                  there are currently 69 new bus services implemented under the BSEP,

              <p>I would not consider peak-period short services as new bus services (to be precise, it is routes)...they just merely follow most of the route of their parent feeder services. Also, note that some supplementary services are just extension of operating hours and not new routes as they were originally introduced by the bus companies themselves before BSEP started.</p>

                  <p>I have researched further.</p>
                  <p>Apparently, supplementary bus services and peak-period-short-services are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> new bus services.</p>
                  <p>Let me correct my statement.</p>
                  <p>There are currently <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">47</span></strong> new bus services launched under the BSEP - 32 by the PTOs, 15 City Direct bus services.</p>
                  <ul>

              <p>Beyond the extension of bus service 49, there are five confirmed new City Direct bus services and there are five confirmed new bus services by the PTOs. (as of 19/11/15)</p>

              <p>IMO, these will be some of the services required. Time period: 2017</p>
              <p>1. Service to cater to Yishun Ave 1 &amp; Yishun st 51 (feeder)</p>
              <p>2. Service to cater to Canberra Estate (this will be a short trunk from Sembawang to Yishun via Canberra Estate - could also be 860 extension)</p>
              <p>3. Connect Yew Tee and BPJ MRT, could extend further to Bukit Batok (177 can be extended and made full day, with 177M operating to MINDEF)</p>
              <p>4. CBP service to Tanah Merah and beyond maybe to Bedok estate</p>
              <p>5. CBP service to Punggol via Tampines </p>
              <p>6. Feeder service to Matilda estate</p>
              <p>7. 386 extension/diversion to cover Waterway HDB at Edgedale Plains end or new feeder to Edgedale Plains end (personally prefer the first)</p>
              <p>8. Connect Buangkok Link HDBs with Buangkok MRT &amp; maybe beyond to Sengkang west town. This is to complement 101 and provide closest MRT connection</p>
              <p>9. Trunk service for Sengkang West town along West Way to connect to AMK or YCK (alternative to current sv 50 that is already crowded)</p>
              <p>10. Feeder service connecting CCK Ave 7 and CCK Grove to CCK MRT (could also connect to BPJ MRT depending on routing)</p>
              <p>11. Possible extension of sv 700 to CCK via Keat Hong</p>
              <p>12. Trunk service to Segar/Senjar apart from 972 (could be diversion/extension of existing service such as 41/171)</p>

              <p>Thanks for posting a quick update on the loading. It is not surprising that loading will be high towards Boon Lay Interchange. Surprise, surprise, why? It just copies route of 243W. This is the same argument of 143M/143/79. 143M can have some buses with very high loading, but then 143 at the back will be empty. 258 loading in this sector cannot be measured in isolation.</p>
              <p>For 258 to be of use, the loading needs to be good between Joon Koon and Pioneer, and Pioneer and st 81. Otherwise it is a failed service. Actually, 258 could have just looped around Soon Lee / Kim Tian estate. Did not need to go to Joo Koon as you pointed out the loading in that sector is pretty low. </p>

              <p>Skip 192's independent section between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Pioneer MRT Station. Skip 258's independent section between Joo Koon Bus Interchange and Upper Jurong Road. The combined bus service ply the entire Upper Jurong Road and then use AYE to Tuas Road, then continue on 192's route towards Tuas.</p>
                  <p>The combined bus service is very likely to at least break even. :)</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree the link to st 81 and pioneer mrt stn is good but just that the freq is too long for such a trunk svc. In fact, taking Svc 243G to switch at that bus stop could still be faster. Of course, not to have some weird guy keep spamming and ranting to LTA/SBS to increase the no of trips for 179A, then it should make travelling more convenient than before.</p>

                                  <p>Well, when I first saw the frequency of bus service 258, I was disappointed. I was expecting it to be like the other Jurong-Industrial bus services, which have frequencies of around 7 minutes during morning peak hours.</p>
                                  <p>Nonetheless, I feel that bus service 258 could still be of good use for bus connection between Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong West Street 61/71/81 if we know the arrival times.</p>
                              <p>The "MyTransport" mobile phone application by the LTA informs us about the arrival times of bus services. Bus Service 258 arrival times are available. We could use that to check what time the bus would arrive and be at the bus stop when the bus is about to come. :)</p>
                                  <p>I am looking forward to see the timetable of bus service 258 on SBS Transit website, so that I could go out at the right time and not have to wait long for the bus to come. :)</p>
                      <p>However, the mobile phone application and website require internet connection. Not everyone has internet connection.</p>
                       <p>It would be good if the bus arrival times for bus service 258 could be shown at the bus pole, like how the arrival times for express bus services are shown, so that more people can have access to the bus arrival times.</p>

                              <p>Thanks for posting a quick update on the loading. It is not
                              surprising that loading will be high towards Boon Lay Interchange.
                              Surprise, surprise, why? It just copies route of 243W. This is the
                              same argument of 143M/143/79. 143M can have some buses with very
                              high loading, but then 143 at the back will be empty. 258 loading
                              in this sector cannot be measured in isolation.</p>
                              <p>For 258 to be of use, the loading needs to be good between Joon
                              Koon and Pioneer, and Pioneer and st 81. Otherwise it is a failed
                              service. Actually, 258 could have just looped around Soon Lee / Kim
                              Tian estate. Did not need to go to Joo Koon as you pointed out the
                              loading in that sector is pretty low. </p>

                              <p>Went out to try bus service 258 to Joo Koon Bus Interchange. Around ten people board at Street 81 and that's about it. Almost everyone alighted at Pioneer MRT Station bus stop.</p>
                              <p>Between Pioneer MRT Station and Joo Koon Bus Interchange, there is absolutely no boarding or alighting. </p>
                              <p>At Joo Koon Bus Interchange, a few people alighted, but I can tell you, they are only there to see the bus interchange.</p>
                              <p>Board another bus 258. Same scenario. No boarding or alighting, until Street 81.</p>
                              <p>Really, I do not think many people know that there is this bus service 258. If there is strong awareness, the loading between Joo Koon Bus Interchange and street 81 would be stronger.</p>
                          <p>There are a lot of people taking bus 182 at Upper Jurong Road. These people will take 258.</p>
                          <p>There would have been a lot of people taking 258 from street 81 to Pioneer MRT Station, but after they know the frequency, I think they don't want already.</p>

              <p>The industrial belt on Upper Jurong will need a bus service more to Pioneer MRT. But now you have 192, 258, 99 all serving Upper Jurong - a bit of an over kill. I agree with your suggestion. There was no need of a 258. 192 could have been diverted via st 75/81/71 to Pioneer MRT. Job would have been done. </p>
              <p>Doesn't seem like a well planned route, but let's see in a month. If there is a sizeable population working at Joo Koon / JIS along st 75/81/71, they might prefer 258 to go directly to Joo Koon and change to 182/254/255/253/257 (I am not sure if these numbers would be high enough to warrant a dedicated service).</p>

                  <p>Well, if after a while bus service 258 still does not collect enough revenue in a day to break even the costs of operations, I feel that it would be wise to merge 258 with 192 (the new one), while re-route 192 to ply AYE towards Tuas Road, before it continues on the original route. The residential area and the industrial area can help the combined bus service collect revenue that can at least break even the costs of operations. :)</p>

              <p>Well, if after a while bus service 258 still does not collect
              enough revenue in a day to break even the costs of operations, I
              feel that it would be wise to merge 258 with 192 (the new one),
              while re-route 192 to ply AYE towards Tuas Road, before it
              continues on the original route. The residential area and the
              industrial area can help the combined bus service collect revenue
              that can at least break even the costs of operations. :)</p>

              <p>While you have suggested merging 192 and 258, I had to take some time figuring what will the route be and it turns out to be something like what is mentioned in the Joo Koon thread...I was wondering if you have read my comment from two weeks ago, but I will show you where it is again.
