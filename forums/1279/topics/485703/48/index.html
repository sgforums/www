              <p>If i remember correctly, the earliest the Edgedale Plains (end) flats will open is Q2/Q3 2016. So there is still a year and half for people to start living there. </p>
              <p>During that time, you never know there might be a connecting road constructed between Edgefield plains and Edgedale plains. I believe in future sv 386 will be extended to cater to Edgedale plain residents as well. </p>

              i think the end of Edgefield &amp; Edgedale Plains will still be a dead end in future. the residents there can only exit to Punggol Drive. This could explain why these 2 road levels are much higher than the service road behind as the authorities dont intend to link them up.

              <p>That's a bit strange. Would have been good if it were linked up. This means, there will be a feeder for each of the roads. 386 for Edgefield via Central, 387 for Edgedale via Punggol Dr and may be 388 for Punggol East via Punggol Central as well. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, yes finally somebody agrees with me on this. I have mentioned the same thing to a certain extent a few months ago but mr busanalyser doubted my words and told me otherwise. (No disrespect to mr busanalyser and no intention to start any quarrels). I was on the opinion that sbs 386 will not be able to go to edgedale plains at that time.</p>
              <p>Till today, I strongly believe that the only exit is Punggol drive. At most, a new bus service will go to edgedale plains end and come out and exit to Punggol east and loop back to interchange vs Punggol central. There will definitely be new bus services from Punggol interchange plying the semi expressway and link to pasir ris and yishun towns which is the objective of semi expressway. </p>
              <p>However, I still hope for miracles that they can link up the 2 roundabouts (edgedale and edgefield plains) on higher roads to the semi expressway. Cheers.</p>

              <p>But lets not be too over-confident about this, as they can always have connections to the semi-expressway... and the fact that the road is higher... there can be a flyover to connect to semi-expressway... this way again edgefield and edgedale might get connected in future.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, ideally and realistic speaking, the roads should be linked. For any town planner point of view, the roads should not be left the way it is now. Maybe not year 2016. Most probably by end of yr 2018 or even 2019, all the linkages should be up. Till then, good luck to all those residents who shall live inside with no cars of their own. They only have Punggol drive to exit out of the places. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Semi-expressway:Yishun side is that the road goes to the two Punggol Islands, then connect to Yishun Ave 8 (parrallel to Yishun Dam, then straight to Simpang Park Connector (means current Yishun Ave 8 is different)) then ends at Admiralty Rd East/Sembawang Rd junction (converted to flyover).

              <p>Again.. this is case of reluctance that ppl want to board the
                  PTO bus... who would not know that 903P will go to WRI.. ofcourse
                  and I sincerely hope ppl have that much common sense.</p>
              <p>I have seen this even on 268P. People just refuse to board the
                  bus. 4-6 pax board at AMK. After 2-3 mins you have sv 76 come, you
                  will see 30-40 pax board the bus. 268P has been in operation for
                  very long time now.</p>

              <p><em>Probably because there is no EDS.</em> But it is more likely because there is no SBST/SMRT livery on the PPSS buses.</p>
              <p>In the part of the statement in italics, it could mean that people won't board a SBST Volvo B10M or Batch 1/2 VO3X or B10BLE CNG..</p>
