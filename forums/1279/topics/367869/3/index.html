              havent tried the latter.. but from experience.. the former takes an average of 1 hr 30 min.. at the airport side, frequency can take a bad hit at times,hindering plans of making it faster through the expressway
               
              I tried and failed to get to and from Tampines fast via the airport due to that reason.

              TP la!
               have to walk to Teluk kurau Rd to take it
              and don't talk about taking  13 or 55 then transfer to it .. it doesn't help in the morning rush
              and worse still don't ask me go to PP or anywhere before the looping point and transfer to it.. it's only gonna add to the travel time
              
              
              Currently, I go to Opp Blk 57 stop. Take a bus to Bedok. Take another bus to Bedok Reservoir. Take 23 to TP. Only this way is fool proof. 15 from Teluk Kurau fails. 69 from bedok fails. (as in getting there in time, given the conditions of traffic and boarding point)
              
              So much to wish 15 should ply as it used to before? And I'm not complaining. Just a wish.

              I tried to make use of the expressway as much as possible and here are the failed routes just for your reading. :D
              
              By airport: 
              
              36 from opp Blk 57 to airport - 20 mins
              27 to Blk 938 Tamp - 10 mins
              15/23 from Blk 141 (just opp) - 5 mins
              
              add in the waiting times and it takes 50 mins.. def fail :lol:
              
              By PIE (Eunos):
              
              To Still Rd - 5 mins
              969 from Still Rd to Kallang Basin - 12 mins
              Crossing opposite + waiting time  - 9 mins
              23 from Aft Infineon to Opp TP - 10 mins
              
              roughly takes 35 mins.. rather take 15 and save all this hassle :lol2:

              you can't trust the airport buses in frequency. depending on the waiting times for the bus, your journey can be very short or longer than usual.

              <p>I tried to make use of the expressway as much as possible and
              here are the failed routes just for your reading. <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>
              <p>By airport:</p>
              <p>36 from opp Blk 57 to airport – 20 mins<br> 27 to Blk 938 Tamp – 10 mins<br> 15/23 from Blk 141 (just opp) – 5 mins</p>
              <p>add in the waiting times and it takes 50 mins.. def fail
              <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
              <p>By <span>PIE</span> (Eunos):</p>
              <p>To Still Rd – 5 mins<br> 969 from Still Rd to Kallang Basin – 12 mins<br> Crossing opposite + waiting time – 9 mins<br> 23 from Aft Infineon to Opp TP – 10 mins</p>
              <p>roughly takes 35 mins.. rather take 15 and save all this hassle
              :lol2:</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>might as well take 15 and sleep all the way.. lol..</p>
              <p>For Tampines IMO 15 and 31 takes around the same time. If Eunos area is jammed too much then 31 is better..</p>
              <p>To Harbourfront and anywhere along the south-western coastal line its good to take 31/16 to Old Airport transfer to 10/30. 10 or 30 makes no diff during off peak cos the waiting time for 30 can kill you. Alternatively 196 to shenton way xfer 10/97/57/131 to harbourfront</p>
              <p>Anywhere mid-west (bnv clementi and probably jurong east) take 48 to <br>i) Holland Rd xfer 7/106/165 for Clementi bound (xfer 52/99/105 to go jurong east)<br>ii) Holland Ave xfer 106 to go SP<br>iii) Farrer rd xfer 93/153/855/961 for anywhere along the Queensway corridor. Bt merah corridor just take 196.</p>
              <p>Northern areas like Serangoon Paya Lebar Aljunied Macpherson Estate and Ang Mo Kio just take 43/76/135. Toa Payoh take 966</p>
              <p>Far North East and North has been mentioned liao...</p>

              It is midway between Tampines and Bedok
              
              Going to Tamp then TP is a waste of time.. Rather go by Bedok.. But don't take 69..The jam built up from SAFRA all the way to TP can kill.. :lol: Once I was stuck in it for almost 20 mins (just the jam!) 
              
              I thought 10 to Harboufront was fast enough :roll: (about 50 minutes in total or is the route u mentioned even faster?)
              I used to take a bus (135/197/43/76)  to Tg Katong Rd then transfer to it.

              MRT is proposed to be completed in 2020. The downside of it is that they may cut down on bus services (which I hope not)
              
              Remember 76 and 135 closely replicate each other? They may be affected when MRT comes..
