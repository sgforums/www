              I see quite a number of bus fans from Marine Terrace
              who are upset with very little services and some we have to walk to/from Marine Parade Rd
              
              In this thread, we will discuss how to get around to/fro MT as well as our wishlist for MT

              well yea u can use these svcs but there are limitations..
              
              most of the time u have to walk to Marine Parade Rd (5 min) and even to Teluk Kurau Rd (10 min) to take some buses..
              
              I think MT residents will agree with me..

              <p>Agree with jay and pitot.</p>
              <p>Marine Parade Road is not far from Marine Parade Terrace. But I blame it more to the poor road planning within Marine Parade estate. You should be lucky that Marine Parade has so many services that goes almost everywhere in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Look at places like Sembawang and Bukit Panjang. The bus services there are far much worst than your area.</p>

              need more buses that use expressway
              as far as I know, Tampines is the best place to get to almost everywhere quickly :D
                              
              Airport - :lol:
                              
              Yishun - 30 mins 969
                              
              Woodlands - 168 takes 45 mins .. go to airport police stn, opp take 858 to Seletar camp and transfer to 168 from there
              think can save some time. not sure. but 168 wastes a lot time before getting on to the expressway
                              
               Sim Lim/ Serangoon Rd - 23  - 10 mins :D
                              
              what else :roll:
                              
                need Yishun bound bus, as well as fast bus to Tamp.. 31 takes 45 mins. :x

              <p>You can take 15 to Tampines Central, if you want faster. Else take a cab.</p>
              <p>There is 853 to Yishun during weekends only.</p>
              <p>But you can try proposing to SBST to extend 135 to Yishun as full weekdays and weekends services. It can also give Yishun residents a better link to many other places. But due to some stupid regulations, I will doubt so.</p>

              take 135 to yishun? (assuming your suggestion to extend it there)
              
              I am talking in the likes of SMRT's buses that use expressway eg. 966 to WDL from marine parade :ty: SMRT its such a wonderful service that makes transpt to WDL much easier..started late 2000' i think

              oh.. u rmb approx how long it takes?
                      
               I thought abt using this thread to share the routes I take to and fro MT to benefit the rest..
                      
               To go to Yishun by bus as fast as possible, I used to:
                      
                * take 36 to airport. (20 min)
                * Alight at  airport police stn
                * Use underpass to go opp
                * Take 858 - only 30 mins from there to Yishun :D
                      
              Incl waiting time, it can range from 1 hr to 1 h 30 mins at times
                  
              btw, jay, i assume ur also staying in MP? :roll:

              Yea I agree with the part on poor road planning within MP
              
              The main reason why 13, 16 and 196 do not ply MT while returning towards the east, is that there is no way they can make their way out to Marine Parade Road, since the exit to the major road is one-way, west bound. Hence, they exit via Marine Cres, bypassing Marine Ter altogether to proceed to MP Rd.
              
              If not for that, residents could simply alight at Blk 53 stop.

              <p>take 135 to yishun? (assuming your suggestion to extend it there)</p>
              <p>I am talking in the likes of <span>SMRT</span>’s buses that use expressway eg. 966 to <span>WDL</span> from marine parade :ty: <span>SMRT</span> its such a wonderful service that makes transpt to <span>WDL</span> much easier..started late 2000’ i think</p>
              <p>Hope another <span>SMRT</span> variant to Yishun comes.. I will try and post in the route suggestions thread <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>Perhaps you’re talking about the quota of <span>SMRT</span>/SBST route ownership?</p>

              <p><br>Do you know the real rationale behind why 966 is an express route rather than a normal trunk service??? Marine Parade is nearer to the city, so there is no need for so much express routes to exist. And yes, that stupid territory ruling.</p>
              <p>Moreover there are service 36 and 48 that goes ECP and a City Shopper service if I'm not wrong. But I quite unhappy that they withdrew Express 503 in the early 2000s.</p>
              <p>And not to forget, 168 and 161 to Woodlands, from Bedok/Tampines and Hougang/Sengkang respectively. Service 5, 59 are also partial express bus services, just that they don't serve your area.</p>
              <p>And it is TIBS (Trans Island Bus Service) that introduce 966, not SMRTB. Please get your facts right.</p>
              <p>And since there is a straight bus to Woodlands, you can take a bus to Yishun from here. If SMRTB really bothered to introduce a bus service to the southeast, they would have make 853 a full day service long ago. Since the day they took over TIBS, less than 5 basic services was introduced in SMRTB to improve links as compared to SBST's 10, at least.</p>
              <p>You should be very lucky that there are new services being introduced in Marine Parade, service 43 and 48. In my place, served by SMRTB area, no new bus services since TIBS has gone, service standards dropped drastically, dirty buses, poor maintenance, poor customer services and irregular frequencies from SMRTB. Those who never lived in SMRTB served areas will never know the agony and frustrations they had to face for their daily bus commuting. So don't think that SMRTB is that good.</p>
              <p>Be glad of your bus services links now in your area, because when the MRT is up in the area, many of these links might be gone and your only choice might only be the crowded MRT train, everyday.</p>

              <p><br>Not just Yishun, look at Bukit Panjang, some areas have no feeder bus at all. You have to walk a few blocks to the LRT station. WALK. Even those with a feeder bus service, mind you, the frequency of the feeder bus as even worse than 966 and 966 is already one of the few express services that has the worst frequencies.</p>
              <p>Come to Sembawang, many parts are not served well by buses, like those living in BLKs 31plus, BLKs 466 to 469, they have to walk a few blocks distance before they can reach a bus stop. And Sembawang interchange has the least trunk bus services, 4 only (excluding 981) and 2 passing by services within the town.</p>
              <p>You should be glad already for the number of bus services you have in MP, given MP is such a small housing estate, as compared to Bedok nearby.</p>

              Ok, peace guys. Dont get too tensed :)
              
              and about TIBS introducing 966 and not by SMRT, I don't understand your anger. SMRT took over TIBS, So i just wrote SMRT. :?
              
              Perhaps you have gripes of poor service by SMRT compared to TIBS :roll: :?
              
              I agree and am glad that there are some services *esp new ones* that make travelling much easier.. but a place like MP which has rapidly developed along the years really lacks some links

              I was shocked to travel to Yishun from Tamp and Changi Airport in just 30 mins. While Marine Parade, which is not as far, takes about 1 h 30 min average by bus to travel to Yishun.
              
              I understand the TPE link makes Tampines easier to get to Yishun.. Just hoping they can make use of PIE from Eunos and link MP to Yishun..
              
              966 to WDL already takes close to an hr.. from there to yishun by bus takes an ave of 30 mins.. I think I should try making transfer en route 966 at Toa Payoh as jay said..
