Since I live in the west, I find it more convenient to take the train to Kranji, then take 170 or CW1 all the way to Larkin.. Tickets cost RM 25 there (it used to cost just a bit above RM 21 early this year though!!!), and you get more choices of bus companies. I usually go for Transnasional, because they are the most easily available. While waiting you can always buy papers and / or Ramly burgers. Total, this would be less than S$ 15.<br><br>On the way back though, I'm a bit more liberal with the destination. Will take a bus to JB or Singapore depending on whether I want to reach home faster or if I wanna grab some food, magazines or newspapers at Larkin.</div>

Since I live in the west, I find it more convenient to take the train to Kranji, then take 170 or CW1 all the way to Larkin.. Tickets cost RM 25 there (it used to cost just a bit above RM 21 early this year though!!!), and you get more choices of bus companies. I usually go for Transnasional, because they are the most easily available. While waiting you can always buy papers and / or Ramly burgers. Total, this would be less than S$ 15.<br><br>On the way back though, I'm a bit more liberal with the destination. Will take a bus to JB or Singapore depending on whether I want to reach home faster or if I wanna grab some food, magazines or newspapers at Larkin.</div></blockquote>I mean, on your return trip, you are not afraid of being dumped in JB by the dishonest ticket agents in KL?</div>
