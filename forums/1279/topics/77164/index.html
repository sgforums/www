Still trying to spot for more, but all boxes.<br><br>Yes. The frequency before the bendy is 10mins. Boxes still remain at 7mins per bus. TIBS is notorious for doubling the frequency b4 a bendy arrives. This happended when 806 only have one bendy in the past.<br><br>It still remains to be seen wad would become of svc 806, and im still waiting for TIBS to reply to my query.
