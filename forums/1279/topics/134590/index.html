            <div class='col-md body'>Boarded NR7 at Geylang Rd bus stop (outside Blk 14 Food Ctr) to Fullerton Rd (outside Fullerton Hotel). Got off about 1.20 am. Had paid my fare in cash as there was not enough cash in my ez-link card (left 98c). Asked the BC whether the bus stops outside Fullerton Hotel, BC said yes. Afterwards, I had sat near to the boarding doors of the bus. When I had wanted to get off, my ez-link card (which was placed in my left shirt pocket) had accidentally tapped on the card reader. Informed the BC to reset the accidental fare by my card, he still can tell me off as to why I had stood so near to the reader. BC did not even bother to reset the fare paid by my ez-link card at all. Even said that he don't know how to do it. He even had asked me to tap on the reader again to confirm again, and from the there it showed that it had already been deducted. Reasoned with him that it seemed illogical as I had paid total $6 just for a ride on NR7 ($3 cash and $3 ez-link card), and he said it was just too bad.<br><br>Makes me wonder for a moment. Are all BCs actually trained to handle this type of situation. If they can reset the fares paid by the passengers when the bus breaks down, then I do not understand why they can't do the same for a passenger who has accidentally tapped unknowingly on the reader. Seems this experience has made me think differently about SMRT BCs.<br><br>Now, I have to make my way down to the TransitLink office to ask for a refund of my $3!!! And already submitted a complaint to SMRT liao.</div>
