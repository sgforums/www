              <p>they'll let u off most of the time if you're a first timer and your reason is valid enough. personally i think ur reason can lah, bcuz u saw another car do so and ur quite near to the junction whr u hv to turn what. sometimes all these inspectors damn knn one, even thuogh u nv break the rules, they take a picture of u...esp at places close to junctions where the line from solid will become dotted...so if u accidentally cross whr the solid part is even when the dotted is so near u, they take a picture.</p>
              <p>my dad ever got fined by one of these white men you were talking about. he parked at marina costal rd terminal...a long distance behind the bus bay. but the SBST inspector took a picture of his car.</p>
              <p>LTA sent him a letter...he appealed stating that he parked there because EVERYONE else did so. also he was a long distance away from the bus bay. then he also stated that he was with his family (i.e. us), and that we needed the toilet during the family outing thr, so he parked there temporarily to use the toilet.</p>

              do so, cos 1) i was looking for my way along that road. 2) i left
              the damage was already done. i even saw a car in front of me wanted
              to keep left and swiftly turn back right. now i know the reason
              why.</p>
              <p>will they review each case case by case? i feel it's pretty
              unfair if i got a fine. will appeal if i got it. damn sian diao.

              <p>I drove into a bus lane 2 month ago and the same thing happen to me.....</p>
              <p>but till now, still no news. So i ask ard and it turn out that some of my mate dun get the summon letter. I think it depend on a few thing here. If the picture cant tell ur car plate clearly, or that it cant establish that you are in the worng, they might just forgo the summon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So let just wait and see if u ever get that summon.</p>

              <p>i drove into a bus lane today, i think. at commonwealth ave towards queensway. then like 3 seconds later, i saw a man in white with a tripod and camera.</p>

              <p>but it's not like i was driving in the bus lane all the way. i only drove in like 200m and i saw him. i'm sure he would have seen that in his camera. i even saw a car in front of me in tha lane already. he had his left signal on. i guess he saw the man in white and turned on the signal to show he wanted to turn left. i did not do so, cos 1) i was looking for my way along that road. 2) i left the damage was already done. i even saw a car in front of me wanted to keep left and swiftly turn back right. now i know the reason why.</p>
