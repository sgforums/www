              <p>Are the gas tanks on the B10BLEs nearing expiry? I know some of the Transperth O405NH CNG buses gas tanks recently expired. The OC500LE gas tanks have 20 years on them as they were built using updated technology. </p>

              <p>At this rate, trying to track each minor or major design change by batch alone simply makes no sense anymore. The nomenclature has to evolve with MAN/GML/STK too:</p>

              <li>SMB138Y - <strong>MAN Lion's City SD (Euro V), MCV eVolution </strong><em>&gt; rebodied to</em><strong> Gemilang Mark I</strong><br></li>

              <li>SG1751Y onwards - <strong>MAN Lion's City SD (Euro VI), Gemilang Mark III</strong></li>

              <li>SG5830B to SG5920A - <strong>MAN Lion's City DD (Euro V), Gemilang Mark III</strong><br></li>

              <ul>

              <p>Then divide each Mark type by batches separately.</p>
              <p>The number increases by one for each Windows 10 style update to their 
              bodywork (Gemilang Mark V, Gemilang Mark VI, ...Gemilang Mark IX, Gemilang Mark X, etc.). Windows 10 style updates should be expected as the norm, not the exception. Hence we need to allow this nomenclature to scale until at least 2025.</p>
              <p>There is only that many times you can call the design a facelift. You can say the same for ADL Enviro500 MMC too (their "facelift MMC" would similarly be Enviro500 MMC Mk II).</p>
              <p>Yes, the Lion's City brand is applied retrospectively. But the marketing material and technical evidence indicates this is the manufacturer/distributor's intention and this should keep the certain bus lobbyists very happy for decades to come. And there appears to be no strict adherance to the traditional European requirements as well when it comes to naming a Lion's City product, at least if it's not integral anyway.</p>
              <p>As for overseas units (such as Hong Kong and Sydney), you can call them MAN Lion's City if you like. Apply duck test (if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, it's a duck). The overseas distributors doesn't seem to mind anyway.</p>
              <p>At this point it is a matter of when, not if, new articulated buses from MAN 
              and Gemilang shows up in the future. We can then call them <em>MAN Lion's City GL (Euro VI), Gemilang Mark

              <p>Have read. Two questions:</p>
              <p>1) Was the different nomenclature for the latest design <em>sans</em> foglights (Mark III for SDs, Mark IV for DDs) intentional? I personally thought it would have made more sense to harmonise the numbering across bus types as much as possible, since we know SG1751Y and SG5921A have the same frontal design.</p>
              <p>2) How can you be so certain of new articulated buses coming?</p>

              The "hair" is meant to hide the capacitors on the European A37 Hybrids. SMRT loved the looks, so they requested for it. Yes, pretty dumb if you ask me.

              <p>Yeah I suppose the "hair" also differentiated SMRT's main SD from that of SBST's (mercs) for brand identity purposes.  But now since everything is owned by Green Bus Co, there is even less purpose for the "hair" now.</p>

              <p>Have read. Two questions:</p>
              <p>1) Was the different nomenclature for the latest design
              <em>sans</em> foglights (Mark III for SDs, Mark IV for DDs)
              intentional? I personally thought it would have made more sense to
              harmonise the numbering across bus types as much as possible, since
              we know SG1751Y and SG5921A have the same frontal design.</p>
              <p>2) How can you be so certain of new articulated buses
              coming?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1. Yes.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Because the rear design has also changed. SD and DD are substantially different.<br></li>
              <li>For Gemilang Mark IV, there is also a reversion of design for the A95's rear to SG5999Z's design. <br></li>
              <li>Skipping the numbering, say for future A24s, will cause confusion. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>2. The bus lobbyists got everything they wanted. LTA capitulated too easily IMO. Even colour EDS. Heck, they are the only effective "publisher" of information in town and get to control the narrative. I will be very surprised if the bus lobbyists do not try to push the boundaries further.</p>

              <p>Bus lobbyists, I know you are reading this elsewhere. Have fun paying your GST increase for your shiny new full-feature PIS and EDS...if it's even going to be put into good use (history shows it has not...whatever happened to the C751As and C751Bs).</p>
              <p>Two percentage GST increase yields S$3 billion to S$3.6 billion a year. That is not enough to even cover the annual $4 billion spent annually (2015 figures) on public transport subsidies and infrastructure.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p><em>"One major contributing factor is the large increase in network 
                      capacity as we opened new lines and added more buses and trains."</em></p>
              <p><em>"This
                       huge cost increase has been borne by the Government," explained Mr 
                      Khaw. "Against such rising cost, fares have gone down by 2 per cent over
                       the same period."</em></p>
              <p><em>"Every dollar spent on transport is a dollar less for other expenditure –
                       like schools, healthcare and security," noted Mr Khaw, who is also the 
                      Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure.</em></p>

              <p>Personally, though, for the Citaro issue I would only put half the blame on lobbyists. It is one thing to take in positive feedback on the Citaro and order a batch of units, and it is another thing to keep ordering them when better alternatives have emerged rendering the Citaro no longer the top choice. The former can be blamed on lobbyists, although I am not sure it is entirely a bad thing worthy of blame. The latter, is it really due to lobbyists petitioning LTA to keep on buying Citaros?</p>

                      You guys may have seen the same SOP for manual ramp follows for auto ramp, the driver still has to go to the rear despite the ability to deploy the ramp from console.</p>

              <p>Our EDS is capable of displaying Chinese characters, during CNY some PTO displayed Chinese greetings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The LCD panels are for next stops display, it will also show mrt stations at the bus stop. It is something  that came out10-20 years ago in western countries. But now when everyone is using mobile phones to check, our cavemen LTA decided to copy the concept.</p>

              <p>Refer to my post above. If you have seen the tender specs, the LCD screens are to show next stops, at least 3 next stops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be plug and play, using VDV300/301 protocol. But whether LTA has procure the protocol is another thing. Full system is expected to work by this year or next year. As for now, it will be half fked.</p>
