              <p>Result? Sudden spike in passengers waiting at BNL + the problem
              at platform escalator. Train arriving though escalator still w/

              <p>actually the schedules of employee buses can be quite tight. drivers also tend to want to clear their trips faster since they can have more break time.</p>

              <p>BTW, the reason for it is:</p>
              <p>1: Automatic tranmission ones generally consumes more fuel due to unnecessary / inefficient mechanism in the gearing</p>
              <p>2: Old vehicles. Last time already very rare to see one such.</p>
              <p>3: Afterall, all vocational license requires Class 3 and not 3A before you can even think of it. Yes, including intentions to drive an automatic transmission Taxis. It can be found on SPF / TP website.</p>
              <p>Oh well, a bonus tip:</p>
              <p>No, whether is it automatic or manual transmission, it wont matter for speeding issues so long as the limiter is installed and in working condition. I saw service 985, can chiong like 65km/h which is damn shiok on PIE.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ. Try taking NR services. I'm not sure if the driver was a malaysian or a local, but he was well running above 70km/h on PIE/BKE on NR3 and drives on corners at HIGH SPEED. I can assure you guys he aint a chinese national.</p>
              <p><br>Instead, i enjoy taking buses driven by most chinese nationals. Altho they drive fast, they are confident but not too over. A well known racer once said "its not always trusting your own skills when it comes to racing(in this case its driving), sometimes you have to trust the vehicle your having your hands on."</p>

              <p>No wonder I had seen buses travelling at around 65km/h in expressway. (The speedometer shows almost hitting 70km/h but as a passenger view, it might be an error and hence I factored it to 65kph)</p>

              <p><span>The 59 yr old driver is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporean Chinese driver</span>. The
              bus he drove was "WT 13", which his job is to pickup other SMRT
              drivers to the bus depot. What shocking is that after he brought
              back the damaged bus to the bus depot, he told the controllers
              that, he bang a tree and requested a bus switch, as he still have
              another 2nd wave to pick up the SMRT drivers.<br> <br> And another unconfirmed news is that, my dad says there's 2
              casualties died in this accident. Apparently my daddy heard about
