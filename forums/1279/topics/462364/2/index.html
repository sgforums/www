              <p>This is my first post here but I've been in the community for more than 2 years. It might be my only post, because I don't really bother coming here where flamewars are everywhere. It's a simple waste of my time.</p>
              <p>But I'd like to say that disliking Mark or liking him that's your own personal opinion. If you hate mark due to ABC reason or like him due to XYZ reason, I think it should be respected, whether or not you share the same opinion. We can't expect everyone to have the same way of thinking.</p>
              <p>That said, if becomes wrong when you express your opinions up online. Hating Mark due to ABC reason is fine, but if you post it on SGF saying (or expressing that thought) that I hate Mark due to ABC reason, and everyone else is wrong, or vice versa, I believe that's unneeded. A person's like or dislike towards someone should be his own personal opinion and should not be influenced by others.</p>
              <p>Thus I believe it's best if everyone stops the provocation here... Meaning there's no need to flame Mark/BIS in every post you make, and even if that happens (or the other way round) there's no need to respond. If you truly think you're correct, then so be it. There's no need to force an opinion upon others.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents</p>

              <p>This is my first post here but I've been in the community for
              more than 2 years. It might be my only post, because I don't really
              bother coming here where flamewars are everywhere. It's a simple
              waste of my time.</p>
              <p>But I'd like to say that disliking Mark or liking him that's
              your own personal opinion. If you hate mark due to ABC reason or
              like him due to XYZ reason, I think it should be respected, whether
              or not you share the same opinion. We can't expect everyone to have
              the same way of thinking.</p>
              <p>That said, if becomes wrong when you express your opinions up
              online. Hating Mark due to ABC reason is fine, but if you post it
              on SGF saying (or expressing that thought) that I hate Mark due to
              ABC reason, and everyone else is wrong, or vice versa, I believe
              that's unneeded. A person's like or dislike towards someone should
              be his own personal opinion and should not be influenced by
              others.</p>
              <p>Thus I believe it's best if everyone stops the provocation
              here... Meaning there's no need to flame Mark/BIS in every post you
              make, and even if that happens (or the other way round) there's no
              need to respond. If you truly think you're correct, then so be it.
              There's no need to force an opinion upon others.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents</p>

              <p>as i said, mostly depends on SL attitude. if never report, will never be fixed. i know of an SL who reports everything and even a gearbox problem before she started her first trip and demanded a change in the bus too.</p>
