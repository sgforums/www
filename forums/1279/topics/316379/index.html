              <p>theres no place for them to illeviate their anger unfortunately. their superiors and road users are the biggest culprits of the stress. the company doesnt protect the interests or anything of their drivers. driver die, die lor. who cares. jus get new driver can liao.</p>

              <p>That is what I intended initially, to get the print-out (evidence) of the transaction.</p>
              <p>But I was told by MRT staff that they no longer do that service. They can only help me to check the transactions and provide me details but no print-out.</p>
              <p>I also do thought of complaining, however, I know that not all complaints will be heard/attended. That's why so many forumers complained online.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Still traumatised by this incident, I just wanted to get this off my chest and inform everyone about it. Not knowing where to post my letter or would it be rejected by publications, I've decided to post here...</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Having read articles on bus cheats’ impact on bus company with great interest. But I would like to bring to everyone's attention on another viewpoint on this; while it is important to instil compliance of correct fare payment, it is also important for bus drivers to do their job with courtesy and professionalism.</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Mid April, after alighting a bus at night (a few metres away from the bus stop), I spotted a figure stepped out of the entrance of the bus, yelling and waving at me, enraged.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">It was the bus driver.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">From his loudly accented expression, I could make out that he was commanding me to go back to him as he alleged I did not scan my ezlink card. I distinctively knew I had scanned my card both at times of boarding and only when alighting, hence there is no reason for me to be treated like that. He was not in the right mindset for a civilised discourse. I would be glad to clarify if he had make the effort to come up to me and enquire politely, since he was already out of the bus.</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">The next day, I checked with a polite MRT personnel and re-affirmed that my card is in working condition and the bus transaction yesterday night was well-recorded (and paid with the correct fare of $1.39).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Understand that being a bus driver is stressful, there is no reason to displace the anger on passengers. This might be another isolated incident, bus drivers certainly need to improve on their way of following up with passengers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Bus driver's harsh way of handling the situation may be the reason why so many passengers are enraged to land a punch on their faces. However, I urge all of you to just walk away and ignore - would be the best method and then follow up later the next day with the authority. This may just prevent alot of abuses which land innocent people into imprisonment.</span></p>

              <p>Well what to do? In case some of you do not even realise that most SBS bus drivers hired in Singapore are not Singaporeans, they are foreign workers. For years, SBS has been hiring half of the workers from Malaysia, as they are much cheaper and willing to take up the lower income job. And very soon, you will see more foreign workers continue to come from 3rd world country like China(SBS is now recruiting from that country). I perceive the situation will get worst because these china men won't have a clue how to communicate with the locals and foreigners since they only know how to speak Mandarin.  The only Singaporean drivers you can find are the lower educated Ah Pei (old men) who do not mind the "unglamourous" job..(sigh)</p>
              <p>Therefore either we learn to put up with it, or complain to SBS (through ST forum) that they should hire better social manner foreign workers or increase the pay to attract more educated Singaporeans to join in.</p>
