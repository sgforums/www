              <p>Common sense tells us the best way to solve this labour crunch with minimal disruptions to commuters is to have SBST take over one or two routes from SMRTB.</p>

              <p>SBST has a ready pool of buses and drivers (30/45) familiar with their buses. why wasting one week time and resources training SBST drivers driving SMRTB. It makes no sense to me.</p>
              <p>If due to cost issue, let the bloody SMRTB pays for it since it is their mistake in the first place. Never recruit enough drivers for contigency because of cost savings.</p>

              <p>But wouldn't the SBST PRC start a strike when they take over the route? I mean it's like more drivers would be required to drive those route? Means that some gotta work longer also. :o</p>

              <p>The one week training for route,equipment was from ComfortDelgo
              spokesperson appeared in Dec 2 edition of TNP.<br> <br> Based on historical territory segregation by transport authorities,
              to minimise customer confusion on the sudden deployment of SBST
              buses on SMRT routes, i do not think any SBST buses will run on
              SMRT routes during this interim period.<br> <br> The authorities already have a headache last week, they do not want
              another incident where local commuters making noise and shock from
              another fiasco.<br> <br> SMRT OCC will know that their buses are deployed on time, kept to
              schedule with their own buses on the road rather than that of
              SBST.<br> <br> I gather the redeployed SBST BCs are SG/PRs rather than from
              PRC.<br> <br> The PTOs have no say in this, transport authorities are the one
              managing this, so do not think SBST is kind to lend BCs to
              SMRT.<br> <br> It is School Holiday schedule for most if not all services, so BCs
              on scheduled OFF/LEAVE should still be able to go</p>
