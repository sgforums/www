              <p>But the sad irony is that the more I see the data, the more I can see now why the govt does such things.</p>
              <p>If you want a less risky growth, if you want better short-term prospect, which also ironically improves the long-term if done right, then what the govt is doing: positioning ourselves as a hub for everything, makes the most sense.</p>
              <p>But yeah, maybe I am also starting to fail to think out of the box, but I am now poring over the same data and reaching similar conclusions.</p>
              <p>Dont forget too, hindsight is 20/20.....and our multi-million scholars are also only human.</p>
              <p>And what happens around the world we never know too.</p>
              <p>But from the trends, it seems that the decoupling of operations of MNCs is in fact accelerating.</p>
              <p>SG govt has clearly caught on to that and has been actively AND aggressively pursuing open trade flows.</p>

              <p>I think it is time to start off with one or two areas slowly transferring from SMRTB to SBST. Maybe start with Yishun or Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>It has shown that SMRTB do not have the capability and capacity to run public bus routes in the long term. Should give 2 to 3 areas back to SBST to run. Probably they will have enough resources to run the bus services of other areas properly. Should SMRTB to scale down by about 40%, probably it is still justifiable for SMRTB to operate bendy buses on just feeder services only.</p>

              also ask me for what?Cut cost?Yea from Michelin to Gajah tunggal a
              mix of Bridgestone back to gt.The depots itself is the root of many
              problems.Amdep more than half of the fleets onp at
              Sembawang/Yishun/Lor 1 which ardy cause more time consume and
              fatigue for their SLs..I did bring up this matter eons ago but till
              now still unchanged.Better to lease the empty land infront of Amdep
              depot so at least 60-70 buses can park there thus no need to park
              at Sembawang and Lor 1 and Yishun only onp for feeders and
              Intratown svc beside 857/860.</p>
