              <p>SMRT's practices have been wanting since the last incident in dec, yet they have yet to awaken from the slumber.<br><br>Sg's problem of foreign workers having adequate, decent housing have yet to be solved, just head around town at night when the nationalities of foreigners congregate, you hear lots of cases of exploitation of foreign workers. Some of them have been jobless for a long while waiting compensation, so if MOM is doing a decent job and is quite to persecute the wrong doers, it would not be such a sorrowful tale for these helpless folks,<br><br>Dun believe, check with TWC2 folks...<br><br>Every country has their own National Interests to look at, just look at the most recent voting in the UN for the voting of a Palestine state, SG abstained from voting coz if it voted for it, it will piss of the US[major supporter of Israel] and Israel, if SG voted against it, it will piss of Muslim countries and the Arab world. <br><br>So if SG government misstep in this labour issue, the Chinese will come down hard on SG. The Chinese likes "FACE" and they do not like to be humiliated, the Japanese are smarting from it after they nationalised the Senkakus late October.</p>

              <p>The root of our woes is really that SG is too small to escape

              <p>If you not cheaper, better, faster, more obedient, who will
              invest in us?</p>
              <p>We grew from investment, we have to continue growing if we are
              to keep these investments in.</p>
              <p>One way to reduce reliance has been to use public money to try
              for a dynamic substituting strategy, but it produced mixed results
              with ST co., CSM, Keppel etc etc.</p>

              <p>Entrepreneurial cannot be taught in schools by i see local unis teaching it as a module which i find it amusing...<br>When i look at SG's SMEs, there are no lack of entrepreneurs from Mr Quek of BreadTalk, Kenny Yap[Qianhu], Gain city's boss and many others pioneers before them.<br>they did not take any course, they have the instinct, foresight and guts, these CANNOT be taught in an aircon classroom...<br>Classroom taught entrepreneurs are the same cookie shape and CANNOT think out of the box...<br>just look at the head honchos who took scholarships and heading stat boards, GLCs now, look at the companies and see if they are doing well?!</p>
