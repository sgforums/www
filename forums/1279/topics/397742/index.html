              <p>You know i think (well i cant really remember) there're several occasions where i board buses and witness people fight in the buses LOL. When i say fight i mean argue until very loud that kind.</p>
              <p>I remember got one time when i was sec 4 i think, i board 969 bus going home, there were these 2 malay aunties i think, couldnt remember that clearly as it happened quite long ago.</p>
              <p>I think at first both of them were sitting side by side each other in those "2 seats" seats, then for awhile, cos the bus ride quite long also, after some time one of the auntie stand and move to the most front seat to sit, the seat just behind the bus driver.</p>
              <p>As the auntie standing they just started to argue, even after she went on to sit behind the driver they still argue, and it's like they can argue forever man. I think they speaking in malay so I dont know what they arguing about also.</p>
              <p>Then they just get louder and louder, and I was sitting watching, not only me watching of course. And it's quite funny as you watch both of them. Luckily i never laugh out. Then those in the bus all looking at them also. (now think of it, still find it funny, lol no offence or anything)</p>
              <p>And they really argue for a REALLY long time and it's quite NOISY also lah, the bus driver then ask them to stop arguing cos it's really noisy in the bus, then they blame each other, like "she started first" etc thingy, then ok they stopped, like finally.</p>
              <p>After a few minutes only they started to argue again, LOL. Then the noise came back and it goes on....</p>
              <p>Then again the bus driver said the things he should say lah, like if they dont stop he will report them or something i not sure.</p>
              <p>So the arguing finally stopped cos the auntie sitting behind the driver got off the bus, leaving the other auntie alone.</p>
              <p>It's like abit weird.... did they know each other or what, lol.</p>
              <p>Oh and also there's once when i was sec 4 also, i board the 969 bus and sat down beside one malay lady with groceries etc, after awhile she just started talking to me! I didnt know her of course, then she started talking to me about american idol, she was talking about adam lambert i think, anyway i didnt watch american idol. Then she just started to chat like we're friends. Then i think i just dont care her? Or did i answer some of her questions i cant remember... it's just weird lah!</p>
              <p>She also told me about her son, and also one thing. She told me that this morning(when i was sec 4) when she board 969 there's one lady got flu or something then she fainted, then dont know talk about H1N1, omg that time I should have change seat....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You all can share all the events that you saw that happened on the buses when you were in it, like fights, arguments etc.</p>

              <p>ohya suddenly rmb one, i was in secondary school years back, i was in a dizzy mode, i think iwas sick or something. after school i board bus home. while i was queuing there's this old guy behind me i think, looked kind of scary and drunk or something. then the bus came and i board the bus, he came and sat beside me !</p>
              <p>i wanted to change seat after a bus-stop passed while driver driving but idk why i just never get up and change seat. and i was really dizzy. the old guy really looks scary and something wrong with him, i forget did he sit closer or what ( i was the one sitting inside), anyway i think not that obvious. then after a few stops a lady behind us shouted at the weird old man "hey what are you doing" i think and he got down the bus as the bus stopped at the bus-stop. then the lady asked me if i was okay and  told me to be careful with these people, lol.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I remember taking 1977B on 113 the last day of it being a full Volvo fleet, 27th Feb 2010. When it reached Kovan Hub, several ppl boarded, a girl and her father, and a man. The girl was seated and apparently eating something while the man stood beside her. Apparently there was some staring incident and an argument broke out. It started and stopped a few times. Thankfully there werent any fists thrown. Anyway there was another guy on the bus who helped to cool things down.</p></div>

              <p>I remember i was on a SC on Sv 51. Along Changi Road, around 730pm. BC drove the bus off without closing the rear exit. Until the next stop then he close. After a few minutes at a random bus stop, he opened the front door to allow people to board. He also switched off the lights in the bus.</p>
