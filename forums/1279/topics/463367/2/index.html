              <p><br> It makes sense because it is not profitable at all and viable for
              the company to continue holding on the losses forever, and most of
              all, its core business is rail, not buses. Buses should be operated
              by companies that can manage bus services better and has the better
              expertise to manage, like SBST or even KMB. Hogging it and continue
              to mismanage it will not only do more harm to the commuters but the
              company itself as well.</p>
              <p>SMRT should refocus all its resources on its rail business if
              there is a lot to be improved in this segment rather than wasting
              the money and resources on money losing segments. It doesn't give
              SMRT a better ground in the long run if they continue running
              unprofitable and unmanagable segments. The notion of SMRT being a
              multimodal transport operator failed and this model do not work
              well with SMRT way of managing its operations.</p>
              <p>Just like any business in the corporate world, companies tend to
              sell off their money losing divisions to others and refocus
              themselves in their core and established segments instead. This is
              how companies, especially those with many problems, survived and
              emerged themselves as better players in their core business.</p>
              <p>That's why if Mr Desmond Quek thinks of selling the
              unprofitable bus business from SMRT, I will support his decision as
              it is more promising for SMRT in the long run. It will be even
              better than one company controls buses and light rail, for SBST,
              and one for heavy rail only. for SMRT.</p>
              <p><br> At least for the past decade the NEL is managed well.</p>
              <p>Look at CCL, barely a year but already so many problems. Bukit
              Panjang LRT is another fine example. Always breakdown for the first
              few years and many years.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>do you even know why BPLRT always breakdown like siao until this year? its the first LRT line in SG, obv LTA/SMRT have little exp in operating them. together with a system which is complex and isnt supposed to suit our climate, of course it will breakdown often. it isnt meant to carry that huge amount of passengers.</p>
              <p>most of the CCL's disruptions are because of a faulty power cable (design/manufacturing issues). please please find out the cause of disruption before saying that it is due to operators' inadequate maintenance.</p>
              <p>why must SBST control any type of rail in the first place? it was supposed to be a public bus company in the first place. its the "smart" govt who wants "competition" introduced when there are little in common. SMRT was meant to be a rail company until the "smart" govt introduced "competition" for SBS.</p>
              <p>so you see, all this stupid problems are all coming from where? 30 years back. when govt wants "competition" when there is nothing to compete.</p>

              <p>Please do not talk rubbish if you are not representing SMRT. You only make SMRT sound more stupid instead. If they are really serious, they will find ways to improve it, not excuses to avoid the problems. SBST also have zero experience operating LRT but why it has so much less problems since its operations?</p>
              <p>Then for CCL, why does the company allow such a design flaw in the first place? And why the negligence in maintaining the NSEW lines where they should have anticipated that age will cause more problems and planned for preventative measures instead? What are they doing all these years? More concerned about counting profits and pay shareholders?</p>
              <p>I agree that the govt is mainly at fault in interfering too much in the competition and creating multimodal companies is seriously a great mistake for Singapore public transport. SBS should have stayed and operate all the bus routes in Singapore, plus LRT. SMRT should have controlled all the heavy rail operations.</p>

              <p>The BPLRT system isn't designed to suit Singapore's climate. Only recently after they bring in experts to study the problem and provide solutions, the LRT has become more reliable. As far as I know there isn't a major disruption this year which totally paralyses the whole system. That's why Changi Airport switched to the Mitsubishi Cyrstal Movers. They give lesser problems to operate.</p>
              <p>What can you expect when the govt privatised the public transport companies? Of course, they will focus more on profits and pleasing shareholders, and try to cut costs here and there. NEL is already showing its cracks and SBST better to something before the cracks become worse.</p>

              BPLRT was because of the design... it didn't want to straighten the viaduct at all.. esp at Teck Whye that side...
              
              Eh... Changi Airport's former Skytrain system is the same as BPLRT, but how come it gave less problems?
              
              They switched to Mitsubishi was because they wanted to upgrade the track n system, in lieu of T3's commencement...
              
              The profits they make, ends up most will end up kept as cash [except for SMRT, 80% divd payout rate indeed]... this cash will be needed for future needs i.e. depot new lease, MRT replacement etc...

              <p>But you think with out govt interfering everytime it's good? At least HK seems to be better managed, you don't see KMB or Citybus managing the rail services. Maybe LTA should just handover the NEL, DTL and SKPGLRT to SMRT and SMRT handover Yishun and Bukit Batok to SBST, just let SMRT manage those feeder/intratown routes in Woodlands, Bt Panjang or CCK and most of the basic trunk services being handed over to SBST too.</p>

              <p><br>SMRTB should only handle small scale premium bus services using BusPlus, while it refocus most of their resources improving and maintaining the rail services. As the heavy rail network to increase in future, it makes more sense for them to concentrate more heavily on rail operations, as it is costly to build, maintain and repair in the long run.</p>

              <p>But you think with out govt interfering everytime it's good? At least HK seems to be better managed, you don't see KMB or Citybus managing the rail services. Maybe LTA should just handover the NEL, DTL and SKPGLRT to SMRT and SMRT handover Yishun and Bukit Batok to SBST, just let SMRT manage those feeder/intratown routes in Woodlands, Bt Panjang or CCK and most of the basic trunk services being handed over to SBST too.</p>

              <p><br>SMRT shouldn't even be operating buses at all. They should just concentrate on heavy rail, like the NSEW, CCL, DTL, NEL and the upcoming future lines.</p>
              <p>SBST should take over all SMRT bus services and control all the bus services in Singapore, regardless of trunk, feeder and premium services. Thus there will be no restrictions around Singapore and can provide a more seamless and systematic bus network as a whole for Singapore. It can also operate the LRT since it is of a very small scale as compared to heavy rail. However there is no need for more LRT lines in future.</p>
