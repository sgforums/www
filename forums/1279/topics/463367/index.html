              eh... It's not MTR that's successful in stealing bus pax...
              
              Over the yrs, the HK govt allowed KCRC especially to add the West Rail &amp; Ma On Shan Rail.. That hurt buses a lot...
              
              but nonethless, HK is pretty diff... Cos MTR fares are super atas esp once it's cross harbour...

              <p>Dude, it is still too early to determine the performance of the new assigned personnel for the company. Hopefully these people will do a major change for SMRT if they can.</p>
              <p>Right now they should revamp on how things work inside and remove all the inefficiencies inside, from the management inside, the maintainance of their rail roads all the way to standardising their bus fleet. If it comes to a point that they realised that focusing much of their resources on rail operations and improving them greatly, but to scale down or even sell off their bus division (excluding bus plus), I would gladly welcome their decision. It makes no sense operating a badly managed division yet continues to drag the company down as a whole because it is always in the red every year.</p>

              <p><br>So I think it is a matter of time these newly appointed people to do somethig about their rail division. If they have to relegate all their resources and personnel inside to improve the rail operations and give up their bus division for that, I will fully support.</p>
              <p>Afterall, rail operations is their forte and main core business and they should focus on that for the well being as a whole. They can still operate small scale BusPlus services and cabs which is an easy source of income, that is, if they are to improve it too.</p>

              <p>Dude, it is still too early to determine the performance of the
              new assigned personnel for the company. Hopefully these people will
              do a major change for SMRT if they can.</p>
              <p>Right now they should revamp on how things work inside and
              remove all the inefficiencies inside, from the management inside,
              the maintainance of their rail roads all the way to
              standardising their bus fleet. If it comes to a point that they
              realised that focusing much of their resources on rail operations
              and improving them greatly, but to scale down or even sell off
              their bus division (excluding bus plus), I would gladly welcome
              their decision. It makes no sense operating a badly managed
              division yet continues to drag the company down as a whole because
              it is always in the red every year.</p>

              <p>selling off their bus division...makes no sense. if the division is not making profit who the heck wants to buy it then? in the first place public transport companies shouldnt be private companies and even listed on stock exchange. i dont think public transport business should be a profitable business since it is meant to serve the public not to squeeze money from people's pockets.</p>
              <p>you think revamping the company is fast? come on, desmond quek is barely 1 year into his job and he needs to clean up the shit slowly. if you want SMRT to revamp itself you must give them a few years to do so.</p>
              <p>as you said it is still too early to see the changes in SMRT. its barely 3 months.</p>
              <p>if you think you can you can manage the whole company and bring it to shine like how tony fernandes did with airasia, why not you do it?</p>

              <p><br> So I think it is a matter of time these newly appointed people to
              do somethig about their rail division. If they have to relegate all
              their resources and personnel inside to improve the rail operations
              and give up their bus division for that, I will fully support.</p>
              <p>Afterall, rail operations is their forte and main core business
              and they should focus on that for the well being as a whole. They
              can still operate small scale BusPlus services and cabs which is an
              easy source of income, that is, if they are to improve it too.</p>

              <p>their core business is public transportation, including buses, MRT, and taxi. they should also focus on that too. might as well nationalise public trnasportation.</p>
              <p>now NEL is starting to show its cracks too. just see how frequent NEL breakdowns this year. and its age is not even half of the mainline's age.</p>

              <p><br>It makes sense because it is not profitable at all and viable for the company to continue holding on the losses forever, and most of all, its core business is rail, not buses. Buses should be operated by companies that can manage bus services better and has the better expertise to manage, like SBST or even KMB. Hogging it and continue to mismanage it will not only do more harm to the commuters but the company itself as well.</p>
              <p>SMRT should refocus all its resources on its rail business if there is a lot to be improved in this segment rather than wasting the money and resources on money losing segments. It doesn't give SMRT a better ground in the long run if they continue running unprofitable and unmanagable segments. The notion of SMRT being a multimodal transport operator failed and this model do not work well with SMRT way of managing its operations. SMRT started as a rail company only and it did well all the years until it became a multimodal transport operator. Thus going back to its roots and operate in a scale that is managable by the company itself will be more appropriate for SMRT. It can still operate cabs as it is easy profit and Bus Plus services with a small scale bus chatering.</p>
              <p>Just like any business in the corporate world, companies tend to sell off their money losing divisions to others and refocus themselves in their core and established segments instead. This is how companies, especially those with many problems, survived and emerged themselves as better players in their core business.</p>
              <p>That's why if Mr Desmond Quek thinks of selling the unprofitable bus business from SMRT, I will support his decision as it is more promising for SMRT in the long run. It will be even better than one company controls buses and light rail, for SBST, and one for heavy rail only. for SMRT.</p>

              <p>Look at CCL, barely a year but already so many problems. Bukit Panjang LRT is another fine example. Always breakdown for the first few years and many years.</p>
