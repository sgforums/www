              <p>Yea, but i guess its because they decided that the different 3rd party applications thats available for iphone, android and windows phones that "hooks" onto mobileiris takes up too much bandwidth and capacity, therefore they implemented the validation code to ensure the person querying is indeed a human and not a machine.</p>

              Forgive my ignorance, if any but if thats the lousy, pathetic excuse sbs is giving, wtf, sbs, GROW UP. Wtf? Who cares if its an AI or a human using the app? For god's sake, its aTRAVEL info app! If thats the lousy excuse sbs is giving for their CRAPPY app, give it up. YOU DUN WANNA FIX IT, DUN ACT DUMB.
              
               this app is not Jus slightly bad, its horrible! 
              
              Firstly, a minor complaint: it requires gprs and gprs ONLY. How rigid is that? 
              
              Second: it crasges incessantly nonstop 
              
              thirdly: it is VERY slow, like in the span of up to ten mins of waiting, sometimes it doesnt even load. Says it cannot connect. Bullshit. My safari works fine. So why not? Lmao=___= 
              
              Fourth: VERY tedious process of checking. While other third party apps jus require a few presses and a wait of say, at most 3 min(very long, before iris shut it down mine could fetch info in 10 sec flat), iris needs some stupid form of 'verification' crap as ive state is COMPLETELY irrelevant
              
              Lastly, my views cant be flawed; why? Because thousands agree with me. Simple check the app store like i have and in the past two mths no other app in the store has received worst(abd perfectly sane ones,  no rants) ratings than this crappy excuse for an app. Every single rating is abt the horroble features of it and i myself have never found a good thing abt this app anyways. Bottom line, anyobe considering this app, forget it. Ure better off reading off the schedule boards in bus stops and still be earlier than if u use this app. 
              
              
              
              Cheers~

              <p>the fact that iris app auto-loads arrival times for all services
              at a bus stop has not helped things, as the server is still busy
              during peak hours nowdays.</p>

              <p>If i remembered correctly, the apps (some of them) actually uses a caching server to cache the query from sbst, i.e. 2 person asking for the same stop same services then not all the arrival times request are actually handled directly by sbst. This is why some times the offical app will offer a tiny bit more of accuracy.</p>
              <p>Actually im wondering if it is the humans that's causing the lag or the buses that's bottlenecking the database server. Putting almost 1000 vehicles on the road and getting their location every 10 seconds is no joke and it really will tax any server, do share if u have any experience of that.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>My dear friend, iris was actually set up in 2007 and that's before the maturing of 3G data, iphone, and applications in different mobile os. During that period, no one would have anticipated this huge amount of users popping in by the perfect storm of iphone and android apps. You really had to use sms or gprs to get the timing and definately not all services at once for the particular bus stop.</p>
              <p>It may be no excuse that they should have started to upgrade their systems as the years passed on, but, its really a cost to them that generates no return at all. I feel that what they should at least do now is to add a caching server to cache queries directing them straight to the database if they havent done so, and allow developers to join in and not thru some non-official manner.</p>
              <p>I've too experienced times where iris would just give u a timeout error, but its really a value added service that's free for passengers. Look at smrt, 4 years already and yet still missing in action.</p>

              <p>Ah, not really. For sgbuses, the developer has his own server to cache the iris queries. Sbst's app too uses a special web page to get it's results from too instead of its own mobileiris page.</p>
              <p>A powerful database server to generate the timings can easily cost in the 5 digits region, and that is not a small sum since sbst already provides a better service than the other company can... To pay that amount to make it slightly better is not really justifyable. Hope smrt will get theirs running, so sbst will make theirs better or the other option is to give a good optmisation to the system... Its not a small sum to setup the infrastructure for such services, gps modules(which both already has), mobile data modules(which both already has too), servers, software and monthly data charges and power is just some of the things they have to pay.</p>

              <p>SBST could leverage on the power of cloud computing... (though it sounds big and I don't know how they're going to export their proprietary software to the cloud)</p>
              <p>SBST can also cache the bus timings and update their mobileiris webpage or iPhone app every 2 minutes... (1st minute display timing, 2nd minute just minus 1 minute from the 1st minute timing - this would be much faster than recalculating the timing for every user who logs onto iris... I think!)</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, iris has really been a great help since SBST released it 2-3 years back (am I right?)</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents ;)</p>
