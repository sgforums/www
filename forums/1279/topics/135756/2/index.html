That remind me that i was sitting with a boy prob in his teens. I gave him 2 hard stare when he was eating his old chang kee currypuff &amp; then drinking his softdrink, however, i dun think he feel anything, regardless guilty or embaressed. Wat come straight from my mind, he lack of teaching from the school as well as his own parents.<br><br>Well, eating &amp; drinking is bad, however it is much to see pple like him would to leave their wrappers or plastic bags on the bus &amp; expect someone or the bus driver to pick or clean for them.

There are still some buses that are marked with poor standards. Esp, i notice that the boths sides of the tibs bus, near inner seats, rubbish is easy trapped &amp; accumulated, if the bus drivers do not clear them, it will just ensuring the reproduction of the cockroaches.</div>
