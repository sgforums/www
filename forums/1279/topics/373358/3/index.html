              <p>I don't know about other bus fans of my age, but if you are around my age, you would surely feel right to stand up against these abusers (if you have the size or have the skill). Although the job as a bus driver (captain) always get looked down by the public, I think they really deserve some respect. Maybe some inconsiderate folks like this woman think its too easy to drive, or its too tough to respect. Oh, don't talk about respecting bus captains, I think she don't know how to respect normal countrymen too.</p>
              <p>If I were to see an abuse, lets say sorry to the abuser, most likely I will be on top of him... A her, is indeed difficult in Singapore. Sadly I am not a female.</p>
              <p>Asking her husband (to bail her out of the situation?) is already a bit too much. And the husband has just been released from jail? The woman should think about it before doing such a thing as attacking a public transport operator physically... In other countries, this couple (lets not say family) will not have any bit of respect left and get kicked out of their properties...</p>
              <p>Luckily HDB will not kick you out of the flat for attacking a bus captain... Lucky woman.</p>

              <p>pressing of emergency buttons occur where there is immediate threat. like a knife beside you. its a serious warning message where you cannot even communicate with the OCC such as this case. an inspector or a mobile police will be deployed immediately upon, the red emergency button at a secluded position on the right side of the driver's cabin. the pressing of the red SOS button on the IDFC still involves communication of speech. i would be surprised if he pressed the red SOS button and communicated with the OCC, without the female knowing.</p>
