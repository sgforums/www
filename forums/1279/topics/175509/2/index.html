Suddenly a sv55 0405 came up along the right lane beside the mk2 I was on. The Mk2 did not slow down, and the 0405 sped up like crazy and cut into our lane. Later, at the CTE junction, the Mk2 was on the second lane when the 0405 swerved dangerously into our lane. My driver was already scolding, and then later at the AMK Ave 10 junction, the 0405 driver point middle finger at my driver.</div>
