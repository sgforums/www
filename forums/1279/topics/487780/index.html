              <p>I want to talk about the bus stop display at Somerset MRT on Somerset Road. If anyone has noticed, the time indicator there is flawed. If it shows 02 or 03 mins for the bus to come, the bus is actually already at the bus stop.</p>
              <p>For instance, when 972 came to the stop, it still showed 03 minutes on the indicator display. Even after it departed it continued to show 02 minutes and only then changed. That is very misleading. I hope they correct this as it could lead to frustration among people.</p>
              <p>Imagine I saw a fully seated 972 come but I see 03 minutes for the next one to arrive. I will wait considering I might get a seat of my choice. In reality next one is only after 14 minutes. </p>

              <p>DTL3 is not even supposed to serve Ave 5 within Tampines. And Tampines West is on Ave 4. From what I heard, the stops along Ave 4 will be shifted down to the entrance.</p>

              <p>Bus stop numbering codes - specifically, the B-somethings (B01, B02, ...)</p>
              <p>Does LTA officially uses these codes, together with the 5-digit codes? Most of the time we only see them being used by certain map publishers such as Mighty Minds.</p>
              <p>Some of these codes can be terribly incoherent - such as the very obvious break along Woodlands Ave 7, not accurately reflected on Mighty Minds maps. Then there are those that could be better off renumbered, such as Petir Rd (B02, B02A, B02B, B02C). Dozens more of cases where bus stops opposite each other do not have consecutive codes. The AYE / Buona Vista Flyover junction has very confusing code numbering. Old CCK Rd starts numbering at B15. And how did (B61, B62) at PIE / Tuas Rd came about ...</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, I don't agree. Bus stop is built to convenience people. Going by what you say, many buses have to skip bus stops near MRT and let all the people walk. This is not what public transport is aimed for. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS2601D, let's not forget the bus stop has many other services that people need to transfer on to. This provides a seamless connection if required to. If for every reason due to crowdiness, they wish to remove bus services from bus stops to settle this issue, then many other stops all over singapore need to remove bus services. By then, road directories and bus route planners will find it absurd that the services all do not appear at certain stops. Surely this is not the way to go! Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, there is no much difference. Better to have sbs 83 and smrt 965 go inside sengkang interchange to pick up people. Don't forget the majority of commuters for these 2 services start at the interchange. By asking all of them to walk outside to a bus stop at sengkang square is not appropriate. Sengkang is a hub as it requires to provide seamless transfer for mrt/LRT/bus. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Can svc 14, 96, 147, 156, 165, 166, 175
              and 285 skip Clementi MRT bus stop towards Clementi Int?
              There are always traffic jams there because too many buses try to
              enter the bus bay, and often pax have to wait for 3-5 minutes
              before they can alight... These services can just go straightly to
              Clementi Int and let all the pax walk to Clementi MRT, it's just a
              matter of a few minutes and will effectively reduce the traffic jam
              at Commonwealth Ave West.</p>

              <p>There are definitely merits to your suggestion. The only downside I see is those who want to transfer to another service. But this should be taken care of by transferring at the stop before Clementi MRT where all bus services call already. </p>
              <p>Some services like 96 and 285 are the biggest problem makers here. There are around 70-80 pax alighting from both these services that clog the bus stop for long. Apart from this you also have sv 52, 78, 154, 183, 201, 106 that have huge number of pax alighting and boarding at this stop and keeping the stop engaged for long time.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is even if you don't want all services to skip MRT stop before interchange, at least 96 and 285 should.</p>

              <p>If transferring to other services is your concern, that can be addressed by people transferring at bus stop prior to Clementi MRT. Most smart people would anyway do that today, as there is high likelihood of boarding and getting a seat when many pax alight at Clementi MRT stop. So it's only an advantage and not disadvantage.</p>
