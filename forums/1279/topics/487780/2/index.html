              <p>There are definitely merits to your suggestion. The only
              downside I see is those who want to transfer to another service.
              But this should be taken care of by transferring at the stop before
              Clementi MRT where all bus services call already. </p>
              <p>Some services like 96 and 285 are the biggest problem makers
              here. There are around 70-80 pax alighting from both these services
              that clog the bus stop for long. Apart from this you also have sv
              52, 78, 154, 183, 201, 106 that have huge number of pax alighting
              and boarding at this stop and keeping the stop engaged for long
              time.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is even if you don't want all services to skip MRT
              stop before interchange, at least 96 and 285 should.</p>

              <p>Doesn't matter much. This stop is not crowded and does coz a queue of buses and traffic, so would let it be (unlike Clementi MRT stop)</p>

              That means,... 27 got a new stop?... 
              Now days I prefer taking 27/89 to TPE then 858/969 to Tampines and Changi Airport respectively.
              This shows hpow the TPE stops brought  convenience to the north-East people.

              Some outdated bus stop names here.
              B67031, Aft Jln Kayu should be renamed Aft Sengkang West Rd since that part of Jalan Kayu has been already closed and replaced with Sengkang West Rd.
              B03129, Uic Bldg should be renamed has, Bef S'pore Conference Hall since that building was demolished to make way for a new condo there.

              <p>99 to extend to Joo Koon via st 93? But do you really think there are many people who work in industrial areas in Joo Koon that live along st 91, 93... Also then 99 will have to do st 91 bi-directional not to upset current huge load of customers who take 99 to Jurong west town. </p>

                      <p>That was what I saw at that time, but they take down already. Actually, extending 99 to Jurong West Street 93 can create a new intra-town connection to the new nursing home and the sports complex, from Boon Lay town, Jalan Boon Lay and Jurong West Avenue 1.</p>
                      <p>Well, it may be a new bus route that loops at Street 91 via the other direction, among other possibilities. </p>

              <p>I do feel there is scope for new feeder service in Boon Lay to cover for sv 257 in case it starts from Joo Koon in future.</p>
              <p>This way the new feeder service can do sv 257 route to Pioneer MRT followed with st 93, st 92, st 91, st 93 and back... this way the new complexes around st 93 and hyrsing home can get direct connection to Pioneer/Boon Lay + alternative to 241 for the heavily crowded st 91 area.</p>

              <p>Well, with regards to the new bus stops at Jurong West Street 91 in the direction towards Pioneer Road North, there are many possibilities.</p>
                  <p>Whatever the bus service that would call at the new bus stops, I hope it would benefit the local population; the people staying in Jurong West.</p>
              
                  <p>If there is a new bus service intended for Jurong West Street 93, I personally wish it can connect to Pioneer MRT station, where between Pioneer station and Boon Lay station, it complements the heavy sectors at Jurong West Street 71, 81, 75 and 64.</p>    <p>Jurong West Street 93 has two new developments - the new nursing home and the future precinct of rental flats. If a new bus service is introduced there now, it's only going to serve the existing precincts of residential apartments, the existing precinct of landed apartments and the new nursing home. When the rental flats are up, the loading at Street 93 will increase.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, there is a future precinct of elderly flats under construction at Jurong West Avenue 4 opposite Pioneer Mall. Nonetheless, even with that addition, we can simply enhance the bus fleet of service 242; no need for new bus service.</p>
                  <p>Once again, there are many possibilities with regards to the new bus stops at Jurong West Street 91. Until there is official press release, let us not conclude anything.</p>
                  <p>Who knows, it may be for the new bus service at Jurong Lake? There are many possibilities.</p>
