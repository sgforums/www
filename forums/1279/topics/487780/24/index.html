              <p>True and if you see both 135 and 155 need no DDs. 135 main loading is Paya Lebar to Parkway Parade, but that is when it comes before 43/134. Same saga like 79/143/143M at Teban Gardens towards JE. </p>
              <p>100 is the one that has high loading between Aljunied and Serangoon. It is supplemented with 100A and with 28 buses in the fleet, unless SDs are reduced, 100 also does not need DDs today. It badly needed them a couple years back. Same scene like 145 that still stuck with 3 DDs only since 27 buses is already too much and buses are running at high frequency. </p>
              <p>39 also does not have DD loading because before Yishun became DD friendly, a lot of SDs were added to 39 and then 103/117 also took off some of the loading. </p>
              <p>66 needless to say doesn't have DD loading due to many services in parallel (Except for weekends maybe but that also I hear loading between JE - Little India dropped significantly). You would be the right person to confirm that.</p>
