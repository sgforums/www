              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, waterwoods condo is completed. My friend has already taken keys. Renovation is ongoing. That section of Punggol east needs to have a stop as the whole stretch does not have any in the past. The Punggol field bus stop is at Blk 126A HDB flat which is further out. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, they are still within 400 metres of meridian LRT and bus stop or coral edge LRT and bus stop. It is still deemed within walking distance. There are also no more spaces to introduce new bus services at Punggol interchange. It is also not practical to divert 3 or 83 to this portion and come out again which will affect major traffic flow along Punggol field. The journey for 3 and 83 to make its current loop around Punggol field-east-central-interchange is already very draggy. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, LTA has already announced before launch of SBS 382G/W that its main purpose is to serve residents along Sumang walk where there is no LRT. The road sumang walk has no LRT. It is on the other side of the road where there is LRT. </p>
              <p>Edgedale plains waterway sundew is caught between 2 LRT stations. LTA must be having a big dilemma now due to the way that the road structures are built in such a manner. It is also not practical to keep launching new bus services to go in and out but it seems they have no choice. Furthermore, there is no space in Punggol interchange. What we can say is the buildings deep inside Punggol waterway face a problematic issue. Good surrounding view but poor transport due to the poor structure of the roads. LRT is nearby but not sufficiently near enough. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, these are my replies.</p>
              <p>1) sumang walk has no LRT. The road needs a bus service and it is given. It is the only bus service going the inner loop of Punggol west. LTA is right in launching Sbs 382. Almost all the stops it served are new bus stops. The rest are bus stops relatively new with just one bus service. At Punggol field, it is 119 and 382. At Punggol place, it is 50 and 382. The rest only have 382.</p>
              <p>2) Blk 120/121 is unfortunately near TPE. At this sort of poor location, it is comparable to those living in Blk 134 area. Once walk out to Punggol field, it has 3/62/83/386/meridian LRT/coral edge LRT. You need to realise that for bus to go into this stop and come out is not too feasible. This bto is built inside the developed area and it has to leverage on the current bus services available. </p>
              <p>3) Waterway sundew will definitely have new bus service once Punggol interchange is expanded. It will definitely be a new bus service. It may also go all the way to Punggol east end once that side is developed well enough. Rest assured sbs 386 will not be touched as the link to new stops at edgedale plains (opp horizon primary and next to Greendale Primary) need to be preserved.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, my replies are that of mine and it only depends on the way I look at the road structures in this town. Please stop your linkage to whatever you deem as protect and justify LTA. Don't go back to your nonsensical old self of linking people to LTA. That is really childish. Very childish way of thinking after so long time. I don't collect money from LTA. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

                  <p>In fact, I think it's because of this that's why the bus stop just outside JJC only have 185 and 157 calling at it; 174 does not call there, probably because it comes from the expressway and they probably don't want the bus to jam up the traffic from the expressway, that's why they don't allow 174 to call at that bus stop.</p>
                  <p>Why? You thinking of new bus route at Jurong West Avenue 2 ah?</p>
                  <p>Actually, I think the section between Corporation Road and Jurong West Street 23 can have one pair of new bus stop...</p>
                  <p>Well, if you want, you can have a new bus route that runs along Jurong West Avenue 1, Corporation Road, Jurong West Avenue 2 and the expressway. So far, there's no bus service which runs this route. :) by running along Jurong West Avenue 1, the new bus route can serve the people staying along Jurong West Street 42 that you want it to serve. :)</p>

              <p>174 does not call at that stop simply because it needs to turn into Boon Lay Ave. It has nothing to do with the expressway.</p>
              <p>I suspect that when Bulim Ave is open, 174 will skip the bus stop in the opposite directin also.</p>

                  sandwiched between Oasis and Kadaloor LRT, but do you know how far
                  it is to walk to these (especially inner block 662)? Seriously LTA
                  can do better. Instead of launching stupid routes like 150, need to
                  provide connectivity to people who have none. Can just modify 386
                  to do the needful. There is no need to launch new
                  service. </span></p>

              <p>It would be great if there is short feeder to Pasir Ris Grove. There are huge number of condos there, and they are not very close to MRT. Just a service with 2-3 buses is enough, but important to provide the connection.</p>

              <p>I know what they're saying... What I mean is, the flats near the additional Dr 8 bus stop are pretty close to both Pasir Ris MRT and St 52. So residents may still be having their old traveling patterns (either walk to St 52 and take svc 15, or just walk to MRT), instead of taking Svc 3.</p>
