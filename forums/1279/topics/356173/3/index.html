              <p>3's loading at the bus stop outside mrt towards Punggol is heavy, which is why 3A has to come in. Towards tampines, the queue can be as long 88's, but this only happens between 6pm-6.25pm, because at around 6 a bus reaches Pasir Ris Int, and the next bus arrives at around 6.25pm - 6.30pm.</p>

              <p>Yes I'm afraid you're right about that, but SBST wanted to combine them, because to make more money right. 294 duplicated 291's east route for quite a long way, and before the introduction of 3, 81 was the only bus that provided a direct link from Tampines Int to Pasir Ris, mind you it didn't even go PSR int. The last bus to do so was 21 when it plied Tampines INT - Pasir Ris INT a long long time ago. (Correct me if I'm wrong again).</p>
              <p>Rmb before the new 3 came along, the combined service did not extend to punngol and it looped at PSR St 71.<br><br>And one other thing, at Tampines MRT towards Punggol, the load is mostly people going from Tampines - Pasir Ris.

              <p>The overcrowding issue at Tampines is not that severe as Pasir Ris or Bedok...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pasir Ris doesn't have enough slots(berths) and Bedok doesn't have enough parking lots...</p>
              <p>Actually Tampines(after upgrading) is still much better than Pasir Ris and Bedok. IMHO since the latter two are so dilapidated, LTA might as well tear them down and build an entirely new Interchange(A/C one like TPY of coz).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I like the new look of Tampines Int actually, the colors(interior wise) are quite reinvigorating... But they have to do some work with the exterior.</p>

              <p>The overcrowding issue at Tampines is not that severe as Pasir
              Ris or Bedok...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pasir Ris doesn't have enough slots(berths) and Bedok doesn't
              have enough parking lots...</p>
              <p>Actually Tampines(after upgrading) is still much better than
              Pasir Ris and Bedok. IMHO since the latter two are so dilapidated,
              LTA might as well tear them down and build an entirely new
              Interchange(A/C one like TPY of coz).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I like the new look of Tampines Int actually, the
              colors(interior wise) are quite reinvigorating... But they have to
              do some work with the exterior.</p>

              <p>Are you sure, LTA is planning to make Tampines Int an air-con one by 2016, not 2009. Although Tampines Int may seem more lively now, the overcrowding issue is still very bad. As far as I know, Tampines has bad connection to the City as a regional centre. Maybe they should insert more berths to have more services.</p>

              <p>IMHO parking space isn't that much of a problem in TP Int. Have never seen every lot filled, unlike Hougang and Boon Lay... Usually TP Int has quite a couple of vacant lots, as BC don't want to park their buses at the far end of the Interchange.</p>
