              <p><br>There are spot checks at Interchange by SBST Personnel. BCs are not being told as it is sort of a surprise spot check. Motive is to check for and damages to the bus especially the bumper. So far as i know, Sv62 and Sv64 has the perfect score of no damages.</p>

              <p>Yes being a bus driver in SG is very damm stressful.You have to face all kind of shits both from the company and passengers as well road users who usually dont give a damm.But i feel SMRT is more flexible towards their own employees compared to SBST.But as i said before both got its own flaws.</p>
              <p>Employing Chinaman is just another reason(Low pay save cost)besides manpower shortage.I would prefer if they employ more Indiaman or Filipinos who is more English spoken.</p>

              <p>If I am a BC, I will do the following when i got into such a situation. Whether its flouting the rues or not, or you dun feel like it, but I guess its the best I would do...</p>
              <p>As a SBST BC...</p>
              <p>1. Early: Once the DDU indicates I am early, I will check my time against the timesheet. If the timesheet is not the same as the actual time, which means that the timesheet is wrong, I will mark the time against the timesheet, like +2 or -3 and so on, and continue on with the journey. And when the buffer is reached, like 5 minutes, I will stop the bus and apologize to the commuters on the bus, and stop the bus at the bus stop until the time have dropped to 0 or +1 and I would move off. Saves my wallet and my points too. Being so, i will drive at a safe speed of 50km/h maximum on normal roads and maximum vehicle speed on expressway.</p>
              <p>2. Confiscating cards: I will not confiscate cards. I swear I will never do such anti-social things, even if it gives me SGD1000 bonus per year. Ethnic is ethnic. Irritating customers is the last thing I would do.</p>
              <p>3. Late: Once I got into a late situation, more than 5 minutes behind schedule, I will go off service immediately. I will not ask OCC cause this is plain stupid and I hate being late. Before entering Interchange, or when time reaches +1 (early by 1 minute), i will put back the plates and resume service. Only in dire conditions will I ask OCC if I can go off service. I believe on the road, the BC sees more than the guys in the office.</p>
              <p>4. MC: Believe me, unless I am bed-ridden or under heavy medication, I will not take MC. This is making loss to the company. Serious loss, as men are its tools in profit, in turn, will the company then care about its employees.</p>
              <p><br>As a SMRT BC:</p>
              <p>1. Late or early: same as above. DDU have to be the iBOS though...</p>
              <p>2. Confiscating cards: Same as above.</p>
              <p>3. MC: Same as above.</p>
              <p>4. Vehicle performance: You know the underhand methods of making the bus run fast. Then you do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the views I have as the shoes of a bus captain. There are just some rules which have to be followed, there are some which are meant to be broken sometimes. And some rules are plain stupid rules, which need no following...</p>

              <p><br>hmm, lemme think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as an sbst bc, i would follow:</p>
              <p>1) timing-</p>
              <p>if ddu says im early, i would slow down reasonably, say, instead of trying to rush over traffic lights, i will slow down to a speed of 30km/h at every set of lights till the ddu tells me im back on time. of course, i wont slow down till sv.119 type of speeds where the drivers in the late afternoons are praying for every set of lights to be red. i will enter bus stops even if it does not seem that the ppl in there are going to board my bus. on highway routes, i will drive at a constant speed of 50kmh till the ddu says im back on time</p>
              <p>if ddu tells me im late, i will speed up, not to really chiong and overtake everything i can overtake, but speed up reasonably, and if no one at the bus stop flags down the bus, i will accelerate and keep pace with traffic. on highways i will try to hit the max speed of the roads or as fast as the bus allows me to go, this continue until ddu says im on time.</p>
              <p>if i get into a really late situation, i will make contact with the occ to check wat i shd do next, to remove desto or carry on.</p>
              <p>2) ezlink cards and fares-</p>
              <p>i will not confiscate any adult ezlink card. this are standard ezlink card and its right for anyone to own one.</p>
              <p>student ezlink card, only if the holder really does notlook like a student. as for ppl paying by cash, if student lack the 5 cents to pay i wont make a fuss over it.</p>
              <p>3)mc-</p>
              <p>i believe that i can take 10 or less mc per year. usually much less.</p>
              <p>4) bus-</p>
              <p>i belive as a bc it would be my duty to take care of the current vehicle under my charge. i will do checks at the start and end of my duty and report any damages. ;likewise, i will keep it clean, sweeping the floor when i am parked at interchange.</p>
