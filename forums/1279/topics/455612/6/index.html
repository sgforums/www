              <p>SMRT operates with Rigids/bendies. I believe that they can deploy out rigids instead of bendies for certain train diversion route? Then those services that are bendy-friendly can get full bendy fleet instead of rigid/bendy fleet?</p>
              <p>Anyway, in Singapore, you will sure be expecting pros/cons everywhere. So I don't think it's a good idea for SMRT to "upgrade" their fleet from bendy to DDs. Plus, a mixture would be better than identical.</p>

              <p>I believe not many people are happy about the hub and spoke
                      concept nowadays because of the mulitple transfers they have to
                      make just to get from point A to point B.</p>
              <p>Why are so many incidents of people fighting over seats
                      recently? I don't think having lesser seats is suitable for our
                      context. Think of all those working long hours everyday as well, do
                      you think they like to stand for the whole trip and transfer many
                      times just to go to work and go home? And not many are smart
                      experts, which in fact, most commuters want the simpliest way to
                      get from point A to B.</p>
              <p>Even if with a hub and spoke concept, I believe maintaining a
                      full single decker fleet is good enough. They are flexible and bus
                      stops can hold at least 2 buses of different services at the same
                      time which is faster and more efficient.</p>

              <p>You are wrong.</p>
              <p>Once people got used to the system, practically everyone I know now liked the hub and spoke system.</p>
              <p>And it makes far more sense than taking train only.</p>
              <p>Or taking bus only.</p>
              <p>The flexibility I now gain from having the liberty to alight, drink tao huey zhui, and then take another bus to another destination is tremendous.</p>
              <p>And now taking feeder bus to my house from the MRT station is such an attractive option instead of walking 15 minutes in the sun to save 60 cents.</p>
              <p>And perhaps you do not travel like I do on a daily basis. I can switch buses up to 3x per trip to try to find a good balance between having seats and reaching my destinations quickly.</p>
              <p>Call it troublesome. But consider my trip to Bedok from Hougang Ave 8 this morning:</p>
              <p>If I take the train only (NEL=&gt;CCL=&gt;EWL), I take around 50 minutes, including a 15 minutes walk from my house.</p>
              <p>By contrast, despite walking 10 minutes, and then switching buses 3 times and having to wait 10 minutes, and 5 minutes for the first 2 buses (62=&gt;25=&gt;28), I took 40 minutes to reach Bedok MRT. And the trip was cheaper!</p>
