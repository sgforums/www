              <p>Even with this objective view, I would think there would still
              be a need for bendy buses. Especially for feeder/intratown/townlink
              and short inter-town routes, these kind of buses are more useful
              than double deckers. Why? Over a shorter distance, who would be
              willing to move up and down stairs of a bus? A bendy bus would be
              more practical, due to the accessibility to more doors. Also useful
              for high-loading services which may be unable to use doubledecks
              due to height restrictions. <br> <br> Double-decks on the other hand should be used for the
              longer-distance routes, as there would be a higher chance of people
              staying onboard for a longer ride. <br> <br> But of course, even with the bendy bus being only a memory soon, it
              would be nice to see more come in.. Only a dream.. Soon, we shall
              be like London..</p>

              <p>It is not true that people don't want to move to the upper deck. It applies only if it is 2 stops or so. Look at 291, 334 DDs are so well utilized with people moving to the upper deck. I have noticed a problem with 132 where people cramp onto the lower deck from  Henderson road to Redhill. But on most routes, the upper deck is well utilized and if standing was allowed, people would have stood on upper deck, too. </p>

              <p>I find something puzzling</p>
              <p>Bendies were first deployed in 1996</p>
              <p>From 1996-1997, there were 57 bendies Mk 1 deployed.</p>
              <p>In 1999, came 29 bendies Mk 2</p>
              <p>From 2000 onwards, 229 habits/volgrens were rolled out.</p>
              <p>Throughout a spell of 4 years from 1996 to 2000, the 86 or so bendies must have fetched a favourable response from the public in order for LTA to approve the further procurement of 229 more bendies in 2000!!!</p>
              <p>If bendies were really that detestful, why didn't the public vehemently oppose it from 1996 to 2000?</p>

              <p>You said it 1996 to 2000. Population back then isn't even 4 million. 1996 was about 3.2 million. Now we have already 5 million and will increase further in years to come.</p>
              <p>You think they are still practical now? You only see the picture of 4 years but you never see the picture of 12 years after that. Many complains of high accident rates, burn down rates, taking up too much space in bus interchanges, bus stops and bus lanes and delaying the schedules of other buses, parking woes in depots surfacing for the past 12 years.</p>
              <p>Things look new and good in the early days but the real problems will only come in many years after. Everyone like new things but once these things give a lot of real problems after that, you will see that it is just a fad or became another history up in the books.</p>

              <p>back in 1996, bendies were the novelty.</p>
              <p>I still remember its first appearence on 911. It was fun.</p>
              <p>Until I saw a 913 BC who thought he was driving 911 and made the left turn after the 1st stop after leaving WRI.</p>
              <p>He tried to do a 3 point turn at the carpark and that led to a HUGE traffic jam.</p>
              <p>Isolated incident it is...but I have little doubt that a SD or DD would have taken far less time.</p>

              <p>My main point is that with double decks for such short-haul routes, I would feel that the time taken at bus stops would also be longer, as people would have to only rely on one main exit door of the bus, unlike a bendy bus which has two. <br><br>Double-decks are well-utilised for the trunk services, I have no qualms about them.

              <p>modern buses will come with lesser seats</p>
              <p>With the emphasize now towards the concept of hub-and-spoke and bus-to-train intermodal transfer, the average travelling time has reduced as compared to the 1970s and early 1980s before MRT train was introduced</p>

              <p>In singapore context, if passengers were to choose between comfort and punctuality, i believe they will opt for punctuality..they just want the bus to arrive quickly and fetch them to the train stations in the shortest time possible</p>
              <p>sitting is no longer a neccessity for short-distanced journey, especially when the distance-based fare computation is already in place, many smart bus experts who are well-versed with every bus route know how to make multiple transfer from their origin to destination</p>
              <p>i wonder if the 2-by-1 front facing seating configuration is still necessary, in fact i'm advocating a 1-by-1 single seat arrangement to free up more standing space, or all sideway seating configuration just like MRT</p>

              <p>Why are so many incidents of people fighting over seats recently? I don't think having lesser seats is suitable for our context.

              <p>You fail to realise that most route's demands don't need double deckers as they are not so high to justify the use of double deckers while others is more of the road width limitations. <br>And some routes did use double deckers before, like 94 while some withdrawn double deckers from the service beacuse demand is low, like 18, 29, 63, 82, 130, 135, 358, 359.</p>

              <p>the problem with woodlands interchange is that there are too many bus services with bendies while Sembawang and Bt Panjang Int is under-utilized</p>
              <p>and a lot of routes towards Woodlands are actually parallel, which you may wonder if it's really neccessary since the distance-based fare computation is already in place</p>
              <p>eg.</p>
              <p>From Bt Panjang to Woodlands Interchange via Woodlands Road, Ave 3, we have 960 and 961 parallel, one of them could be truncated to terminate at Bt Panjang Int instead, preferably 960 since it got bendies</p>
              <p>From Bt Panjang to Woodlands Interchange via BKE, Wdls Ave 3, we have 187, 963 and 966 exactly parallel. Two of the three could be truncated to terminate at Bt Panjang Int instead.</p>
              <p>From Gambas Ave to Woodlands Interchange via Ave 7, we have 965 and 969 parallel, one of them could be amended to terminate at Sembawang Interchange instead, preferably 969</p>

              <p><br>You want to cut these bus routes but first you need to get feedbacks first. Sure will come in tons of complains with these kind of cuts.</p>
              <p>People want more choices to get to their destinations as well. Cutting them means limiting their choices. not wise.</p>
              <p>However some extensions are already disasterous, as in the case for 858 to Sembawang.</p>
