              <p>In my opinion, don't need queuing berths/railings during peak hours. Sometimes one bus takes 3-5 minutes for queuing passengers to fully load up.</p>
              <p>Imagine if two buses arrive at the berth at the same time, the behind bus has to wait 3-5 minutes for the front bus to move off, and spend another 3-5 minutes.</p>
              <p>There are also situations where increasing number of foreigners who don't have ezlink cards and they need to ask the SLs for exact fares to pay by cash, this further slows down the boarding process if they clog at the entrance besides the SL's cabin</p>
              <p>Some even carry bulky items and luggage and take their own sweet time to fish for the exact cash/coins, the queue get stuck</p>
              <p>Some tap their card unsuccessfully and realize that their ezlink cards are defective or out-of-value and have to fish for cash, as a result hogging up the queue behind.</p>
              <p>Some aunties even stand at the entrance and ask the SL for directions, hogging up the queue behind...especially these days so many foreigners and tourists</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the bus almost full already and passengers at the front door still insist on boarding and squeezing in, the SL, unable to close the front door, has to shout for the passengers inside to move in further and squeeze</p>
              <p>All these are factors delaying the bus. During the morning rush hours, almost 90% of commuters are stressed up and hot tempered and in a rush</p>
              <p>i prefer they remove all the queue railings at Yishun and Woodlands.</p>
              <p>All 3 doors of bendy should be used for boarding. From 3 minutes can be reduced to 1 minute.</p>
              <p>The operators have no excuse for late departure from bus interchanges</p>
              <p>London practises this.</p>

              <p>As long as the bus travels out of the estate it's considered as
              trunk liao..regardless of the route? There are some trunk services
              with ultra-short round-trip routes that are even shorter than
              residential feeder services.</p>
              <p>Sv 403 - total 7.9km - <strong>trunk</strong> !! cos
              Pasir Ris Park is considered not inside Pasir Ris estate??</p>

              <p>I don't know what you're trying to mean; are you trying to imply Pasir Ris Park is not counted as under Pasir Ris Estate? Then where else you want to classify Pasir Ris Park? Ubin? Changi? Yishun? Woodlands? Bishan? Tampines?<br><br>Pasir Ris Park is classfied under Pasir Ris Estate AFAIK. Even DPM Teo says so. Just that 403 was classified even as a Parks service (like 408 &amp; 409) when the Park services labelling came out, the Sv 403 guide even used to print it as a Parks service..then they dropped that scheme for 403 later somehow but kept it for 408 &amp; 409.</p>

              <p><br>I saw this happen for 291 at Tampines. The ground staff allowed boarding from the exit door and then the BC came saying that most people entered without tapping. People want to save money, if they get a chance.</p>
              <p>Observed so many people during rush hours not tapping while entering from front door. Sometimes they get caught, sometimes they travel free.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, don't need queuing berths/railings during peak
              hours. Sometimes one bus takes 3-5 minutes for queuing passengers
              to fully load up.</p>
              <p>Imagine if two buses arrive at the berth at the same time, the
              behind bus has to wait 3-5 minutes for the front bus to move off,
              and spend another 3-5 minutes.</p>
              <p>There are also situations where increasing number of foreigners
              who don't have ezlink cards and they need to ask the SLs for exact
              fares to pay by cash, this further slows down the boarding process
              if they clog at the entrance besides the SL's cabin</p>
              <p>Some even carry bulky items and luggage and take their own sweet
              time to fish for the exact cash/coins, the queue get stuck</p>
              <p>Some tap their card unsuccessfully and realize that their ezlink
              cards are defective or out-of-value and have to fish for cash, as a
              result hogging up the queue behind.</p>
              <p>Some aunties even stand at the entrance and ask the SL for
              directions, hogging up the queue behind...especially these days so
              many foreigners and tourists</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the bus almost full already and passengers at the
              front door still insist on boarding and squeezing in, the SL,
              unable to close the front door, has to shout for the passengers
              inside to move in further and squeeze</p>
              <p>All these are factors delaying the bus. During the morning rush
              hours, almost 90% of commuters are stressed up and hot tempered and
              in a rush</p>
              <p>i prefer they remove all the queue railings at Yishun and
              Woodlands.</p>
              <p>All 3 doors of bendy should be used for boarding. From 3 minutes
              can be reduced to 1 minute.</p>
              <p>The operators have no excuse for late departure from bus
              interchanges</p>
              <p>London practises this.</p>

              Agree!!! Speed up boarding at interchange!! Feeder bus use distance fare only extra few cents from MRT so people can't save so much!!!

              <p>We should reduce the services available at Woodlands Interchange

              <p>161 - duplicates 168 from TPE (Seletar) to woodlands, in my
              opinion, this service should be truncated to start from Hougang
              Central and loop at jalan kayu bus stop instead, don't need to go
              all the way to Woodlands</p>
              <p>168 - frequency should be further increased</p>
              <p>169 - need not touch </p>
              <p>178 - need not touch</p>
              <p>187 - should be truncated to terminate at Bt Panjang Int</p>
              <p>856 - in my opinion, this service should not terminate at
              Woodlands Interchange, should just do a loop at Marsiling station,
              eg. Woodlands centre road, Ave 3, St 11, St 13, centre road</p>
              <p>858 - need not touch</p>
              <p>900, 901, 902, 903, 911, 912, 913 - need not touch</p>
              <p>925 - in my opinion, 925 doesn't need to go to Woodlands, from
              Sungei Kadut, it can just do a loop at Kranji MRT and U-turn
              back to CCK</p>
              <p>926 - need not touch</p>
              <p>950 - need not touch</p>
              <p>960 - duplicates 961 from Bt Panjang to Woodlands. In my opinion
              it can just be truncated to terminate at Bt Panjang Int, doesn't
              need to go to Woodlands</p>
              <p>961 - need not touch</p>
              <p>962 - need not touch</p>
              <p>963 - need not touch</p>
              <p>964 - Should start from Sembawang Int and plies Woodlands
              Loop</p>
              <p>965 - Should start from Sembawang Int since we already have 969
              from Woodlands to Gambas Ave</p>
              <p>966 - should be truncated to terminate at Bt Panjang
              Int</p>
              <p>969 - need not touch</p>
              <p>By making the above amendments, we can reduce 8 bus services at
              woodlands interchange to alleviate congestion at the
              interchange</p>
              <p>We don't need so many buses in Woodlands as there are already 3
              MRT stations serving </p>

              <p>You know the standard practice when there are 2 buses waiting to queue at a saw-tooth berth. The 2nd BC usually keeps a gap between his bus and the front one so that a bus that wishes to leave the preceding berth can do so.</p>
              <p>And what happens? The rear gets choked.</p>

              <p>I used to live at Woodlands before the bendy mess descended.</p>
              <p>I still miss Woodlands.</p>
              <p>But not the current mess at WRI.</p>
              <p>It wasn't like this up till the late 90s.</p>
              <p>Things became horrible from the early 2000s. Its no coincidence that this was when the bendy fleet expanded rapidly.</p>

              <p>You know the standard practice when there are 2 buses waiting to
              queue at a saw-tooth berth. The 2nd BC usually keeps a gap between
              his bus and the front one so that a bus that wishes to leave the
              preceding berth can do so.</p>
              <p>And what happens? The rear gets choked.</p>
              <p>And if the bus moves forward? The preceding berth gets
              choked.</p>
              <p>Dillemma dillemma dillema.</p>
              <p>And I have seen BCs who are in a rush TSK loudly when they get
              stuck behind a bendy in the bus-bay.</p>
              <p>Simply irritating.</p>

              </p><p>"Longer articulated buses could not turn around at certain stations such as Bishan and Ang Mo Kio" doesn't mean it's the end? That's only for train disruption, not for services issues? Plus, if they said that longer articulated buses couldn't turn, why don't they deploy double decks out after the major breakdown(during the CCL etc.)? </p>
