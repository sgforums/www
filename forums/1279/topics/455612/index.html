              <p>With QOC of bus services to be reviewed every year, bus service frequncies have to be improved time to time. By then, full single deckers are able to fulfill such quota instead. What is the point of having good frequencies with bendy buses and having them running half empty and yet takes up so much space in the bus stop and lanes?</p>
              <p>Even SMRT now is using more single deckers to improve the frequencies for some trunk services and removing more bendy buses from them. And there is only a handful of bus services with low height constraints.</p>
              <p>Using bendy buses doesn't mean they are fully utilised. Sometimes people don't even want to move into the trailer section of the bus. It defeats the purpose anyway and not practical as it waste road space running a half full bus. Your logic that people won't move up the upper deck for short trips is not true. Many commuters board the upper deck of Jurong West feeders. Even now 291 I can see more people moving up.</p>

              <p>Using bendy buses doesn't mean they are fully utilised.
              Sometimes people don't even want to move into the trailer section
              of the bus. It defeats the purpose anyway and not practical as it
              waste road space running a half full bus. Your logic that people
              won't move up the upper deck for short trips is not true. Many
              commuters board the upper deck of Jurong West feeders. Even now 291
              I can see more people moving up.</p>

              <p>I think the current amount of bendies is enough or even more than enough already. Wait till the MK1 bendies retire first then I will hope to see the either the Volvo 7900 Artic, MB Citaro G, MAN Lion City G or Scania OmniLink Bendy.</p>
