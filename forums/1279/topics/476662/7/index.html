              <p>Hu Ching Road is missing from the 2013 URA Draft Master Plan.
                  The site where the roadside bus terminal is in now is meant for
                  Education Institution.</p>
              <p>In future, bus route 49 is either going to be extended to Boon
                  Lay Bus Interchange/Joo Koon Bus Interchange (and loop at Taman
                  Jurong), or extended to Jurong East Bus Interchange/Joo Koon Bus
                  Interchange (and loop at Jurong West Street 42 and 41).</p>
              <p>The bus interchange the bus route shares its buses with is
                  <em>likely</em> the one (or the one which will have bus routes
                  transferred to by June 2015) it would be extended to in future.</p>

              <p>dun think so much.... the plan is for the future (10-15 years later) and this is just a PLAN!!!..</p>
              <p>and if you go and look at the 2008 master plan (which is finalized as of 5th Nov 2013), there is ALSO NO HU CHING ROAD in the plan... so why Hu Ching Road is still around NOW????????? </p>
              <p>nothing have been finalised... i really dun understand why ppl want to go and think so much for what? keep thinking of the terminal gone, thinking of amendment of this route and that route...  as long as the buses come on time and you can board can already.. why bother so much??? </p>

              <p>Actually, is it possible to just go to the Taman Jurong Bus

              <p>yes... you can even go into SBS Transit HQ at braddell road.. maybe they can give you all the information you need..  maybe they can even give you the user id/password to their computer system to access whatever information you need? </p>

              <p><br>Agreed. The same thing happened with 116 which started with 7 buses and then became 6 buses. For sv 50, it started with 10 DDs, 6 Citaros (if I am not wrong) and today fleet is 9 DDs, 5 Citaros - so totally just 14 buses from initial deployment of 16 buses.</p>

              <p>Haven't observed much to conclude yet. But the loading on sv 334 still seems very strong. At Jurong Int yesterday at around 6pm, observed 7 buses. Each bus took between 75 and 88 pax. When KUB came, 66 pax entered bus and counted 14 still in queue. Buses seemed to come at regular intervals between 06-08 mins, so there were not huge gaps in between and loading seemed evenly distributed.</p>
              <p>I am sure as the bus went to Jurong East Central, would have taken another 10-12 pax. So overall can assume 90+ pax on each bus even after launch of sv 49. This could mean that not many people have still moved to Lakeside and changed habit. could also mean, a lot of people could be alighting at Boon Lay Way and Jurong East/West Ave.</p>

              <p>Today PM peak, I was at Lakeside MRT. Observed sv 98 came at a very poor frequency of 18-20 mins. 98A came after 09 mins and 25 mins every time. So the difference in frequency was 09 mins and 16 mins respectively for two 98A buses.</p>
              <p>Sv 49 on the contrary came every 12 mins. Not many pax on board. Very few people alighting too. It did have around 18-20 pax board the bus though. The 4 buses I observed all came 2, 2, 4, 5 mins after 98, 98, 98A, 98 respectively. So fewer pax on stop anyway when sv 49 arrived.</p>

              <p>I think in due course people from St 42 will convert to sv 49. Also from st 41, the stop is right outside MRT and don't have to cross bridge - so see people moving to sv 49 here also.</p>
              <p>On the way back, since it is longer time to reach st 41, I think people will take 335 instead. Also people might prefer to alight at Jurong East, get some groceries done and take 334 as Lakeside is not equipped.</p>
              <p>I saw 334 loading still very high at Jurong East.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Earlier AM peak, 334 used to already come crowded from st 42 and people would not be able to board at Jurong East Ave 1, Polytechnic etc. People here rely more on 98, 99 to get to Jurong East. Now with 49, I foresee 334 getting most of its crowd from Jurong West/East Ave.</p></div>
