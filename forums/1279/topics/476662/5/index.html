              <p>If many prefixes were used on one number just because of some similarities in some routes (in this case, 49, 98 and 98M having the same route from Jurong West St 51 to Corporation Dr), it may cause confusion to passengers...in fact, nearly half a century ago, Singapore bus network uses prefixes for different routes with some similarities, but it didn't turn out well back then due to the point I stated above from what I heard...</p>

              <p>This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brilliant idea</span> to promote a new bus route. They should have kept it until Monday, so that the working people who might not head out on weekend could also get more aware. After all, it is about changing people's pattern. Those who are used to taking 334 for years to Jurong, now have to make a change, which initially is always difficult because you are so comfortable with your regular journey.</p>

              <p>Yes, agreed and you are expressing the same sentiments as mine. I don't see why a route number is a big deal. If people wonder what this route number is, they should find out. If they still don't know after a week or two, they are dumb. If you renumber the route as 98X, people will get more confused. Someone from Lakeside might take the bus to Jurong Green CC thinking it parallel 98 route, when it does not.</p>

              <p>Wondering if the reason why they give out this free bus service is also because some guy forgot to program the coding for the ezlink card fares such that they will charge us accordingly, and this would be a brilliant move to cover up and to measure distances along the way because the man was never told to do so, not until today or something. But regardless, this is possibly to raise awareness and get everyone at Taman Jurong (which includes me) to come on down and go to Jurong East free of charge (and vice versa), though yes, keeping it until Monday and possibly Tuesday would be a better move since the weekend is not a working day, not for about 90% of the people.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">On the assumption that new BSEP bus routes are numbered after the existing type of bus routes in the area they are introduced, the following numbers are available for the BSEP trunk routes in Jurong East, Jurong West and the Industrial areas. (based on the bus routes in Jurong East Bus Interchange and Boon Lay Bus Interchange):</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 4X series - 41, 44,46,47,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">49</span></strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 6X series -  68.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 7X series - 71.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 10X series - 104,108.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 14X series - 140, 144, 146, 148, 149.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 15X series - 150, 152.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 16X series - 164.</span></p>
              <p><span>In the 24X series - 244,245,247,248. <em>However, 244 and 245 may be reserved for future feeder services in Jurong West.</em></span></p>
              <p><span>In the 25X series - 250, 253, 256, 258, 259.</span></p>
              <p><em>*<span style="line-height: 1.231;">10-19,20-29,30-39,50-59,90-99,170-179,180-189,190-200 are already full.</span></em></p>
              <p>After observing the '2-99' list at <a style="line-height: 1.231;" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_Singapore#900.E2.80.93985">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_Singapore#900.E2.80.93985</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> , it seems to me that this bus route '49' could have been numbered along with the 5X series(51,52) from Jurong East. numbers 40-59 seem to be dominated in the East area. Maybe this route 49 is numbered so that the two trunk routes at Jurong East would look more appropriate in 51 and 52, along with 48 which goes to Buona Vista. (<em>spreading</em> from east to west)</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, since we are at this topic, l<span style="line-height: 1.231;">et’s take a look at how the bus routes are numbered at other countries/cities.</span></p>
              <p><span>Korea: 1<sup>st</sup>/1<sup>st</sup> few numbers according to the places they originate/serve/terminate, last/last few numbers is their “serial number” (similar to a student’s index number in his form class).[</span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" rel="nofollow" href="http://visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=257573">http://visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=257573</a>]</p>
              <p><span>Sydney: Each area/region has its own set of numbers for the bus routes there.

              <p><span>Beijing: routes are assigned numbers based on which zone of the city they run in or what kind of routes they are.

              <p>It seems to me that our bus numbering system is similar to that in Beijing and Sydney.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>If you look at the numbers pointed out, I would rule out 41-47 (no connection)</p>
              <p>68 should be for future Tampines - Little India service (when it splits from 67)</p>
              <p>71 should be for Jurong - Penjuru Crescent service</p>
              <p>104, 108 - Could well be NEL services</p>
              <p>140 - 149 seem more appropriate for Toa Payoh - AMK services</p>
              <p>150, 152 - these are east west services like 151, 154, 156, 157</p>
              <p>164 - this is hybrid, but this should be reserved for future Woodlands - SBST area service</p>
              <p>So which one is a good service number to give?</p>
              <p>The only thing they could have possibly done is numbered the service 332 to have synergies with 334, 335 but I think the 33x series is for Jurong Int feeders and so they must have not given</p>
              <p>Likewise the 24x series of feeders is for Boon Lay Interchange, so they must have refrained from giving 244 or 245 as the number as well.</p>

              <p>This BSEP bus route is a Trunk service - confirmed by <a title="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/transport/trpt_bus_timetable.aspx" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/transport/trpt_bus_timetable.aspx">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/transport/trpt_bus_timetable.aspx</a> . Hence, yes, the BSEP bus route cannot be given a number in the 33X series as that series is for Feeder services originating from Jurong East Bus Interchange.               </p>
              <p>Whereas for the number 49 given to this BSEP bus route, I think it is now very obvious that <strong>it may be derived from dividing 98 by two</strong>, since this BSEP bus route serves the areas along <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong West Avenue 1</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong West Street 51</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Boon Lay Way-Corporation Road</span> (this section is an inevitable duplication) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corporation Drive</span> (the areas along Yuan Ching Road) – <em>to some extent</em> being a <strong>complementary to bus route 98</strong>. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>I think we have been on this for a bit too long already. Let’s move on and discuss other things, shall we? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As I have predicted earlier, the frequency is indeed similar to the other BSEP bus routes when they were initially launched: 10-15 minutes. Hence, the number of buses deployed to this BSEP bus route is indeed (very likely to be) what I have predicted: in the range of 5-7 buses. </span></p>
