              <p><br>I don't consider hgdep far from bndep, it is slightly further away compared to bndep.</p>
              <p>33 25 26 32 7 9 197 66 were hgdep services. Since these services are under Bedok route group, and bedok route group is under the East district, it is very natural that these services goes under the East control. Excpet for 87 which is under Sengkang route group control.</p>
              <p>Some services were original bndep services before hgdep control and back to bndep, such as 32 66.</p>
              <p>There was a year when 32 (bndep) and 197 (hgdep) swap control, then in late 2003 197 (bndep) was "redeemed" back to hgdep in exchange for 9 (hgdep). Which means 197 was under bndep &amp; hgdep twice each.</p>
              <p>2004, 33 came to bndep</p>
              <p>2005, 7 32 66 came to bndep</p>
              <p>2008, 197 return to bndep.</p>
              <p>Erm, anyone knows went 87 was revert to full hgdep control? bndep had a share of 87.</p>

              <p><br>I think the event is led by the desire to show displeasure to the government. And it happen so that this bus fare hike comes into the scene and it becomes an issue blown up with malicious intent to exploit on the issue and stage the first step towards an anti-government movement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my opinion, the movement is made because the members wanted to show their displeasure towards the 'government for implementing unpopular measures'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mirrored by the trade unions in the west, many of these trade unions went on strike to get their message across. Unknowingly there are selfish higher agendas creeping within the ranks of the union leaders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I think is that the online citizen does not have the intention of dealing with the problem. But rather to 'show displeasure' to the government for excluding their rights to policy making.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The public transport industry becomes a scapegoat for their twisted agenda.</p>

              <p>I think the fare hike is more or less justified for SBS Transit, but as I have always said, they still have much room to improve on. At best, it's only 75% justified for them.</p>
              <p>As for SMRT, not a single bit. Not a single freaking bit do they deserve charging us more for their "service" in the last five years; in fact I can give so may reasons against their fare hikes that it will result in a wall of text so high it carasses the stars.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day still, if we the commuters want many of the problems with our public transit system resolved, they themselves must be aware of their own ugly behaviour...</p>

              <p>Small comment today.</p>
              <p>SMB6U had a dirty back lols...</p>
              <p>Aunty who was driving it was quite talkative (to herself), perhaps she is happy today.</p>
              <p>When reversing from the interchange berth, she started talking, apparently to no one, 'Cannot reverse leh!', 'Wah late liao!'.</p>
              <p>Exiting the interchange, she made sure to avoid the hump, sounded the horn (for everyone to give way), and ran the amber light.</p>
              <p>The bus reached the first intersection, she shouted at the s189 Indian BC driving 544E (without opening the small window) who stared at her bus, '189 also got what!'. Sound seemed to travel though windows and walls.</p>
              <p>Then one old lady passenger commented that she thought that it was a s174 bus. Aunty said 'New bus new bus, 77 also have!'.</p>
              <p>When someone accidentally pressed on the wheelchair bell, she shouted 'Don't press on the bell arh! Only for wheelchair passenger arh!'</p>
