            <div class='col-md body'>My stories goes way back in 1997. I was a 4 year-old kid and I luv buses eversince. I was first introduced to each bus model slowly. The first time I rode a Volvo B10M DM3500 while it was new in 98' was on Service 30.(My saturday clases are at Bedok and living in old Jurong West Estension) My perm bus from Jurong West was the late Leyland Olympian.<br><br>My first Habit ride was in 2000, my first Volvo B10BLE ride was in 2000, my first time spotting good old SBS998Y was in 2001, my first time spotting SBS997A is in 2003 and SBS999U in 2004. I liked them all. But time didn't gave me chance.<br><br>I started to find out my permbuses. Their history, and what happened.<br>Look at me, now. An independent 14 year-old, filled with courage, skill, guts and peservearence. Although I'm a bully victim in school and being a loud shouter in class, I have a special fondness for buses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever since I was K2. I started looking from the tyres and then to the rims. As I get older I look at the body. Then my bus loving started when I was P2. During my visits to my grandma's house my timing always coincides with SBS997A.  Then that special bus aroused me more to this hobby. Apparently I used to be extra slow on riding new buses. It took me till 2001 when I took the Box bendy, and apparently I haven't took any B9TLs yet, suggestinbg how slow I am actually. I long knew which buses were svc. 900 perms, from the days where TIB726Y started on 900 till TIB1049L joined 900.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, it dated back to almost 8 years ago when I was just a Primary 1 kid. I used to take the school bus (I can still remember it's rego - CB 4219P, and it's NAC) from my school to home everyday. I take school buses everyday until I was Primary 6 when I then stopped taking the school bus.<br><br>I could still remember my first ride (not sure when my first bus ride really is but this is what I only know) on the then Singapore Bus Services Bus, SBS 3685E on Service 225W. This happened when I was in Primary 1 and I had to be sent home because of fever, so I took this bus with my mom.<br><br>In Primary 6, as I mentioned, I stopped taking the school bus, but the public transport instead. First, it would not come obvious, but as the days go by, I noticed a bus which is quite familiar and that I see it everyday. The bus is SBS 3721J, and it may be how it became my favourite bus.<br><br>I started taking down bus regos when I was a to-be-Secondary-1 student. Last year, during New Year's Day, I was learning how to take the bus and the MRT to my school and back when I happened to be on SBS 0933J on Service 18. I said, "Nice rego." while on the bus.<br><br>In the same year in year 2006, I was searching for more on buses (was searching for SBST articulated buses, which had been sold to NZ) when I came across this forum. I joined and soon, I opened up more accounts on other bus forums.<br><br>And this was how I became a bus fan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like to see public buses SBS and TIBS buses on the streets since 4 yrs old. It was at my grandma's hse. As my grandma's hse is near the bus stop, there were buses passing by all day long. I always ran to a spot where I could see the buses clearly, the bus service number, the sound of the buses since the door of my grandma's hse was open and I was bored.<br>In addition, it was at my grandma's hse when I read Transitlink Bus guide in the year 1992. The front cover showed a Lakeside MRT station with a 154 dd bus in the front at the bus stop. If I didn't rmb wrongly, there was a 187 bus behind 154. I read it when I visited my grandma's hse weekly. Unknowingly, somehow the routes got into my mind.<br><br>Later on, I chanced upon sg bus forums, which made me realised that the difference between bus spotting fan and bus route lover. I am not the type who is interested in the type of sound engine, gearboxes inside the bus. However, I focus on different kinds of bus routes especially trunk services cos they r simply cool, long and pass by many towns. Anyway, thanks to sg bus forums.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me:<br><br>It was due to taking Sv 82 to my grandmother's house since I was young. Remembered taking those MK3 on Sv 82 when I was going home and was packed with people due to the Thais who boarded at Golden Mile Complex and going to Punggol. When it was under TIBS rule, took a few of the bus models like Scania ELBO(NAC) etc. The most interesting was the box bendy. The first time I took it when I was going home and saw two Sv 82 buses at the bus stop. One was a Scania(with not many people), the other was the box bendy(crowded) and decided to take the box bendy which was quite fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Rego: TIB853M<br>Advertisement: Cyberway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Different types of bus will give out different bus sounds. Besides, these sounds are unique to SBST and SMRT buses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My old house faces the main road in Bishan. Everytime when a bus wiss its way out of the bus stop i would run to the living room window to see what bus was it, sometimes also seeing the rego. As i do more spotting from my house window, S56 LAs became 9030E 9142R 9144K 9148A 9150S 9668R <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> (ya 9668 went bndep one big round and came back to amdep on former perm) S410 NAC Merz became NAC Scania (or vice versa?) I've see UDs zooming past Bishan Rd with no freaking idea was service it was on (i now know its S13). The rest of the services were just WA and DM Merz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Moved to Toa Payoh 10 years ago, Merz became Scanias and a whole lot of other stuff due to the variety of models at Toa Payoh Int. Started to spot my S238 NAC Scania perm fleet for a start then went the other TPY feeders. Noticed the transition from the old int to the temp and back to the current one. Toa Payoh Feeders from NAC Scania to partial Merc fleet (NAC conversion period) to OAC Scania to O405s. S159 from full Merc fleet to partial DM3500 fleet (2836-283<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, S163 from TIBS days to SBST CAC Merz fleet, 88 from NAC Scanias to batch 3 VOs, S31 from VO2x to Mk3s, S90/S157 from LO2x to NAC Scania/LO3x.. erm the rest basically didnt change much <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Chanced this place thru a friend in late 2003 and understood what does a 'bus spotter' mean. What does it mean to catch a cameo, knowing what's the cameo that kinda stuff.<br><br>Throughout the years i collected services guides as they seem something different from the TL guides.<br><br>I see from the earlier posts that some of you like buses of a certain aspect - service guides, models, technical stuff etc... For me i'm into scheduling and deployment. Very dynamic when it comes to xovers as you never fail to see/understand how sbst (more into sbst than smrt) is able to pluck the bus from a parent service and do xover to another service.<br><br>Say for example the premium services. Judging from operating hours its quite obvious its done by a xover bus. Checking the service it xover from is the more interesting part. At first I thought its a feeder bus as the timing kinda matches certain lower-than-peak demand for some services. They used trunk services instead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Then sometimes you see me commenting fleet changes in the redeployment thread before the actual day is because i did the online timetables in advance. One example is the S48 fleet addition from this Sunday.<br><br>Very interesting and unique hobby.
