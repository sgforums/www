Awaiting for Svc 853 to come at S'goon Central. Here it came, TIB 946D, the last Lance 245 in TIBS. The driver drove quite ok and it did arrive at the time I expected. 1410 hrs, I reached Yishun interchange. Rushed to TIBS Shop and got my Bendy bus Ez-Link Card. At 1432 hrs, I got onto Svc 965 to Sengkang. However, it WASN'T A MB O405 VOLGREN!!! Haiz. Blame on my luck of not getting a MB O405 volgren. Instead, I got onto a MB O405 Hispano (TIB 713). I liked the driver speeding on SLE n TPE!!! FULL SPEED ALONG the Expressways! Wah hoo! 1452 hrs, I reached Sengkang Interchange to wait for 9888Y. Sadly, after waiting for about 40 mins, it didn't appear within my expectation. It might have gone b4 me. Haiz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . Then, I got onto SBS9379A of Svc 85 to Sin Lim Square to get something. Guess what? The driver drove SO SLOW as if the bus was an OLD Volkswagen Beetle!!!! He could only reach the maximum of the 3rd or 4th gear at about 55-60 km/h!! I felt like vomitting blood at that time. As a result, I got off the bloody bus at Bendemeer Rd and transfer to Svc 23. That driver was so gr8! He did some speeding along Jln Besar. After getting what i supposed to get from Sim Lim Square, I went to Selegie Rd to take any bus home. Feeling thirsty, I got myself a can of coke. As I pulled of the ring and drank the coke, I saw Svc 56 (SBS9000S)! Immediately, I alomost got choked! Since when 9000S became a permanent bus on Svc 56?! When the bus left, it did really sound like an old grandfather! Finally, I got onto TIB 1083L (svc 106) to get home. The driver was rather good in his driving skills! I thought that he might be in his 20's. (such a young driver..)</div>
