              <p>From today onwards to the end of the year, the whole schedule is following the holiday week schedule. So it is totally different timings compared to normal weekday schedule &amp; holiday week schedule. I've said that in the bus timetable thread. So therefore, holiday slot for SBS8030L is 1416 departing at BNL. But even if you all camped at there earlier, the bus won't appear as the bus is currently in coma.</p>

              <p>for my ride, the driver preferred to kickdown and drag it at the 3rd gear, probably due to the low rpm and output just to maintain his pace along his route. but i still prefer how the gearbox originally worked.</p>

              <p><br>lol you are welcome.Yea i think my bus was above 60km/h.The way it was chionging didnt feel like it was on 60.Haha.When the bus was going on the flyover near BRBP,i just turned my head automatically to look at the workshop.First i saw a B9 paked outside the workshop.Then as i looked on and on,i saw 8030 parked infront of the B9.Its really easy to spot 8030 cuz it is parked outside the workshop and more nearer to the CTE.So when u are in the CTE coming from the city and passing by BRBP,just look to your left quickly and u should be able to see 8030.But if u are on a car on the fast lane,i doubt u can see it.Haha.Since i was on a bus and on the leftmost lane,it was more easier to spot it.And i am not sure if it is still at the same spot or has moved to the inside of the workshop.<br><br>Btw i think it's a real pity for 8030.Constantly have to be sent to BRBP for frequent problems.It just only came back and it's back to the shadows of the workshop again.No offence but i think sl really heck care and killed the bus even after it got fixed and came back thus sending it back to BRBP again.I really hope that this time after it comes back,it would be given to some other depot than sl cuz i think sl really can't maintain the bus.It would be really more better in other depots.:)</p>
