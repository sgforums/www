              <p>Starting next Monday, Premium 537 &amp; 540 will be withdrawn.</p>
              <p>At the same time, City Shopper 551, 575, 577 &amp; 580 will be withdrawn too.</p>
              <p>Service 816 (CT28) will be converted to a festive season service from that day too.</p>
              <p>These withdrawals and conversion are supposedly due to low demand.</p>

              <p><br>You just never listen to what i said earlier. Once upon a time the 3 S575 buses belong to S9. They operated as 2 split shifts &amp; 1 full day. Then they went over to S575 with 2 doing T shift and 1 on full day. There was a net reduction of 1 bus during PM peak as 1 of the S575 buses does not do S9 during PM peak. However it was able to cope with the loading. Now, when S575 is withdrawn, all 3 buses should go back to S9. You simply underestimate how crowded S9 can get during AM Peak.</p>

              <p><br> You just never listen to what i said earlier. Once upon a time the
              3 S575 buses belong to S9. They operated as 2 split shifts
              &amp; 1 full day. Then they went over to S575 with 2 doing T
              shift and 1 on full day. There was a net reduction of 1 bus during
              PM peak as 1 of the S575 buses does not do S9 during PM peak.
              However it was able to cope with the loading. Now, when S575 is
              withdrawn, all 3 buses should go back to S9. You simply
              underestimate how crowded S9 can get during AM Peak.</p>

              <p><br>Supplementary service rationalisation. Let me give you a timeline.</p>
              <p>Before Dec 07, 8 and 28 does not have any xover. 37 has xover from 38 and 293.</p>
              <p>On 3 Dec 07, 37 add split shift while 293 reduce split shift. At the same time 293 xovers are gone, retaining the 38 xovers. From the micro view this solves the 293 buses from doing 37 for most of the duty to doing 37 as split shift.</p>
              <p>In the planning of 579, I believe the staff didnt take into consideration of the demand patterns of 37 as well as the operating hours of 579. If not if they change it the driver allocation would be somewhat messy as the new S37 split shift drivers would learn 579. Hence when 579 was introduced on 15 Dec 07, the supplementary trips went to S8 and S28 instead.</p>
              <p>As time evolved, to make things neater for Tampines Route Group as well as the supplementary trips and drivers, it would be better to allocate all the supplementary trips for 579 to one service instead of 2 services if resources are justified.</p>
              <p>Hence on 26 May 08, they add 1 split shift each for S8 and S28, replacing 2 supplementary buses each. There's an overall deduction of buses (and of course drivers) of S37 (3 buses), 8/28 (1 bus each) and 38 (1 bus). To top it off, S38 had its supplementary trips removed and fleet size cut. S37's original 2 buses can be converted into DD to solve the demand crunch during peak as well as off peak hours.</p>
