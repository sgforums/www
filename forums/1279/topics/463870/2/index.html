              SMRT launches new parallel bus service linking Choa Chu Kang to CBD
              
              SINGAPORE â€”SMRT has announced a new parallel bus service, 982E, that will link Choa Chu Kang to the Central Business District (CBD) from March 18.
              
              The new bus service will run twice in the morning from Choa Chu Kang Avenue 5 at 7.40am and 7.50am, and twice at the evening rush hour at 18.15pm and 18.30pm from the Central Boulevard. The service will operate only on weekdays, and will not be plying the route on weekends and public holidays.
              
              Fares for express services will apply to the 982E bus service, and the new service will have fewer bus stops and will use the Ayer Rajah Expressway to shorten travelling time between Choa Chu Kang and the CBD.
              
              The 982E service is the eighth to be unveiled under the Land Transport Authorityâ€™s Bus Service Enhancement Programme.
