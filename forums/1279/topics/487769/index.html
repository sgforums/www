              <p>I wanted to create a new thread for the future Jurong East Bus Interchange. However, considering there is very little information about it and not many people are talking about it, I doubt it would last. </p>
                  <p>There will be new bus interchanges (eg. Joo Koon, Woodlands, Bukit Panjang) and new bus terminals (eg. Tuas) opening in the next few months and years. Along the way, we may hear news of more new and future bus interchanges.</p>
                  <p>There have been several standalone threads about new bus interchanges, but all of them are usually inactive.</p>
                  <p>It may be better to have one single thread for every new and future bus interchange. While it enables us to actively discuss about new and future bus interchanges, it would also enable us to even discuss possible (imaginary) new bus interchanges in the future.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I created this thread.</p>

              <p>Recently, I went onto OneMap.sg and looked at the map of Jurong East MRT Station. I noticed the new road "Gateway Drive" is now included in the map. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">What's more interesting is that the development "Jurong East Bus Interchange" is also in the map.</span></p>
                  <p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10628447_1553257644952577_6891543842973866320_n.jpg?oh=34e0f5250cc2d707cb23e2feaf755ece&amp;oe=554A86BF&amp;__gda__=1435174528_6cb202246bed82b1080d40ba320ab310" alt="" width="960" height="463"></p>
                  <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When I went to see the land lot, I noticed some unknown layout, which I believe is the layout of the future Jurong East Bus Interchange.</span></p>
                  <p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10407351_1553258108285864_3550223075645666402_n.jpg?oh=b30b6edce88e112661953a98e444de26&amp;oe=554ECD50&amp;__gda__=1434437888_08a64c477ced021527e3354779ac065a" alt="" width="960" height="463"></p>
                  <p>At first I thought it was the layout of the original interchange, but it does not seem like it. Anyway, if that is indeed the plot of land that would contain the Integrated development with Jurong East Bus Interchange, I think</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>- there will be end-on berths underneath the MRT tracks.</li>
                  <li>-depending on how the plots are drawn, we may see either </li>
                  <li>* an interchange that occupies most of level one of the integrated development.</li>
                  <li>* an interchange with two storeys - level one and basement one.</li>
                  <li>* etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The issue with Jurong East Bus Interchange and the Integrated development is the MRT tracks. One way to overcome this is to be very tall (around twenty floors) and construct a "bridge" building on top of the MRT tracks. I doubt being very deep (to go under the MRT viaduct) is feasible (financially for the developer and safety for the MRT).</p>
                  <p>Anyway, it was mentioned before that the authorities want to develop Jurong East ITH by year 2020. By the fact that until now there is still no land sales of integrated development around Jurong East MRT Station, I think we may have to wait until around year 2025 or year 2030 before the new Jurong East Bus Interchange is constructed.</p>

              <p>Few years ago, they say there will be ITHs at "<a href="http://www.mnd.gov.sg/landuseplan/e-book/files/assets/basic-html/page55.html">Bedok, Bukit Panjang, Hougang,Joo Koon, Jurong East, Marina South and Yishun in the next ten years.</a>" <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bedok is completed, Joo Koon is coming soon and Bukit Panjang is under construction. Yishun is next. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Still no news about Hougang and Marina South. Jurong East they got say before, but no more news ever since a few years ago.</span></p>
              <p>Then there is Bidadari and Tampines North. A new terminal at Tuas Link was mentioned before somewhere, although not directly from the authorities. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Then there is bus interchange extension at Sengkang and Tampines. New bus terminal at Changi, New roadside terminal at Taman Jurong, etc. </span><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">With the Downtown Line and Thomson East Coast Line, somehow, I think it is predicted that the demand for bus services will eventually drop and there is no need for so many buses in the future. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Apparently, there is not yet a definite plan for future bus interchanges.</span></p>
              <p>This thread is not totally about the individual future bus interchanges. It is more inclined towards the future of public bus networks as a whole, with bus interchanges and terminals being points where routes converge.</p>

              <p>actually, is there really a need for long-distance bus services, when the MRT is a much better alternative, and there are express and city direct services?</p>
              <p>would it be better to have BRT-like routes which span across the island and only serve a limited number of bus stops (a few kilometres apart) across towns?</p>
              <p>instead of having bus interchanges and terminals, would it be better to have major bus stops, with buses supplied from depots and bus parks?</p>
              <p>a few BRT-like routes may be able to replace many long-distance routes.</p>
              <p>with that in mind, is there really a need for bus interchanges? What exactly is the purpose of a bus interchange? Is it just for buses to bring people to MRT stations? If so, why not just have feeder bus routes?</p>
              <p>just some food for thought.</p>
              <p>that said, the moderators may want to re-name this thread to "The future of public bus services", or something along that line.</p>

              <p>since land is already so limited, why not relocate the bus interchange to somewhere away from the town centre where the MRT station is? In place of it, we can have a (few) large bus stops to have many bus services calling at it. Or have a facility that has only sawtooth bus boarding berths. </p>
              <p>well, anything is possible.</p>

              <p>Future bus interchanges will still be possible because the population will be increasing and 6.9 million is the target. There is already talks into 10 million after that.</p>
              <p>However these bus interchanges will not be very big if they are not within the town center of residential area,  since they serve as secondary interchanges to the main ones in the town centers. E.g. Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang. </p>
              <p>BRT or rather put it as the guided bus system, is only feasible in Singapore for short stretches of busy roads that can separate public bus traffic than normal traffic.  Any BRT that is too long might only be converted to a rail line instead.</p>

              <p>Bukit Panjang they say is because of diversion of a canal nearby. I do not know how this affects the progress. Anyway, the commercial and the condominium also not constructed yet. Based on Boon Lay, Clementi, Bedok, usually the bus interchange will only open around twelve months after the commercial and condominium developments open.</p>
              <p>If the commercial and condominium opens in June 2016, bus interchange may open in June 2017.</p>
              <p>Well, a short-term solution is to construct a proper temporary bus interchange next to a Downtown Line MRT Station. Maybe the design can less costly a little bit, since only use for around one to two years. Maybe can just concrete with some sheltered tents. I think like that also can.</p>

              <p>Bukit Panjang they say is because of diversion of a canal
              nearby. I do not know how this affects the progress. Anyway, the
              commercial and the condominium also not constructed yet. Based on
              Boon Lay, Clementi, Bedok, usually the bus interchange will only
              open around twelve months after the commercial and condominium
              developments open.</p>
              <p>If the commercial and condominium opens in June 2016, bus
              interchange may open in June 2017.</p>
              <p>Well, a short-term solution is to construct a proper temporary
              bus interchange next to a Downtown Line MRT Station. Maybe the
              design can less costly a little bit, since only use for around one
              to two years. Maybe can just concrete with some sheltered tents. I
              think like that also can.</p>

              <p>The excuse of the canal diversion doesnt sounds right. I read before that engineers also need to divert the canal in order to open additional entrance/exit for the Bt Panjang MRT station at Senja road Blk 604 that area. Unless they said the entrance/exit also not ready until 2017.</p>
