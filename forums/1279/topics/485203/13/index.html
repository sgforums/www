              <p>I'm quoting this post from a few days ago but anyway:<br><br>Did anyone really think that Sv 169 will get DDs? Sv 169 is like the unoffical "Army Express". Go and count the number of army camps &amp; key protected places it passes by. (Khatib Camp, Dieppe Barracks, Nee Soon Camp, Sembawang Air Base, Sembawang Camp, Sembawang Wharves, Sembawang Shipyard).<br><br>If they really put DDs on Sv 169, don't you think that the authorities would think that this would allow random people to happily spy into what goes on in the camps because of the elevated height? And in turn pose as a security threat?</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that Sv 169 will never get DDs, but I don't think it will happen anytime soon on their priority list.</p>
              <p>I do agree that Sv 169 needs much more Bendies though in the fleet at the frequencies they're running now during Peak. The Rigids just can't cope that well unless they're bunched up together. </p>

              <p>169 had DDs previously. Not sure if spying would be so easy from just a heightened level of DD.</p>
              <p>But thank you for agreeing that 169 does need more bendies. It has a very unique route with very little parallel options to offer unlike many other services like 167, 854, 980 which I am ok if get DDs later as there are other options.</p>
              <p>169 has bi-directional high-loading, and it really shocks me that the bus is always packed to door and there is no real effort taken to correct the situation.</p>

              <p>Dk why...waited for 169 arond 2:40pm @ RP and there were 2-3 buses flying pass me(opposite) to Woodland Int..but the frequency towards AMK wasn't bad.</p>
              <p>I think they somewhat need to adjust the timetable, by putting more buses from 4-10pm..</p>

              <p>The security issue might be the thing hampering the possibility of Sv 169 getting future DDs. It's not a big issue, but to those concerned about the security, the availability to even glimpse more into the camps might concern them. <br><br>I agree with the lack of options for those travelling along Sv 169's route. The thing with Sv 169, is that the crowds really only build up during the two specific Peak-Hour periods and the extended hours before &amp; after that. In the middle of the day, the buses are usually max half-full for most of the trip from both directions. It needs more adds in the Peak Hours than full-day Bendies imo.</p>

              <p>No la.</p>
              <p>I tell you the real reason why 169 no more bendies.</p>
              <p>Cos everytime the SBS DDs passed by last time, they always get chased by those chao recruits who could see the tall-tall bus: OMIGOSH NINJA VAN</p>
              <p>and I tell you, despo boys can out-run commando mozzies. That scared the bus drivers and they complained to LTA. So no more DD for 169. So sad right</p>
              <p>Don't believe, you go serve nation, take IPPT at Khatib, ask the PTI laojiao (not the CISCO ones).<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              True, bro. However, its route was amended in 1996 when WDL extension opened for service. Back then it didn't serve KTB camp.
              
              HQ Guards, ADSD and SBAB served by 167 &amp; 980, so no DD fleet for them too?
              
              Route 2 passes by Selarang Barracks, so why has it got 99% DD fleet? Because it falls under SBS contract area?
