            <div class='col-md body'><p>To be honest,  i would not support early withdrawal of TIBs era bendys. They still work reasonably well so let them serve their full 17years, no extension. Their suspension beat the A22s flat. Our busfares are already skyrocketting, the last thing I would want to see is wasted resources. The 201 ADLs should be used on services that desperately need high capacity buses and dont have/not good for bendys. The other services, just use the old era bendys first - when time comes to replace with new buses, replace with new DDs from a next production batch. We have lived with bendys for more than 15yrs, a few more wont hurt plus the count is going down as more bendys deregister anyway. New bendys restrict to feeders and short hauls ONLY and parking at interchanges is a good idea. I feel Bendys should be explored for SBST feeder services that are not DD friendly and short haul feeders in the contracting model. Long haul feeders doing good with DDs as of now no need convert.</p></div>

              <p>SMRT would have to evaluate whether maintaining the O405Gs would be more expensive or purchasing new buses would be more expensive. I would opt for the more cost-effective measure because we dont want a fair hike just because people wanted newer buses (majority of Singaporeans would rather keep the older buses and not have a fare hike). Early retirement also means wasted cost for COE. This will not be a one-off issue. The newer buses now will also face this problem when they are 12-15years old - but just scrapping them would be such a waste and not the best thing to do when people would rather have lower fares than the newest buses in the world.</p>
              <p>I would think maintaining the O405Gs till lifespan expiry will be more cost effective because though the parts would be more expensive, I believe SMRT can canibalise spare parts from the MK1s or even the O405s before sending them for scrap. Denis Lance and Hinos, we were looking at 60 units with nowhere to canibalise spare parts unless some go off but O405Gs, you have 250+ units on the roads with similar units retiring earlier. With SMRT doing refurbishments, its unlikely SMRT is going to refurbish for anything shorter than 2 years. I doubt the mileage would be that high in most units when you compare to SBST buses that keep running on express or 161/168 . Alot of bendys are being used on feeders anyway.</p>

DD and bendy engine cap is bigger and waste diesel. and by way the there is no COE of public transport buses. and LTA want those old buses to go off the road ASAP as LTA and NEA want a cleaner air in singapore. also i think no need to have more bendy buses as new DTL is going to start operating 1st Q next year </p></div>

              <p>DDs are far bigger consumers of diesel because of their larger surface area (almost double) headway... its a scientific study. DDs also use more powerful engines than bendys because of this reason. Bendys are more expensive in terms of maintainence because of the articulator joint that has moving parts subject to more wear and tear. Using SDs at 4-5mins frequency, you are incurring more manpower costs and taking up more parking space . A double deck or Bendy take up lesser parking than 2SDs. No way our feeders can operate with SDs like 238. 238 is like that because it cant use DDs and SBST has no bendy.</p>
              <p>Anw, Bendys have no relevance to DTL. It has already been established that bendys are to be used in shorthauls or feeders ONLY and MRT lines dont really change feeder loadings. It could mean you need lesser DDs on trunks only. Like for eg, DTL would provide an alternative mode of transport to those commuting on 67, 190, 960 now - so maybe in future they might not need too many DDs.</p>
