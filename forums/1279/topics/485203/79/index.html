              <p>Haha actually no need argue so much. So far, SMRT has been doing a good job in purchasing those DDs and putting them on their trunk services. Especially Services like 190, 857, 963 and 966 have improved greatly from the past where they had crowd management issues.</p>
              <p>In my own opinion, I would really like to see Bendys being used on Feeder services and especially those short haul feeder services because the efficiency of bendys in those areas cant be denied. Take Sercice 804 and you can see it (Or go see the youbtube videos of A24 on 804). I stay in a SBST area and I do find it frustrating when people crowd the lower deck and I cant board even though the upper deck is so empty, for feeder routes. Which is a reason why I prefer AMDEP's operation of 265, 268 with 3-4mins frequency and all SD. </p>
              <p>BUT, yes, we are a small country and space is important too. Simply saving space and overlooking the benefits to the publics is not wise and similarly using bendys where DDs can do a better job and simultaneously save sapce is not wise too (which is one reason why I cant understand why SMRT chooses to perm A24s on 851,854 etc). No point arguing to see DDs or Bendys just because of personal preferences.</p>
              <p>If you want more people to patronise the upper deck of a DD even on feeders, its actually pretty easy. No need for 12.5m 3-axle etc. Just need to deploy staff on the ground to encourage people to go up and over time, the habit should stick (I can see it working for SMRT trunks). The 12.5m 3-axle only improves alighting efficiency but not necessarily encourage more people to go up.</p>
              <p>But we are an ageing population and it will be quite contradictory to have purchased low floor buses, only to make people climb more steps to the upper deck even for short distances. There will come a time in future when the number of seats just in the lower deck wont be sufficient to seat all the older citizens and some will be forced to go up or stand. So these are things that LTA will need to take into consideration before making the right decisions that benefit the people as a whole.</p>

              <p>184/189 both should have got BSEP add but haven't. Very strange. Same with 172/180. 75 has BSEP add. If LTA wanted, would have given DD already to 75. Does the loading warrant DDs? Maybe not. The high loading comes between Cashew and Ngee Ann, but since 184 is there to complement, I think those who miss 75 can take 184, unless they have to go further to Ullu Pandan, Holland.</p>

              <p>True 184 is better with bendy buses. But then, I would increase the capacity since there's plenty of students boarding it until BPJ. </p>
              <p>Need not have faster boarding/alighting for them since the higher demand usually comes from opposite NP bus stop ; whereas those from NP bus stop got 184 and their shuttle bus alternatives(means there's not a need to go upper deck for students taking 184). </p>
              <p>Plus, Clementi forever gets jam with all the taxis, cars stopping here and there. Should have created some indicators to tell the 3rd bus to "cut-in" at the very first spot in the bus bay. </p>

              <p>Given the current route of 184, bendys are better. If wanna use DD, should let the bus terminate at Clementi and then use the staff there to encourage ppl to go to the upper deck.

              <p>189 going over to TT anyway right. Most likely will get DD after the handover but dont need so many. The old 189 route could have justified more DDs but the current route is pretty short. </p>

              <p>Yes, similarly, at the NP and SIM bus stops, the SBS double deckers are actually causing the jams, the bendies actually take less than half the time to clear a full load. In fact in this case, due to the large percentage of students, and the nature of the schools' timetables, more often than not, most passengers alight from the buses, and are replaced by a fresh batch of passengers.</p>
              <p>It is actually very easy to visualise the passenger flow. On a bendy or 12 metre bus, passengers head from where they are standing or seating to the nearest door, and due to the way the buses are designed and where their doors are positioned, the distance they need to do so is typically shorter than that of the lower deck of a double decker. On top of that, there is a choke point on the double deck where passengers wanting to head upstairs or to the back of the lower deck will have to wait for passengers coming from the upper deck, who expectedly are the passengers who take the longest amount of time to disembark. On a bendy, there may be a short wait for the people at the doors to alight, but that is significantly shorter than the choke point situation on the double deck.</p>

              <p>The current route of 189 is also quite packed between Clementi and Bukit Batok. Yes has lost its heavy loading between West Coast and Clementi. Still need more high capacity buses.</p>
