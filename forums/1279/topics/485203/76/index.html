              <p>Anyway, I see few pax on the upper deck, usually kids (I see the young kids and students like to go up, not the adults). One of my friends sometimes picks the DDs on 43, and skip the SDs. 3305C slot, and 5196L delayed and arrives 5-7 mins late, to be exact.</p>

              <p>Commuters don't even find the burden of bendy buses. </p>
              <p>The only fact they matters is frequency. If now, with more CCTVs capturing cars on bus lane, I don't even think driving a bendy is "timebomb". Maybe the no. of bus lane should increase to 2, allowing buses to overtake etc. </p>
              <p>And not every Singaporean is like svc291 commuters. Maybe LTA should remove more seats at lower deck to "encourage" them to move up? </p>

              <p>Biased la.. Even 225G/225W with 3-4 stops only has full upper deck during peak hours... When people don't have an option, they will move up.. No point whining here bcoz it is LTA decision... If it were for us, yes, we would be happy to have both DDs and bendy in the city.. why not... but open your eyes... LTA is not favoring that.. .clearly... otherwise explain why no BSEP bendy order when SMRT needs so badly.</p>

              <p>Lack of BSEP order probably due to lack of space and probably because the number of bendys currently on the roads is too many.</p>
              <p>LTA definitely does not favour the usage of bendys on long haul and trunk services. This we know. About the issue on feeder services, LTA is probably still evaluating but cant decide as of yet because the advantages bendys have on feeders cant be denied. That's why LTA probably let SMRT purchase that 40 units of A24, to see their performance. SMRT would never have purchased those bendys if they know LTA want a total ban on it because it just wont make sense. They purchase it due to the gray area. We are not talking about children who make stupid decisions here, SMRT is a big company and LTA is a government body after all. They cant be childishly fighting over bendy buses and SMRT just buy first incase later cant buy. Besides even if LTA buy BSEP bendys now, SBST cant operate them.</p>
              <p>Buying more SD buses to serve on feeders at a higher frequency is definitely going to cost more space and manpower as opposed to bendys.</p>

              <p>the thing is the WRI is very messy with the number of A22s and O405Gs. going full fleet bendies would have been effective since bendies clear loads fast in this case. but what happens later? some questions raised could be why 179, 199 and even 179A gets DDs but not 902?</p>
              <p>just look at 169. a DD (SMB3536L) have different arrival time on Weekdays and on Weekends, PHs and non-school days. varies from 08.30 to 09.30. usually arrives after 1616C.</p>

              <p>but why is LTA giving the green light to SMRT's A24s purchase
              when LTA is going for favours DD? the A24s do not have a BSEP batch

              <p>That is because LTA doesnt ban bendy but instead it will be limited only.SMRT left about 290 non wab bendy buses meaning it can only buy around 145 WAB bendy buses the most.</p>

              <p>Yes no need for DDs on 902. But another perspective, you do have 3-4 DDs on sv 72B every morning during ITE operation days. It is exactly same like 902. Yet upper deck does get full and clears the queue. Bcoz not everyone is late, right. There is a good sizeable who come early.</p>

              <p>Nobody is asking for full fleet bendies. At least not DD can enough. WRI have lesser bendy buses now but there's still issue with the 900/901 buses. They are arriving together always + they have the longest queue...</p>
              <p>179/199 are long distance + different people alight differently. 902 getting DD is seriously not working if the entire bus of students were going for 9am class(i.e. board at 8:50am). Nobody wish to be late for class clearly. </p>
