              <p>965 although i hardly took it, in my opinion it is like a
              leftover bus. Whatever pax 969 cant take, throw to 965 as it shares
              the same route for more than half the route. Only the Ave 7 and
              Sengkang part is different so the loads is even out in a
              way. </p>
              <p>Peak hour time, people chose 161 over 965 over obvious reason
              wich is why 161 always pack and people chose 969 over 965 due to
              Chong Pang n it has bendies</p>

              <p>I agree but since BSEP quota for 969 is almost done... 965 can get 2 BSEP DDs... it will help commuters along the route... In either case, 965 will not get more than 2 DDs acc to me. From SMRT side, you can expect 0 coz they have to first satisfy big DD guzzling services. If it gets, only possible from BSEP. </p>

              <p>I can agree that 965 will get crowded during peak hour, 965 can take DDs+ maybe 1 or 2 more bus. 965 most of the time almost empty as the frequency can be erratic unlike 969 so people prefer 969 to 965</p>

              <p>Actually I was expecting more. I remember that I waited for more than 20mins for 169 at Yishun, and the 1 o405 came but it couldn't pick up any more pax. </p>

              <p>From what I see for Sv 169, most people do not travel long
              distances. Their journey is usally only around 10mins either
              to/from Woodlands MRT and 2 directions from Yishun MRT. So putting
              DDs on this service, i doubt it will ease the loading of 169. this
              service is more suited for bendies. SMRT should consider swapping
              out the 190/106 bendies with DDs and then redeploy the bendies to
              services like 169. But that will involve transferring across
              depots. A24s could also be used on this service if there are enough
              to go around.</p>

              <p>I disagree STRONGLY. U need to take the service more often. People who board at Yishun MRT at am start alighting only at Admiralty/Senoko area. That is quite long distance already. Also PM people who board at AMK interchange alight at Springleaf.. Again quite long distance. DDs will help ease load on 169 soon + help ease industrial crowd of Woodlands and Seneko.</p>

              <p>Actually I also seen extreme long queues for 169 even during RP vacations. IIRC, at least 2-3 SDs + 1 bendy arrived within 15mins to clear the loads, all SDs + 1 Bendy departing WRI were packed to the front doors. Even after I left, the queue is still forming up.</p>
              <p>Similar incident for 964 that day.</p>
              <p>Svc854/857 needs some DDs too. Was at NCS Hub[towards Yishun] this evening and could say that most passengers couldn't board the bus as most of the buses(SDs + 1/2 bendy) were packed to the door. It was only up till 8:05pm where it starts to get better.  </p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Actually I am surprised that they still haven't increased the number of evening slots.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">they need to encourage more ppl to take bus in PM also. Still only 2 timings.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">My suggestion for PM:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">17.40, 18.00, 18.20, 18.40 </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">* start with these 4 bus timings and deploy MAN22s to start with for PM</p>

              <p>I doubt it will turn into full day service because who is going to take bus from Shenton Way to Yishun in AM? PM might still get some ppl want to go to Orchard for chilling/shopping but yet have NSL direct to Orchard, so I doubt.</p>
              <p>They will soon need to add 1-2 more DDs in AM, with possible crossover to 969 in PM. </p>
