              <p>Some people need to wake up and smell the coffee, and accept the
                  facts about the future of bendy buses here. All of you can argue
                  until your faces turn blue, LTA isn't buying bendy buses anytime
                  soon.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you have seen and understood my post, you'd have realise that a) I support the use of bendies, b) I recognise the fact that LTA isn't really looking into bendies and c) I support a measured use of different types of buses, including double deckers and bendies.</p>
              <p>The problem with this discourse and that of many other in Singapore is that people tend to want an extreme yes or no answer, without any compromise. We don't need responses like "SMRT should replace all of their A24 on order with double decks" like a certain member has repeatedly done so, which has not helped the quality of the argument. You also have to realise that this is a forum, and not a meeting to decide on company direction/investment decision/etc, and everyone has a choice to make their own argument about different possibilities based on a wider range of probabilities (so long as it remains civil), instead of just brushing people off.</p>
              <p>The lack of compromise and a rush to fix self inflicted problems is also the exact reason why things have not been improving in quite a lot of issues in this country. This brings me to the part of my post which states that even though LTA is unlikely to change their stance on bendy buses, I had made it a point to show what can go wrong. And on that subject matter itself, I am holding a "time will tell" stance, which may be different from another person's (such as your's) stance.</p>

              <p>It is clearly UNFEASIBLE and nearly IMPOSSIBLE to sustain DDs on feeders and intratowns in the long run, DDs just aren't designed for this purpose!

              <p>And I tell you here now, I will only accept it if LTA shows some sincerity in really making journeys faster and providing more choice!

              <p>They are too pampered already.  No wab bus complain. No aircon also complain. Wait a few min longer also complain. No new bus also complain.  Ask them go stay in jb n experience their public transport.  No direct bus service also complain. Ask to introduce more express service from neighborhood to town? So sengkang need 4-5 express services from different neighborhood to town? Or just one with long winded route in sengkang (just like 518) before hitting expressway?</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Who's the one living in the
              world of fantasy sia...</span></p>
              <p>Wake up your bloody ideas la bro, you know very bloody well how
              HK bus system runs what...</p>
              <p>That's why they could even justify the use of zero bendies!</p>
              <p>I'm here to slap u awake ah, in "land-scarce" and
              "time-precious" SG there could only be TWO choices: Either you
              introduce more point-to-point express svcs and scrap the bendies,
              or you retain the current infrastructure, and quit complaining
              about how bendies is occupying half your car space!</p>
              <p>It is clearly UNFEASIBLE and nearly IMPOSSIBLE to sustain DDs on
              feeders and intratowns in the long run, DDs just aren't designed
              for this purpose! Just like how bendies aren't designed to ply busy
              roads! Oh yah, I'm sorry hor, I know u last time drive bendies mah,
              only know how to kpkb and change to DDs, got think about how much
              travel time will be added?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My point being, if there are
              going to be no bendies, I'd rather feeders and intratowns be used
              to merely get to town centre, but intro more express in the
              neighbourhood itself to popular destinations! In other words, scrap
              current hub-and-spoke!</span></p>
              <p>Sorry lah hor, I know you like to bootlick LTA a lot, want to
              save land space but thinks that there doesn't need to be a
              compromise somewhere...</p>
              <p>You see this is why SG PT still isn't the "world-class"
              transport as described by the gvmt!</p>
              <p>Oh and who are you to force me to accept the "realities of no
              bendies" first? I want talk about bus infra tgt cannot ah? Just
              that you are too ignorant to recognise that I did not bring the
              both together for no reason! The type of routes you intro will
              automatically mean the need to determine the best type of buses to
              use what, this is common sense!!</p>
              <p>And I tell you here now, I will only accept it if LTA shows some
              sincerity in really making journeys faster and providing more
              choice! Introducing more and MORE feeders with problematic DDs and
              forcing ppl to walk and transfer to the even more problematic MRT
              is definitely not sincerity!</p>

              introduce more express service from neighborhood to town? So
              sengkang need 4-5 express services from different neighborhood to
              town? Or just one with long winded route in sengkang (just like

              <p>If bendys are restricted to be used in just feeder/intratown services and selected short trunk services (184, 962, 964), together with SDs, the number of bendy buses in Singapore will still be well below the maximum number of bendy buses SMRT ever had.
