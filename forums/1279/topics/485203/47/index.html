              <p>I would say 172 could take in more bendies. For 172 loading,
              most of the crowds at peak hours come from the SCDF/Tengah
              Airbase/Keat Hong Camp. All these people usually carry very big
              bags and I doubt they will go up. And the people that board earlier
              on in the route, they are more likely to stay dowstairs since there
              is space. Also, between CCK int and CCK Ave 1, the travel time is
              very short and people boarding 172 in these areas will not go up.
              It would be better to let 180 take in DDs and the Bendies go over
              to 172.</p>
              <p>Overall SMRT Trunk services that should definitely use DD (IMO):
              106, 180, 188, 190, 700, 857, 960, 963, 965, 966, 969, 972, 985</p>
              <p>SMRT Trunks that could use Bendies: 67, 172, 176, 187, 189, 851,
              854, 856, 962, 964</p>

              <p>855 will surely get BSEP DDs once Yishun int opens. 180 I doubt for the moment coz SMRT does not have enough DDs, else it is a very good route suitable for DDs. Most ppl who board at Boon Lay alight only at Phoenix and BPJ. </p>

              <p>Yeah if that happens then i predict some 0405Gs would likely retire early like how the Lances were dereged early, if LTA announces the purchase of more E500s like in late 2015.</p>

              <p>I believe SMRT will procure more Double Decker buses this year and in the next few years. </p>
              <p>Last year it only procured 201 units most likely because this was its first year procuring Double Decker buses. Now that it has experience, it may procure more units of Double Decker buses.</p>
              <p>I feel that eventually, the Articulated buses (including that SMB-registered one) will all be phased out and replaced with Double Decker buses. </p>
              <p>Speaking of which, an articulated bus caused a traffic jam inside Boon Lay Bus Interchange bus bay recently. That bus occupied around half of the driveway where buses from sawtooth berths drive through to loop and exit the bus interchange. Only one bus can drive through to loop, and some departures were delayed.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there should not be Articulated buses here where traffic volumes are high and traffic congestions are common.</p>
              <p>According to the article on Wikipedia, last updated on 29 December 2014, SMRT has 315 units of Articulated buses.</p>
              <p>When SMRT procures Double Decker buses again, it shoud procure at least 315 units to replace all its Articulated buses. Considering that more high capacity buses will be needed in future, the figure should be doubled to around 630. SMRT should procure around 630 units of Double Decker buses when it procures Double Decker buses again.</p>

              <p>I still strongly feels that the bendies will eventually found itself on feeder services and short trunk service. DD can give long trunk svc that plies expressway etc. </p>
              <p>Boon Lay part that one i cant comment coz i strongly feel 180 172 need DDs to bendies as their passenger are not those stop 1-2 bus stop away. </p>
              <p>Pros of DD</p>
              <p>More capacity, less space on road, pax can sit down longer.</p>
              <p>Cons of DD</p>
              <p>Loading and unloading can take more than 5 minutes as they is only one door, one staircase to unload. </p>
              <p>Best case study example 154 at Clementi MRT AM Peak.</p>
              <p>A lot of people disembark at MRT Station and it seems like the whole upper deck disembark, A lot of Ngee Ann Poly students had trouble boarding because they have to wait for everyone to alight then they can board and it cause a major obstruction to other buses like 52,105,106 etc. </p>
              <p>Students then chose to take 2 184 bendies wich can take pax faster and get off th<span style="line-height: 1.231;">e bus bay faster in which the 154 bus still stuck at the bus bay.</span></p>
              <p>On your view on BNL int, that one i have to agree on the bendy part but i seen DDs jammed up the entrance not due to bendy but due to the JIS svc having to alight their whole bus worth of pax which jammed up the place during PM peak and i hope Joo Koon opened up soon to minimise the strains of peak hour for the JIS</p>

              <p>67 does not serve a lot of residential area so it is possible but 851 n 854 i think the pax are long haul esp 854 wich serve Yishun,HG,Eunos and Bedok n it passed by some factories at YCK Rd. 851 case it passed by Yishun,Marymount,AMK, Tiong Bahru and ultimately Bukit Merah. The peak load comes from Chinatown and Bukit Timah and i see the pax took all the way to Marymount,Yishun meaning they are considered long haul pax</p>

              <p>Just what I noted when I took 190 back to CCK from opp far east plaza 2 days ago at about 10.30pm. 2DDs, 2 Bendies and 1 SD came together. The order was SMB5003U, TIB1127U, a E500, a MAN A22 and a Box O405G. I wanted to board SMB5003U but the BC did not open the door as it was fully packed to the front door (but upper deck seemed to be only 75% full). So I ended up on TIB1127U, standing at the front door. TIB1127U overtake SMB5003U along PIE. When I reached CCK, I alighted and was waiting for 172 and I noticed SMB5003U arrived a full 10mins after TIB1127U. Even the Box O405G had overtaken SMB5003U. Which makes me think, are DDs really so much more better? For a service like 190, the pros of DDs definitely outweigh the cons.</p>
              <p>But in a feeder service where passenger boarding and alighting activities are so high, is DD really the best choice to solve the overcrowding problem? Imagine you make the feeder full DD, the dwell times increase and the total duration to complete the route increase, you also have to buy more buses to take maintain the frequency. And then you get bunching of buses (Example 241). On the whole, you are using more buses and prolonging the travel time - Does this really reduce the footprint on the road as opposed to Bendies? I really cant imagine Yishun feeders using DDs. The dwell times are going to be just too high and the travel time is going to increase for every passenger making people think about the efficiency of SG public transport. Like wise, if a service like 241 used a mix of Bendies and SDs, travel time would be shorter, dwell times will be shorter, you will need lesser buses plying the route and Im sure passengers will have a better ride. For feeders, seats are never a priority for passengers anyway....Just some food for thought!</p>
              <p>(You might think the congestion to turn into BL int might be a problem, I dont deny - but Id say mix Bendies and SDs. If you do these for all feeders, you are reducing the number of buses turning in anw. Since DDs have been added, Ive noticed greater bunching and more buses being deployed due to additional travel times and this is partially responsible for the congestion too...)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>FYI, according to sgwiki, Feeder 804 operates with 10 buses but Feeder 241 operates with 9-16 buses. 804 has a longer route and more busstops, with definitely a greater passenger load to deal with as opposed to 241. If 804 were to convert all its 10 buses to DD slots, I doubt 10 buses will be sufficient to run the route at its current frequency. So yeah, just an example to my point.</p></div>

              <p>Just what I noted when I took 190 back to CCK from opp far east
              plaza 2 days ago at about 10.30pm. 2DDs, 2 Bendies and 1 SD came
              together. The order was SMB5003U, TIB1127U, a E500, a MAN A22 and a
              Box O405G. I wanted to board SMB5003U but the BC did not open the
              door as it was fully packed to the front door (but upper deck
              seemed to be only 75% full). So I ended up on TIB1127U, standing at
              the front door. TIB1127U overtake SMB5003U along PIE. When I
              reached CCK, I alighted and was waiting for 172 and I noticed
              SMB5003U arrived a full 10mins after TIB1127U. Even the Box O405G
              had overtaken SMB5003U. Which makes me think, are DDs really so
              much more better? For a service like 190, the pros of DDs
              definitely outweigh the cons.</p>
              <p>But in a feeder service where passenger boarding and alighting
              activities are so high, is DD really the best choice to solve the
              overcrowding problem? Imagine you make the feeder full DD, the
              dwell times increase and the total duration to complete the route
              increase, you also have to buy more buses to take maintain the
              frequency. And then you get bunching of buses (Example 241). On the
              whole, you are using more buses and prolonging the travel time -
              Does this really reduce the footprint on the road as opposed to
              Bendies? I really cant imagine Yishun feeders using DDs. The dwell
              times are going to be just too high and the travel time is going to
              increase for every passenger making people think about the
              efficiency of SG public transport. Like wise, if a service like 241
              used a mix of Bendies and SDs, travel time would be shorter, dwell
              times will be shorter, you will need lesser buses plying the route
              and Im sure passengers will have a better ride. For feeders, seats
              are never a priority for passengers anyway....Just some food for
              thought!</p>
              <p>(You might think the congestion to turn into BL int might be a
              problem, I dont deny - but Id say mix Bendies and SDs. If you do
              these for all feeders, you are reducing the number of buses turning
              in anw. Since DDs have been added, Ive noticed greater bunching and
              more buses being deployed due to additional travel times and this
              is partially responsible for the congestion too...)</p>

              <p>You observations on route 172 is in line with the academic findings <a href="/forums/1279/topics/487180">here.</a></p>
              <p>I think the lesson here is be to consistent when it comes to bus fleet deployment on any given route. Deploying bendy buses and double-deck buses on the same route is the worst thing you can do if you wish to maintain a regular headway.</p>
              <p>How about getting route 172 to loop at Boon Lay and use the same bus stop as CW6?</p>

              <p>Being a student in NTU myself for 4 years already, I am a regular commuter on SBST 179, 179A and 199. IMO, given the loading pattern of 179, DDs are definitely a wrong choice for this service. There is too much boarding and alighting at almost every busstop in NTU and Pioneer MRT station too, with no traffic lights in NTU campus. Also, many students do not wish to go up when they are going to alight at pioneer (I also dont know why but this is very true amongst most of my friends and what I see when Im on board) so upper deck is usually only 50-75% utilised.</p>
              <p>However, the number of passengers taking 179 everyday is just too high and the number of buses required to operate this service is just too many to say 179 should use bendies. Though bendies are a better fit for this service and no doubt the number of buses used on this service can be reduced with bendies, it wont be feasible with the current Boon Lay interchange and wont be wise because bendies occupy space.</p>
              <p>With the bus contracting model and a possibility of DDs and Bendies being better utilised to their pros and cons, my suggestion for 179 will be as follows:</p>
              <p>179 - SLBP - NTU - SLBP via Pioneer MRT (stops at all busstops)<br>179A - Boon Lay - Pioneer - NTU - Pioneer - Boon Lay (basically the same 179A route as currently except that it should call at the 2 busstops between Pioneer MRT and Boon Lay Int)</p>
              <p>In this way, 179A can use a full DD sleet with 179 exploring a possibility of running on SDs and Bendies. This way you also eliminate congestion at Boon Lay Int. <br><br>As for 199 - Current deployments are pretty good with DDs and SDs. DDs are definitely better utilised on 199.</p>

              <p>I believe SMRT will procure more Double Decker buses this year
              and in the next few years. </p>
              <p>Last year it only procured 201 units most likely because this
              was its first year procuring Double Decker buses. Now that it has
              experience, it may procure more units of Double Decker buses.</p>
              <p>I feel that eventually, the Articulated buses (including that
              SMB-registered one) will all be phased out and replaced with Double
              Decker buses. </p>
              <p>Speaking of which, an articulated bus caused a traffic jam
              inside Boon Lay Bus Interchange bus bay recently. That bus occupied
              around half of the driveway where buses from sawtooth berths drive
              through to loop and exit the bus interchange. Only one bus can
              drive through to loop, and some departures were delayed.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there should not be Articulated buses here where
              traffic volumes are high and traffic congestions are common.</p>
              <p>According to the article on Wikipedia, last updated on 29
              December 2014, SMRT has 315 units of Articulated buses.</p>
              <p>When SMRT procures Double Decker buses again, it shoud procure
              at least 315 units to replace all its Articulated buses.
              Considering that more high capacity buses will be needed in future,
              the figure should be doubled to around 630. SMRT should procure
              around 630 units of Double Decker buses when it procures Double
              Decker buses again.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Agree to points you made, but SMRT can continue using bendies on certain CCK / Yishun / Woodland feeder intra-town services. For all trunk services, strictly use DDs. Considering this SMRT should maintain 150 units of bendies.</p>

              <p>For Sevices like 67, 851, 854 - Ive noticed that loading pattern
              on these services does not see passengers travelling very long
              distances. Most of them travel for 15-20mins max and these services
              have no express sectors, meaning there is very little incentive for
              people to go to upper deck. Also, there is alot of boarding and
              alighting activity along the route, making a 3-door bus more
              efficient. Given that these services are already having bendies and
              terminating at SBST interchange on one side, such operations might
              still be feasible. The problems with Bendies are actually the space
              it occupies on the road. As such it would be wise if SMRT actually
              does not deploy consecutive bendies so that they will not cause
              long queues at busstops when they bunch together</p>

              <p>This is an absolutely incorrect observation. I have taken these services and this is so not true.</p>
              <p>On 854, you have pax who board along YCK Road and alight at Eunos, Airport road junction. You have pax who board at Yishun and alight along HG Ave 3. All this qualifies for long distance travel.</p>
              <p>On 851, you have pax who board along Marymount and alight only at Bugis/Little India/Novena. This is long distance travel.</p>
              <p>On 67, you have lot of pax who board at CCK and alight along Bukit Timah, pax who board at Bukit Timah and alight along Serangoon rd/Geylang... and so on... </p>
              <p>On every route there will be people who take it for short distance, but on all these 3 services you have a good number of pax who take the bus for long distance travel. DDs are PERFECT for all of them.</p>

              <p>Surprising to see LTA still registering BSEP DDs when so many spare.. Let SMRT register instead and increase capacity on its services.</p>

              <p>Seems like LTA only listens to MPs these days... 972 okay... but 966 to get one more... too much!</p>
              <p>Rather prefer 969 gets.</p>
