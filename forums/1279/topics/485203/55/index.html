              <p>Yeah could try the DDs on 180 because quite alot of pax go end to end so upper deck will be well used. But personally, I would not support the use of DDs on 172.</p>
              <p>For 172, the heavy loading is only during peak hours and that explains the split shift bendy slots currently. This Service could do with an upgrade of some split shift SDs to Bendys. If use DDs also, probably only split shifts because full day would be quite a waste. To use DDs on this service, the roads along Jln Bahar and Old CCK road need to maintain a 4.5km clearance and I would think it is not too cost effective to for maintainence on such a long stretch of road for just 1 service and that too just for peak hour loading. And also I dont believe those people booking out from army camps will be inclined to go the upper deck with their heavy and bulky bags. Non Peak hour crowds are only between CCK int and CCK ave 1 (Quite short distance).</p>
              <p>For 184, its more or less an institutional service. Quite heavy boarding and alighting activity at quite a number of stops along the route. If you observe 154 along clementi MRT station to the clementi road stretch, you can already see the situation of using DDs (its really quite slow). The Bendys on 184 have helped this service stay efficient. Unless there is a severe space constraint or there is a ban against bendys, I would support use of Bendys for this service.</p>
              <p>For 189, I am not too sure about the loading after the shortening of the route. For the Old route, yes, DDs could have been used but too bad SMRT didnt have DDs before. But for the new route I believe the heavy loading is just between Clementi Ave 6, Clementi MRT and the Clementi Ave 1? If yes, it more or less becomes a kind of feeder service.</p>

              <p>184 I agree with you. A lot of boarding/alighting happens at Clementi MRT. Bendy is a good option here. 154 DDs doing well. Don't say anything. 154B given DD for a reason. It is not same situation like 184.</p>

              <p>yes..172 load duringÂ AM off peak can be crazy too! I have seen on many occurrence that buses are packed to the door after the Sheng Siong stop towards CCK duringÂ the afternoons. The OCs definitely not enough...</p>
              <p>Few weeks back they trialed a bendy on one of the AP slot but seem to disappear already...revert back to full rigid AP slot and the 4 bendy split shift slots are not very certain also.. at times rigid may appear (like SMB58U on 172S105 yesterday)...</p>

              <p>I travel on 172/180 very regularly! I would say yes to DDs for 180 because I know quite a number of people boarding at BL and Lakeside travel all the way to Bt Panjang (it serves like an express version of 187 to Bt Panjang). Also 180 loading is all day round</p>
              <p>On the other hand for 172, majority of the people do not travel end to end. People Travel between BL and Sheng Siong (even though 199 is shorter, because 199 off peak frequency can get very bad). Then the there are people who travel from either ends to the army camps/CD academy thats located on the way. Lastly CCK Ave 1 to CCK int. 172 usually gets crowded after 3pm for PM, by which split shift bendys are already operating. Off peak I mostly see the bus is decently crowded with max a few standees for a OC and so having AP high capacity bus is a luxury. My reason to oppose DDs for this service is because of the type of people taking this service during peak hours (mostly army/CD personnel). Plus I would think maintaining the 4.5m height clearence from along the long stretch that is only used for 172 is an economic waste. 172 can be considered a short haul trunk spanning usually just 32-40 mins end to end. I believe it will aslo be SMRT's last priority for DDs</p>

              <p>If you notice, 172 is not even a bendy priority or any kind of priority for SMRT. I think it lets it be because mostly lower income group takes the service on most part of its route. I am okay if they want to deploy bendy. Deploy bendy. But if you do not have enough bendies, at least deploy DDs.Â </p>
              <p>172 also needs BSEP slot. not one, but two. It is strange that some services are neglected by BSEP bcoz they do not cater to the elite.</p>
              <p>Also, I think people would be stupid to take 172 to Sheng Seong when 199 is faster and has BETTER frequency contrary to what you said. Also 199 mostly has DDs plying. 172 run time is around 10 minutes more than 199 to Sheng seong given the congestion and number of signals it has in between. Also, 172 I believe has been purposefully made to do the round so that more CCK bound people take 172 and those for Jalan Bahar, opt for 199 instead. And this is exactly what happens.</p>
              <p>If you are at Jalan Bahar and want to go to Boon Lay, even if 172 comes before, people will wait for 199 since it is faster, cheaper and more reliable.Â </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Let me correct you there. 199 has better frequency than 172 during peak periods mostly but during off peak periods like in the afternoon and at night 199 frequency is atrocious. Its 17-24mins per bus. I dare say 2 buses of 172 can come most of the times before 199 comes (I study in NTU and I take 199 everyday) during off peak. Plus even at peak hrs 199 is quite irregular. There are so many instances where 2 buses come together and then next 15mins no bus. Yes 172 is a longer route but most people take whichever comes first from SS unless both arrives together. During Peak hours its approximately 5-10mins longer than than 199 but non-peak its only 5mins. And for 172, people can alight at the last stop before the interchange to transfer to MRT too so it doesnt make too much of a difference. But from BL-SS direction, you are right! most people queue up for 199 instead because the 172 arrival timings on the tv screen are usually not accurate and yeah 199 is shorter.</p></div>

              <p>Hmm actually 172 is definitely not SMRT priority now. There are services that are far more worse off that I would say this service is fine. I take it very often and in recent days I havent seen the bus not being able to pick up passengers. Besides 975 has had increased frequency to counter also. With loading just mostly during split shift duties, this service is still managable. If it were bad enough, BSEP would have added MAN A22 atleast since there are so many available. ..</p>
              <p>As for DDs I would say wait till SMRT has enough to spare, if this service ever gets the DDs. Likely that if they remove the bendys, they might just fleet add during peak hours and maintain a SD fleet.</p>
