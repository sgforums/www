              <p>I believe SMRT will procure more Double Decker buses this year
                  and in the next few years. </p>
              <p>Last year it only procured 201 units most likely because this
                  was its first year procuring Double Decker buses. Now that it has
                  experience, it may procure more units of Double Decker buses.</p>
              <p>I feel that eventually, the Articulated buses (including that
                  SMB-registered one) will all be phased out and replaced with Double
                  Decker buses. </p>
              <p>Speaking of which, an articulated bus caused a traffic jam
                  inside Boon Lay Bus Interchange bus bay recently. That bus occupied
                  around half of the driveway where buses from sawtooth berths drive
                  through to loop and exit the bus interchange. Only one bus can
                  drive through to loop, and some departures were delayed.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there should not be Articulated buses here where
                  traffic volumes are high and traffic congestions are common.</p>
              <p>According to the article on Wikipedia, last updated on 29
                  December 2014, SMRT has 315 units of Articulated buses.</p>
              <p>When SMRT procures Double Decker buses again, it shoud procure
                  at least 315 units to replace all its Articulated buses.
                  Considering that more high capacity buses will be needed in future,
                  the figure should be doubled to around 630. SMRT should procure
                  around 630 units of Double Decker buses when it procures Double
                  Decker buses again.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As mentioned before, it's also the interchange structure that is always causing jams problem, not just bendy bus factor alone. So don't juz blame the bendy bus alone.</p>
              <p>If you wish to have no jams in the interchange, govt. should bloody expand the landspace, stop being stingy..</p>
              <p>Imo, imagine some random bus just breakdown at the entrance of the interchange, and because the govt. wants to save space, they only make two lanes for entry..which in reality only can take 1 single lane..</p>

              <p>LTA should focus more on SMRTB routes..SBST for now their plan is working perfectly.</p>
              <p>LTA should work together with NEA for the trimming/chopping of branches or even trees if they must..</p>
              <p>LTA should order more BSEP Enviro 500s and A95s while SMRTB should order another 60-70 units of A24s at a discount rates.If not by 2016 when the population increase again the old problem will erect again..</p>
              <p>All feeders/Intratowns and short trunk like 859,860,962,964 should use just A24s and rigid buses</p>
              <p>Mid and long haul trunk should use DDs and rigid buses..</p>
              <p>svc like 106,188,190,960,969 can deploy all DDs</p>
              <p>Maybe ADL can offer SMRTB their new E200MMC with 4.5litre engine for svc like 825 etc</p>

              <p>This may sounds like a pretty unpopular opinion, but I personally prefer services serving major teritary institusions that have either a MRT station nearby, or have its Int nearby to use bendys instead, due to very high loading/unloading within a few stops. Of course, not all services need bendies IMO.</p>
              <p>Here are some which I can think of currently.</p>
              <p>23 (Tamp Int - TP)</p>
              <p>95 (Kent Ridge MRT - NUS)</p>
              <p>There are some services that I also considered, but decided against it due to several reasons.</p>
              <p>31 (More of a point A - B type of pax, noticable on 31A)</p>
              <p>69 (A bit of distance from Bedok - TP)</p>
              <p>96 (A bit of distance from Clementi - Kent Ridge Cres)</p>
              <p>179 (Way too much buses, and Pioneer bus bay will pobably not be able to support so many bendy)</p>

              <p>Okay, to your point</p>
              <p>sv 300 in 2013: 10 bendy buses</p>
              <p>sv 300 in 2014: 8 bendy buses + 5 SDs</p>
              <p>Capacity increased by 3 buses, in turn 2 bendy slots degraded to SD.</p>
              <p>So how much really was the capacity increased?</p>
              <p>When the SD comes, already no space for anyone to board along ave 4. Observed 2-3 times. Same PM peak, SDs can hardly clear off the load.</p>
              <p>Do we have to wait for another person to post video until SMRT takes constructive steps? 302/307 still okay (not great).</p>
              <p>Now compare this with 240, 241, 243, 291, 334... such a huge world of difference in the way feeders are managed in SBST and SMRT. </p>

              <p><br>think 300 will be re-routed once 301 is introduced...it will be anytime soon i guess. 300 loading is super crazy...the queue can go easily up to at least 2 bendy buses worth of pax during peak hour even at 2-3 mins per bus... putting SMB1510Z and SMB1516H (AP slot) in is definitely a wrong move.. TIB549S is still ok since it is only for peak hour, so i take TIB549S only as a supplement...</p>

              <p>Okay, to your point</p>
              <p>sv 300 in 2013: 10 bendy buses</p>
              <p>sv 300 in 2014: 8 bendy buses + 5 SDs</p>
              <p>Capacity increased by 3 buses, in turn 2 bendy slots degraded to SD.</p>
              <p>So how much really was the capacity increased?</p>
              <p>When the SD comes, already no space for anyone to board along ave 4. Observed 2-3 times. Same PM peak, SDs can hardly clear off the load.</p>
              <p>Do we have to wait for another person to post video until SMRT takes constructive steps? 302/307 still okay (not great).</p>
              <p>Now compare this with 240, 241, 243, 291, 334... such a huge world of difference in the way feeders are managed in SBST and SMRT. </p>
