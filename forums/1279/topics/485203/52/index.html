              <p>To my observation, 169 is still 100% suitable but the problem is there will be about &lt;50% of Foreign Workers moving upper deck or [moving to the rear(rigids&amp;bendy)] from Yishun to their dormitory and same doesn't help during weekend.<br><br>And as for 960, most of the crowd from Bugis will go up then will it reach Little India it will be equaliser especially on weekend.</p>

              <p>IMO, some people are very paranoid with DDs. It is okay if upper deck is not full. DD will still carry more pax than a rigid. Those who want comfortable journey can go to upper deck, sit and relax.</p>
              <p>I have taken sv 169 previously and I saw full upper deck from AMK to Springleaf area. It is not just industrial service workers but a lot of residents, students also take service between AMK and Yishun.</p>
              <p>Also, those who board near Seneko to go to WRI, also go to upper deck. I think there is a small patch between Yishun and Canberra, where distance is too short, and people rather stay downstairs and that is okay. </p>
              <p>Overall, 169 is still in need of more bendies or DDs. They need to kick out more rigids from the service.</p>

              <p>On the other hand WPDEP has only 14 BSEP E500s. Out of these 3 will go to sv 960 for sure. Remaining will be 11 BSEP E500s for Yishun.</p>
              <p>This number is quite less to meet Yishun demand. So next round of registration will be for WPDEP IMO. </p>

              <p>Hmm but I guess bendy will suits 169 more bah...but it depends on the human behaviour. Some workers went up straight away rather than squeezing on the lower deck..</p>
              <p>I hope the deployment of DDs on 960/980 won't be that bad.. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Also, an observations for 187. Right after SMB3559X slot(at about 6+ near the ITE), there was a big gap, not sure if it's the bus that was caught in accident or so. Waited about 15mins for 1 full MAN..with the rear empty..</p>

              <p>No. SMRT didn't have an option. 972 was under BSEP. And only A22s were registered then. Once the E500s came in, 972 was the first service to get them.</p>
              <p>But I agree SMRT cannot be like SBST, bcoz even now SMRT is struggling with high capacity buses. You see so many rigids span on their super high loading routes. If it were SBST, these services would have been full fleet capacity. </p>
              <p>In fact, in SBST jurisdiction some services are extra pampered with surplus buses and DDs. You won't find even one such example in SMRT zone. </p>

              <p>Sooner or later I believe SMRT would catch up and services will improve. SBST has been operating DDs since 1970s so when it came to fleet renewal they just bought new DDs and replaced quickly. For SMRT case, they had been using articulated buses all the while since late 1990s. But LTA had to cap the number of articulated buses on the roads and so after certain time SMRT could only deploy SDs to increase capacity. When it came to fleet renewal they naturally looked at replacing articulated with articulated. This is how I believe SMB388S first appeared.</p>
              <p>But since LTA does not want town bound services to have so many articulated buses, SMRT had to consider it options which took pretty long. But atleast now they have purchased E500s and probably looking to order MAN A95s. So yeah they might have been slow but i believe they will catch up soon. And with them operating articulated buses and DDs, I believe they will surpass SBST some day if they maintain. IMO, they were just late bloomers.<br><br>Also IMO, if you going to put DD on service where 25% goes up and 75% stays down on short route services, its a better option to just keep to SDs and increase the number of buses. Just add 2 more SDs and increase the frequency - effective capacity is the same and efficiency in terms of boarding and alighting will be higher than deloying DDs. Faster travel time, Better frequency, looks better also.</p>

              <p>See the bolded part.</p>
              <p>Please also consider for every 2 extra SDs you add</p>
              <p>1. additional BCs</p>
              <p>2. more operating costs</p>
              <p>3. more parking space at already cramped interchanges</p>
              <p>4. more road space occupied (imagine the higher traffic volume)</p>
              <p>It is wise and smart to rather deploy more DDs that is okay if carried 90 pax (but takes care of the additional 20 pax that SD cannot carry, even if upper deck only 25% full). In turn, you save adding one more SD bus to the fleet and in turn all the costs and points mentioned above.</p>

DDs have been very effective on SG roads unlike bendies... I know you want to prove otherwise... but will be better if we stop discussing topic on DDs v/s bendies. </p>
