              <p>Your reply seems to hint that you know little about the events
              of 1999. Maybe you weren't even born then. I was a teenager about
              to complete my secondary education and get drafted to the army that
              year, so I remember heaps. Tibs, the operator of bendy buses, were
              made to hand back SKG and PGL to SBS, in exchange for CCK and BBT
              when the latter won the NEL tender, which I suspect was rigged by
              Potong Pasir reject Mah Bow Tan, then transport minister. If that
              didn't take place, it is very likely the Habit bendies would have
              been deployed on routes 864 &amp; 865 in large numbers.</p>

              <p>Yeah this is Singapore, we cant do much! So many of our bus routes (excluding those with express sectors) are more suited for bendys than DDs simply because of the number of busstops along the route. General public chooses to take bus to MRT station and transfer and DDs really lay over for quite long. But this is Singapore, we cant afford to use so many bendys with the land constraints that we have.</p>
              <p>So according to PTOs, when people complain cant board, they just throw in DD and the ball is back to the public's court as to whether they want to go up or not. But either way, they cant complain the PTO is not doing its job properly. So the solution? Its obvious, we cant move to having more bendys on the roads, so the choice will be to design bus trunk routes that suit DDs like those in HK so that the DDs are used properly and not just there for show that the PTOs have done their part. Feeders to provide linkage to MRT for people who prefer MRT comuting and trunk routes as alternatives to MRT for people who prefer bus. This will probably take ages or may never ever happen unless someone takes a bold step forward. Its the sad reality.</p>
              <p>Till then, just live with it. Even though the DD is quite empty on top, it still carries more people than a SD and so its still better because you cant use so many bendys on our roads. Its because 169 has bendys as well that people can do this comparison and say bendy is better etc. So many SBST services also go this issue but we never had a direct comparison so people just live with it. Atleast I still do respect SMRT for seeing the use in bendys for their feeders and still purchasing new units for their feeders as opposed to SBST which is just throwing in DDs to show they have done their job. </p>
              <p>Woodlands, I doubt will leave the hands of SMRT even in GCM. So many bendys over there...</p>

              <p>If you observe, it is only people in SMRT area that complain about DDs. It is because they are not used to them yet, which is understandable. On SBST side, I have also posted many pics to show how the smallest feeder route 225 has DDs... and has full upper deck when it leaves interchange during PM peak. </p>
              <p>Last week, I had another observation: sv 45 DD at Tanah Merah MRT towards UEC Terminal had almost full upper deck. Around 45-50 pax boarded at TNM MRT and many many of them went to upper deck. If you see, its only 4 stops from there to terminating point.  </p>
              <p>Give it some more time, you will see upper decks getting better utilized for short distance also. </p>

              <p>They need to get better at pruning the branches. This is very common these days. Even roads such as Mountbatten road having huge number of DDs on 12, 14, 196 have tree branches not cut and many times they hit the upper deck. Some slacking in work here. </p>
