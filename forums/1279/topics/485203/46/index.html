              <p>Yes, to what I recall, it was SMRT that said about DDs on 960. Probably they had an oversight of the issue of the trees along Bt Timah Rd?

              <p>I dont believe LTA will decide to chop down those 2 trees so easily if they have not acted on it for the past 15-20 years. I guess those trees are protected. I believe SBST would have wanted to deploy DDs on Svc 66 long time ago and even on 67 when it was under SBST but I suppose the trees were the issue. Also to be taken note is the fact that 67 only got high capacity buses (articulated buses) after handing over to TIBS (now SMRT).</p>
              <p>Till today 66 runs on a full SD fleet and 48 (where some split shift DDs could do some good) also runs on full SD fleet. So these 2 services are probably still gonna use articulated buses in the near future and maybe see how it goes after the A24s arrive? 960 has already seen an influx of rigids recently - from having a 100% articulated fleet in the past - possible sign of a reduction of capacity?</p>

              <p>The two trees logic is strange. As another friend said here, govt has chopped forests not just trees. so I don't see what the big issue here is. Maybe just a matter of time.</p>
              <p>Coming to 48, it cannot use DDs even then coz of Tanjong Katong South. Coming to 66, its ok not to have any DDs, since you have full fleet DD on sv 65 from Little India to Bedok Reservoir and many other services in parallel. On Bukit Timah stretch, you have 157/174 join in that have parallel route all the way upto PIE at Jurong/Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>So mainly it is 67/960 that need the DDs asap. </p>

              <p>The two trees logic is strange. As another friend said here,

              <p>Coming to 48, it cannot use DDs even then coz of Tanjong Katong
              South. <strong>Coming to 66, its ok not to have any DDs</strong>, since you have
              full fleet DD on sv 65 from Little India to Bedok Reservoir and
              many other services in parallel. On Bukit Timah stretch, you have
              157/174 join in that have parallel route all the way upto PIE at
              Jurong/Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>So mainly it is 67/960 that need the DDs asap. </p>

              <p>I would say 172 could take in more bendies. For 172 loading, most of the crowds at peak hours come from the SCDF/Tengah Airbase/Keat Hong Camp. All these people usually carry very big bags and I doubt they will go up. And the people that board earlier on in the route, they are more likely to stay dowstairs since there is space. Also, between CCK int and CCK Ave 1, the travel time is very short and people boarding 172 in these areas will not go up. It would be better to let 180 take in DDs and the Bendies go over to 172.</p>
              <p>Overall SMRT Trunk services that should definitely use DD (IMO): 106, 180, 188, 190, 700, 857, 960, 963, 965, 966, 969, 972, 985</p>
              <p>SMRT Trunks that could use Bendies: 67, 172, 176, 187, 189, 851, 854, 856, 962, 964</p>
