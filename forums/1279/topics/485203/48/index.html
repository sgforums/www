              <p>No I am not a double decker hater. I welcome the use of DDs on 190. I was just using my experience on 190 to illustrate the efficiency of bendies. It does not mean I want 190 to continue using bendies. But a full DD fleet for 190 will be better than the current bendy and DD mix because I see alot of bunching cos of different the types of buses bwing used currently.</p>
              <p>My stand is what many have said before which is being practical and what SMRT has endorsed - DDs for long distance and Bendies for short distance. Of course some long distance services do have feeder service kinda loading and there it is important to consider if DDs really fit the job. if not bendies, deploying SDs with higher frequency is still better than using DDs in my opinion. Its just my thoughts. I live at a place where its SBST and I must say their operations seem to just throw DDs everywhere. Like for eg. Are DDs really needed on 43M? It would have made more sense to use the DDs on 43 and transfer the SDs from 43 to 43M. So many times I see 43M with empty upper decks.</p>

              <p>At some point of time the existing network of routes will require a redesign. Many old routes were originally designed to maximize catchment and revenue.</p>
              <p>With the contracting model there should be a shift in focus towards increasing efficiency and to reduce the traveling time of commuters.</p>

              Why Sembawang no Double decker!!?? Hahaha.
              
              Just want to say, why 855 only need 2? Just compare it with 188, which also goes to Harbourfront. 188 have shorter distance than 855. 188 estimation 22km, 855 estimation 27km. But then, 188 likely get around 5 - 6 E500s. If 188 can get more DDs, why 855 cannot? 855 have more distance travel and I say that the demand is high for commuters during peak hours. That's where last year I got saw one bendy deploy on 855. 
              
              Other services like 171, 851, 854, 855, 857 must definitely have DDs. 860 if can try to deploy DDs too. Not sure if 852, 853 and 856 can have DDs.
              
              For Yishun feeder service like 812, please deploy MAN A24s. I can't stand the waiting time for 812, and 812 altogether only got 6 buses?? It's am intratown service, and they have 6 buses only?? But since AMDEP will get MAN A24s, 812 will definitely get MAN A24s.

              <p>Just want to say, why 855 only need 2? Just compare it with 188,

              855 have more distance travel and I say that the demand is high for
              commuters during peak hours. That’s where last year I got saw one

              <p>Other services like 171, 851, 854, 855, 857 must definitely have
              DDs. 860 if can try to deploy DDs too. Not sure if 852, 853 and 856
              can have DDs.</p>
              <p>For Yishun feeder service like 812, please deploy <span>MAN</span> A24s. I can’t stand the waiting time for 812, and 812
              altogether only got 6 buses?? It’s am intratown service, and they
              have 6 buses only?? But since <span>AMDEP</span> will get
              <span>MAN</span> A24s, 812 will definitely get

              <p>Are you judging which services should get DDs and which should not based on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">distance</span>? </p>
              <p>The loadings on sv 855 and sv 188 just cannot be compared. 188 has super high loading and a unique route with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very little duplication</span>. 855 does have quite a few alternatives along its route, and can have high loading but will mostly range around 70-80 pax. Hence, DDs on sv 855 are good to have. I recommend that it should get at least 2 BSEP DDs to start with.</p>

              <p>Why does 171, 852, 853 need any DDs? The loading just doesn't justify. 852/853 on 90% buses do not get more than 50 pax. 171 peak hours could get around 60 pax... but again not DD worthy.</p>
              <p>Also we need to consider there are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> so many DDs with SMRT. Once they have surplus DDs like SBST, SMRT can think of it. </p>

              <p>I absolutely agree with your point on 812. Need full fleet bendies and at least need a fleet of 8-9 buses. st 61 do not have another option so also many blocks along west part of ring road. Just because these blocks were built in yesteryears, does not mean you do not give it additional buses or services. </p>
              <p>Yishun is in major need of re-hauling its feeder/intra-town network to meet today's demand. Routes like 800 / 804 need to be modified as well to provide more direct MRT access than current route which is more winding to MRT.</p>
