              <p>Load management is even worse for SMRT because there are not enough bus services and frequencies are very bad, till the state that is so bad that there are so many problems in SMRT buses a few years ago. All until BSEP comes in.</p>
              <p>SBST on the other hand can cater for more services, having good frequencies in many feeders.</p>
              <p>That's the purpose of GCT. More buses, better frequencies and more services. </p>

              <p>The truth hurts, but...</p>
              <p>Though majority of the svcs, namely the trunks, do better with DDs, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Feeders and intratowns do perform better with bendies.</span></p>
              <p>I'm sure you have heard me say this many times. Faster unloading time, optimum spa<span style="line-height: 1.231;">ce usage etc etc. It is all about realising the advantages of each and every bus type, and be innovative and intelligent enough to make good use of them. </span></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, LTA isnt really that open to it now. Perhaps after GCT they may pump some, but for now its really not to conclude LTA has given up. </p>
              <p>As mentioned alr, the feeders and intratowns are minority compared to the rest of the svcs. So makes one wonder how does parking a few dozen more bendies really cost<strong> that much</strong> space? After all, if i were to choose an additional perhaps 480m2 of space, versus thousands who have to be late coz they have trouble <span style="line-height: 1.231;">getting on or off, its really no contest is it.</span></p>
              <p>So you say SBST could do better. Clearly you have not seen the other side of the story, look at SBST 222. Even if at the very least, if JE svcs could do well with DDs, well I applaud them. But they have not used bendies before have they. Residents there will probably have gotten used to it. Not for SMRT side though! And dont push the blame to TIBS, bendies were great to have around, and it is still my fav bus op in SG. SMRT may have screwed up a little, but it does not change the fact that bendies are the most suitable for these heartland jobs.</p>

              <p>Bro,You know the real reason why SMRT only purchased 40 units of A24?Because they already knew that LTA doesnt favour any bendy purchase in future so they lan2 have to go on with the orders..I can also guaranteed you that these A24s wont last long.Imagine if Yishun will be bidded under Seletar package and they lost it again?40 units not so bad compared if they ordered 100 units..At least can distribute among Wld,CCK feeders..LTA doesnt ban bendy but it not interested in buying..Its SMRT freewill that they lan2 buy</p>
