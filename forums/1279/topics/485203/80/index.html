              <p>Yupp i agree to that. For institutional services, the DDs really do clog up the place. I am a NTU student and I see it on 179 and 199 everyday. It takes a long time for everyone from the upper deck to come to the lower deck and alight ONE at a time and everyone that's boarding will get stuck before the staircase till the last person has alighted from the bus.</p>
              <p>So bendy is definitely faster because boarding and alighting can take place simultaneouly and 4 people can alight at a time from both rear doors throughout the alighting process. Why 179 needs to be so frequent is because the bus guess jammed up very long at major busstops if only 1 bus comes at a time. So SBST choose to let 2 buses go simultaneously to divide the boarding and alighting. Yes 2 double decks have more capacity than 1 bendy bus but if you notice, the 2 179s only leave mostly with a 3/4 seated crowd with some standees at standing area at current frequency. </p>
              <p>I can assure you given same load of boarding and alighting for 184 as well, the bendy will win hands down as compared to a double deck. You dont need much intelligence to think for that. &amp; for purely institutional services bendys do fit better because the loading is very different from trunks services like 190 or 857 or 963. 72B can survive well with DDs only because there is no simultaneous boarding and alighting.</p>

              <p>agree that 179/179A could have done better with bendies than DDs...but sad to say Boon Lay Int does not allow so many bendies due to lack of space and there are actually 2 tight turns along the route which will not allow bendies too...</p>

              service ply town areas and come back talk to me about the practical
              and effiency of bendy buses in Singapore.As for short distance
              trunk or feeders i have no comment since SBST also succeed in using
              DDs for their feeders.</p>

              <p>If SG is gonna become a second HK, then pls ask them to restructure and overhaul their bus route framework lah...</p>
              <p>Still wanna intro feeders here and there, and think building feeder-MRT with 3-4 car trains can solve problem...</p>
              <p>Surely the demand is ale there for more express routes and long trunks alr right?! 7m leh. </p>
              <p>Since bendies dont work anymore... I'd rather SG just scrap hub and spoke altogether and intro more long-distance express...</p>

              <p>Well logically, bendies just don't make sense for sv 96 or sv
              179. Okay, let's assume for one Clementi and Boon Lay are gigantic
              interchanges that can accommodate bendies without complain.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine the queue that would form to enter the
              interchange when 3 bendies on sv 179 come together to turn right
              into Boon Lay Int, and the massive queue that would pile up outside
              Clementi MRT if 96 had bendies. </p>
              <p>Common guys... bendies are great... used them in Paris.. but in
              Singapore... they just don't make sense.. at least in crowded areas
              and interchanges... </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The queue that would form outside the interchange would in fact be shorter, because the bendies would clear the area in less than half the time of the double decks. Fast in, fast out, rather than the current situation of double decks behind waiting for the passengers in front to get down from the upper deck.</p>
              <p>The problem with the pro double deck argument is that it is based on absolute road space taken, instead of the more realistic and accurate metric of traffic flow.</p>

              <p>This is the same LTA who had short sightedly decided that 3 carriages was enough for circle line, the same LTA who is playing catching up to all the transport infrastructure needs, the same LTA who realised after years of overcrowding that the MRT and LRT systems needed new trains.</p>
              <p>With that, can you say for certain that their decisions are absolutely the best for the transport system? If they decide to dump all the bendies in the future, I personally think they will be scratching their heads wondering why the jams have gotten worse, or why bus journeys are getting longer, as they may think double decks would solve all their issues, when in actual fact, it doesn't really do so.</p>
              <p>A good mix of double deckers and bendies is needed, together with proper planning as to which routes to use the buses on.</p>

              <p>Yes, unfortunately, Boon Lay interchange cannot accomodate so many bendys at the current design. It can only do so if a full bendy fleet utilises 2/3 the number of buses as a full DD fleet (do the math on the length and it will work out to that). I wasnt saying 179 should convert to Bendys, I am just saying 179 would have been better with bendys. The amount of time a DD 179 clogs up at pioneer MRT and also Boon Lay alighting point is also very long.</p>
              <p>If there were bendys on 179, I doubt there will be as much bunching as of the current state with DDs. The DDs makes the passenger activities very irregular such that the buses bunch up so easily. And like I mentioned, SBST purposely sends 2 179s together to counter the boarding/alighting disadvantage that DDs have due to the 1 lesser door - this wont happen with bendys. Also, with dwell times reduced at the major busstops, the number of buses in the 179 fleet can be reduced slightly. But yes a 3-door double deck is a viable option to the bendy in this case because it eases the passenger activity and since passengers are mostly students, they can go up too. Best option, build MRT into NTU and 179 can operate with just SDs.</p>
              <p>And yes SMB351M is right. DDs only take into account the absolute land space but LTA is obviously over-looking the fact of how many more DDs are being used on services with short distances and high passenger activities to compensate the efficiency of bendys. So will the overall picture really save the landspace occupied? You talk about express service (eg. 966) where there is more driving than time spent dwelling at busstops, DDs and Bendys have similar efficiencies, so of course DD is the obvious choice to save space. Also there arent any town services that need bendys because there arent any feeders or institutional services there so if planned properly, bendys wont be clogging the busy roads in town.</p>
              <p>Yeah if Singapore bus network become like HK one, I will not even talk about bendy bus. But face reality, that's still far and I dont see feeder services disappearing in the next 20 years. I only see more old people needing to use feeders over the next 20 years.</p>
