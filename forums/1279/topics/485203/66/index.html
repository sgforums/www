              <p>Hi. I am curious. Just wondering, what is it about Articulated Buses that you like? In so many aspects, Double Decker buses is better. Any reason why you want Articulated buses on the routes in Seng Kang and on the routes you mentioned?</p>

              <p>Mentality issue I think. The older buses have more seats, so people wouldn't mind standing for a while as there is a higher chance of getting a seat after few stops. As for low entry buses like the OCs and KUBs, the area at the back is kinda like the older buses, so those who take for shorter distance would not move to the back, and those who want a seat would stand at the rear portion. As for low floor buses like the A22s and O530s, the aisle at the rear is quite small, hence people would tend to leave it empty so it won't be too much of a hassle for those alighting.</p>

              <p>What's your point here? Are you supporting my earlier statement on DDs being more comfortable... I think that's what you are saying... but from your tone "just go ask those sv 190pax"... I can't make out.</p>
              <p>And I don't need to ask sv 190 pax.. coz it is common sense. For such a long route, people would want to sit on upper deck, relax, enjoy the view than scramble standing in a crowded bendy. </p>

              <p>I take 190 regularly and yes DDs are great. Definitely more comfortable than the Bendys, though efficiency not as good. But the situation of 190 is different from other short routes etc. For 190, people want comfort cos long ride so DD is good. But for short routes and feeders, I will still choose to use Bendy because in those services, people are more interested in the speed and efficiency to get home/MRT than comfort. Yes you give me a double deck bus so comfortable but I need to sit for like 10mins longer than standing on a bendy whats the point? 169 is fine with bendys or DDs because there are ppl who travel LD and SD. And so in such a situation, its better to just use DDs and save bendys for use on a service that is not as suitable for DD.</p>
              <p>So in summary, DD is more comfortable no doubt, but Bendys have higher efficiency and are faster. Deploy according to which factor is more impt for each service, as long as our land scarce sgp allows it.</p>

              better. Any reason why you want Articulated buses on the routes in

              <p>Your reply seems to hint that you know little about the events of 1999. Maybe you weren't even born then. I was a teenager about to complete my secondary education and get drafted to the army that year, so I remember heaps. Tibs, the operator of bendy buses, were made to hand back SKG and PGL to SBS, in exchange for CCK and BBT when the latter won the NEL tender, which I suspect was rigged by Potong Pasir reject Mah Bow Tan, then transport minister. If that didn't take place, it is very likely the Habit bendies would have been deployed on routes 864 &amp; 865 in large numbers.</p>

              <p>Obviously, if you see DD departing WRI at 7.25pm, you are not going to see many pax. Are you forgetting it goes to Seneko/Admiralty industrial area? Who would take bus at that time to industrial area. The few who will take it are for Ave 9. </p>
              <p>At that time even the Republic Poly load towards Yishun would be missing. Plus by the time it reaches Seneko industrial, the heavy load going to Sembawang/Yishun has gone. So what do you expect? At that time, the bus to have full load???</p>
              <p>Now observe this same bus that leaves around 17.30 from AMK going all the way to Woodlands. It has huge load from Yishun, Seneko industrial, Republic Poly all the way to WRI. That is the main loading for which the 169 DD is timed and not for its return journey. When it comes to bus loading, I do know my shit! ;)</p>

              <p>I have seen workers at Yishun MRT boarding 169 to go to Seneko going to upper deck. All JIS services have full fleet DD, and workers go upper deck. It may be random observation, but surely that does not warrant your comment. </p>
              <p>Also where does SMRT have so many bendies to play around? Haven't you seen how it has downgraded so many services to more A22s when current bendy expires?? So SD better than DD in this case? </p>
              <p>Let's start being realistic about what resources they have and where should they deploy. I rather prefer they upgrade those A22 slots on their heavily packed feeders/intra-towns to bendies and start upgrading trunks with DDs. And the latter is definitely more comfortable.</p>
