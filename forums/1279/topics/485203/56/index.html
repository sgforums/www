              Boon Lay interchange will be pasar malam with or without the bendys anyway. The problem is that it is so poorly designed that it cannot cope with the number of buses turning into the alighting point. Buses like 179A can hog alighting the limited alighting area for 3-5mins when the bus is at a fully seated load. You very seldom see 2 bendys hogging the alighting point - on 187 the bendys almost never exist, on 172 there arent many and that leaves just 180.
              
              I am not implying that bendy buses are better in boonlay but I am just saying that bendys are not the culprit for boon lay problem. And in all fairness, although they are a bigger burden on the roads, they clear off from the alighting point alot faster. BL interchange has sufficient parking space for the number of bendys patronising the interchange as of now also. One option would be to let 179A terminate at the busstop outside the mrt station (that means turn right after st 63 instead of left towards interchange). After all, the driver also go in alight and then almost immediately go out. Scan card can find another solution...

              <p>Actually 179/179A has no BSEP slots. BSEP has never played a role in improving NTU services. 179 is still pretty ok but for 199, I would consider it as one of the not so well operated services by SBST. You should see Sunday - So many people go back to NTU halls at night and yet that service runs on 2 DDs ONLY, But Ok thats besides the point.</p>
              <p>If 179A is modified to terminate outside, it will certainly reduce peak hour jams outside the interchange. Cos if you notice, 179A is the service that spends the longest time at the alighting point due to it not having any stops btw NTU and Boon Lay. The distance from interchange-MRT and the busstop-MRT is more or less the same. Yeah Joo Koon can't help there. Joo Koon could take over and extend Service 241 though. Joo Koon - JW St 91/92 - Pioneer - Boon Lay (Loop outside interchange). With 179A and 241 out of there, it should be more managable already. Anw, Joo Koon will take out some of the JIS also mah.</p>

              <p>The frequency is not 20-25 mins but around 12-15 mins during off-peak hours. there are still some classes that leave in the off-peak also and the buses have decent loading of 55-60 pax in off-peak as well. Yes in the night, frequency is very poor and most loading is for HDBs along Jalan Bahar. I think at this point, frequency of 172 might be better than 199.Â </p>
              <p>But I agree that 199 needs a higher frequency even in peak/non-peak hours. 8 buses is not enough. Current peak hour frequency is 07-08 mins and it should be something like 05-06 mins. 199 should have fleet of 10 buses - it would be good if BSEP gives 2 SLBP WEG to 199.Â </p>
              <p>There are occassions when at SADM, people were not able to board 199 already and hence there were requests for 179 to stop at SADM. Actually travel time of 199 from SADM &lt; 179 given 179 does full loop before getting out.Â </p>

              <p>if i didnt remember wrongly, its 16-18 mins during off peak..though i waited for 30 mins before for 199 at around 1pm..</p>
              <p>Many of 199 buses during peak came from 243W (3113P, 3115J, 3120T, 3129U), and most DDs are on split duties...AM/PM peak the headway is very good, sometimes even as close as 2 mins per bus until bunching occurs...but due toÂ jam at Boon Lay Int, buses may be delayed, which explains occasional 10 mins wait during peak.</p>
              <p>If i am not wrong, there are only 3 buses running during off peak (SBS8902X on fixed slot 1A/?P, SBS6695G also on AP slot, and last bus usually is a DD. SBS3069J, SBS3070D, SBS7402D are confirmed split shift buses, im not sure about SBS3243Y, SBS3244U and SBS9548D, though i know only one is AP bus). In the afternoon, just before PM peak, buses will usually be packed, which will cause problems to those boarding from SADM, Hall 9, and Hall 11.</p>
              <p>During off peak, 172 frequency is definitely better than 199. Therefore, we see many pax alighting at Sheng Siong stop even though they can take 199.</p>
              <p>I would think 199 will need more AP buses rather than split shift buses..</p>

              <p>Yeah, which kinda explains why I see 199 as poorly operated. I stay in Hall 10. I gotta take bus to school everyday and since I got bus concession, I can opt to take Campus Red Loop or 199 (whichever comes first). During off peak afternoon, even though the indicated frequency on the boards is 12-16mins, the real frequency is 19-25mins. There is decent load even at these hours.</p>
              <p>At night, even though the load in the HDB areas might not be as good, there are alot of foreign students who take 199 from Opp LWN Library Busstop (Blk 2) to Sheng siong which I understand has some hostels behind. So if its a SD, the bus gets full and residents from Hall 9 and Hall 11 busstops cannot board. Also there are many hall residents taking 199 from JP to NTU.</p>
              <p>To what I noticed, SBS8902X and SBS6695G operates at night. The double deck recently has been SBS9548D or SBS3243Y. Anyway these are the only 4 buses that are commonly seen on 199 so I believe the rest do splits? SBS3069J, SBS3070D and SBS7402D I only see during peak hours leh. SBS7402D will bunch up with SBS6695G (Citaro is very bad choice for this service - should use KUB instead) and sometimes SBS3070D with SBS3243Y</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>179A could be faster than 199 from SADM though. One bus captain on 179A once told me that one loop including break is 38minutes. Even I also supported 179 stopping at SADM. Because at night if i miss 199, taking 179 and walking to hall 10 from SADM can be about 10minutes faster than waiting another 20+ mins for next 199.</p></div>

              <p>Yes that's why I am proposing that 199 gets perm fleet of 10 buses not including crossovers. BSEP SLBP can add 2 WEGs to this service. 5 buses can operate on A/P including 1 BSEP slot.Â </p>

              <p>That's because they do not have many bendys to play with. It is not just 857 that is badly managed. Even many other services deserve much more bendies. The # DDs ordered is also not enough. Need to order more to really start the SD --&gt; High capacity bus conversion.</p>
