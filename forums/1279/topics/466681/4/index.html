              <p>So 6, 23 and 31 are also part of BSEP. These were not identified earlier. What about 88? Still no confirmation? sgwiki does not show any BSEP addition for February. Someone stated that 88 was getting Citaros. Looks like it was a rumour.</p>

              <p>Sv 23 was a surprise though. I didn't expect a BSEP Wright to go on Sv 23 that fast given the past trends of BNDEP BSEP deployments. I guess, it probably means BNDEP is alr getting ready to offload the VO3xs of Sv 23 soon. Perhaps to the West District if they need the DDs given BN alr has a ton of VO3x SPs.</p>
              <p>Sv 6 I thought all along they might put in another fleet add soon given how packed the Loyang Industrial area is nowadays. Just didn't expect it to be a Wright. This BSEP add would definitely help to ease the loading of Sv 89 from White Sands onwards to Loyang, cause alot of pax in PSR preferred to take Sv 89 up till now to Loyang because Sv 89's freq is more constant during Peak compared to Sv 6. Not to mention the buses deployed towards Changi Cargo Term (&amp; hence Loyang) during AM Peak are usually the DDs with the SDs going in the opp direction. Good choice here.</p>

              <p><br>With the Citaro addition, BSEP makes a hole in one more full fleet DD service just like 168. I thought 99 would get the Citaro given that it is doing perfectly fine with its current fleet of buses. But then given 251 has only uni-directional loading, this might be the reason for consideration.</p>

              <p>I think it has been a good selection on BNDEP side. svc 6 loading during morning and evening peak can be super crazy. Also each bus on 23 is always packed (atleast 60-70 pax minimum). 31 is a high loading service between TPY - Lor 1 Geylang and Bedok to Tampines. So good choice again.</p>

              <p>I expected the Sv 31 BSEP to be from BRBP side though, it's interesting why BN provided the Wright instead. </p>
              <p>At least for the 3 BN services in this round, they dumped the Wrights instead, which is a wise choice. Compared to the selection of Citaros for Sv 2 &amp; 168 the other time (when Sv 2 &amp; 168 needed the DDs instead), this round was quite sensible. Or maybe because the BSEP Citaros allocated for BNDEP were used up for Sv 4, haha. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I would suppose this bus is out on first day but it's not perm BN 12. Sv 12 last e-tt change was 18 Feb, and all along it has been 3319M on that BSEP slot since 18 Feb. So 3336M is replacing 3319M's slot today? Ask him to give you or me the timings to cross-check please. And ask him to cross-check with the e-tt first before anyhow posting that Sv 12 now has 2 BSEP buses? 18 Feb e-tt change for Sv 12 was the previous round, not this round.<br><br>Either way, I don't think 3336M is perm BN 12. Don't anyhow edit wiki yet or rather revert those edits yeah. Just classify it as SP first. There's only 1 BSEP slot for Sv 12 so far from e-tt, and that bus is 3319M. Don't screw up the wiki for Sv 12, tyvm.</p>

              <p>Sometimes we forget that a BSEP fleet add is almost the same as getting a non-BSEPã€€fleet add isn't it? Given that they probably would deploy a Wright as fleet add in this case? Just the rego and slight change in timings are the diffs between a BSEP &amp; non-BSEP fleet add aye. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Yes bro. I think last year's BSEP deployment should be reviewed again. 2, 87, 168 should be given Wrights. Take those Wrights from either 119 or 50. A Citaro hardly helps the loading on any of these services. More so, it is irritating when the Citaro comes first, and a DD follows within 2-3 minutes.</p>
              <p>I don't know if you agree but during peak times a Citaro can be slower than a DD and can cause massive delays. At major bus stops, when pax cannot enter as the bus is full, the BC has to first ask pax to move to the rear, then ask pax to stand back. This makes the Citaro further late, and the DD behind catches up but doesn't get its full due of passengers. After the peak loading area is gone, the DD behind becomes redundant with very few pax on board. </p>

              <p>I think I mention before, think the rationale to use a Citaro in between the DDs of those svcs was to split the load. I.e. Introduce a bus in between which beats having no bus at all. But I think they might reverse the decision of deploying BSEP Citaros soon, might be a wait-and-see approach. </p>
              <p>But you're right in a way, having Citaros in any case on a DD-dominated svc is just asking for trouble. KUBs not that bad cause the standing area can crush-load with 2 &amp; even 3 rows. The Citaros during Peak, practically everyone just stands in one row from front to rear. At most 20-25 standees only. If you compare to a KUB, the amt of standees pales by a whole lot. </p>
              <p>And the case you mentioned, are for BCs which obviously are just doing their own jobs &amp; minding their own business. I've seen more than once BCs co-operating together with their own hand gestures, whereby the BC driving the SD would specifically overtake the DD and pick up the pax at the first few packed stops. The considerably more-empty DD then zooms past the SD that stopped and picks up the pax beyond the first few stops that the SD stops at. This cycle continues again with every set of stops until they clear the packed stretch of the route. <br><br>Also seen this pattern of co-op for services with Citaro &amp; KUB one after another as well (think in the context of the CGA svcs). This pattern I've observed, usually occurs more so for the long-time perm BCs of the svcs though. </p>
