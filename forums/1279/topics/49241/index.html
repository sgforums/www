Instead, it stops at an un-named road parallel to the station and again along Punggol Central.

So LTA built a bus stop each on both side of the road, also Punggol station is the only station in which the concourse is divided into two by the road, so this mean passengers can board and alight at any one of the two stops depending on which part of the concourse they are going to/coming from. So SBST let service 83 to stop at the bus stops on both sides of the road for the convenience of passengers.<br><br>As for most other services, the 2 bus stops on both sides of the road are used also by other services, so SBST/Tibs let the particular loop service to stop on both side of the road for passengers transferring to/from other services.<br></div>
