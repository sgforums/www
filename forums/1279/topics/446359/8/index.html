              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>LOL dude. When you said waiting to collect WAB buses to perm
              them, it came across to me that you were trying to mean that 81 did
              not have any WAB perms in the first place. So therefore it needs to
              collect the WAB perms to start perming 81. If you were trying to
              mean that 81 already had WABs, then i would have thought that
              sentence should appear as  'collect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> WAB perms'.<br> <br> Sure, I opened my eyes very wide to see what you typed. I just
              interpreted it differently from you did.</p>
              <p>Just so sad that you don't have eyes then, cause otherwise you
              wouldn't have mistyped 82 for 81 and yet not realise your mistake
              until I quoted you.</p>
              <p>You want to shoot me? Your level not there yet.</p>
              <p>So what are you trying to imply by the words I posted and you
              quoted in red? That post was to refer that 81 needs at least 3 more
              WABs to hit the minimum required, and those 3 Wrights are more
              likely to replace the 3 VO3x when they are all adless, the current
              ad contracts will limit when 81 will get the Wrights.</p>

              <p>Okay, I got what you are trying to say, I'm sorry about the mistake. I will edit the post.<br>So, whatever the reason, those ads are on those buses since when?<br>AD contracts usually expires after 4 months.</p>

              <p>Typically Tiger Beer ads last more than a year. Previous gen Tiger Beer ads have lasted more than a year, so I don't see why this gen wouldn't be the same. </p>
              <p>The SBST EXSA ad usually lasts till the next round of EXSA ad, which would only be pasted in 2013 as well.</p>
              <p>So very apparently, your assumption that ad contracts only for 4 months while valid for some ads, doesn't apply to the ads on 9453T 9573E as well. Observe and you will see. The Farmhouse Milk ads have been on the KUBs and all for like what close to 2 years?</p>

              Jun 2014, 06 Aug 2014</span>. And it is almost definitely that they
              will extend them beyond those dates till reach the max 19 years,
              cause those dates are only up till 17 years. So that means another
              4 years.</p>
              <p>Want to pick on the Striders?
              Sure. <strong>1969A</strong>'s lifespan expiry is

              2013</span>, <strong>2614S &amp; 2633L</strong>'s
              is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">13 May
              2013</span>. But that is only up till 17 years too. Not even 19
              years lifespan. So even then, can last till 2015. That's 3 years
              more. <br> The B10TLs? <strong>9801Y</strong>'s lifespan expiry is
              on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">16 Feb
              2020</span>, <strong>9837U &amp; 9843B</strong>'s
              on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 Apr
              2020. <br></span>And we all know the Euro Vs were only
              registered in 2009.<br> <br> Service 81 simply doesn't get WAB service status yet because it
              needs the Wrights, there's no way they can afford to put more SD
              WABs without attracting complaints from the huge amount of pax
              daily. Plus Citaros won't work cause 81 depends alot on the
              standing space in KUBs for crush loading from Tampines to Hougang
              during peak hours and weekends.<br> And because 9453T 9573E both have ad contracts, and the SL simply
              doesn't like or want to give his B10TLs away, there's no Wrights
              yet even though BNDEP has been getting Wrights for some time now.
              The points you raised were all not valid simply, and I've proven to
              you why.</p>
              <p>Don't tell me I misunderstood your post. So sad to tell you that
              in this forum, once you've made more than a couple of mistakes to
              prove that you're unreliable and speaking gibberish, that's it. Be
              prepared to be shot at. </p>
