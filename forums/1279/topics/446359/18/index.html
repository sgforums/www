              <p>Cannot figure out what bullshit SMRT is doing here... they're taking 965 for a toy and just keep on taking advantage of it. </p>
              <p>As you can see, here is the timeline:</p>
              <p>When 965 first started in 2002, it has OAC, CAC and Volgren O405s. (Maybe some Lances I think, can't remember much) </p>
              <p>But after some time, 965 was merrily kicked off AMDEP.</p>
              <p>Then for some reason, the CACs were thrown to other svcs and 965 was dumped with a few OACs.</p>
              <p>After that, SMRT was so stupid enough to go and take 965's Volgren to deploy on 950. And switched 950's "torn-down" JB OACs... so basically, 965 at that time is one of the few mono-fleet svcs in SMRT.</p>
              <p>Then, its long-waited rewards came. 237U, 238S and 242D came to 965, becoming the F1RST few WAB perms on 965. But they didn't stay for long. They then went to 187 and OACs came back to serve 965. That motherf***ing thing is, 187 didn't turn WAB.</p>
              <p>Afterwards, another wave came. 276U and 277D came over first, but was almost instantly thrown over to 966. So, 280T, and also 281R from 969 came over. At first i thought this was the end and they were gonna stay for good. But what the f***! They went over to 859 and 171 respectively and thrown the CACs back to us! This is the situation i hate the most. When you are downgraded, you get your rewards and then your rewards are switched with the already worn-out stuff you were taken away before. </p>
              <p>Then I heard the BCs takling about 760 and 474 replaced with MANs, but of course that was total crap and did not happen. </p>
              <p>Was is SMRT taking 965 as? Even 969 can retain its MANs and even get BSEP upgrades, while 965 was only listed but no BSEP till now. SMRT huh. I boycott since 280 and 281 is gone, but I can stop if an improvement that can happen long and good is implemented onto 965.</p>

              <p>I find 965's fleet pretty decent to be honest. If you're a bus fan living in SE/YI/Thompson area in the 90s, and saw 167 grown from a very decent fleet to something thrashy, how would you feel? I am ok with 965's fleet anyway.</p>

              <p>Yup, they did 167 before when WLDEP opened in 25 Oct 1998. 167 was partial WLDEP/KJDEP during those days, and the fleet under WLDEP...</p>

              <p>And I remember 167's fleet became something like this after 25 Jul 1999...</p>

              <p>822C remained on 167 thruout.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong the 46x series were all redeployed over to Rapidbus 700 which got transferred from KJDEP to WLDEP then.</p>

              <p>Previously, several services got WAB buses on the day it turns WAB. Then some of listed bcos TPY not ready. Then the rest from wishes in this thread. I do believe 62, 70/70M, 73, 82 &amp; 83 can turn WAB very soon. Maybe end-of-year or start to mid-next-year</p>
