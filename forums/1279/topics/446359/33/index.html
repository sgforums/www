              <p>All 83 citaro should be out from 83.It`s useless when the bus service is not a WAB service.Give the citaros to other bus services that is likely suitable to declare as a WAB service in the upcoming future like 159 </p>

And somemore during that time 88 had alot of CDGEs. It had 7489D, 7490Z, 7491X (first WAB bus I took, hence my username), 7492T, 7493R, 7494M, 7495K, 7496H, 7497E and 7498C. And since there were only 200 CDGEs introduced, 88 was a really lucky service to get some, even though its fleet before was perfectly fine. The sudden change made me think that 88 gonna get WAB but only now, 7 years later, it goes WAB. 88 has an award now. Longest time having DD WAB perms but not WAB service.</p>

              <p>I remember somewhere in 2006, when I first saw a CDGE B9TL on 88, wah I was super happy but I also thought, why of all services, 88 suddenly get CDGE? And somemore during that time 88 had alot of CDGEs. It had 7489D, 7490Z, 7491X (first WAB bus I took, hence my username), 7492T, 7493R, 7494M, 7495K, 7496H, 7497E and 7498C. And since there were only 200 CDGEs introduced, 88 was a really lucky service to get some, even though its fleet before was perfectly fine. The sudden change made me think that 88 gonna get WAB but only now, 7 years later, it goes WAB. 88 has an award now. Longest time having DD WAB perms but not WAB service.</p>

              <p><br>88 also has another award. one of the few services with most WAB DDs in the fleet, apart from svc 72. thanks to ITE college central, it has sudden increase in the DDs deployed lol</p>

              <p>But that's how you make a service popular with commuters by increasing capacity and frequency that commuters start trusting the service.</p>
              <p>SBS did the same with sv 43 last year when everyone said so many DD additions not required. It wasn't required at that time, but today you see sv 43, the DDs are well utilized. Why? Because people have started trusting the sv and have moved to this svc. </p>

              <p>I wrote to SBS about DDs on 159 from AMK to Sengkang or TPY to Sengkang via CTE. The reply was "159 was monitored for both AM and PM peak and operated between 60-80% of its capacity". It also mentioned that with more buses on 159A and 159B, it has taken care of the high loading sector for sv 159. The reply further mentioned that commuters can opt for sv 50, sv 88 that have higher capacity to reach their destination from AMK. So guys, no DDs for 159.</p>
