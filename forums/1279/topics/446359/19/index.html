              <p>Yup, they did 167 before when WLDEP opened in 25 Oct 1998. 167

              <p>Not all of them. Some services already had WAB 'prepared' before they announce it to go WAB, like 171 851 and 858, Whereas the rest had already 'warm up' like 61 and 855 For 61 before 35K came in there was 4A and 44J, and most of OCs coming from 75 etc, Last year when 4A got demoted to TRNG for good only they swap 35K for 819M, kicking some buses out. 855's case already had a couple of buses as 'warm ups' like 28G and 136C, before the citaros kicked out the lances and the 'quota' is still not there.</p>
              <p>This year the WAB candidates 75 177 187 700 852 and 970, 75 had 'way prepared beforehand', 177 ditto, 187 just transformed literally without preparing which is why you saw those old ELBOs perming 178, and it came as a shock because it took time to settle those fleets. 852 was already 'warmed up' this year by having 3 citaros 146Z 147X 148T as perms from AMDEP, WLDEP just transformed 852 without making giving sufficient notices before hand, It was only the week before, Then they took action by swopping out the scanias, and that makes the deployment very messy at that time when both services were converted, Which means the fleets of 167 178 were being played around with, 167 got its citaro stripped, 178's strider got redeployed again. </p>
              <p>As for 970, The fleeting was there before hand but for some reasons it wasn't considered for WAB until this year.</p>

              perming 178, and it came as a shock because it took time to settle

              <p>Uh, perhaps my post wasn't clear in my definition of dumping, I had meant that SMRT's habit is to dump a certain fleet of WABs onto their pre-determined WAB service, then swap out those WABs wholesale and then replace them with another set of permers. If you look at Service 75 since the 1st day they got the first few Citaros, and then subsequently what happened till today before they finished with getting the MAN permers, you should know what I mean. <br><br>So yes, no doubt these WAB services were prepared as in the SLs know how to drive WABs and all, but their WAB permers, are really like mahjong from what I keep seeing. One week swap here, the other week swap to another service. Not just 75, some other services also, you should know better since it's your side. </p>
              <p>For SBST, it's very rare lately that once they put a set of permers on a yet-to-be-WAB-certified service, they swap out the entire set from that service and replace with another few permers before going WAB. SBST's practice is more likely slowly adding on one-by-one, then unless there's ad contracts/particular issues with the model (like Voith Wrights vs ZF Wrights for Sv 168), they wouldn't swap the entire set of permers from a service like what SMRT has been doing lately.</p>

              <p>Just as I expected.</p>
              <p>Only 859 860 has the full,or 'almost there' quota. The rest are mediocre and borderline. </p>
              <p>I won't be surprised if 178 gets it next. With 2E and 262X they can add in 122S and 124L if they want to warm it up.</p>
