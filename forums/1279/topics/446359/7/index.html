              <p>178... just took full route last week around 12.30pm from Boon Lay to Woodlands.<br><br>Reaching Bt Batok only a total of 8 passengers took the bus. Bt Batok... a bit healthier load.<br><br>but definitely most healthy was in Marsiling to Woodlands.

              <p>LOL dude. When you said waiting to collect WAB buses to perm them, it came across to me that you were trying to mean that 81 did not have any WAB perms in the first place. So therefore it needs to collect the WAB perms to start perming 81. If you were trying to mean that 81 already had WABs, then i would have thought that sentence should appear as  'collect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> WAB perms'.<br><br>Sure, I opened my eyes very wide to see what you typed. I just interpreted it differently from you did.</p>
              <p>Just so sad that you don't have eyes then, cause otherwise you wouldn't have mistyped 82 for 81 and yet not realise your mistake until I quoted you.</p>
              <p>You want to shoot me? Your level not there yet.</p>
              <p>So what are you trying to imply by the words I posted and you quoted in red? That post was to refer that 81 needs at least 3 more WABs to hit the minimum required, and those 3 Wrights are more likely to replace the 3 VO3x when they are all adless, the current ad contracts will limit when 81 will get the Wrights.</p>

                  sentence should appear as  'collect <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> WAB perms'.<br> <br> Sure, I opened my eyes very wide to see what you typed. I just
                  interpreted it differently from you did.</p>
              <p>Just so sad that you don't have eyes then, cause otherwise you
                  wouldn't have mistyped 82 for 81 and yet not realise your mistake
                  until I quoted you.</p>
              <p>You want to shoot me? Your level not there yet.</p>
              <p>So what are you trying to imply by the words I posted and you
                  quoted in red? That post was to refer that 81 needs at least 3 more
                  WABs to hit the minimum required, and those 3 Wrights are more
                  likely to replace the 3 VO3x when they are all adless, the current
                  ad contracts will limit when 81 will get the Wrights.</p>
