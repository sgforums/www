Is the '1413' referring to the start of work for BC doing 89P on the same bus? (I didn't have time to get the one for 89P, in which the timesheet 89P is behind 87A.)</div></blockquote>se-808 is the block/run number. se is for East district, while SC is for Central and SW is for West District. 8xx is for SIngle deck air-con buses. Yes 1413 is the time the driver for 89P tap card, but he should be at the interchange way before that time.<br><br>Payhour, basic pay is 8hr00, including meal. however, this driver does OT, so he gets 8hr39 instead of 8hr10.</div>
