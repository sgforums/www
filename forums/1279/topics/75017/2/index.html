Sengkang East Way (towards Sengkang East Rd, after Compassvale Rd) was a dead end back then, as the rest of the road was closed to facilitate NEL construction. Buses then park on both sides of Sengkang East Way. When the temporary interchange was opened, all services were then re-located there.</div>
