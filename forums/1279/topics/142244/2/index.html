If ONLY there is a bus which <span style="color: blue;">simply turns LEFT</span>, we will reach the Serangoon MRT immediately.<br><br>Even though it is possible to walk from this area to Serangoon MRT, it is not near enough, so pple there may want to take bus to the MRT.<br><br>Currently, if people dont walk to the Station, their alternative is to go to the Cardiff Court or Boundary Rd Bus stop to wait for 22/53/853, or take 133 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Potong Pasir</span> MRT, which is very slow during morning heavy traffic.however, the 22/53/853 option is for pple who live near boundary road, <span style="color: blue;">what about<br>those who live along B02/01 Serangoon Ave 2?? </span>[b]why go to Potong Pasir Station when Serangoon MRT is just one stop away</strong>?<br>[/b]</blockquote>Well, at least from 31 July onward tbere will be 58 from B02 Serangoon Ave 2 to Serangoon MRT station.This would be the first bus which turns left at the Ave 2/Upp Sgoon Rd junction. dont mind walking to B02 to wait for 58. better than walking all the way to the mrt station. dont like waiting at Boundary Road bus stop for 53/853/22 because it is has to walk and crossed overhead bridge. Also, has to get across 3 traffic light(4 for 853) to reach MRT, whereas 58,from B02 Ave 2, no traffic light if toward the MRT.<br><br>with this new service, maybe the amendment of 315 will not be necessary to me anymore, however, it would even be better if there is a bus from B04 Ave 2 to MRT station, but nvm....<br></div>
