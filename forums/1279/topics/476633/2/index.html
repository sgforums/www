              <p>i think should have some more routes from somewhere to NTU to

              <p>say Choa Chu Kang int &lt;-&gt; NTU ? what do u think? </p>
              <p>the route is simple... out of CCK int, turn left to go to KJE,
                      then in expressway to jln bahar exit &amp; turn right to get to the

              <p>Have similar thoughts as yours, have feedback to LTA on considering to have that route under the BSEP scheme and also other factors like better to disperse the crowd to other hub points rather than channeling all to the same area (Boon Lay, Pioneer MRT, East-West Line) which also face the crowd from fellow residents and workers working at the Jurong/Tuas Industrial Area. <br><br>But LTA replied not feasible as it is not short-haul route and prone to traffic jam (think refering to KJE during peak hours), thought of can ply via Jalan Bahar and Old Choa Chu Kang Rd(recently expanded with more road lanes) if the jam is bad along the KJE.</p>
              <p>Talking about 179A, feasible for it to stop at Pioneer MRT? May result more students to take and improve the loading. <br>Perhaps all 179A start at Hall 1 Bus stop(during PM peak) instead of downrouting at the various different bus stops (e.g. Innovation Center Bus Stop), perhaps can give this task to Sv 179 instead?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">A possible soultion would be to
              switch to use the NTU shuttle buses. If the reason why you take
              179/179A is because you feel that the shuttle buses are
              ineffective, perhaps you should feedback
              to shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg (I found the email at <a style="line-height: 1.231;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/has/Transportation/Pages/GettingAroundNTU.aspx">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/has/Transportation/Pages/GettingAroundNTU.aspx</a>)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Personally, I feel that it would
              be good if more shuttle bus routes similar to the Campus Rider can
              be created, to ferry students from other MRT stations, such as Joo
              Koon (EW29), Choa Chu Kang (NS4), Masiling (NS8), Toa Payoh (NS19),
              etc. , so that the crowd can be diverted to more MRT stations and
              no MRT station would be overcrowded with students going to
              NTU.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perhaps you should suggest to the
              LTA to create BSEP bus route(s) that goes into NTU, from other
              areas. For instance, in view of the industrial areas at Wenya and
              Jalan Bahar coming up, maybe a new BSEP bus can be created to serve
              these industrial areas and loop at NTU.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;">Personally, I feel that 179's
              frequency is very long, such that how soon it arrives at the bus
              stop determines whether or not I would be late for school. As a
              resident who relies on 179 to get to Pioneer MRT Station, I wish
              that there can be a short-trip of 179 that loops at the PIE Nanyang
              Flyover (or at the roundabout at the junction of Pioneer Road North
              and Nanyang Crescent), operating during peak periods at least, so
              that buses can arrive more often and my bus connection to Pioneer
              MRT Station can be more reliable.</span></p>
              <p>I agree that there may be insufficient number of buses deployed
              to bus route 179, in particular during peak periods. </p>
              <p>However, I cannot say anything about the short-trip 179A because
              I never ride on 179A before. Maybe other forum users can share
              their experiences on short-trip 179A, if they have rode on the
              short-trip before.</p>

              <p>Regarding having shuttle service from the major MRT station during AM peak(similar to what some polytechnics have done), have feedback to the transportation division and the SU. They will look into the matter and perhaps study how it works (poly model), primarily due to cost concern. </p>
              <p>Adding on, the traffic flow in NTU can be improved.<br>E.g. Innovation Center bus stop can have a dedicated bus stop bay. Especially during PM peak when many students are going back, the layover of the bus at the bus stop will be long and cause a hindrance of other traffic users (due to one lane) and also have divider in place. Also prone for 179/179A to bunch together at this area and most likely travel in a convoy after that. If there is a dedicated bus stop bay, some of the 179/179A can consider skipping that bus stop (if there are 2-3 buses there and no one alighting) and serve the next bus stop (Hall 4) so on and so forth (more likely to improve the flow and efficiency)?</p>

              <p>Dear <span>SLBP</span>,</p>
              <p>You’ve better come clean with this underops and overops nonsense
              before <span>LTA</span> opens the Bus <span>OCC</span> and instead of chickenlittle2 saying “SLBP will
              handle it”, it’ll become “LTA will handle the matter”... and
              <span>SBST</span>/ SLBP slapped with $100k fine</p>
              <p>179A was severely underoperated at about 8 – 10 mins freq.. and
              worst, BC didn’t allow exit door boarding today…</p>
              <p>179 was over-operated…</p>
              <p>The best thing of all… pulling 179A buses over to 241…</p>
              <p>How come I know… Cos I saw a ghost bus plying 243W’s routing and
              eventually entering Jurong West St 91 w/ <span>EDS</span> displaying “OFF <span>SERVICE</span>”...</p>
              <p>I’ve checked the e-timetable.. the last downroute is at 0803
              from Jurong West St 91 [inbound bus stop]... I spotted this ghost
              bus at 0810+...</p>
              <p><span>LTA</span> has stipulated that <span>SLBP</span> is supposed to dispatch 179A once the queue at
              <span>BNL</span> Int is long enough because they do not
              want people to be left behind at each dispatch… But the queue was
              spotted to have reached Shilin Taiwan snack stall, which meant
              there’s about nearly 180 pax waiting…</p>
              <p><span>SLBP</span> really disappointing… Semi express
              service become slow service… Might as well dun operate.. all
              operate as 179 with 30 buses at 2 mins freq… See if chickenlittle2
              or <span>SLBP</span> later face more complains by pax at
              Pioneer Rd Nth being unable to board the bus at all…</p>
              <p>If <span>SLBP</span> people are looking and the took
              revenge on the previous post of exposing the exam period Sat slot
              matter, by all means go ahead…</p>
              <p><span>SLBP</span> people totally dunno how to manage
              179 at all… Today 179A properly operated, next day no bus… then
              subsequent days of course more people would queue for 179 and suan
              179A since <span>SBST</span> didn’t operate the bus
              properly…</p>
              <p>Then 4th day people queue for 179A again cos tuan by 179’s long
              queue and long runtime…</p>
              <p>What to do… <span>SLBP</span> the best loading expert…

              <p>I still take 179 and 179A daily but for the PM peak, it is still a headache (not saying it is not a headache on other services).</p>
              <p>Stopping at Pioneer is generally good at other times but at PM peak, every single full DD takes almost 2 minutes to completely offload. Together with 241, 255, Pioneer shuttle and the factory buses which eats up 1 of the 2 lanes, the entire road is already congested even without 179A stopping there. All thats needed to bring traffic to a standstill is a impatient driver who lets pax off while having the tail of the bus blocking the other lane.</p>
              <p>From a operator standpoint, it is not easy to balance the pax between 179 and 179A, because if more 179 are operated, the pioneer stretch gets congested which will eventually affect the runtime of many buses. More 179A are operated, then the alighting bay at BNL itself gets congested.</p>
              <p>Perhaps an alternative option would be to have a SWT 179B in the evening to alight pax at the opposite side of pioneer (coffee shop side) and terminate there since it is less congested. This could fill up the demand to alight at pioneer and also relieve some buses from using the congested bus stop. These BC can alternate between 179A and 179B so less traffic is going back into the interchange, while still getting their well deserved rest.</p>

              <p>This is what I feel. 179 current # of buses are managing the load quite well. I dont see a need for Bsep or additional buses. On an average, I would say each bus has 60-70 pax during peak. Booz of bunching, you might observe some buses awfully crowded, while a few empty. In total, I have never had a major issue with 179, maybe had to leave a bus coz I saw on iris the bus behind is in 2 mins.</p>

              <p>And you are right... There is definitely a perception issue and few that make the problem sound larger than it is. If to clear the perception, we want to create two loops, we can. That would in turn reduce the frequency at each stop, and stain people will complain.</p>

              <p>I agree with your point about the rush at Pioneer stop. During PM peak! almost all of 179/255/257 alights at Pioneer MRT stop and each bus can take  up to 2 ,mins to unload. I think this issue can be resolved only once JOO Koon comes up and then the load is distributed. Already some services like 182/254 do not call at Pioneer and go express from Boon Lay due to bus stop issue at Pioneer. I don't think much can be done about this today.</p>

              <p>And you are right... There is definitely a perception issue and
              few that make the problem sound larger than it is. If to clear the
              perception, we want to create two loops, we can. That would in turn
              reduce the frequency at each stop, and stain people will
              complain.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is not (only) about clearing perception. This idea is mainly about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">diverting the crowd</span> and making bus rides on 179 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more comfortable</span>.  </p>
              <p>Regarding the reduced frequecy and longer waiting time, this is perhaps inevitable. This is perhaps what NTU commuters have to trade-off for less crowding and quicker boarding. Anyway, <em>on the positive side,</em> I'm sure (most of) the students have access to wi-fi, where they can check what time the bus arrives and leave for the bus stop just on time. I don't think reduced frequency would be a problem.</p>
              <p>I think I got the idea after viewing <a title="http://youtu.be/aUuqq8RcaEg" href="http://youtu.be/aUuqq8RcaEg">http://youtu.be/aUuqq8RcaEg</a> and saw the <span style="color: #0000ff;">Red</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blue</span> campus loop shuttle bus services: they run in opposite directions as each other. S<em>omehow</em>, this makes me<em> </em>think of the Bukit Panjang LRT and... *light bulb* <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/lightbulb.png" alt="lightbulb.png"></p>
              <p>If NTU can come up with this idea of having its two internal shuttle bus services run in opposite directions(probably to split up the crowd), why not also propose this idea on 179?</p>
              <p>The earlier part of the loop of original 179 can enter/leave the campus via Lien Ying Chow Drive. The later part of the loop of original 179 can enter/leave the campus via Nanyang Drive. This would <strong>split</strong> the crowd into two, while <strong>enhance</strong> the bus connectivity within the campus.</p>

              <p>If the suggestion is to create congestion within NTU itself, then yes that works.</p>
              <p>The roads in NTU are not wide enough to allow large vehicles to pass at a high frequency. Even now 179 have to yield to opposite buses when turning after LWN library, and near the bus stop before innovation center.</p>
              <p>Also, that would be rather pointless since there would effectively be no boarding after WKWSCI since the rest of the route can be covered by 199.</p>

              <p>It was so peaceful then before Pioneer MRT Station opens. Everybody went to only Boon Lay MRT Station to take train and there was no traffic jam that serious (at least) at the section of Pioneer Road North between Jurong West Avenue 4 and Boon Lay Way.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, the traffic jams back then at the sections of Jurong West Avenue 4 (nearer to the cluster of temples), Jalan Boon Lay, Boon Lay Way and Jurong West Street 81 are still present today.</p>
              <p>When LTA reviews the public bus network of the Jurong West Extension again, <em>(at least) </em>in tandem with the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange in 2015, I hope that the bus routes plying such roads can be re-routed <em>somehow</em>. Similarly, <strong>bus lanes</strong> should be added to those sections of roads<em>, unless the bus routes are adjusted somehow</em>.</p>

Therefore, instead of avoiding Pioneer MRT Station, LTA should review the bus routes and do some changes to the roads(eg. <strong>add bus lanes</strong>), to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take advantage of Pioneer MRT Station to relieve the crowding conditions at Boon Lay Bus Interchange and the traffic jams on roads near Boon Lay MRT Station</span> <em>and also at other parts of Jurong West Extension, when people are encouraged to switch to public transport as the public bus connection to Pioneer MRT Station is enhanced.</em></p>
