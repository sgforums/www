              Dear SLBP,
              
              You've better come clean with this underops and overops nonsense before LTA opens the Bus OCC and instead of chickenlittle2 saying "SLBP will handle it", it'll become "LTA will handle the matter"... and SBST/ SLBP slapped with $100k fine 
              
              179A was severely underoperated at about 8 - 10 mins freq.. and worst, BC didn't allow exit door boarding today...
              
              179 was over-operated...
              
              The best thing of all... pulling 179A buses over to 241...
              
              How come I know... Cos I saw a ghost bus plying 243W's routing and eventually entering Jurong West St 91 w/ EDS displaying "OFF SERVICE"...
              
              I've checked the e-timetable.. the last downroute is at 0803 from Jurong West St 91 [inbound bus stop]... I spotted this ghost bus at 0810+...
              
              LTA has stipulated that SLBP is supposed to dispatch 179A once the queue at BNL Int is long enough because they do not want people to be left behind at each dispatch... But the queue was spotted to have reached Shilin Taiwan snack stall, which meant there's about nearly 180 pax waiting...
              
              SLBP really disappointing... Semi express service become slow service... Might as well dun operate.. all operate as 179 with 30 buses at 2 mins freq... See if chickenlittle2 or SLBP later face more complains by pax at Pioneer Rd Nth being unable to board the bus at all...
              
              If SLBP people are looking and the took revenge on the previous post of exposing the exam period Sat slot matter, by all means go ahead... 
              
              SLBP people totally dunno how to manage 179 at all... Today 179A properly operated, next day no bus... then subsequent days of course more people would queue for 179 and suan 179A since SBST didn't operate the bus properly...
              
              Then 4th day people queue for 179A again cos tuan by 179's long queue and long runtime...
              
              What to do... SLBP the best loading expert... playing with commuters...

              if SLBP really very smart...
              
              Then the timekeeper uncle last time go manipulate the 179/ 179A PM ops... really should have been able to maintain the 3 mins overops headways during PM mealbreak...
              
              end up real bus freq was 12 mins during PM mealbreak.. breach of QoS...
              
              Cos why? All anyhow manipulate, pull buses in and out... end up dunno when is the stipulated mealbreak etc... when the bus exit so on...
              
              then at night.. big mess when CCA n part time students are going home... but during this timing, timekeeper also bo chap so no more additional buses to feed to 179 anymore...
              
              chickenlittle2 keep on insisting 179 not profitable.. then why SLBP bother to dispatch 179 properly on weekend when loading is not even sustainable? Why must manipulate the weekdays peak hr headways and must keep on get LTA people to step into the matter? SLBP people dun feel bad?
              
              Obviously there's more to this... how come it's peak hr always got 179 overops, 179A underops problem...
              
              People x-fer to 157, 198... all gets screwed.. take 179 long journey time.. but scared later really no 179A.. but if 179A appears, the runtime might help people to save 1x 198's dispatch [board the earlier S198 bus instead]...
              
              SLBP really cmi in bus networking... people taking 179 &gt; 157/ 198 totally bo chap about travelling experience and though SBST earn 100% of the revenue...
              
              MRT rosak how? People boarding and alighting mess at Pioneer? SLBP will handle or must wait for LTA warden to get down to handle? and later people find out overops and SBST slapped with a fine?

              <p>I'm stupid or you stupid? As we all said including other users,if you want to complain,go to SBS Transit and complain,not here or maybe you can go meet the CEO of SBS Transit personally and ask and him why your favourite service 179 is underoperated. I don't care whether my favourite bus service us underoperated as long it has a good frequency,it is already enough for me</p>

              <p>Do u see the empty 179A and super crowded 179 running along Pioneer Rd Nth every evening? More 179A and get complain from other groups of people? SBST will receive more complain if they continue to operate more 179A as what you wish. Can you tell me why? when you are complaining to the whole world about your 179A but LTA did not impose any fine of this service? 179A means it is a supplement service to 179. Operating more 179A than 179, will just make SBST stupid by benefiting a small grp of people in th expense of the majority.<br><br>Why  I dont see students along Clementi Road complaining like what you did? Not only that, what about the people along Commonwealth Ave?</p>
              <p>Stop dwell about the MRT issue, you sound like the MRT at Pioneer breakdown everyday. More people prefer to take MRT than buses, I believe you know but you just want to cover it with your weird logic..</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">A possible soultion would be to switch to use the NTU shuttle buses. If the reason why you take 179/179A is because you feel that the shuttle buses are ineffective, perhaps you should feedback to shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg (I found the email at <a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/has/Transportation/Pages/GettingAroundNTU.aspx">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/has/Transportation/Pages/GettingAroundNTU.aspx</a>)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Personally, I feel that it would be good if more shuttle bus routes similar to the Campus Rider can be created, to ferry students from other MRT stations, such as Joo Koon (EW29), Choa Chu Kang (NS4), Masiling (NS8), Toa Payoh (NS19), etc. , so that the crowd can be diverted to more MRT stations and no MRT station would be overcrowded with students going to NTU. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Perhaps you should suggest to the LTA to create BSEP bus route(s) that goes into NTU, from other areas. For instance, in view of the industrial areas at Wenya and Jalan Bahar coming up, maybe a new BSEP bus can be created to serve these industrial areas and loop at NTU.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #a52a2a;">Personally, I feel that 179's frequency is very long, such that how soon it arrives at the bus stop determines whether or not I would be late for school. As a resident who relies on 179 to get to Pioneer MRT Station, I wish that there can be a short-trip of 179 that loops at the PIE Nanyang Flyover (or at the roundabout at the junction of Pioneer Road North and Nanyang Crescent), operating during peak periods at least, so that buses can arrive more often and my bus connection to Pioneer MRT Station can be more reliable.</span></p>
              <p>I agree that there may be insufficient number of buses deployed to bus route 179, in particular during peak periods. </p>
              <p>However, I cannot say anything about the short-trip 179A because I never ride on 179A before. Maybe other forum users can share their experiences on short-trip 179A, if they have rode on the short-trip before.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Suggestion: possible solution: if you have the time, create a video on how hard and how long it takes to board a 179/179A bus during peak period, then upload it onto Youtube and make it go viral. </p>
              <p>Based on a similar Youtube video uploaded about 1.5 months ago, I am quite sure this can improve the situation on 179A/179, or even prompt LTA to create a new BSEP that goes into NTU.</p>

              <p>Suggestion: possible solution: if you have the time, create a video on how hard and how long it takes to board a 179/179A bus during peak period, then upload it onto Youtube and make it go viral. </p>
              <p>Based on a similar Youtube video uploaded about 1.5 months ago, I am quite sure this can improve the situation on 179A/179, or even prompt LTA to create a new BSEP that goes into NTU.</p>

              <p><br>As a frequent user of 179 to NTU, I feel it will be very hard to create such a video. I have faced may be 1 or 2 times in my memory when I have not been able to board a 179 bus at Pioneer during AM peak. Yes, the bus can be packed to door.</p>
              <p>179A, I hardly see standing apart from some time slots. That's why I think it is now under-operated (if that is the case) and the buses are given to 179. I have no complaints with 179 operations.</p>

              <p>Dang u delete my part where my bio is at.
              a free bio though xD. <br>Back to topic:</p>
              <p>then 179A freq can be 10min-15min, since it is a supplementary, and I personally saw 179 with moar loadings than 179A. 179 freq remains same as above mentioned.</p>

              <p><br>And that is the case. Observe aft PIE towards Pioneer, buses in the evening between 5 and 6pm. You have a bus every 03 minutes. There are 3 179 buses followed with one 179A bus.</p>
              <p>When I observe, 2/3 179 buses are packed (must be 90-100 pax), the 3rd bus will have say 50-60 pax and the 179A will have 50-60 pax.</p>
              <p>So where is the need for 179A to have more buses and more frequency when even if 179A comes after 8 mins, does hardly get packed. Even SDs can be deployed on 179A actually.</p>
              <p>And this I am saying because many times whenever I have gone to Boon Lay to take 179/179A. I see the bus leaves with just 50-55pax on board during AM peak. 179 on the other hand leaves Boon Lay with 40-45 pax though has a much better frequency. When it goes to Pioneer it will touch 90pax or so but 179A will have peak load of 50-55pax.</p>

              <p>i think should have some more routes from somewhere to NTU to ease the crowds at boon lay &amp; pioneer mrt (in other words divert the crowd to other places)</p>
              <p>say Choa Chu Kang int &lt;-&gt; NTU ? what do u think? </p>
              <p>the route is simple... out of CCK int, turn left to go to KJE, then in expressway to jln bahar exit &amp; turn right to get to the direction of NTU</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">strange that how most people become hermits during exam time but this guy still has so much time to rant about 179 / 179A and talk about shipping statistics daily on his FB. leads me to think that either </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">NTU exams must have been terribly hard on him so he needs to find some place to vent and let loose, or that he is an ace at what he does and the exams were no big deal to him. </span></p>
