            <div class='col-md body'>Some buses in Taipei, Kaohsiung have a LED display installed at the front of the bus. After leaving a bus stop, the name of the next bus stop in mandarin followed by english is shown in a ticker tape manner, accompanied by a automated announcement in mandarin, taiwanese, hakka and english I think.<br><br>When it is very near the next bus stop, a slightly modified message will scroll on the LED display and a slightly modified announcement will play, indicating that the next bus stop is very near.<br><br>This system is apparently integrated with the bus stop bus arrival time LED display, which will show how many minutes till the bus arrives, plus even displaying messages such as that the bus is at the previous intersection. Information is displayed in a flipping screen manner.<br><br>It is also integrated with an online system that allows commuters to find out where the bus is on a map online.<br><br>Everything is under a project known as the Taipei e-bus system, currently installed at hundreds of bus stops, and is being expanded to cover thousand over bus stops by 2008.<br><br>Do google Taipei e-bus if you wish to find out more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Switzerland, the interface system is displayd on an LCD screen, about the size of a TVMobile. On the top is the service number and the name of the current stop. Below it are the names of 4 upcoming stops and their Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). At the bottom is the name of the last stop and its ETA as well as a small picture of a clock showing the present time. Once the bus is approaching its next stop, a chime is heard and the name is announced. Extra annoucements are made by the driver via a microphone for prolonged stops, such as at a train station. I noticed that the LCD screen is fairly new as it is found on the newer buses such as the Scania N94UB. On older buses like the Mercedes O405G, they use something like what SMRT Buses are using, but with an audio announcement. Sometimes it did screw up. I'm not sure if its because of the driver or otherwise but the screen will show the journey in the opposite direction or it will remain static. The same system is not only used on buses but on the trains and trams as well.</div>
