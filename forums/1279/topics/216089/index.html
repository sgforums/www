Trams would be IMPOSSIBLE in Bedok Rsvr/Kaki Bt and highly unfeasible in the areas that you mentioned. The city is already congested enough and hence there wont be enough space for a tram service. Tram may be possible perhaps only at East Coast/West Coast.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore had trams on 2 occasions and both were deemed as failures. The steam tram functioned for 9 years only from 1885-1894. The electric tram fared a little better, lasting for 22 years from 1905-1927. Competition didn't come from the bus companies because of an ordnance which prohibits private bus companies to operate within the trams' area of operation. Rickshaws were the biggest threat followed by the pirate taxis. Track degradation was the main problem for the electric tram mainly because of the poor road condition and the extreme tropical monsoon climate. Maintenance costs were high and so trolleybuses were brought in, starting from 1925, to replace the trams. And so, throughout the years until 1941, the Singapore Traction Company takes pride in having "The Largest Trolleybus System in the World".<br><br>Although the infrastructure was largely destroyed during the war, much effort had been made to restore the system, by both the Japanese and later the British, but it never regained to its pre-war state. The lost sectors were substituted with motor buses. Traffic improvements within the city in the 1950s saw some roads converted into one-way streets and this posed a problem as one of the trolley bus lines along these streets would now be heading against the flow of traffic. Around this period also saw the coming of more modern trolleybuses to replace the aged and battered pre-war vehicles. These new buses faced another problem. Being longer than their predecessor, they have a wider turning diameter and this posed problems at the turning points and at some junctions. It was not uncommon for a bus to 'come off the wire' and at the narrow junctions, the driver had to back up a little in order to complete the turn. Now, the Chinese bus comapnies were having a share in the city area and with their cheaper fares, commuters would tend to prefer the 'Chinese bus' rather than the trolleybus. Slowly but surely, the trolleybus routes were being replaced by motor buses until only the Geylang sector remained. The hammer blow came with the proposed development of Geylang. And so, it was decided to end the trolleybus system and the buses ran into the depot for the final time on the night of 10th November 1962.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... It seems Singaporeans don't like the idea of trams. I actually thought of this idea after seeing trams in many cities in Europe (e.g. Frankfurt, Vienna, Prague, etc) and North America (e.g. Portland, San Diego, Calgary, etc). I just find trams elegant and cool. (Maybe I'm the only weird person who thinks so. Haha.) You can just board a tram just like a bus without going through all the ticket gates and escalators. The ride is also quieter and smoother. It's also cheaper and more convenient to build than MRT.<br><br>Of course, I must say that trams also have problems. If there's a tram breakdown or collision, not only the tram service is disrupted, the normal road traffic is also affected because trams use the same road space as other vehicles. (Cannot imagine a tram breaking down in the middle of Orchard Road... LOL) Also, trams cannot be as fast as MRT, as trams are affected by traffic jams and traffic lights. Trams also cannot drive around obstructions like a bus. In fact, the tram in HK is so slow during peak hour that it's faster to walk.<br><br>But HKers still take the tram because it's cheap (HK$2 per ride, or SGD 40cents), and the HK tram attract a lot of tourists because a tram ride is a good way to see the streets and the life of HK. In fact many people see the DD tram as a symbol of HK. (Similarly, people see the San Francisco cable car as a symbol of SF, red buses as a symbol of London, tut-tut as a symbol of Bangkok, etc)<br><br>For Singapore, I can't really think of a mode of transport which people see as a symbol of Singapore. Maybe foreigners are impressed with the efficient and spotless MRT, the driver-less NEL, or the presence of both DD and articulated buses. But these transports are not really "uniquely Singapore"... Perhaps we don't really need a mode of transport to "represent" Singapore, since Singapore already have many famous symbols such as Merlion, Changi Airport, Esplanade, etc. Haha. (I better stop here now. I think my comments are getting more and more stupid... :p)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that taking a tram is a unique experience. So far, I have only taken trams in Zurich and it was a great way to see the city sights. But for the sake of Singapore's urban re-development, the tramlines simply had to go. I can't hardly imagine what the City would look like if the trams had stayed. Plus, with the tram's overhead wires, Singapore may not have DDs and that would not be good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I'm not wrong, I once heard that there was a proposal to build a kind of a people-mover system in East Coast Park. I think a non-air conditioned tram system (or one that is partially air-conditioned) could be a good choice for that. Maybe the whole of East Coast Park Service Road be turned into a right-of-way for the trams (converting them into tram trackage). Cars going into East Coast Park could instead park at one of the proposed underground carparks instead of the current messey roadside and surface parking configurations, and people could then transfer to the tram system to go where they exactly want in the park. The tram line could mostly follow East Coast Park Service Road, but in a few places it could wind into the park itself (the tracks "embedded" into the grass, <a href="http://world.nycsubway.org/perl/show?13412" rel="nofollow">somewhat like this</a>), and then could make a stop witin the park itself. Stations need not be a grand affair - even a simple concrete patch alongside the tracks long enough for the trams with a paved path will do (Although some decor is recommended)! Some places where stations can be located include the Big Splash, near Bedok Jetty, East Coast Park Hawker Centre, the resort and the adjacient area where the McDonalds is located (not sure what is that area's name), and the lagoon.<br><br>How about our old friend the 401? Well, a bus-to-tram terminal can be set up near the area where route 401 enters East Coast Park from Bedok, and passengers can alight there and transfer to the tram to go to where they want to go. Route 401 can then go onto the expressway, and then go out onto Marine Parade, following the same route as it does now, and then drop off the passengers at the East Coast Park end of Fort Road, where another bus-to-tram terminal can be set up, before turning back along the same route to Bedok.</div>
