              <p><strong>More than</strong> 14mins, not 14mins. It's somewhat
                  like waiting for 178 if I'm not wrong. Anyway, it's on the websites
                  also - 17 to 20mins after 1900. I feel that there should at least
                  cut short to 12-15mins...</p>
              <p>And don't compare with 178. 178 is rather low demand, no doubt
                  the frequency will be 20mins long. You can't expect them to waste
                  $$. </p>

              <p>No wonder. </p>
              <p>Reason why it takes so long is becoz despite its long waiting time, the number of people on the ride from Yishun all the way to Punggol will have at most 35 pax only. I rode it once during 8.20pm and have countlessly seen the empty buses at Anchorvale. Once, I saw one that was LITERALLY EMPTY. Maybe due to the lack of developments at the areas 85 exclusively serve, very little people will choose 85 over 965 to get back to the northeast. And yes, this caused a domino effect on svc 85's freq too. The peak hours were better though. Though again not much, but at least I won't get fed up from waiting for a bus then. </p>
              <p>A little advice to you: try to keep to the schedule so that you won't have to wait in agony. That's what I and a few of my other friends do when we wait for a bus with horrible frequency. Or during early morning or late night. Look at the time, know when to set out, board punctually and you won't have to warm up the bench. </p>

              <p>85 is to serve the Sengkang East/West and Punggol residents. Unfortunately, Punggol is still under development, and so is Sengkang West. Some at Sengkang East have a choice of 965, while the others, however not much, will have to stick to 85. But then, not many people there will really return from Yishun in late night. In fact, 965's main load from Yishun to Sengkang (which of course is more than 85 by a lot more, don't believe you go see) will clear at Blk 190C, the stop where they can change to key services such as 83, 86, 88 and 161. In fact, even the residents at Punggol will rather 965 --&gt; 82/83/136 becoz of the faster route 965 take. So that kills the Punggol load for 85 too. So not saying 85 is redundant, but only its golden age is not yet here. Which is why 85 remains at full fleet SDs and less frequent than other services like 161. </p>
              <p>For 39 it's different. People from Pasir Ris will take 39. And different is becoz PSR residents only have 39, no choice. And nobody will take bus round and round to Tampines and take 969. And it has better frequency too. Though no DDs are needed for 39 it does need more reliable freq coz the door-jamming loads are caused by delayed buses and not by its already-okay freq. </p>
              <p>Regarding how 85 is thought to be better than 965, I have to agree on that. 85 is thought to be better becoz of the misconception that SBS is ALWAYS better than SMRT. After all, everyone has its own good points and flaws. And for this one, I have to to give it for 965. Yes, I was also one who used to think 85 &gt; 965. </p>

              <p>I'm not a frequent rider of 85. But just to express my feel over a rather longer waiting time than some trunks svc I've board. Infact, I've board it<strong> twice</strong>. <strong>And</strong> I <strong>still</strong> feel that they can shorter the waiting time by a little, and perhaps re-route for the time being if possible.</p>
              <p>Tamp. Int quite cramp already...and if 39 were to also link to Downtown East, even better. Infact, it would be a better resource to link up PSR residents with the North area.</p>

              <p>I'm not a frequent rider of 85. But just to express my feel over
              a rather longer waiting time than some trunks svc I've board.
              Infact, I've board it before. But I just feel that they can shorter
              the waiting time by a little, and perhaps re-route for the time
              being if possible.</p>
              <p>Tamp. Int quite cramp already...and if 39 were to also link to
              Downtown East, even better. Infact, it would be a better resource
              to link up PSR residents with the North area.</p>

              <p>Erm okay. </p>
              <p>Agreed on the 39 part. Make it a resourceful service in the PSR, instead of wasting it in Tampines.</p>
