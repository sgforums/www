              <p>SMB66X, just to clarify, sv 85 is mainly useful as it serves as a townlink between Sengkang West and Sengkang East. It need not be compared to sv 965 in the first place as they have different routes. If anyone from Yishun wants to go to Sengkang, Punggol Road, best option is 965. If you want to go to other parts of Sengkang, 85 is a good option.</p>
              <p>But the loading of sv 85 apart from few time slots in peak hours is weak between Yishun and Sengkang, but within Sengkang area, even off-peak buses have a good 35-40 pax within Sengkang town.</p>
              <p>85 will also gain more popularity in coming years when Sengkang West and Punggol areas develop. For now, existing fleet is just fine and serving well. You will hardly see a sv 85 bus packed to the door. Having said that, I repeat that it is still an important service for within Sengkang town.</p>

              <p>On sv 39, I completely agree that going to Tampines Int is a waste because people will take 969 rather than 39 to Tampines. Those who want to go to Tampines Ave 7, 4, 5 or 2 can also take 858 and change at Seletar stop to 168. Why will they take 39 that has a long winding route to Tampines?</p>
              <p>I think the reason 39 goes to Tampines is because they don't have many terminating options. Either terminate at Pasir Ris Int or Tampines. Can't terminate at Pasir Ris Int as it will affect Loyang and Pasir Ris Dr 1 residents who take 39 to Yishun or Woodlands (transfer to 168 at Seletar).</p>
              <p>The option I would recommend is to divert it to Changi Village Terminal via Loyang Avenue. The issue there is it might not be in a position to take in more services as the terminal space is quite limited.</p>
              <p>The other option is to have it loop at Loyang Ave via Pasir Ris Dr 2.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Why do you need to add 1 more bus to sv 39? Already 3-4 buses have been added in the last few service improvements. Can't go SMRT style of sv 106 and sv 190 and then bleed losses.</p>
              <p>Better is to add 2 split shift DDs on sv 39 during AM peak. It will cater to the AM peak load and once Yishun Temp Interchange comes up, SBST can ply DDs and I am sure it will.</p>

              <p>If worst comes the worst can always make the service to go usual route, but instead of crossing to Tampines at Loyang Ave, it can head upwards and go back via perhaps Drive 3. This way, it also serves Downtown East people and can terminate at PSR int. </p>

              <p>Jln Kayu will have pax one. But most of the time is only ONE person. Or at most 3. Sengkang West only Blk 323B and Blk 317_ will have around 7-8 pax board the bus. Anyways, if you wanna change to 86, I always suggest you to take 965 and change to 86 at Blk 190C. Faster, more direct too. </p>

              <p>No. </p>
              <p>In fact 858 is same as 85. You change buses at Jln Kayu. But the thing is after you board 86 it still takes you to Blk 190C no matter what. So why stop in the middle of the expressway? Why not just take 965 straight to Blk 190C and change to 86?</p>

              <p>Agreed. 903 should fleet add to 7-8buses instead. Every morning[6:45-6:55], could hardly wait for 1 bus. During this slot, it's either you see bunches with full loading[on the first bus], or swey swey 2 buses infront departed before 6:50, and left with 1 full bus behind at 6:57am.<strong> [Weekdays]</strong></p>
