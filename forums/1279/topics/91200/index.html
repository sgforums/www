            <div class='col-md body'>From next year, LTA will start re-installing signages at MRT and LRT stations to reflect all 4 official languages at a cost of $2.2 million.<br><br>Installation will only take place during non-operation hours in the night.<br><br>Due to Punggol LRT being postponed to open in early 2005 (from original end 2004), the signages reflecting PGLRT will not come up until next year, and is expected to be completed by end of 2005. First to be changed is platform signages of station names, then those at station entrances, and finally directional signages in the station.<br><br>From Straits Times Interactive:<br><br><strong><span class="large">MRT signs to be multilingual by end 2005 </span></strong><br><br>BY THE end of 2005, multilingual signs will go up at all MRT and LRT stations to help those who cannot read English get around.<br><br>There will be Chinese and Tamil station names on signs at the station platforms and entrances, and on panels showing the map of the train system.<br><br>The word 'Fare' on fare charts in the station will also be translated into Chinese, Tamil and Malay.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority already revamped the signage system in July 2001 by differentiating MRT lines by colour and stations by numbers and letters.<br><br>But the opening of the North-East Line in 2003 - fully underground and therefore devoid of visual clues and landmarks for commuters - created new problems.<br><br>The 5,000 multilingual signs will cost the LTA $2.2 million.<br><br>The move, first mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech on Sunday, is part of the effort to help older Singaporeans feel at home.<br><br><strong>For fuller report, see Saturday's edition of The Straits Times.</strong><br><br></div>
