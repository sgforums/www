              <p>You missed out one more. 5 busfans were featured in a mini-documentary for the Panasonic Kid Witness News Singapore Competition in October which i eventually directed, together with my school. The version on Youtube wasn't the actual piece due to a special request made by one of the interviewees to not feature him on the internet. So, his part was cut-off.</p>

From wat i thot, this BC was like 'challenging' with another bus (190 crossover bus) to see whether which bus goes 1st. I rmb when the BC applied full force of brakes.. Woah, the contents of my bag were all sprawled ard the floor lol. Seat covers at the back have all fallen off &amp;  i thot i was going to fall to the seat infront of me..

              <p><strong>Have you forgotten...</strong></p>
              <p>...that two Service 168 drivers lost their way earlier this year?</p>
              <p>The first came with SBS 9487X. The Chinese driver apparently did not turn out of SLE into Woodlands and ended up being lost along with his 20 odd passengers. He had actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insisted</span>, according to various sources, that he knows the route and he could drive to the destination by himself but it did not materialise. The bus eventually found itself in Bukit Panjang at around 1300 hrs, a mere 2 hours after being lost. This was the subject of the headlines in the bus scene.</p>
              <p>The second one came on the same day. It was reported that SBS 3668E bound for Bedok also lost it's way - it turned into Tampines Interchange instead.</p>

              Should be, just like the 2008, although the F1 circuit route may remain the same for the next 5 to 6 yrs.. I've also Seen several diverted buses along Victoria St.

              <p>...that there were Free Rides on board 20 buses on 26 Aug 2008?</p>
              <p>Great Eastern celebrated their 100th Birthday by giving free rides on board 20 such services. 19 of them had special destos; the last one (Service 30 - SBS 9446P) used the normal desto.</p>
              <p>There were bus fans going around Singapore on that very special day trying to catch their free rides (you saved some $$$) as well as photos (We've got someone who took <strong>ALL</strong> 19 photos of the buses coupled with their special destos within a day alone).</p>
