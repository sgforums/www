              <p>Not much notable cameos, because all are Mercs.<br>DM Mercs with skyliner (ie SBS573P just a few days ago) and CAC Mercs as well.</p>
              <p>Perm buses slowly gets full body adverts, now, full fleet gets before full body ads.</p>
              <p>Redeployments:<br>SBS218R came in for SBS254K, which went to lay up then scrap subsequently.<br>SBS449R came in, exchange for SBS469H. 469H takes over the Nikon ad from 449R.</p>
              <p>Permanent buses as of 1 Jan:<br>SBS143Y SBS156K SBS254K SBS368R SBS410B SBS465T SBS469H SBS503S SBS543B</p>
              <p>Permanent buses as of now:<br>SBS143Y SBS156K SBS218R SBS368R SBS410B SBS465T SBS449R SBS503S SBS543B</p>
              <p>Other events:<br>SBS503S reported breakdown at AMK Int on this forums (Feb 2008). Gearbox jam after the breakdown subsequently repaired but with whorring sound till now. Weird thing is that, 543B stop having that whorring sound after 503S gets it.</p>
              <p><strong>Service 315 Summary Report</strong></p>
              <p>Notable cameos:<br>SBS1832K, SBS1863X, SBS1885H, SBS1887C<br>So far, in this year, SBS950J is the only bus with skyliner cameo on 315.<br>Mark IV cameos happens almost everyday on 315 but it's more of DM and Strider, seldom DM3500.</p>
              <p>Changes in shifts:<br>Duty 10S was introduced to this sv as a fleet addition, with SBS682H doing this slot. Later on, 9S, which crossover to sv317 no longer do that x-over. Duty 10S takes over. Bus used for x-over remains unchanged.</p>
              <p>SBS682H perm duty 9S<br>SBS814U perm duty 10S (315/317)</p>
              <p>Permanent buses as of 1 Jan:<br>SBS605G SBS678X SBS735P SBS803B SBS814U</p>
              <p>Permanent buses as of now:<br>SBS605G SBS678X SBS682H SBS735P SBS803B SBS814U</p>
              <p>The slots for sv315 sometimes just jump around, so at times, u might c 682H doing the x-over slot or else, S shift buses become full day. I'm not too sure if sv315 has this jumpbus system.</p>

              <p><br>1. I think TWS was refering to the newer Premium Services introduced by Premier Rent-A-Car and a few other private bus companies and also, the newer Premium Services that both SMRT and SBST introduced.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely. Forgotten about your 574 etc?</p>
              <p>Now I shall do an in-depth review of the year's happenings in the bus scene. Despite the current economic downturn, lots of events happened that led us to smile, to frown, or even sometimes cry. In order of rank per category, the most memorable...</p>
              <p><strong>Events</strong></p>
              <p>1. SMRT's newest bus in nearly a decade - the Mercedes Benz OC500LE, introduced at the SMRT Go Green campaign on 30 Apr.</p>
              <p>Subsequently registered SMB 0001H and first deployed to Service 190 on Sunday 29 Jun. Was said to have been cancelled (the news got in in at about 3 am on the same day). Someone believed the news was true and I got myself tricked. Eventually came out, but broke down at PIE over Eng Neo due to gearbox and battery problems. Only about two bus fans boarded the bus.</p>
              <p>Repaired and came out on Tuesday 1 Jul. That was the first ride for most bus fans here. I did not have the time to attend or witness all these due to personal commitments, but it was a truly memorable experience of the year.</p>
              <p>2. SBS 8074K and TIB 1138M involved in an accident at Yio Chu Kand mid-Jun while I was away in Malaysia on holiday. When I learnt about the news, was surprised and shocked since it was unexpected - the KUBs boasted lots of safety features.</p>
              <p>Subsequently believed to have led to the decision not to register buses with registrations ending with the number '4'.</p>
              <p>3. SBST introduces two demonstrators - a Volvo B7RLE (SBS 8030L) on 10 Jan and a MAN 18.240 HOCL-NL (SBS 8031J) on 22 Jul. I did not have the time to spot SBS 8030L but did for SBS 8031J on it's first day.</p>
              <p>Took a ride on SBS 8031J. Performance is quite good. What wows me was that it was vibration free as compared to the other buses. I voted it the bus of year 2008.</p>
              <p>SBS 8030L deployed to Service 174 as well as Fast Forward 174e; made two-three month short stint on Service 185 before returning to original service. SBS 8031J deployed to Service 6 and subsequently on x-over to Service 354. Redeployed to Service 17 w.e.f. 9 Sep.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Redeployments</strong></em></p>
              <p>1. SMRT's mass redeployments between buses, services and depots, one on 23 Mar and the other in Jun. I could still remember that me, along with 6 other bus fans, went around Bukit Batok as well as Bukit Panjang to take photos of the various buses on the eve of the Mar redeployment. I could even remember that TIB 0504X broke down on that day!</p>
              <p>2. Complete/Premature withdrawals of SBST's Volvo B10M Mark 2s and the Scania N113CRB NACs, which resulted in a redeployment scramble among the various depots.</p>
              <p>My last ever ride on the Volvo B10M Mark 2 is SBS 1887C on Service 11 on the evening of 4 Apr. Took it by chance since I was to attend a concert held by my school later at night. Felt a sense of nostalgia since they were to be withdrawn. (<a href="http://sbs9199c.fotopic.net/p49515838.html">http://sbs9199c.fotopic.net/p49515838.html</a>)</p>
              <p>My last ever ride on the Scania N113CRB NAC (and also my LAST EVER Non-Aircon ride) is SBS 3634C on Service 6 on the evening of 5 Dec. With thanks to the kind and knowledgable BC, I also took my LAST EVER photo of a Non-Aircon - it's none other than an interior shot itself. (<a href="http://sbs9199c.fotopic.net/p55326750.html">http://sbs9199c.fotopic.net/p55326750.html</a>)</p>
              <p>3. ADDs introduced on more and more services - a sign of service improvements in order to cater to the increasing demands since LTA is promoting public transport as a choice mode.</p>
              <p>Service 5 got theirs in early Jan, despite my initial prediction that they would not be one of the services to receive them due to the small roads at Loyang. Certainly explains clearly why I think it was the "best ever service that SBST has introduced".</p>
              <p>Service 225 got theirs on 18 Feb. Timesheet wise, revision no. 20, both ADDs doing E shifts with no overnight parking. Buses are SBS 9231S for Green plate (3E) and SBS 9355T for White plate (53E). I was surprised when I learnt about it and sent out the info to almost everyone. Response was overwhelming - in one form, there were two of us who went out to take photos of it on their first day.</p>
              <p>Service 151 got theirs on 4 Aug, unusually used 4 units of B9s. Bus fans scrambled to Hougang Int as well as Kent Ridge to take photos of it on their first day. Later in same month, got VOs as cameos.</p>
              <p><strong>Cameos</strong></p>
              <p>1. SBS 8009A on Townlink 222 (30 Apr). Unbelievably, I was the first to spot the cameo (another bus fan saw the same bus but it was off service when he saw it). Many bus fans (including seniors) came to witness the cameo, even taking photos of it.</p>
              <p>2. SBS 8031J on Service 5 (11 Oct). Was waiting to take SMB 0011D on Service 67 when I got info from someone about the cameo. Regretably did not have a photo but at least I did take a ride (with another bus fan).</p>
              <p>3. First B9 cameo on Service 5 - SBS 7340Z (17 Mar). Comes after ADDs were introduced on Service 5 in Jan. As many as about 10 or more bus enthusiasts took a joyride to Pasir Ris. I was unable to make it (despite being in Pasir Ris) since I had to work on a school project.</p>

              <p>ADDs introduced on this service on 18 Feb. Timesheet was revised to revision 20 to include two se- 9xx block slots. SBS 9231S did the Green Plate (3E) and SBS 9355T did White Plate (53E). In turn, fleet reduction for 225W (3684H). SBS 3683K (G), SBS 3684H (W) and SBS 3721J (W) out of 225.</p>
              <p>First ADD to cameo on 225W - SBS 9266S on 4 Mar.</p>
              <p>First ADD to cameo on 225G - SBS 9578S on 24 Apr.</p>
              <p>Weekday timesheet revision on 7 Jul. Revision 21; no change to order of buses.</p>
              <p><em>From this part onwards, the information is unconfirmed.</em></p>
              <p>Timesheet revision for Sat schedule. Includes an ADD for 225G.</p>
              <p>Timesheet revision for Weekday schedule. ADDs serve P shifts instead of E shifts to cater to the increasing demand at night where queues between 8 pm and 9.30 pm can stretch right up to the next berth (B6; 225 is B5).</p>
