              <p>While quite a lot I'm saying here has been said before, I still want to mention a few incidents that happened in the local bus scene that made me take notice this year:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Double-deckerisation En Masse!</strong> Several bus routes, many of which we all never imagined could have double-deck buses, started receiving double-deck buses, to the delighted surprise of many. Routes like 6, 37, and 151 (among many others) received double-deck buses, and often newer-ones such as Volvo Super Olympians and B9TLs. I still remember some time back when someone posted a (posed) photograph of a B9TL on route 6, and everyone quickly dismissed the possibility of such a deployment. Now, though as far as I know, such a deployment is <em>still</em> not reality, there's a very good chance it might actually happen one day.</li>
              <li><strong>The Great SMRT Bus Depot Mix-up Switcheroo.</strong> SMRT, make up your mind - where do you want this bus, this route, and this bus driver to be, and on what route? Several messy redeployments occurred at SMRT throughout the year, bringing buses that otherwise were never (or very rarely) deployed on certain routes a daily occurrence. For example, route 171 used to see a nearly-full Mercedes or Dennis Lance fleet, but the redeployments introduced large numbers of Scanias to the fleet, and route 960 started receiving large numbers of non-bendy buses being deployed with (alarming?) regularity.</li>
              <li><strong>Introducing, ∞ Premium Bus Routes from SBS Transit and SMRT (and then withdraw ∞ - (∞ - 1) of those routes in the end). </strong>I don't even know where to start, and I didn't even to bother to count, but quite likely you will need all your fingers and toes (and maybe those from your friends) to count the number of new Premium bus routes from both SBS Transit and SMRT introduced this year and last, only to have many of them withdrawn later on this year when the bus companies find that exactly 0 passengers take many of those routes, thanks to the frightening sky-high fares ($3.80 or thereabouts, anyone?), in a country where people groan about fares at 71¢. This, in many ways, is a repeat of the silliness exhibited by the bus companies when Express routes were first introduced - and you thought they could had wisened up to history.</li>
              <li><strong>China Invades Singapore ('s Bus Network). </strong>As even Malaysians begin shunning bus driving in their search for a job, local bus companies are forced to look to China for new bus drivers. While this trend started a few years ago, it's effects has been the most visible this year. Most of the feedback I have personally heard about them are not favourable, with many complaining that they do not observe proper driving etiquette, some getting involved in accidents just a few days into their jobs, others losing their way, and one fellow bus driver posting here grousing about their ignorant attitude to local culture. However, with Singaporeans long shunning this job in their futile search for that job that gives them endless supply of money with zero effort ongoing in their dreams, it is likely that bus companies will continue to be forced to look for bus drivers from China; whether this will affect the quality of bus service in Singapore may remain to be seen, although recent incidents don't seem to bode well.</li>
              <li><strong>No! No Duplication! I Mean, We Allow Duplication! </strong>Route 128, the first new bus route in nearly two decades that is delibrately allowed to duplicate a MRT line, is introduced on a trial basis. However, with long journey times, a messy skip-stop arrangement, and poor routing that only duplicates a relatively small sector of the MRT system - less than half of the perennially overcrowded North-South Line and one tiny segment of the East-West line in the city area, has made this route unpopular with most serious commuters, many preferring to continue suffering in six train carriages crammed full of people. LTA, which helped pave the way for the route (pardon the pun), has been commented by some to be intepreting commuter's wishes wrongly, and not understanding the commuter's need at all, when this route was introduced - another fine example of LTA's boneheaded-ness.</li>
              <li><strong>The Coming Out of the Local Bus Ethusianst Scene.</strong> There's mainstream hobbies, there's hobbies that are a tad bit weird, and there's hobbies that are really out there on the fringe, seated within niches. But in Singapore, even the description of a fringe hobby for bus ethusianism is a bit too mainstream; in a country where herd mentality and comformism seems almost the law, being a bus fan really wipes you right off the map as a wacko. Before this and other similar forums, most of you, I believe, were carrying out your hobby alone or with a small group of friends. While the forums, as a first step in bringing people together, happened years ago, the culumination of our effort to get noticed happened this year, with not one, but two television programs showcasing us doing our stuff. To go from having to do our hobbies "in the closet", so to speak, to being able to tell the country about it is no small effort, and I believe everyone deserves a pat on their back for putting our rightful place on the map.</li>
              <li><strong>The Story of the Bus Captain Who Lost His Way to Prosperity (a.k.a. The Very Lost Route 168 Bus Driver).</strong> This has got to be the most asburd "bus driver lose his way" story anyone could ever hear in their lifetime: one stubborn bus driver, one double-deck bus on route 168 full of passengers, and a missed expressway exit. What ensued was a two-hour ride of their lives that eventually got everyone in Bukit Panjang, a real distance and at least a bus ride away from where everyone was trying to go to - Woodlands. Despite several passengers (all of whom probably knew the route better than the bus driver himself) attempting to get the driver back on route, the bus driver stubbornly refused to listen to any of them, insisting he <em>knows</em> the route. Nothing was ever heard of from the bus driver again, but it might be possible that he is now struck at home and eating cup noodles and neighbour's leftovers for his three daily meals - you know what that means. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></li>
              <li><strong>SMRT's Faulty New Bus.</strong> This has got to be another one of those "unbelievable" moments this year. SMRT's first new bus in eight years, the Mercedes OC500LE, was shown off to the media, then promised to be deployed by a certain date. But, as with SMRT, such promises were down the toilet the moment it was made. Finally, at the end of June, amid a swirl of rumours it debuted on route 190 with the all-new, Trans-Island-heritage-destroying registration of SMB 1H, only to leave everyone stranded right in the middle of nowhere on Pan-Island Expressway when it broke down - on it's first day and after numerous delays. Makes you wonder what they were doing with the bus in between the media showcase and the time it debuted. And it was also a long time again, before more Mercedes OC500LEs were introduced on the roads, but only mostly for those living in Choa Chu Kang and Yishun, with many other areas (Sembawang, for example) being completely neglected.</li>

              <p>...that there were Free Rides on board 20 buses on 26 Aug 2008?</p>
              <p>Great Eastern celebrated their 100th Birthday by giving free rides on board 20 such services. 19 of them had special destos; the last one (Service 30 - SBS 9446P) used the normal desto.</p>
              <p>There were bus fans going around Singapore on that very special day trying to catch their free rides (you saved some $$$) as well as photos (We've got someone who took <strong>ALL</strong> 19 photos of the buses coupled with their special destos within a day alone).</p>
              <p>Too bad, I was unable to come and catch them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>Bus captains were forced to manually update the fare stages after the EZ-Link service went haywire.

              <p><strong>Have you forgoten...</strong></p>
              <p>...the confusions running amok among Singaporean bus enthusiasts around the period during the Singtel Singapore Grand Prix 2008 (a.k.a. First F1 Night Race)?</p>
              <p>You could remember that nearly 30 odd services were affected by road closures after road closures, resulting in diversions and more diversions. Service 195 in particular, was forced to use the bus stop at Block 92 of Commonwealth Drive as a makeshift bus terminus. Two SWTs, mainly coming from 56 (56A) and 195 (195B), were also introduced to cater to the demands during the race season.</p>
              <p>You could remember that you took a joyride of SMRT's newest in town - the Mercedes Benz Sprinter. Those were part of the free bus-bridging service as a result of the several road closures around the race park. You also commented on both the good and bad aspects of the bus.</p>
              <p>You could also remember risking yourself (and even your life) to take photos of the Chartered buses at Kallang and Lavender MRT Stations on shuttles to the race grounds. A few of us, including me, got unlucky and were caught by the police for taking photos of them. I was lucky though to have my IC at that time or else I would have to ask for help to bail me out.</p>

              <p>Erm...you won't risk your life if you are arrested by police unless you are trafficking drugs or you murdered someone.</p>
              <p>Anyway for those who want to know more , the Chartered buses are a security concern as they ferry locals and foreigners to the race grounds...a good target for any terrorist acts. So by photographing them - Police thinks you are getting intelligence for terrorists.</p>

              <p>'Confusion running amok': Too exaggerating to use such words. Maybe its only your bloodstream that is running at high tone. I was working with SGP and I don't feel a skipped heartbeat. BTW I was at the coach bay. Take things easily and on a more simple outlook and you might live a few years more.</p>
              <p>Oh, and maybe because I have the SGP pass, taking photos at the parking area for the shuttles was no problem. I bet there were several guys (non-staff bus fans) who shot pictures and had no problem too. Just don't look and act suspicious.</p>

              <p>Have you remembered the previous years..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>..when LRT broke down &amp; buses r deployed to serve the passengers to their destination? The route to CCK is abit complicated where BC needs to go from CCK Way to infront of Lot 1 bus stop via CCK Ave 3 -&gt; CCK Loop (Blk 355 - Blk 350 area). I remembered 1 time i saw this BC trying to manouver the sharp left turn at CCK Loop (he was driving a DAF), the front (where the battery box is) hits the kerb &amp; big thick smoke came out from it, but the BC didnt care &amp; zoomed past me. It was like a loud screeching sound when it hit it.. Wat do u guys think is tht? Pls comment.</p>

              <p>Conclusion for 2008:</p>
              <p>Best selling private bus (proper bus chassis) model of the year: Isuzu LT134P (as usual)</p>
              <p>Best selling private bus (anything which is registered as a bus): Toyota Hiace Commuter.</p>
              <p>Best selling European brand for coaches/private buses: Scania.</p>
              <p>2008 also saw two new Chinese bus manufacturers for Singapore: The biggest bus manufacturer in China, Yutong and also the not so pleasant Zondas</p>
              <p>Toyota gained the new minibus market for the first half of the year with their Coaster, but Mitsubishi Fuso was the dominant one in the second half of 2008 (and still is) with their Deluxe Rosa.</p>
              <p>As with the past few years, Mercedes Benz isn't getting any orders from Singapore's private bus companies for proper bus chassis (they've got some for their Vito, however), allowing Scania to gain some market share. Same goes for Volvo, very little orders (or maybe even 0) for new Volvo coaches.</p>
              <p>Crappiest new things to run on Singapore's roads (private bus): The new Isuzu NQR which WTS Travel uses it on The Sentosa hotel shuttle (PA7489D), it shouldn't even be used as a bus, its a lorry chassis, and the new Zondas, expect to see more of them as we have signed a FTA with China.</p>
              <p>Best new coach of 2008: MAN SÜ283F/A91, its probably the quietest bus
                  you can find on Singapore's roads currently. Notably, MAN is a newcomer
                  (relatively) into Singapore's coach market (ok lah, they had orders
                  back in the 1990s from SJE, but then again SJE is a public bus company).</p>
