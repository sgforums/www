            <div class='col-md body'>As i observe, they get the priorities wrong !<br><br>To really make meaningful sense, the fares have to reflect the level of 'doorstep-ness' &amp; comfort &amp; convinence levels offered to commutors, besides the issues of travelling times !<br><br>Taking the car (hence taxi) as the ultimate form of personal transport (since it excels in most if not all of the above qualities !) then logically it'll have to cost the most to use it. Therefore i've no issue with taxi fares being much higher than bus or train fares.<br><br>Next down the line of personal transport appeal would have to be the bus (minibuses too) BEFORE the train, since it's well known by now that train travel tend to involve plenty of walking up &amp; down in &amp; out of stations, with lower chances of getting any seat &amp; even if there's a seat, it's a hard seat instead of a more normal car-like seat with cushioning etc. !! Furthermore, trains do NOT tend to offer doorstep-like levels of service as well as the bus or taxi can (in that order) !<br><br>Therefore taking all these factors into consideration, it's only perfectly logical that train fares HAVE to be priced cheaper than bus fares, NOT the same level (they simply don't deserve that level of 'status') &amp; most sensibly NOT MORE than bus fares !!!!<br><br>As a commutor, i'm not interested to know if it really costs more to operate a train service due to any higher overheads from infrastructure &amp;/or equipment costs etc., especially when you have the situation nowadays whereby the same operator who runs bus services ALSO runs train services ! I expect them to price their bus &amp; train fares such that the bus revenue HAVE to generate higher profits (than train revenue) to cover any losses or lower profits from the train operations. That's because the social costs (due to traffic congestion, vehicle exhaust &amp; noise pollutions etc.) of operating the bus services may be higher compared to trains but infrastructural &amp; equipment costs of bus operations tends to be lower than for trains, thereby also a factor (besides what i've mentioned in the paragraphs above !) which can &amp; have to result in higher profits for bus operations compared to train operations !<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by thinker:<br><strong>SINGAPORE : The Public Transport Council has approved fare increases for trains and buses from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]July</span></strong>.<br><br>Bus and train fares can go up by <strong>10 cents across the board. This is if commuters pay cash. </strong><br><br>However,<strong> if they use ez-link link cards, fares will increase by one to two cents for buses and one to three cents for trains. </strong><br><br>Student fares and prices of student and NS men concession passes will not be increased.<br><br>Senior citizens will, however, be affected by this increase.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
