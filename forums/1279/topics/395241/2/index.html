              <p><br>Those are my fellow colleagues. They promoting the service at Serangoon just now. Later in the day (sunday), they will be there to promote the service there. Today, Sv 731 have an acceptable demand for it's first day.</p>

              <p>Basically, this service is ran by Blackliner, a limo service company which offers limo rental of Audi A6s and Vito. The boss is a young entrepenuer which runs the company while studying in University. I can say that this company has the potential to go far. The service uses only one Mercedes Benz Sprinter painted in plain black. The company runs two services; Sv 731 (as mentioned in this thread) and Sv 728 which runs from Fidelo Street to Shenton Way in the morning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the fares, it will be $3. Ez-link card payment is accepted onboard. Sv 731 will run one bus per hour stopping at Heereen, Far East Plaza, Macdonald's House and Suntec City. It operates on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays.</p>

              <p>Thank you for riding Sv 731.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, Service 731 has been recieving lack of ridership and they are currently considering scrapping the service if this goes on after 6 months. There are times that I was the only pax on the bus. Both the sat and sun perm drivers mentioned the poor ridership to me when i was joyriding the bus last month. It is common for the service to get zero passengers per trip.</p>

              <p>Again, thanks for riding and on behalf of Blackliner and flydirectbus, the company which runs this service, we hope you continue supporting this service.</p>

              <p>Seriously, im not surprised that theres a lack of ridership for this service. Freq is irregular and u cant find a single timetable at the bus stops.</p>
              <p>To make things worst, buses dont arrive on time. There was once when i waited 10mins before the published timings on their website and yet i missed the bus.</p>

              <p>Hey man,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for riding Sv 731.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically, Service 731 has been recieving lack of ridership and they are currently considering scrapping the service if this goes on after 6 months. There are times that I was the only pax on the bus. Both the sat and sun perm drivers mentioned the poor ridership to me when i was joyriding the bus last month. It is common for the service to get zero passengers per trip.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again, thanks for riding and on behalf of Blackliner and flydirectbus, the company which runs this service, we hope you continue supporting this service.</p>

              <p>Very comfortable ride, very sad if it'll be withdrawn. My feedback in order to improve this service would be;</p>
              <p>1) Change the interval from 1h10m to 30mins</p>
              <p>2) Display timetable and route info at bus-stop</p>
              <p>3) Put up ad/info on Aljunied Town Council newslettler (do note that S'goon North, Toho Dr and S'goon Gdn belongs to ATC), and also post on HDB flats notice board and neighbourhood</p>
              <p>Although bus no. already displayed on bus-stop poles, but no one would know the existence of this service. Maybe you can help me feedback to your friends in order to improve this service.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>Yesterday schedule was accurate, I took it opp 139 at 1510hrs sharp, and reached Far East Plaza at 1540 due to jammed at CTE. Return trip was late by 5 mins when I boarded it at Far East Plaza at 2135hrs, which actual arrival time was stated 2129hrs. Do note that 731 had to skipped Suntec on Sat due to NDP rehearsal.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
