              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, actually I understand your good intention. For new bus services, there is already product promotion on bus panels at bus poles. Just that it is not big enough and also not attractive to most people. There are not many people who are really keen on such items like bus services. They just take take the most convenient thinking in their mind and take the bus. With due respect to the female gender, they do not have sense of direction and often just relied on their personal preferences to take buses. They simply do not bother about 36B or whatsoever. If they can take taxi, they will just take. </p>
              <p>For those who are really interested and very enthusiastic, they can even be browsing the bus service on apps even if they are not taking the bus services. Just take for example, loading for sbs 116 on first few weeks and first few months start to show difference. The loading for sbs 11 on first few days and first few months will be different too. Time will tell. There is really no need to put one big banner to tell all of them. Those along tanjong rhu should have known by now as many have approached their MP and lobbied for this change. So just one posting by the MP is much more effective.</p>
              <p>Long time ago, when they are still using the A3 size panel to show new bus services, many people at the bus stop also never bother to read and when the bus goes by, they are all pointing at the bus, wondering why got such services. This shows that most people simply do not bother unless it affects them directly. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, the last three lines suggest that they have approached their MP to request for route extension. They should have known the results by now as the MP Facebook posting has informed them. </p>
              <p>This clearly did not mean that ordinary Singaporeans must lobby MP then can have route extension. It only means since they request MP, the MP will notify them the results regardless if successful or failure. When people ask a person, naturally must reply.</p>
              <p>So please don't misconstrue the sentences. </p>
              <p>There are people who write in to LTA on their own personal behalf, there are those who go through MP and there are also those who go through other feedback channels on group request, corporation, company request. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, they already did their very best and spoonfed everybody. The detailed routes are already listed on the glass panels for all to see. These info are more than enough. Only services like ...A and ...B which are not so crucial are not listed. Cheers.</p>

              <p>DD, dun use the word spoonfeed, only NUS/NTU students r spoonfed, basic bus info is a must to be provided to commuters in all countries, our bus info is not tt fantastic aft i fly to some many countries across the globe, it pales in comparison...</p>
              <p>Some bus stops display A, B rts.  Juz need authorities to standardised thru out SG</p>
