              After I exited Kallang MRT this afternoon,  I saw SBS1941D on svc 11 turning towards Sims Ave. There were about 3 pax onboard. 
                      Then at Lor 1 Geylang Ter, I met a group (or many groups) of bus fans boarding 11 too. Anyway the next bus, SBS6446J, arrived in about 20 minutes (I will check the exact timing later), with only bus fans (it seems) boarding the bus.
                      At Sims Ave, 2 pax boarded the bus but I'm not sure if they are bus fans
                       At Mountbatten Rd, 1 pax. At Stadium (the bus stop at Stadium Cres), 1 pax and some bus fans.
                      Strangely, the bus calles at all bus stops at Stadium Cres and Stadium Walk before going to Tanjong Rhu, while according to the poster only 2 of them should be called at. (Same thing happened for the return journey) Hence 2 pax boarded at Stadium Wal opposite Stadium. (Seems like they wanted to go towards Lor 1)
                      1 pax alighted at Tanjong Rhu Rd and 3-4 alighted at Rhu Cross (excluding bus fans). I alighted here to wait for the next bus. Meanwhile svc 158 arrived and 3 pax and some bus fans boarded 158.
                      Then I borded the next svc 11, SBS6400R(with 159 guide cutout), together with 12 pax (excluding bus fans, and including a group of 7 ppl who missed 158 because they didn't see it). 7 pax boarded the bus along Tanjong Rhu Rd. At Stadium (including all 4 stops), 12 pax alighted including the group of 7. 1 pax boarded at Mountbatten Rd, 4 alighted at Geylang Rd and 5-6 alighted at Lor 1 Ter. (All excluding bus fans)
                      
                      Btw, the group of 7 young ppl thanked BC for finally bringing another service to Tanjong Rhu. They said they used to have only 158 which never arrived..

              When I saw them taking photos when the bus arrived, talking about morning fleet, cameos, 1941D and taking many pieces of service guides, it's obvious to me that they are not normal passengers.. By the way even they seemed to be surprised that all the bus fans accidentally boarded the same bus

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes I know the shortest is sbs 284. But please read my earlier sentence for sbs 11 carefully. 'No longer one of the shortest route'. This means sbs 11 used to be one of the few routes which are the shortest. Cheers.</p>
