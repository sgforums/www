              <p>Of course! Sbs 43 is direct from IMH to NEX. Who does not want a
              direct and faster journey??? IMH to buangkok mrt then mrt to NEX
              slightly more troublesome! </p>

              <p>No I meant... People wanting to take MRT.. Can just take 43 to Buangkoi instead of 43 to Serangoon... But if you observe there are v few people who take 43 to Buangkok even though it is so close but prefer to take 43 to Serangoon instead... And CCL cannot be the reason as 43 takes them to Paya Lebar as well... Other side of CCL is off peak direction from Serangoon.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I am just predicting only. It all depends if they want to make sbs 43 the only service to serve the new roads in Punggol west or not. If they decide it to be, sbs 43 will sure get new buses and improved frequency. If they decide a new service in the next few months, sbs 43 will remain status quo. Cheers</p>

              <p>Oh okay if you mean people wanting to take MRT. In any way, I just want to point out that as of this moment, sbs 27 and sbs 43 are the only 2 doorstep bus services at buangkok mrt. Both are immensely popular. </p>

              <p>Great news but only the twice loop at National stadium..guess use small plate..</p>
              <p>I think only 3 buses for a start,2A/P &amp; 1S..events should have another bus.If loads picking up then another daily bus will be added.</p>
              <p>141 should extend to Sims Place terminal</p>

              <p><br>Even if it loops twice, it calls on different stops, so should not be a problem to differentiate.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes it is true and I agree. However, they prefer word of mouth and usually this is very powerful. Because residents in many estates of Singapore are very keen on such news of either new or extended bus services which benefit them. It is not everyday that estates can get new bus services serving them. However with increased population and HDB flats, more bus services must be introduced. Now I can sense an air of excitement and euphoria with each introduction of new BSEP service. People just keep hoping that it is in their estate. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, you forget that most people will normally go out every single day. So when they are at the bus stop, the first thing they will do is look at the pole from afar. They will see the new number suddenly come out on the plates at the bus pole. Then everything follows accordingly. Even for those who does not look at the pole, surely the new bus will turn up either in their direction or opposite direction. So no problem they will have opportunities to get to know the new services. Cheers</p>
