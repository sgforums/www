            <div class='col-md body'>This is not strictly about buses, but I have some queries on Changi and Upper Changi Roads.<br><br>1) Since there is now a New Upper Changi Road, how did Upper Changi Road connect to Changi Road formerly? Upp Changi Road ends at Anglican High School now. I suppose it ran almost parallel to New Upper Changi Road and connected to Changi Road at Siglap Road junction.<br><br>(Update) Hypothesis: Could it be that Chai Chee Street (ends at ITE Bedok) and Bedok North Street 1 (ends at Junction of Bedok North Avenue 3) was part of the former Upper Changi Road? These 2 roads have non-standard curvature that is more like of older Singapore Roads. BNS1 seems to be able to link smoothly to Upper Changi Road and CCS can also link to Changi Road via the 2 subsidiary roads at Changi Road (which are also called Changi Road).<br><br>2) Where are the locations for the former 10.8km and 13.3km markers on Upper Changi Road? Upper Changi Road is now so short, I can only see a 14km marker (junction of Bedok Road) in the street directories. I see a 18km marker on Upper Changi Road North, which I believe was part of the former Upper Changi Road. This makes me think that 13.3km and 10.8km markers were in the current Bedok HDB estate and not nearer to Somapah.<br><br>If anyone can get a softcopy map of the former Upper Changi Road, I would appreciate it a lot!

I can only remember vaguely that either Chai Chee Street or Chai Chee Drive was a renamed road and it was formerly known as Upper Changi Road.  When I was younger, I would often look at street directories and I was wondering how could there be 2 Upper Changi Roads in Singapore (1 at Chai Chee and the other near Bedok Road).  It was in the late 80s (if I remember correctly) that the government renamed the roads to Chai Chee Street or Drive.</div>
