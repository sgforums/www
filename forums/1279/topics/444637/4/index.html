The right bumper of the bus is slightly dented, the right headlights having some cracks and the rubber protector at the right side of the bus being torn apart. I do not have any news of anyone being injured. As it happened at lunchtime break, many people are forced to take another 325 and it flooded the bus stop outside Hougang Point. As that road only had 2 lanes and with 1 lane blocked, the road had a heavy traffic jam, causing services 72, 109, 159 and 325 to be delayed from reaching Hougang Point bus stop. The bus is slowly towed back to HGDEP for inspection. The bus is currently laid-up till end of life-span as it only had 2 month's time left and having it's rear door having a minor hydraulic malfunctioning problem, the bus will be replaced with another Mk4 bus. But as for now, no permanent buses are filling in the missing slot.</p></div>

              <p>I'm not trying to shoot you (in case you think I am), but you do know the bus is not back out on the roads is because the authorities and people at SBST need to investigate who caused the crash and then inspect the damage?</p>
              <p>And as you said, it's only a minor crash with headlights cracked. If the bus goes up in flames or has serious drivetrain or chassis issues like holes in the chassis, then yeah I wouldn't be surprised if it goes laid-up. Hydraulics with the rear doors is not something they can't fix within a day in the workshop to be honest. Rear doors fail everytime, but most of the buses with such problems are back on service the next day.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, yes most of the parts are not in production anymore. But you do know that the various depots do keep the dozens of deregistered Mk3s from the previous 2 months in their depot till now? Those Mk3s are deregistered, but not yet scrapped. There's an abundance of spare parts to take from them if any of the Mk3s has a minor crash like what you said. So the 'parts not in production anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> laid-up' assumption you have here is simply not valid.</p>
              <p>If they really do lay-up the bus as you say it is, that means the bus has inherent drivetrain issues that can't be solved. Not any of those issues you mentioned.</p>

              <p>Sorry for late post here :<br> Sunday, 11/03/2012<br> SBS815S on revenue service 325 had a minor crash with another
              motorbike at Hougang Avenue 9, which is apprently trying to cut the
              bus to drive into the HDB road. The right bumper of the bus is
              slightly dented, the right headlights having some cracks and the
              rubber protector at the right side of the bus being torn apart. I
              do not have any news of anyone being injured. As it happened at
              lunchtime break, many people are forced to take another 325 and it
              flooded the bus stop outside Hougang Point. As that road only had 2
              lanes and with 1 lane blocked, the road had a heavy traffic jam,
              causing services 72, 109, 159 and 325 to be delayed from reaching
              Hougang Point bus stop. The bus is slowly towed back to HGDEP for
              inspection. The bus is currently laid-up till end of life-span as
              it only had 2 month's time left and having it's rear door having a
              minor hydraulic malfunctioning problem, the bus will be replaced
              with another Mk4 bus. But as for now, no permanent buses are
              filling in the missing slot.</p>
