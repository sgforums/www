              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">SBS BUS INSPECTOR SMACKS GIRL, LOCKS HER IN BUS FOR USING EXPIRED BUS PASS </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">Dear SBS Transit , I'm very disappointed &amp; offended by your transport inspector. I boarded SBS bus service 14 (Bus no. 7346H) at around 2.30pm. I'm still a student hence I'm still using the student card I have on hand. Upon boarding there's insufficient fund on my card so I paid 85cents for my trip to school.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">On the way to school a transport inspector boarded the bus. His a Malay transport inspector, his name is Shahruddin Mohd . He came up the the top deck which I was sitting. I was on the phone with my girlfriend at that point. He started to approach the secondary students beside me aggressively by shouting for their bus cards or tickets. When he got to me instead of asking for my ticket politely he smack my arm hardly twice. At that point I was very furious already. Like excuse me who are you to smack me so hardly, do I even know you.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">Okay I brush it off &amp; handed him my ticket. He asked for my card so I handed him my bus card too. Upon inspection he shouted your card expired already why you still use. At that point I was very lost as I didn't know it had expired &amp; I've been using it all along &amp; topping it up daily. Guess what that barbarian told me, he asked me to pay a penalty fine of $50 on the spot.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">I was furious I screamed at him saying wtf, why I honestly didn't know that my card has expired. He was forcing me to make payment on the spot or demanding for my particulars so he could fine me. My friend was still on the line she heard everything. As i did make quite a scene as I was very shocked &amp; offended, the other passengers were looking on. That barbarian has the cheek to go tell them I'm not condemning her as you can see she's being unreasonable.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">Excuse me who's being unreasonable &amp; obviously you are condemning me. I'm thankful for the adults present on the bus for helping me. Telling that barbarian that he could have just asked me to pay the adult fare instead of forcing me to pay $50 on the spot. But that barbarian was too stubborn and told them it's not their problem &amp; continue to demand for my particulars and wants me to pay the $50 fine .</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">So I shouted at him straight that he has no rights to demand for my particulars, he doesn't have the authority to ask for it. So I asked him does he want me to call the police. At that point he took my card &amp; went down to make noise to the driver. Thinking that he will have to return my bus card sooner or later so I just went back to talking to my worried friend.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">After a while the bus stopped moving feeling something is amiss. I took a look to notice that barbarian has asked everyone to exit the bus &amp; locked me up in the bus. I was very furious, I was late for school already due to his nonsense. I went down &amp; demanded to leave so I can faster rush to school as today we are having lessons on our upcoming examinations which is really important. Bloody barbarian die die wants me to pay $50 or I can't leave.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">I swear i was at the brink of going crazy &amp; killing him. I kept cursing cuz I really need to be in school to attend lessons. So the police came &amp; attended to this issue, bloody barbarian lied to the police saying I was violent &amp; wanted to attack him infront of my face. Wtf he was the one threatening me &amp; being violent which cause me to protect myself against him. Thanks to this barbarian I was late for school for 2 hours and missing 2 hours of important lecture.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">So SBS is this they way you train your inspectors, asking them to threaten students, demanding them to pay $50 on the spot for not being aware that your card has expired. The way he approach bus passengers can be aggressive &amp; he can lay hands on the passengers. I demand a apology &amp; compensation from your officer SHAHRUDDIN MOHD. No way am I going to pay a fine after your barbaric inspector smack me twice &amp; threaten me to pay $50 on the spot to the extend of locking me up in the bus &amp; causing me to miss 2 hours of my examination lecture.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">Tried calling your hotline but you didn't pick up. So fine this goes on social media to let others see how horrid your inspectors are to passengers. I'll kindly appreciate that you get back to me ASAP regarding this issue. My family is furious that I missed 2 hours of my class &amp; your officer for laying his hands on me &amp; threatening me.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 24px; background-color: #f7f7f7;">I strongly suggest a punishment or suspension for your transport inspector SHAHRUDDIN MOHD for him to know its wrong to lay hands on passengers or threatening them to the extend of locking the passenger up in the bus &amp; still has the cheek to lie. For future bus passengers do take note of this person.</p>

              <p>85 cents is the student cash fare (valid with a concession card)... if the card is expired (i.e she is no longer a student), then she have to pay adult fare...</p>
              <p>from her facebook, she seem to be study at kaplan? thus she wont be able to entite to any student concession fare? </p>

              <p>Okay I brush it off &amp; handed him my ticket. <strong>He asked
              for my card so I handed him my bus card too.</strong> Upon
              inspection he shouted your card expired already why you still use.
              At that point I was very lost as I didn't know it had expired &amp;
              I've been using it all along &amp; topping it up daily. Guess what
              that barbarian told me, he asked me to pay a penalty fine of $50 on
              the spot."</p>
              <p>-----------------------------</p>
              <p><br> First things first, we all know that expired bus pass are not
              allowed on any circumstances. But if you guys see it properly, the
              girl did not even use her card because she didn't had enough money
              on the card.</p>
              <p>So technically, she didn't use her card to get on the bus (and
              used the ticket for evidence).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then again, it seemed like a one-sided story.. <em>because
              do expired passes still work if you tap in the bus or
              MRT?</em> I never personally tried it before, though.</p>

              <p>It sounded to me that the card can still be used (expired card would normally cannot be used or top up), instead it sounds more like the concession has expired and therefore the student is no longer eligible for a student cash fare at 85 cents...when concession on a student farecard expires, adult fares apply all the way till the card itself expires. But the attitude of the conductor is another story though.</p>

              <p>Actually, there are CCTV cameras on the bus. I hope SBS Transit can retrieve the CCTV footage and review it, and take action. From the looks of it, the bus inspector is in the wrong. I can tell that the girl is emotionally affected. I hope SBS Transit will take action against that bus inspector. I know bus drivers are always supportive of their fellow brothers and sisters, regardless of whether they are right or wrong. But I really hope that they let justice be served. In this case, the bus inspector is obviously in the wrong. He must be punished. Otherwise, it is not fair to the victim.</p>

              <p>She paid for her trip but she paid student fare. Not adult fares. That the issue. We do not know whether the inspector smack her or not.  There will be CCTV To proof.  What I think is that the girl n her friend are talking so the inspector just tap her to ask for the ticket/card.  The inspector took the ticket n saw that it was student fare (85cents) this he ask for the concession card.  </p>
              <p>N the penalty is imposed by public transport council (PTC).  There are estimated 42000 cases of fare evasion daily. (Can google this). Estimated loss of revenue is around 9 million yearly.  N the inspector does have the right to detain that girl if she refuse to cooperate to pay the fines or give her particular.  </p>
