              <p>i dont see the Toa Payoh Route Group SLs of those routes like 28 where they are lots of sharp turnings using LO3x buses and 157 due to a lack of time but still using their LO3x buses..dun see them complaining as much and so why should some of the SLs be so pushy? 25 and 161 have more than enough time and the route is good for LO3x cos there are not as many sharp turning as 28 or even 60..</p>
              <p>LO3x buses may be tougher to drive..spare a thought for other services too?</p>
              <p>still remember the time when 88 was infested with those buses and services like 70 were getting so many of them..there should be equal distribution of the LO3x</p>
              <p>u can give a pathetic excuse that im arrogant when ur unable to rebutt to my argument or even better still take the whole clan and start flaming against me in any way possible so as not to feel so vulnerable but what i feel is true is true..u cant change a fact</p>

              <p>AFAIK, weekends for Service 161, they were given less than 1 hour to complete the whole trip from 1 end to another, and it can be quite rushing for the BCs as well. (Not sure whether currently they were given more running time for it or remains)</p>
              <p>And yeah... Things may not be fair for the deployment side, this is a fact.. Some services may be flooded with LO3x, but what to do? Ultimately it's up to the dispatcher's decision to decide everything.. The most that they (SLs) can do is to either request to drive other buses for the day, or chao geng until the bus breakdown, and changed to another bus..</p>

              <p>LO3x buses may be tougher to drive..spare a thought for other
              services too?</p>
              <p>still remember the time when 88 was infested with those buses
              and services like 70 were getting so many of them..there should be
              equal distribution of the LO3x</p>

              <p>From the company's POV the LO 3 axles are just like any other buses they have in the fleet. Harder to drive? Blame it on the 1993 technology. There are many hidden factors like maintenance, mileages, costs, management level decisions and constraints among others. Of course, nobody wants to do things the hard way, especially so for older drivers. We have to understand that driving a LO 3 axles at the age of 45 is way different from driving at age of 25.</p>
              <p>Spare a thought for other services. Again, it all boils down to management decision again. If one day SBS Transit decides to change all the B9TLs on service 88 to LO 3 axles again, there's nothing anyone can do.</p>
              <p>So I can say the "equal distribution of the LO3x" is impossible to happen unless the management decides one day to change their style of operations.</p>
              <p>What's good for us may not be good for the company in terms of operations and cost efficiency.</p>

              <p>BR always get bullied. the remaining BR VOs from either 28, 88, 154 would probably be sucked up to 161 to replace the LO3x. i dun think they would take from 60. i pity 28 and 60 BCs driving LO3x thru the narrow stretches. i salute them esp 28 BCs. 161 doesnt have much steep turns yet the SL makes noise. if you hate driving LO, dun drive then. there mus be a line drawn across. abit of work wun kill. that should explain to you, why 161 got 3 B9TLs at first. 161 has got a good share of B10TLs already. compare it to 166 or even 168. it doesnt even serve town.</p>

              <p>we're talking about favourtism not about trying to remove ALL the old buses with new ones..i think old buses are just as good but there should be a mixture in the fleets of services...ever wondered why 197 has the poor conditioned buses? while 62 or 80 has the better conditioned buses? shouldnt there be a balance or an unbiasedness when it comes to giving good conditioned buses? 80 has a strong demand..it is understandable why routes that jus got double deckers like 59, 186, 225 or 243 use the older buses as the drivers MAY have jus picked up double deckers or it could be as a trial to see if the load is favourable for the doubledeckers to remain..</p>
              <p><strong>SBS369M </strong>could possibly be the replacement for <strong>SBS2758K </strong>that ran to BN lemme go n spot the buses in its fleet in the days to come..</p>
