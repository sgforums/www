              RWS8 did use 0405 before.. and RWS 88 seems to be using 0405 quite often for weekends...
              
              No. There's no Yutong today for the shuttle.
              
              Blue pass is only 1 way shuttle.. as for orange pass is through and back. (Do correct me if im wrong, thanks)

              <p><br>But that doesn't mean that they should take up such services during weekends. Some of their services dated ages back during weekends don't have good frequancies at all. Why not use part of these resources to improve bus services during the weekends instead? And the BCs don't need to rest on weekends after working everyday in the weekdays?</p>
              <p>School shuttle buses are good enough to be provided for private operators. Public bus operators should refrain from taking up such services and focus on their main business, especially their main business is simply screwed up, and their resources are so limited.</p>

              <p>I hope that Resorts World Sentosa will fine SMRT heavily, since SMRT have again and again violated the contract of using low floor buses on RWS. And cancel the contract and pass it to other private bus operators. They are not even supposed to provide such kind of secondary bus services when their basic bus services are in a mess and not fulfilling requirements. Irresponsible.</p>

              <p>Actually, the scheduled fleet on a normal Saturday and Sunday is about 15% lower than the Weekday scheduled fleet so they definitely have enough spare buses to go around for such events without commuters feeling any difference from other weekends. it's running the shuttles yesterday and on Thursday that make things seem a bit tight, like having to return in time for evening swing.</p>

              <p>Actually if there's 90 buses (a small being PA plates) tat was pulled into OH, it's quite big alrdy.</p>
              <p>Dun forget SMRT has to add in more buses for RWS on weekends as well. RWS8, RWS88, 188R &amp; 963R. The additional fleet for SDs here alone is at least 25 buses. Not to mention 67, 853, 926, 961, 969, 980's special sunday requirement.</p>
              <p>Even if for tis special week, bendies are able to be pulled into 61, 67, 106, 172, 176, 180, 184, 187, 188, 189, 190, 300, 302, 700A, 800, 804, 806, 811, 812, 851, 854, 856, 857, 859, 900, 901, 903, 911, 912, 913, 960, 962, 963 it's going to be quite straining and tight thks to weekend committments. </p>
              <p>Svs 177, 925, 964, 981 can free up SDs though.</p>

              <p>Resource allocation is important but not to the expense of compromising service standards. Bus companies should take the initiative to monitor the service standards during weekends. Low ridership on weekends for some routes doesn't mean that it applies to other routes. And these routes came to their ownership for their responsibilty to provide a good service standards to commuters, regardless peak or non peak. If bus companies always need the rules and regulations like Qos to determine their service operations standards, then something is very wrong with their way of providing quality service standards. And not all of their shuttle services are on weekends, how about IKEA shuttle services, other than using the PA buses?</p>
              <p>As known, our buses are always overworked in our public bus operations. In this case, shouldn't these buses be resting during the weekends if necessary and scheduled for maintainance and cleaning so as to reduce the chances of overworking/overheating and breakdown rates when they are deployed for more prioritised and demanding working hours during the weekdays?</p>
              <p>SMRT is always contradicting with themselves. At first, their bus services are having service standards lapse like poor frequencies, dirty buses, etc and their excuse is that they have not enough resources like buses and drivers. Then when it comes to bus renewal, they don't want to purchase a few more new buses to replace the older and badly maintained buses, which already should have taken off from service, despite the company as a whole making millions of profits year after year.</p>
              <p>Rather they continue to limit new bus fleets and still claiming their nonsense of limited resources, they can still go into secondary shuttle bus services where their basic bus operations are still having many service standards lapses. We commuters pay for their services, and always have to give in to their increasing fares. They bought in new buses, however, choose to use some of them to provide secondary shuttle services, while the public commuters are already hoping that they can replace the older and badly maintained ones, which they still choose to keep and extend their lifespan and continue using these poorly mainitained buses. Moreover these new buses can improve the frequencies for many of their services while some of the older fleets can be scheduled for resting, cleaning and maintanance instead.</p>
              <p>Their existance is still providing public bus services. If they are so keen on private shuttle services, then give up the basic public bus services to other companies. Don't let commuters pay more to suffer from poor services.</p>

              <p>if they have heart, they'll add another bus to the affected services, or even better do a new schedule with additional running time and use the bus to mitigate the increase in headway.</p>
              <p>that will cost a couple of buses for the few affected routes. definitely no problems deploying them, just whether they are willing to go through the hassle or not.</p>

              <p>Seriously, look at the number of buses idling inside depots,
              SBST or SMRT, on a normal weekend. These buses could be put to
              better use. In fact, not optimizing the use of SBST buses must have
              been a non-commercial reason, because it's the logical thing to do
              to charter the buses out.</p>
              <p>Scheduled fleet on weekends are totally dependent on loading,
              and actual statistics have shown that passenger count for a typical
              feeder service is only 90% on Saturdays and 70% on Sundays compared
              to working Weekdays. Deploying the same fleet count on weekends
              mean drivers have less chance to be rostered for regular off-days,
              certain maintenance is not possible &amp; cost outlay is not
              matched with expected revenue. We're not going to have open houses
              every weekend!</p>
              <p>In fact, putting these buses to good use (like increasing
              capacity provision at RWS) on certain weekends allow better use of
              these buses and opens up the possibility for certain drivers who
              don't mind coming back to work for double pay.</p>
              <p>At the end of all these, we need to ask ourselves, is there even
              QoS for loading applicable on weekends?</p>

              <p>if they have heart, they'll add another bus to the affected services, or even better do a new schedule with additional running time and use the bus to mitigate the increase in headway.</p>
              <p>that will cost a couple of buses for the few affected routes. definitely no problems deploying them, just whether they are willing to go through the hassle or not.</p>
