              <p>An extra axle allows more weight to be carried in each vehicle. It works for 12m DDs, but obviously not for 10.6m DDs. I mean no shit sherlock, the loads a 10.6m carry is only 2/3 of that of 12m (do the math, it's just that simple). An extra axle also consumes more fuel and power, and so why use it when the 10.6m DDs dun even need it?</p>

              <p>Turning radius and axle loading.</p>
              <p>Many of the routes that such 10.6m 3xADD runs on used to be services plied with Leyland Victory and Dennis Jubliants and not 12m DDs. They have narrow roads and/or turns which require the use of such short wheelbase buses. An especially good example is NWFB rt. 15.</p>
              <p>However, with the introduction of air-conditioning in 1990s, the added weight of the additional AC unit exceeds the maximum axle loadings of 2 axles, thus requiring an additional axle to even out the weight displaced onto the roads.</p>
              <p>Substantial work has been done with the HK E400 and 2x weg to lower their vehicle weights (partly by using aluminium body frames). HK TD has also specially given permissions for 2x ADDs to be operated now despite it still marginally exceeds the axle loads. These 2x ADDs now weigh no more than a typical 12m SD we use here, while comfortably accomodating more seated passengers.</p>

              <p>Haha oops sorry, totally forgot the 10.3m DM5000s are tri-axle :P but you're right, with the development of air-con buses and the lack of requirement for further research has allowed these 3-axle 10.3/10.6 to be on the roads. </p>
              <p>However I still think the DMs deserve to stay till end of lifespan. Coz as you have raised 15 earlier, that service is one big cashcow for NWFB, many take that service to go to the peak during weekends and holidays, and so many buses have to be pulled over, sometimes even exceeding the amount of buses running on 101. Do you think an SD can cope with ease? At least these DDs can still comfortably fit in a little more pax. </p>
              <p>And also back to safety problems. 15 is a route that goes up and down the Victoria peak and have sudden and steep inclines. It also has sharp bends that reached up to 120 degrees. 12m SD? Dream on. I've ever tried standing on this route, my head was slammed three times against the wall (was standing near the staircase partition), and once onto the ceiling. Dangerous isnt it? How would an SD, which forces more to stand, be able to warrant more safety? Same goes for 9 and 14. This is why you will NEVER see any other buses than these DMs on these services. </p>
              <p>But it is clear that NWFB will be taking the E400 as replacement. Not that I'm complaining. </p>

              <p>Thanks for the link, but that is not air-conditioned, and also does not have a solid roof (canvas retractable roof from the images).</p>
              <p>That would just be like the open top hippos 12m dds here, just that they have windows and is low floor.</p>
