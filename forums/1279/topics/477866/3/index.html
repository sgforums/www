              <p>Actually I meant that even though most of the parts are made in
              other countries, it still bears a Sunlong badge. But since SBS
              Transit has bought so many Volvo buses I wonder why Volvo didn't
              offer SBS a hybrid yet. And I believe SBS had intended to obtain
              hybrids for testing in 2010, if it was a demo loaned to SBS it
              would already have been already returned and probably sold to some
              private operators already, but SBS is still holding on to the buses
              for some reason (same for RD6066L). This is what that really
              puzzles me.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Just like to point out to you that RD6066L was never sbst's to begin with.</p>
              <p>All along it was a gift from THU to NTU. Sbst was only responsible for operating the bus during the YOG period, and a proposed trial on 179/199 which was not realized due to the cost of hydrogen fuel.</p>
              <p>Why would it be parking in NTU otherwise?</p>
              <p>Also, just to add to your points about hybrids, they are still not yet sustainable in climates which require air-conditioning as the engine still has to run to drive the a/c compressor and alternators. One of the main benefits of hybrids comes from the fact that they can shut off the engine while idling at bus stops or traffic lights and restart it again while moving off automatically. But the AC would be shut off as well if that is done here which makes no sense.</p>

              <p>Oh, I thought that it belonged to SBST but parked there since it will undergo a conversion to full electric according to a newspaper report. It is very likely that the plan didn't materialize at all, wonder what will be the final fate of the bus since it is left at NTU without much maintenance.</p>

              <p>Can't really compare directly, since LPG engines are not converted from Petrol or Diesel engines unlike CNG engines used here.</p>
              <p>Also, LPG is cheap and gives longer range due to availability from China and 2x the density of CNG. Most importantly, it's not pegged to gasoil/crude prices unlike CNG here.</p>

              <p>Oh and btw, road conditions on popular svcs is not the only reason for introducing short variants of DDs in HK. It is also becoz of the travelling pattern and the fixture of most routes. </p>
              <p>In Singapore, these DDs don't work AT ALL due to high turnover rates. In HK is different as short DDs allows more pax to be seated than standing (while carrying the same, if not more than the amount of paz a KUB can carry), and thus this is appropriate for most HK routes which either have many express sectors or sectors with long distances between stops. </p>
              <p>Moreover, it also works great on cross-harbour svcs with less demand as it again allows more pax seated during the tunnel journey and still save till costs like an SD. 690 and 694 uses most of these during off-peak, alongside some SDs. </p>
              <p>So the short DDs actually make a perfect alternative to a 12m DD. It doesn't mean that with road conditions then you will get short DDs, becoz it justs depends on how the company wants to use it, after all, and HK is doing quite a good job at this I can say. </p>

              <p>Recently in HK, about half of the short DDs become spare buses, as they have reached their lifespan of almost 18 years, going for their retirement. They don't have their own deployment route, therefore they operate at some important routes to serve as a ''æ‰“æ�–è»Š'' to take up more passengers. It is very good as these buses can help to maintain a high frequency of buses during peak hours.</p>

              <p>I'm glad at least someone understands.</p>
              <p>The pax turnover rate here for trunk services is unusually high, especially for buses plying through MRT stations due to pax who use them as feeder services.</p>
              <p>As this will only worsen with more pax using the transit system, perhaps one way to overcome that would be to have trunks to bypass the stops near to MRT stations as the new Citydirect services has done.</p>
              <p>This will allow for more efficient usage of DD with less passenger movement, as they now travel for longer distances.</p>
