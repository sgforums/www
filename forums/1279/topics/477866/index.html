              <p>Unfortunately, I don't find this thread really necessary. I mean, not much here would discuss on HK buses what. Otherwise why did the earlier thread die so quickly? The users that come in these years only talk more on SG buses. </p>
              <p>And besides, why HK only? What makes HK so special it needs a dedicated thread? I mean, I used to be a resident in HK, but wouldn't the scope be wider if the thread was made just overseas instead?</p>
              <p>And BTW, a thread that was renamed to overseas bus discussion thread (used to be HK discussion thread) also died lol. </p>

              <p>IMHO this thread should remain, as there are still some other bus enthusiasts into not just SG buses but other countries too. HK buses are relatively more interesting than SG, and there can be contribution from other countries in this thread too.</p>

              interesting. how i wish sg is half as strict as HK to cut down air pollution caused by vehicles. the statutory lifespan of private vehicles of 20yrs is way too long. lots of pollution are caused by these vehicles. i pity those living next to the main roads as this is long term health threat. same as inhaling 2nd hand cigarette smoke.
              
              btw does HK have any cng or diesel-electric vehicles to cut air pollution? i still believe cng vehicles are much cleaner than Euro 6 vehicles. i wish technology can develop economical and much cleaner vehicles soonest possible.

                  i find HK bus service level better than sg. as majority are double-decks hence more chance to get a seat. but bus fares there seem much higher compared to sg. no transfer rebate. and fares are not distance based. if sway sway bus start from terminal and its a long route, u end up paying max fare for just a short ride.
              and i love the cross harbour old double deck ferries. cheap. high frequency and very very convenient and can avoid cross harbour tunnel traffic jam.

              <p><br> i find HK bus service level better than sg. as majority are
              double-decks hence more chance to get a seat. but bus fares there
              seem much higher compared to sg. no transfer rebate. and fares are
              not distance based. if sway sway bus start from terminal and its a
              long route, u end up paying max fare for just a short ride. and i
              love the cross harbour old double deck ferries. cheap. high
              frequency and very very convenient and can avoid cross harbour
              tunnel traffic jam.</p>

              <p>Uh uh. </p>
              <p>I agree on your opinion on HK buses better than SG in overall, but your reasons has a reason behind it. </p>
              <p>Why HK buses more double decks? Why HK buses no distance fares?</p>
              <p>Again, it's the TRAVELLING PATTERN. </p>
              <p>As a person who once reside in HK, I can frankly tell you, nobody will take a trunk svc like a feeder bus, which is what happens in SG. In SG, most travel short distance to connect and transfer, and thus there's a high turnover rate, making mass DD fleet further less encouraged. And this is also why SG has distance fares while HK has not. In HK, when a trunk goes from A to B, those who board at A will naturally alight somewhere near or at B. Since its long haul, DDs are brought in in large numbers so ppl can sit the ride (which is what they want), during the non stop sectors too. In SG ppl take trunks as feeders So they need distance fares to prevent ppl from going bankrupt, and also less DDs so that the buses won't take forever to unload. </p>
              <p>This is also due to the way they set the routes. In HK more than half of the public housing estates has a dedicated terminus with trunks that plies to either CBD or major town centres (eg JE, BNL and TAM), while SG has feeders connecting all the housing estates to the town centre and then the trunks there will take the ppl to other places. And in HK, every railway station has its own bus terminus, and so they don't need trunks to do big rounds in other suburban towns. IMO HK system is so much better than SG. Point to point instead of big round before going to city or other places. </p>
              <p>So, yeah. Still think HK bus is better though bus fares there are rising like crazy...</p>

              <p>Not really.</p>
              <p>Taking into account lifespan and the entire mainteinance package, Volvo's is actually quite possibly competitively priced.</p>
              <p>In fact there isnt such a thing as a "hybrid engine". The bus is powered by the combination of an electric motor and the traditional combustion engine.</p>
              <p>If I am not mistaken, the Sunlong's combustion engine is from Cummins. The electric motor system is from Eaton.</p>
              <p>So what "China make" are you talking about actually when the systems are from USA?</p>
