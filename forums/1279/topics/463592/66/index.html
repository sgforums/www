              <p>Gone are the days when you see a really crowded 72 because of the superb frequency, every 4-5 minutes. Especially the peak loading is now around 40-60 pax per bus in the Hougang - Tampines leg considering that a bus is not late. If one bus is late, then you will see the first bus getting a good 70-80 pax, while the bus that follows in 2 mins will have just 20-30 pax.</p>

              <p>Anyway I was the one who suggested the BSEP buses that have no fixed perms yet to be listed as N/A first. Because the other time there were a whole lot of BSEP buses that were deployed out on the roads for quite a while but w/o perms. And yet on Wiki someone kept reverting their status back to only displaying the depots they belonged. Confusing because it was hard to decipher which BSEP bus hadn't came out yet, since those w/o perms but alr on the roads &amp; those still new-new undeployed in the depots list the same perm status on Wiki.</p>
              <p>And i did recall some bus fans here (can't rmb if it's one of the more senior ones among us or some young fans) saying that what 'BSEP buses are perm on some service, so can't classify as SP'. Confusing much only? <br><br>So can't blame '3107H' fully. He was only editing after what I suggested. </p>
              <p>But yeah, the depots nowadays use the BSEP buses w/o perms as Spares. Up to you then dude, as long as can tell which bus is out on the roads alr, and which isn't. It was only a suggestion to tidy up the Wiki on my part in the 1st place.</p>

              <p>Anyway I was the one who suggested the BSEP buses that have no
              fixed perms yet to be listed as N/A first. Because the other time
              there were a whole lot of BSEP buses that were deployed out on the
              roads for quite a while but w/o perms. And yet on Wiki someone kept
              reverting their status back to only displaying the depots they
              belonged. Confusing because it was hard to decipher which BSEP bus
              hadn't came out yet, since those w/o perms but alr on the roads
              &amp; those still new-new undeployed in the depots list the same
              perm status on Wiki.</p>
              <p>And i did recall some bus fans here (can't rmb if it's one of
              the more senior ones among us or some young fans) saying that what
              'BSEP buses are perm on some service, so can't classify as SP'.
              Confusing much only?<br> <br> So can't blame '3107H' fully. He was only editing after what I
              suggested. </p>
              <p>But yeah, the depots nowadays use the BSEP buses w/o perms as
              Spares. Up to you then dude, as long as can tell which bus is out
              on the roads alr, and which isn't. It was only a suggestion to tidy
              up the Wiki on my part in the 1st place.</p>

              <p>so what is N/A? not available? not applicable?  can u explain?  if the buses have not come out at all, then just as "AMDEP" or "BNDEP" will do..</p>
              <p>now that guy keep on insisting that you have confirm that these buses are N/A and edited Wiki again to N/A?</p>

              <p><br>IMO, SBST is deploying a lot of buses on 72B just because it has many spare buses. 72B started with 3 perm buses, then within weeks the number went to 5,7,8 and now +10. My observation showed that earlier they would make sure a 72B bus gets packed with a good 60 students before calling the next one in.</p>
              <p>Now the ground staff deploys buses just when there are around 30-40 students in the queue. So I wouldn't say that the number of students has gone up much, it is just the number of students each bus takes has gone down due to enhanced frequency.</p>
              <p>Not to add some kids who like to take DDs wait for 72/72A instead even if there is a special queue for 72B.</p>

              <p>I suggested N/A in the context of 'Not Applicable' back then uh. 'Not Applicable' because no perm services yet for those BSEP buses, then this will help to calm those peeps that keep preaching that 'BSEP buses are definitely perm somewhere'. Because there's no perm svc applicable to those BSEP buses yet. It was only a suggestion on my part to tidy up the wik lah.</p>
              <p>I definitely didn't mean 'Not Available'. </p>
              <p>Yeah I know that if those BSEP buses haven't come out yet, just list their depots. But back then weeks ago, I edited those BSEP buses that are out on the roads alr but No perm svc yet as 'AM SP', 'HG SP' etc. But he reverted it back to only listing the depots as the perm status, even for those that alr came out.</p>
              <p>I think he was recalling the 'BSEP bus are perm somewhere once it come out' thingy posted by some of us previously. Then it became mightily confusing, so I suggested splitting the perm statuses to distinguish better which are out on roads and which aren't.</p>
              <p>Actually. Very simple. We just need to come to consensus whether that view that 'BSEP buses are definitely perm somewhere once it come out' still holds not. If it holds but not definitely, then point settled. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Back then when BSEP buses first came out, they really went straight to perm somewhere on the first few days rmb? Then the backlog of BSEP services came + they deploy the BSEP buses faster than each round of BSEP improvements, became now that they used those undeployed BSEP buses as SPs instead. Then that view no longer held absolute ground. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>3336M is just deployed like a SP bus to replace any random DD MIA from Sv 12 every day. It jumps from slot to slot daily. For instance, 3336M is on 3319M's BSEP timings today. But 3319M was instead replacing 9437R's timings, and in turn 9437R was replacing 9354X's timings. </p>
              <p>Only possibility for 3336M to be perm BN 12 is O/S bus? Because the e-tt timings they have now are still the same from months ago after they added 3319M. 08 Apr's e-tt revision was for the removal of ONP at PSR. I still don't think it's an O/S bus. </p>

              <p>I spotted 774H just now driven by AM AP driver</p>
              <p>Buses on 961 AM side confirmed spotted</p>
              <p>501D,500G,481C,932T,540R,753T, </p>
              <p>Bus missing: 431Y,528C,765J.</p>
              <p>765J is out coz its a split bus</p>
              <p>932T replaced 431Y just now</p>
              <p>Only 528C is left in question coz never spotted it just now</p>
