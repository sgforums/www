              <p>18 wab out of 26 buses is around 70% quota.. like that below standard? is your standard 100%?  i dun think the PIW will have to wait for a long time for a Sv70 WAB to come considering that its frequency have improved so much...further more 891X should be a split shift bus which does only few trips on Sv70. ... maybe it is a better idea to replace all the Sv70 Non-wab DD with KUB... i really dun mind these VO3x/B10TL going over to Sv76 to exchange with Sv76 Kubs... but then later you will also complain that why so many SD on sv70...</p>

              <p>Alot of services are in that same situation isn't it? Sv 6 needs only 1 Wright to replace one of the 3 DDs currently to hit the quota, &amp; Sv 81 needs only 3 Wrights to replace the 3 VO3xs to hit the quota after getting the E5 KUBs for 3years &amp; counting. </p>
              <p>But nothing has been done to them too isn't it? The priority for certain services are definitely higher than the rest. But sooner or later, all of the buses on each service will be WABs one lor. People anxious to get WABs (not you btw, the others), just wait yeah, that time will come before you die or something, that's definite. </p>

              <p>I had been observing 70's fleet as well as playing with the
                  iris. Always a non WAB arriving for every 1-2 buses even
                  during off peak hours, sometimes 2-3 consecutive non WABs. And if I
                  remember correctly there was once 5 consecutive non WABs on 70 in
                  the evening peak towards Shenton Way. Unlike other WAB services
                  that have plenty of WABs in its fleet.</p>
              <p>Well, I dun mind K230UBs replacing the non WAB DDs. So long it
                  met with WAB quota.</p>
              <p>163 when turned WAB last Sept also had a bad start, there were
                  several non WABs running on WAB timings too. But after a few weeks
                  situation improved much better.</p>
              <p>For SMRT feeders hope SMRT gets WAB bendies soon.</p>

              <p>If Sv 70 &amp; 163 is bad in the sense that their WAB slots are usually covered by non-WABs for cameos, can I point you to the fact that most (if not all) of the BNDEP WAB services are all with the same problem as well? With VO3xs &amp; B10TLs covering missing KUBs / Citaros / B9TLs every single day? A depot with its huge number of services, being affected by the same prob you mentioned, every single day.</p>
              <p>Compared to a depot with almost all the services affected by the problem you mentioned for your 2 services above, which is worse? I'm not shooting you, I'm just trying to say that there's no such thing as fairness in deploying WABs or non-WABs. that's what the starters decide, not you. Starters who actually have a constraint in the number of SP WABs vs the number of non-WAB SPs. <br><br>Look across all the depots, with the exception of AMDEP + BRBP (they don't even have much SP VO3x or LO3x in the first place), all the other depots they have more non-WAB SPs than WAB SPs. So the WAB SPs get deployed on the svcs with greater PIW demand, then the other WAB services with missing WABs don't they only get non-WAB SPs to replace the missing WABs? At least the pax get to sit a bus at that same timing, and not have to wait to squeeze onto the next bus.</p>

              <p>I guess the main problem between SBS and SMRT is the number of WAB buses in each company.</p>
              <p>SMRT have services that always fail to reach WAB quota because until now I suppose they do not have enough WAB buses to cater to all WAB services yet. Well you could argue that they could have taken those WAB buses from non-WAB services and fulfil the WAB quota for these services. However, there has to be abit of fairness as non-wab bus services deserves new buses as well. So, in my opinion, its not that SMRT does not want to fulfil the WAB quota but its just that it is undergoing fleet renewal currently and it needs time to stabilise the WAB fleet.</p>
              <p>As for SBS wise, it is often puzzling that old buses(mk4s) replaces the mk4s that are going off, especially in a WAB service. For 70's case, not like AMDEP has no more SP KUBs or Citaros to spare to replace the outgoing 1986A, but why 891X? I guess thats the main reason why SBS8676Z is fretting about. Coincidentlly, there were 2 citaro perms on 70 recently, making them look like they are replacing the 2 outgoing mk4s (1986A and 2625K), however, 891X and 2625K were still spotted despite the addition of citaros. Now the question is, the citaros are replacing which buses? Till now, no one actually knows. </p>
              <p>So i guess, we all need time to let the bus companys manage their fleet. I was rather unhappy when HGDEP treat 163 quite badly before it turned WAB but it is only fair at that time because 163 wasnt a WAB service yet. Since 70 is a WAB service, there is a reason to be unhappy about, especially when 70 already started off without a very good WAB quota, not like other AMDEP bus services. </p>

              For SMRT ones the ones I am satisfied or find it acceptable are 171 851 855 857 858 859 970 980, more or less. Indeed svcs like 61 are really the ones to question with, they still do have problems with their quota. I feel the current issue lies with AMDEP for not taking in MANs(Not inclusive of BSEP MANs and 246T 247R), still dilly-dally around and indeed the citaros came in last time out, did help a little bit, but not much literally. 
              
              I do not have questions with SBST's standards with the way they do their things, But SMRT I still have lots of question.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I guess the main problem between SBS and SMRT is the number of
              WAB buses in each company.</p>
              <p>SMRT have services that always fail to reach WAB quota because
              until now I suppose they do not have enough WAB buses to cater to
              all WAB services yet. Well you could argue that they could have
              taken those WAB buses from non-WAB services and fulfil the WAB
              quota for these services. However, there has to be abit of fairness
              as non-wab bus services deserves new buses as well. So, in my
              opinion, its not that SMRT does not want to fulfil the WAB quota
              but its just that it is undergoing fleet renewal currently and it
              needs time to stabilise the WAB fleet.</p>
              <p>As for SBS wise, it is often puzzling that old buses(mk4s)
              replaces the mk4s that are going off, especially in a WAB service.
              For 70's case, not like AMDEP has no more SP KUBs or Citaros to
              spare to replace the outgoing 1986A, but why 891X? I guess thats
              the main reason why SBS8676Z is fretting about. Coincidentlly,
              there were 2 citaro perms on 70 recently, making them look like
              they are replacing the 2 outgoing mk4s (1986A and 2625K), however,
              891X and 2625K were still spotted despite the addition of citaros.
              Now the question is, the citaros are replacing which buses? Till
              now, no one actually knows. </p>
              <p>So i guess, we all need time to let the bus companys manage
              their fleet. I was rather unhappy when HGDEP treat 163 quite badly
              before it turned WAB but it is only fair at that time because 163
              wasnt a WAB service yet. Since 70 is a WAB service, there is a
              reason to be unhappy about, especially when 70 already started off
              without a very good WAB quota, not like other AMDEP bus
              services. </p>
              <p>It's just a matter of perspectives. </p>
              </div>

              <p>Wait boy wait. Just like how I waited for Citaros on 156 after it turned WAB. </p>

              <p>Ya replace temp for 1 OAC to go refurbishment and 969 use random
              cameos.I tell you SMRT is unlike SBST le where perm marking or
              stickers is spotted.U can see 1 particular bus for months and in
              the end it will go back to their perm svc</p>
