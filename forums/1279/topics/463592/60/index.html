              <p>There's another few KUBs that AMDEP x-ferred over to BNDEP (in exchange for the 8 VO3xs that went over from BN to AM) that aren't reported yet. Total should be 8 KUBs for the 8 VO3xs. Interested peeps can go and find them for yourselves. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Think BNDEP not enough BCs compared to AMDEP side? Moreover I'm thinking the x-fer of duties for Sv 21 has something to do with more space being available now in BNDEP after they moved a huge chunk of those Tampines-based buses &amp; services to CGBP. Ditto for Sv 7. So you're right in a way, other than Sv 21, there's no other AMDEP-controlled svc that seems to have any likelihood of switching depot control anytime soon.</p>
              <p>Actually I don't understand why they moved those duties for Sv 7 back to BNDEP. Didn't someone mentioned back then (can't remember exactly which of us said that) that they moved everything from minority BNDEP control to full BBDEP control for Sv 7 a few years ago because the journey time back to BB &amp; BN is almost identical? Then now they switch back minority control to BNDEP? </p>

              <p>Crashed into something. Idk what exactly is it, because I saw others mentioned it crashed into a wall in BNDEP, but the aftermath of the bus from the impact in the latest pics certainly looked more like high-speed rear-ending into another similar vehicle or sorts. And then again, BNDEP have huge walls meh?</p>
