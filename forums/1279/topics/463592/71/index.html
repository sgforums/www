              <p>Think about it logically. There's one bunch of O405s for TRG,
              but the O405s are going soon alr. And isn't there a whole bunch of
              new MANs coming in? </p>
              <p>Makes no sense for SMRT to train their drivers on O405s when
              they are going to deploy them to drive MANs later on is
              it? </p>
              <p>It's the same reason why there's a whole bunch of SBST Citaros
              &amp; KUBs on TRG while they kick out all those ex-TRG Mk4 B10Ms

              <p>I know abt the problem of not having enough buses for SMRT's side. haha. But think long-term uh? training the drivers on O405s is only a short-term thing &amp; not going to be enough if the fleet is moving more and more towards the MANs or even Citaros as forming the bulk of the fleet in the future..</p>
              <p>Everyone can say that, well they're only training the drivers how to drive, the bus they train on doesn't matter. But think about it, the instrumentation are not exactly the same on both O405s and the more modern MANs..no way you can try to read the dials on the O405 the same way as you do on the MANs. </p>
              <p>And doesn't the MANs have a trip computer too like the Citaros &amp; KUBs? Find me a trip computer on the older O405s..</p>
              <p>And isn't 288Y the only MAN in TRG now? Alot of the bus fans are thinking from the commuter's point of view, they want new buses, buses to fill the empty slots etc. Think from the viewpoint of the dept in-charge of training the drivers in this case. </p>

              <p>In my opinion, It is not about using the kind of buses that they use, but rather at what timing they will find the replacements.</p>
              <p>Look at the rate at our current hispano fleets. Some would be going within 2-6 months, Most of them would be going off in the next 10-20 months to come. At that time are they going to 'panic' who should deserve the L-plate? Isn't that too late to begin with where you can have it planned earlier?</p>
              <p>From the dept IC of training the L platers for heavy vehicles, I am sorry but it is not enough.</p>
              <p>I would reduce the number of Hispanos for L plates for this instance. I do not think I would need so many old buses for L plates but I would focus on how would my drivers drive buses with new gadgets in the near future. Clearly SMRT didn't think it this way.</p>

              <p>I know abt the problem of not having enough buses for SMRT's
                  side. haha. But think long-term uh? training the drivers on O405s
                  is only a short-term thing &amp; not going to be enough if the
                  fleet is moving more and more towards the MANs or even Citaros as
                  forming the bulk of the fleet in the future..</p>
              <p>Everyone can say that, well they're only training the drivers
                  how to drive, the bus they train on doesn't matter. But think about
                  it, the instrumentation are not exactly the same on both O405s and
                  the more modern MANs..no way you can try to read the dials on the
                  O405 the same way as you do on the MANs. </p>
              <p>And doesn't the MANs have a trip computer too like the Citaros
                  &amp; KUBs? Find me a trip computer on the older O405s..</p>
              <p>And isn't 288Y the only MAN in TRG now? Alot of the bus fans are
                  thinking from the commuter's point of view, they want new buses,
                  buses to fill the empty slots etc. Think from the viewpoint of the
                  dept in-charge of training the drivers in this case. </p>

              <p>Actually if u train on o405, there's better chances of them driving safely since all those are just simple operations. I believe the learners are train on an o405 bus to familiarise with all the basics of driving skills, rather than on a advanced one(MAN/OCs dashboards with different indicators).</p>

              <p>Agreed. One day they still have to replace the O405s with newer buses as TRG. Might as well change now and let BCs be familiar with newer buses as mainly now on the roads, esp WLDEP controlled svcs are filled with the A22s.</p>
