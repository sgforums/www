              <p>I agree. There's no need for that new bus service when 192 could have taken the route of that new bus service between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Pioneer Road North. Very few people at Jurong West go to Fairprice Hub anyway. This can be seen on the free shuttle bus service that plies between Fairprice Hub and Jurong West. It's usually empty buses and even if have people, it's only like less than five. Since there is already 99 going to provide the bus connection between Jurong West and Fairprice Hub, I do not think there is really a need for another bus service to provide that connection. It's going to be over-served anyway.</p>
              <p>I agree that 193 should continue as per current route. By removing 193 from Pasir Laba camp and shortening 182 to Joo Koon, the people at Pasir Laba camp would lose their bus connection to Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p><br>I think they want 193 to go to Joo Koon (or at least Benoi Rd) so that Jurong West Ave 4 residents can take 193 and transfer to those JIS there. Thus it goes to Jln Ahmad Ibrahim.</p>

              <p>I disagree with the first point. By making 192 plying the route of 258, there are definitely going to be serious problems. It is somehow difficult to explain, but I do not think that as a trunk service, 192 should ply the route like a feeder hybrid. Trunks are meant to provide direct connections from one area to another while feeders bring people from residential estates to the nearest MRT stations/bus interchange. Furthermore, the distance is going to increase, as well as the frequency and number of buses in its fleet. I do not think this can be explained away by the fact that the demand between Jurong West and Fairprice Hub is low.</p>

              <p>I'm curious as to why the pair of bus stops along Benoi Rd right outside Joo Koon Int are not given matching bus stop codes - the stop on the west side of the road is coded 23371, the opposite one is 23519.</p>
              <p>If this has happened since some time ago, had no one bothered to correct it?</p>

              <p><br>192's current bus stop "opp Joo Koon Int" is coded 23379... But it doesn't have timetables wef 28 Nov 2015, whereas 23371 has timetables wef 28 Nov.</p>
              <p>And on 192's poster, "opp FairPrice Hub" is indicated as a new bus stop with code 23519.</p>
              <p>Guess 23519 will replace 23379?</p>

                                  <p>There's 241A.</p>
                                  <p>I guess they may increase the number of trips on 241A, while they reduce the number of trips on 241.</p>
                                  <p>Anyway, the loading on 241 and 241A looks promising during peak hours. I doubt they will reduce the total number of trips on 241 and 241A at Jurong West Street 91 and 92, and Pioneer Road North.</p>
                          <p>Well, if the situation becomes bad, you may want to inform your MP (who is also my MP) about it. I followed his Facebook page. Apparently, he is now doing house visits at 900+ there.</p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, today 179 once again never come on time. According to Google maps, supposed to come at 7:23am, but instead came a few minutes late, with two buses at the same time. That's minor, I know. The main issue now is not 179 already, cuz anyway 258 starting soon. The main issue now is with Pioneer MRT Station. It's so damn overcrowded in the morning. Have to queue at the entrance to take escalator up to enter station and have to queue to tap card to enter, and have to queue to take the escalator up to the platform. Well, ... what to do? Build new bridge, like Clementi station? LOL. I have to go out earlier or later lor. Otherwise what? ;)</p>

              <p>Looking at how limited the driveway space is at Joo Koon Bus Interchange, I do not think there is space for buses to enter from two directions like how it was done at the Boon Lay Temporary Bus Interchange. Although only 99, 182 and 258 come from Upper Jurong Road, while the rest comes from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, I think it is best to let all bus services enter from Joo Koon Circle.</p>
                          <p>The other reason is because all bus services exit at Joo Koon Circle. Rather than let the buses entering from Benoi Road jam the buses exiting to Joo Koon Circle, as they wait for their turn to use the alighting berths, I think it's best to separate the two by letting all bus services enter from Joo Koon Circle. </p>
