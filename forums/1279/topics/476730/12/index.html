              <p>I would have to disagree, as the current route from Bird Park to the stop opposite the Bird Park across AYE along Jln Ahmad Imbrahim where 251 stops is quite a distance to walk to.</p>

              <p>I hope it dosent end up like Tuas Bus Terminal. It is really
              empty during off peak and weekends. Sometimes only 1-2 buses
              parking there and you are waiting for the bus alone at the
              terminal.</p>
              <p>How about the NTWU canteen? Does it close early like the one at

              <p>Don't think it will end up like Tuas Ter as there is a Fairprice Hub above in which it might still attract some crowds during weekends and off peak hours.</p>
              <p>And also it is a good idea IMO to divert those CW services from Jurong East/Boon Lay to Joo Koon.</p>

              Personally, in my opinion, I think of the 3 sawtooth boarding berths, only the last one (B3) has space for Articulated buses. Whereas for parking lots for Articulated buses, I think only the two parking lots nearest to B3 can be adjusted to accommodate Articulated buses. Apparently, it seems that Joo Koon Bus Interchange the driveway has space constraints. I do not think there will be Articulated buses deployed on services that would originate at Joo Koon Bus Interchange.

              <p>not sure how accurate it is, not sure how credible the source is, not sure if I should write this, if I heard correctly, it seems that the construction of Joo Koon Bus Interchange will be completed next month.</p>
              <p>Taking reference from Bedok Bus Interchange, whose construction was completed at around October 2014 and opened on 30 November 2014, testing and commissioning should take around two months.</p>
              <p>Say Joo Koon Bus Interchange construction is completed in End-May, the earliest possible opening day is in End-July. My guess is during the National Day weekend in August 2014.</p>

              <p><br> Personally, in my opinion, I think of the 3 sawtooth boarding
              berths, only the last one (B3) has space for Articulated buses.
              Whereas for parking lots for Articulated buses, I think only the
              two parking lots nearest to B3 can be adjusted to accommodate
              Articulated buses. Apparently, it seems that Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange the driveway has space constraints. I do not think
              there will be Articulated buses deployed on services that would
              originate at Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>I have my doubts on articulated buses going to Joo Koon. LTA is not making new infrastructure suitable for bendies especially in SBST terriroty and going forward with bus contracting model, it is going to dictate terms even further.</p>

              <p>Besides the facility - which actually adjustments (as I have written just now) can be made to accommodate Articulated buses - I guess the other reason is that the roads in Jurong Industrial Estate and Tuas have limited space for public buses.</p>
              <p>Usually, roads are already occupied by vehicles parked along it.</p>
              <p>During peak hours, the major roads tend to experience traffic congestions. Nonetheless, this may be resolved or alleviated when Tuas West MRT Extension opens.</p>

              <p>Road Announcements 6 May 2015</p>
              <p>As part of the preparation works for the upcoming Joo Koon Bus Interchange, the traffic junction of Joo Koon Bus Interchange/Joo Koon Circle will undergo testing on Monday, 11 May 2014 from 09.30am to 03.00pm.</p>
              <p>Please refer to the attached <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/roads/2015/11052015_Testing%20of%20traffic%20lights%20at%20Joo%20Koon%20Bus%20Interchange%20Joo%20Koon%20Circle.pdf">map</a> for more details.</p>
              <p>Motorists and pedestrians are advised to observe the traffic signals when approaching the junction during the slated time.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">say a bus service journey time is 60 minutes and its frequency is 10 minutes. Seven buses. When the 7th bus arrives at the boarding berth, the 1st bus arrives at the alighting berth. Assuming each bus rests (engine &amp; power supply switched off) for 10 minutes, one bus parking lot is enough. Likewise if the bus service journey time is 50 minutes.</span></p>
              <p>Earlier on, we learn that Joo Koon has at least eighteen bus parking lots. If each (trunk) bus service only needs one bus parking lot, this means - theoretically - eighteen bus parking lots can cater to eighteen (trunk) bus services. </p>
              <p>but...</p>
              <p>I guess we all have an idea of which bus services will be shortened to Joo Koon. Just to share with you, 254, 255, 257, 192, ... frequency is less than ten minutes, sometimes even less than five minutes. Really identical to feeder services. A bus service at Joo Koon may need two bus parking lots. </p>
              <p>With eighteen bus parking lots, I guess the bus interchange is able to accomodate up to nine bus services.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange, i<span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">n my opinion, the most likely time for opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange is end-July (around 30/31 July), or during the National Day week. My best guess is Saturday, 1 August 2015.</span></p>
              <p>In my opinion, consider this is a brand new bus interchange with major route changes, the notice would be at least three weeks prior to opening.</p>
              <p>Whereas for this thread, I think we have discussed enough about Joo Koon Bus Interchange. Even if this thread expires before Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, so be it. If we want, we can always create a new thread.</p>

              <p>went to JK BI for so many times. april went. asked the people there, they say "next month". may went. asked the people there, they say "next month". really not sure how credible their words are. but from my observations, most of the installations are there. there are still some fitting works on-going, such as painting of walls, etcetera.</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>the best source on bus interchange opening would probably come from circulars in the bus interchange office and the depots. last time when BNL int opens, the source from circulars was quite reliable. at first say 21 dec, then say change to 27 dec. in the end, really is 27 dec open.</p>
