              <p>I was really surprised to see bus service '405M' at Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange, so I went to look it up online. Came across this
              forums, thought it was really interesting to see so much
              professionalism when discussing about transport-related topics.
              Then I came across this topic.<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>hi. just wondering, is there any possibility that bus services (185, 502, 502A) originating/terminating at Soon Lee Bus Depot will be re-routed to Joo Koon Bus Interchange?</p>
              <p>if 185 extends to Joo Koon (via Upper Jurong Road), both directions would be around 20.1 km if extend to Boon Lay (via Boon Lay Way), both directions is around 19 km. #justsaying </p>
              <p>actually, in my opinion, I feel that 502 can be shortened to Boon Lay. Skip the entire Jurong West Extension. We can always take feeder to Boon Lay and transfer to 502. Vice-versa.</p>

              <p>anyway, I think 182 very likely will come to Joo Koon. Apparently 182 last time is Jurong East de. Then dunno which year it shorten to Boon Lay. I think with Joo Koon opening, 182 will come here.</p>

              <p>185 also another two parking lot de. 502 its frequency I think one parking lot can already. </p>
              <p>Including 182 Which I believe also need two parking lots, that's five parking lots already. JK has eighteen. With that thirteen lots left.</p>
              <p>251, 254, 255, 257 actually I think it's best that they operate at feeder frequency, at least during peak hours. which means two parking lots each. total eight parking lots.</p>
              <p>with that, still have five left. don't forget still have new bus services, which I believe will also need to operate at feeder frequency; two parking lots each. but then, if like that, I think only can have two new bus services. that one left can either give to Malaysia operator run cross-boarder bus services, or have a (new) trunk bus service that runs at frequency that only need one parking lot.</p>
              <p>unless there is provision for more parking lots in the future, which I am not sure about. alternatively, we can let 182 stay at Boon Lay. next year tuas west mrt extension open already then shorten to Tuas Terminal. then we can have up to three new bus services of feeder frequency at Joo Koon. </p>
              <p>should 185 be re-routed to Joo Koon, 185 can re-route slightly to Pioneer MRT Station. Pioneer Road North &gt; Jurong West Street 63 &gt; Jurong West Street 61 &gt; Boon Lay Way &gt; Upper Jurong Road.</p>
              <p>Confession: The only reason why I am so excited about this Joo Koon Bus Interchange is because Boon Lay Bus Interchange is so overcrowded when we need it most in the evening. When JK opens, BL will have less bus services, which means can have more bus services. yay! :)</p>
              <p>I guess eventually, Boon Lay can have around three new bus routes.</p>
              <p>if want make some more room, actually, 405 can also go over to Joo Koon. Can use that one parking lot which I have no idea how it would be used. </p>
              <p>in future if Joo Koon can have more parking lots (along the driveway wall), can create another three or four more parking lots to accomodate another two more bus services. but that's probably new bus services already. unless we let 179 &amp; 199 come over.</p>

              <p>I don't think so; from what I recall, 502 did not start from Soon Lee Depot (<span style="line-height: 1.231;">although it has already existed since 2002) </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">when it is extended at the end of 2005; it simply started from Pioneer Rd North (using the current route within Jurong).</span></p>
              <p>When service 185 was introduced exactly one year later, I guess that should be the time where Soon Lee Depot also becomes the 'starting point' for Express 502/502A; but there is still a significant difference between the two services.</p>
              <p>Previously service 185 actually allowed first boarding/last alighting from bus stops Bef/S'pore Post along Pioneer Rd North (there were no bus stops outside/opposite Soon Lee Depot until August 2007), it was only then service 185 was the first service to use this pair of completed bus stops along Soon Lee Rd.</p>
              <p>Express 502/502A still continued to start from Pioneer Rd North (Opp/Blk 653B) then, which is the significant difference until February 2009, when Express 502/502A was finally made to ply those pairs of bus stops along Soon Lee Rd and Pioneer Rd North (Bef/S'pore Post), officially allowing first boarding/last alighting from Soon Lee Rd like service 185 does.</p>

              <p>if 179 transfers to Joo Koon, length will increase by 2km. However, according to google maps driving feature, journey time will be 5 mins shorter.</p>
              <p>but, honestly, I think a lot of people will complain, including NTU people themselves. it's better to let it stay at Boon Lay.</p>

              <p><br> well, there is word going around that there will be some commercial outlets at Tuas in future. I guess it is either one of the new MRT stations will have commercial outlets, or there will be a new commercial building.</p>
              <p>a development with commercial activities and bus depot may be likely, if the site is next to Tuas Link MRT Station. for all we know, there could even be a condominium on top of it. since after all, there's sea view. :)</p>

              <p>it really depends on the frequency of the bus services. there are eighteen parking lots. three sawtooth boarding berths. if the frequency is high throughout - feeder frequency - maybe between six to nine. if the frequency is low throughout - say around 15 mins - maybe nine to twelve, or twelve to eighteen.</p>
              <p>Boon Lay Bus Interchange has thirty eight bus parking lots (30 standard, 8 elongated) in the sawtooth section. In the sawtooth section, there are twenty one bus services. On average, it's 1.8 bus parking lots per bus service. On the assumption that Joo Koon is also 1.8 parking lots per service, actually, Joo Koon Bus Interchange can have ten bus services.</p>
              <p>185 &amp; 502 together I think only need three. The other fifteen can be for around five to seven services with feeder frequency. Really depends on how many parking lots per feeder-like services. Currently, the 25X services use two parking lots at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, right? So, quite likely there is space for up to seven 25X services.</p>
              <p>7 or 9 or 10. 10 less likely. On the other hand, it also depends on how many 25X services. 10 may be likely. Greater than 10 is also likely. </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, for the new Tuas Bus Terminal, I guess the number of parking lots is either greater or equal than the number in the existing Tuas Bus Terminal: 12 / 13.</p>
              <p>Joo Koon and Tuas combine is around 30 bus parking lots. Boon Lay has around 60 bus parking lots. Actually, if want, we can remove around half of the load off Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>in fact, we can even create another new bus interchange/terminal somewhere else in Jurong, with around 30 bus parking lots, to replace Boon Lay Bus Interchange completely. nah. Boon Lay has the five feeder services. nonetheless, the new bus interchange/terminal can take over some load from Jurong East Bus Interchange, since Jurong East Bus Interchange also operating near/at its peak already.</p>

              <p>my personal wish is that, when some parking lots at Boon Lay Bus Interchange are not in use after Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens (after the removal and addition related to Joo Koon Bus Interchange), </p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. some end-on bus services can come over to the sawtooth section (ignore the rule that sawtooth can only exit by turning left enter by turning right), or both, or vice-versa; re-shuffle bus berths allocation. why? because the end-on side has traffic congestion issue that is quite bad. buses on route 174 has been in the sawtooth section for quite some time now. I think 174 quite likely will come over.</span></li>
