              <p>My hope is 182, 193, 254, 255, 257 will originate from Joo Koon
              while other JIS services 192, 246, 249, 251, 252 will continue to
              operate from Boon Lay. This way 5 services will go to Joo Koon +
              Joo Koon should introduce 2 or 3 new JIS services. So totally 8
              services at Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>With 5 services going, there is opportunity to introduce at
              least 3 new services at Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>1 service has to be feeder to cover missing link of 257. This is
              the service I propose should do st 93 as well. 255 duplicates
              179/241 route, so no need for replacement here. </p>
              <p>1 service can be Jurong Lake District service. I hope 178 can be
              reduced to Jurong East while have new service mimmicking 178 route
              to Jurong East with better frequency. </p>
              <p>In addition, there can be 1 JIS service originating from Boon
              Lay that covers the industrial areas close to Boon Lay / Pioneer
              that do not have direct service today.</p>
              <p>These are 3 services I can think right now that will be
              useful.</p>

              <p>182 is likely, since last time it was from Jurong East shorten to Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>If it's five, then good la - can have two new bus routes at Boon Lay, since Boon Lay capacity may limit to thirty (as there are sixty parking lots and one route is allocated two parking lots) when Joo Koon opens, and currently there are thirty three. But what if it's three? Then we have to have bus interchange expansion for Boon Lay, at where temporary bus interchange was.</p>
              <p>(Off-Topic) In my opinion, the new bus route at Jurong Lake may be an extension of route 49 to Jurong East. With regards to Corporation Road at Taman Jurong, I do not see a need for new routes there, where there's a large number of routes at Corporation Drive.</p>
              <p>Honestly, some routes are clearly likely to reroute to Joo Koon, because currently there is duplication of resources. Hopefully there's more than three bus routes duplicating. If more than three, means can have one or two (or more) new bus routes at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>As of yesterday, I only saw that one new bus stop.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I want to express my concerns with regards to the new bus stop in front of blk 932. Before arriving at that bus stop, the bus has to turn. That is a blind spot. I am worried that the bus may not be able to stop in time when the vehicle traffic light is red, while there are people crossing the road.</p>
              <p>Suggestion: Re-locate the traffic light junction to after the new bus stop, and remove that barrier obstructing pedestrians to have a proper pavement.</p>

              <p>I thank Mr bus555 for his online forum reply ('Query on Jurong East Bus Interchange'; August 10).</p>
              <p>As of now, the land parcel for the proposed new bus interchange is partly used for a temporary market (Pasar Malam).</p>
              <p>I do not know if any tender is open for the sale of that land parcel.</p>

              <p>Anyway, why can't 99 reroute to Boon Lay? If like that then don't need for a new route from Boon Lay to Street 93.</p>

              <p>It's not official. There was just one plastic sample electronic display board hanging above one of the berths in there, with the "next arriving" timings shown, and the date was listed as "13 July". These were the eight routes on the board: 99, 182, 253-258. So my guess is that this was probably the preliminary plan LTA had in mind. None of the berths or route description boards are up.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately I forgot to bring my phone in to take a snapshot, and I couldn't remember all the routes' destinations before I got chased out :(</p>

              <p>I guess the opening day may be delayed by one or two weeks because the upcoming General Elections may be in September. Many people say that it is on 12 September.</p>

              <p>I have new pictures, but I feel that if I share it online, I may
              get into trouble.</p>
              <p>because unlike previously, the bus interchange is already built.
              With road markings, road signboards, etcetera.</p>
              <p>Why don't you do it? :)</p>

              <p>If we assume a 5th September opening, we can expect the news to
              come about 2-3 weeks prior, so around 15-22 August.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UPDATE 19/8: Went to the bus interchange to take a peek. It's
              probably not going to open until November. Services 99, 182, 254,
              255, 257 likely to start from Joo Koon, along with three "new" JIS
              services 253, 256, 258.</p>

              <p>I heard that the bus stop opposite Blk932 bus stop is for service 99. So 99 will not be a loop service anymore. </p>
              <p>I also heard that it is delayed and will only  open on 21/11</p>
