              <p>Like most bus interchanges and terminals in Singapore, the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will be heavily-utilised during weekday peak hours, well-utilised during weekends and public holidays, and lightly-utlised during weekday regular hours.</p>
                                                  
                                                  <p>During weekday morning peak, bus services 182, 182M, 253, 254, 255 and 257 will experience high loading from Joo Koon Bus Interchange, as workers in the Tuas and Jurong Industrial Estates have to commute on them to get to their office/factory, while on their way to work. Meanwhile, bus services 99, 256 and 258 may experience high loading to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, as some residents of Jurong West may take 99, 256 or 268, and transfer to the MRT at Joo Koon MRT Station, while on their way to work. This is because it is easy to find empty seats on the east-bound train at Joo Koon MRT Station in the morning.</p>
                                                  <p>During weekday evening peak, there will be high loading on bus services 182, 182M, 253, 254, 255 and 257 to Joo Koon because workers have to commute on them to get to the Joo Koon MRT station, while on their way home. Meanwhile, there may be high loading on bus services 99, 256 and 258 from Joo Koon. This is because Fairprice Hub - where Joo Koon Bus Interchange is - has McDonaldsâ€™, Burger King, KFC, Popeyes, NTUC Foodfare, etcetera. As it is easier to find empty tables at Fairprice Hub than at Jurong Point, some residents of Jurong West may come here for dinner, while on their way home.</p>
                                                  
                                                  <p>During weekday regular hours, there will be very little people at Joo Koon Bus Interchange, as most people would be at their office, school or factory.</p>
                                                  <p>During weekends and public holidays, the bus interchange will be well-utilised throughout the day, by residents and workers alike. Residents may do their grocery shopping or have their meals at Fairprice Hub, and Workers will transfer at Joo Koon MRT Station as they head to the city area for leisure.</p>

              <p>I went to the Clementi Bus Interchange to see if there is the flyer about the opening of the Joo Koon Bus Interchange that I could collect.</p>
                                      <p>I thought there would be that flyer on the flyer racks at the Clementi Bus Interchange, since bus service 99 originates from here.</p>
                                      <p>However, there are none.</p>
                                      <p>It seems that only the Boon Lay Bus Interchange has that flyer.</p>
                                      <p>Still, it is only the information panel at the alighting bay area of the Boon Lay Bus Interchange that has that flyer; the other information panel at the sawtooth boarding berths area does not have that flyer.</p>

              <p>I went to the Clementi Bus Interchange to see if there is the

              could collect.</p>
              <p>I thought there would be that flyer on the flyer racks at the
              Clementi Bus Interchange, since bus service 99 originates from
              here.</p>
              <p>However, there are none.</p>
              <p>It seems that only the Boon Lay Bus Interchange has that
              flyer.</p>
              <p>Still, it is only the information panel at the alighting bay
              area of the Boon Lay Bus Interchange that has that flyer; the other
              information panel at the sawtooth boarding berths area does not

              <p>When the Tuas West MRT Extension opens by the end of next year, we may want to relocate 182 and 182M to Tuas Bus Terminal.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>We can amend the route of 192 to cover the skipped section of Upper Jurong Road and Tuas Road.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>This would vacate the four parking lots (I assume 182 and 182M has two lots each) at Joo Koon Bus Interchange for two more Jurong Industrial Bus Services.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>We can choose two from 246, 249, 251, 252 and 194.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>194 can relocate to Joo Koon, by plying more onto Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and turning to Benoi Road. It can loop at Jurong Bird Park.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Meanwhile, 249 can remain at Boon Lay and ply all bus stops along Jalan Boon Lay.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>For 246, most people at the industrial area use it to connect from their office/factory to Lakeside MRT Station. What we can do is to merge 246 and 252 into a single bus service. This service can loop at Lakeside MRT Station and skip Boon Lay Place entirely. This bus service can terminate at the Taman Jurong Bus Terminal, hence enable another bus service to use Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>at Taman Jurong, the route could be this:</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>... &gt; Jalan Tukang &gt; Corporation Road &gt; Boon Lay Way &gt; Yuan Ching Road &gt; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taman Jurong Bus Terminal</span></strong> &gt; Corporation Drive &gt; Yung Kuang Road &gt; Yuan Ching Road &gt; Boon Lay Way &gt; Corporation Road &gt; Jalan Tukang &gt; ...</li>

              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>We could let 251 use Joo Koon Bus Interchange, by letting it ply Upper Jurong Road and Benoi Road, after Pioneer Road North.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In summary, if we relocate 182 and 182M from Joo Koon to Tuas, we could relocate 252/246 and 251 from Boon Lay to Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>Likewise, we could relocate 257 from Joo Koon to Tuas, considering it still duplicates other bus routes all the way to Pioneer Sector 1/2/3.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>We can let 257 ply Pioneer Road and Tuas West Drive to the Tuas Bus Terminal. </li>
              <li>This would vacate two parking lots at Joo Koon Bus Interchange and enable a future bus service at Joo Koon.</li>

              <p>On 182: Although it's highly possible, personally I don't wish to see it happen. Don't forget 182 is still the only service at Tuas Checkpoint. Look at how many services Woodlands Checkpoint has...</p>
              <p>And I don't think 182 and 182M have 2 slots each - most likely they will share 2 slots, because their operating hours are distinctly different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On 192: Firstly, although you can use 192 to cover 182's stops along PIE and Upp Jurong Rd, it cannot cover 182's stops along Jln Ahmad Ibrahim. Secondly, doing so will result in 192 skipping Joo Koon ITH - and the direct link between Jurong West St 63 and Joo Koon will be lost. Although I agree that such a link is rather useless, if it's there for a reason, then I would rather accept and respect it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On moving services to Joo Koon: There's no point in moving JIS to Joo Koon just for the sake of doing it. If some areas are closer to Boon Lay/Pioneer compared to Joo Koon, it's better to have a bus service to Boon Lay/Pioneer. It's not fun to force everyone to "backtrack" to Joo Koon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On 194: Severe backtracking. So this means those at Bird Park will also need to go to Joo Koon? Please do not think that connecting people to any random MRT station is enough. Not to mention that Jurong Bird Park and that sector of Jln Ahmad Ibrahim is close to Boon Lay than Joo Koon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On 246/252: Firstly, I doubt "most people at the industrial area use it to connect from their office/factory to Lakeside MRT Station" is a correct statement. There are people who use 246 to Boon Lay, especially for those closer to Boon Lay, and I have seen it before. So the link between Boon Lay and Quality Rd/Jln Tukang needs to be maintained. Similarly, those who are taking 252 at Soon Lee area will also prefer Boon Lay, instead of winding through Quality Rd, Taman Jurong Ter and then to Lakeside MRT.</p>
              <p>Secondly, skipping Boon Lay Place is also not feasible. Don't forget that 246 is the only service at one bus stop along Boon Lay Dr; there are also people who take 246 from Lakeside towards Boon Lay Gardens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On 251: I would rather make 251 stay at Boon Lay rather than forcing it to go to Joo Koon. And even if it gets amended to Joo Koon, your proposed route is also too windy. There are many possible routes from Joo Koon towards Shipyard Rd which are shorter and more direct than yours. If your concern is the bus stops along Pioneer Rd North, you can always make another service (e.g. 246) call at those bus stops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall: Good effort, but sadly, not feasible and simply crazy.</p>

                                                          forget that 246 is the only service at one bus stop along Boon Lay
                                                          Dr; there are also people who take 246 from Lakeside towards
                                                          Boon Lay Gardens.</p>
                                                          <p> </p>
                                                          <p>On 251: I would rather make 251 stay at Boon Lay rather than
                                                          forcing it to go to Joo Koon. And even if it gets amended to
                                                          Joo Koon, your proposed route is also too windy. There are many
                                                          possible routes from Joo Koon towards Shipyard Rd which are shorter
                                                          and more direct than yours. If your concern is the bus stops along
                                                          Pioneer Rd North, you can always make another service (e.g. 246)
                                                          call at those bus stops.</p>

                                                          <p>Overall: Good effort, but sadly, not feasible and simply

                          <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
                                                          <p>Well, the idea is to relocate all Jurong Industrial bus services to Joo Koon Bus Interchange and Tuas Bus Terminal. If possible, 192, 193, 256 and 258 also. If need be, we can use Taman Jurong Bus Terminal.</p>
                                  <p>In fact, I want around ten to twenty bus services at Boon Lay Bus Interchange to relocate to other bus interchanges and terminals, so that Boon Lay Bus Interchange would only have around ten to twenty bus services.</p>
                                  <p>However, that is not likely going to happen, as Boon Lay Bus Interchange is in a location that is very accessible to so many places, and this is the largest bus interchange in the West.</p>
                                  <p>The reason for having this idea is because I wish that the area where I live in can one day revert back to the ulu place it used to be, where there was not too many people and the traffic volume on the road was just right.</p>
                                  <p>After all, Jurong West is a sub-urban area, not a city centre.</p>
                                  <p>I feel that there is too many people around, and the roads are just too congested during peak hours. Every morning and evening, there would be traffic congestions on roads leading to/from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, and sometimes to/from Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
                                  <p>Meanwhile, at the other sub-urban areas such as Choa Chu Kang, Yishun, Seng Kang and Pasir Ris, the traffic condition is better and there are not as many people around.</p>
                                  <p>I wish that Jurong West can be as quiet as the other sub-urban areas. :(</p>

                      <p>Indeed, copies of the flyer about the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange can be found occupying the entire side facing the boarding berths, on all three information panels at Boon Lay Bus Interchange - One next to alighting berth A1, the other at boarding berth B6, and another one at boarding berth B2. :)</p>

              <p>If they decide to change the allocation of berths at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, I hope they can separate bus services that ply the same area, by allocating them to different berths.</p>

              <p>In fact, I think services to the same area should be allocated to the same berth - for the exact same reason.</p>
              <p>If the 2 services are at different berths, which berth would you want those passengers to go to? If they are in the queue of one of them (let's say service A), then when the other service (let's say service B) comes, do you expect them to run all the way to board service B? Especially if the berths are far apart - then good luck running across the interchange. Putting A and B at the same berth effectively saves you from all the trouble as you can just board B at this berth even when you are in A's queue.  (This is also why all the Tampines-bound services at TPE bus stop are grouped together at the same 'berth', and likewise for all Pasir Ris-bound services,)</p>
              <p>Yes, I know there are bus arrival timings displayed in bus interchanges. But they're not always accurate; in fact, for some services, it's never accurate.</p>

              I share the exact same sentiments as array88. Wouldn't it cause so much inconvenience if you want to go to Pioneer and can choose between 241 and 179, and they are placed at opposite ends of the interchange? When people are rushing they would have to run all the way from one end to the other, and at the same time everyone is usually in a rush to get home in Sg lol

                  <p>Actually, I kinda regret it now. That I had spent (wasted) so much time on writing about bus routes (eg. Constantly asking for bus service to Pioneer MRT Station) and maintaining this thread. At the end of the day, all I got is just a thread with around five hundred posts, while I have given up so much of my life.</p>
                      <p>Although Joo Koon is finally opening, I am actually not looking forward to it. Joo Koon Bus Interchange is actually just a very small bus interchange located at the most ulu part of Singapore. Yet, I actually wasted so much time on it. If I could turn back time, I would probably not even write in to the LTA back then in year 2011 to repeatedly suggest bus services to Pioneer MRT Station, not to mention joining this forum and wasting so much time on this thread.</p>
                      <p>My studies are at stake now and I really have to go. I will probably not participate in online forums (including skyscrapercity) from now on.</p>
                      <p>Thank you for the six years and thank you for making thread a success. Who knew a thread about a very small bus interchange could actually have five hundred over posts? It's a miracle, really.</p>
                      <p>Soon, you may notice that I am no longer writing in forums. While my absence may be felt, please do not miss me. </p>
                      <p>I have to go, my studies needs me.</p>

                  to the same berth - for the exact same reason.</p>
              <p>If the 2 services are at different berths, which berth would you
                  want those passengers to go to? If they are in the queue of one of
                  them (let's say service A), then when the other service (let's say
                  service B) comes, do you expect them to run all the way to board
                  service B? Especially if the berths are far apart - then good luck
                  running across the interchange. Putting A and B at the same berth
                  effectively saves you from all the trouble as you can just board B
                  at this berth even when you are in A's queue.  (This is also
                  why all the Tampines-bound services at TPE bus stop are grouped
                  together at the same 'berth', and likewise for all Pasir Ris-bound
                  services,)</p>
              <p>Yes, I know there are bus arrival timings displayed in bus
                  interchanges. But they're not always accurate; in fact, for some
                  services, it's never accurate.</p>

              <p>Totally agree.. but for some reason this is not in practice at most places.</p>
              <p>Jurong East is a very good example of this.</p>

              <p>Currently 78 &amp; 79 are placed far apart. Also 51, 143 are not together. 41, 183 should have same berth but do not. </p>
