              <p>How's the loading like? Is 256 worth an amendment into Kian Teck, or an extension towards Tuas? Just looking at the route, the service does seemingly have potential for such.</p>

              <p>maybe sbst should try SD first before have DD for 258 waste of space. sbst can deploy some DDs to other services some where. </p>

                      <p>I observe that more and more people (are making the switch to) take bus service 258 at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, especially during evening peak hours.</p>
                      <p>Actually, we do not have to comment whether or not there are people taking bus service 258. The data from the EZ-Link card readers on bus service 258 says it all.</p>

                  <p>Now, they are at Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>
                  <p>Really going to miss those days when bus services 182, 182M, 254, 255 and 257 were at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>It is only four less bus services (182/182M, 254, 255 and 257), yet Boon Lay Bus Interchange feels quiet now. Two weeks ago when 182/182M and 257 were removed, I already can feel it. Today, when 254 and 255 were removed, I can feel it even more.</p>
                          <p>I guess it will take a while for me to get used to a quiet Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
                          <p>Probably because there are less foreigners now. Have been using the Boon Lay Bus Interchange with them since the very beginning (of my life. I am nineteen years old). Suddenly, most of the foreigners have gone over to Joo Koon Bus Interchange. The whole place feels more local now. It feels weird. I do not know why. :(</p>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p>Meanwhile, there are some painting and re-painting of the words and lines on the floor at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. Surprisingly, the yellow colour boarding rows at the sawtooth section (B1 to B6) are retained. They even painted a new coat of yellow over the yellow colour lines, for the yellow colour boarding row.</p>
                           <p>Apparently, 179A is getting a second boarding row. If so, I think some other bus services which experience long queues will also get second boarding row, like 243G and 243W. This is one possibility.</p>
                          <p>The other possibility is that there will be another round of new bus services at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. However, based on the number of bus parking lots, there can only be one more terminating there. The rest can only loop around the bus interchange driveway.</p>
                      <p>There is another possibility, that is they are installing the new priority queue and seats feature at Boon Lay Bus Interchange's sawtooth boarding berth.</p>

              <p>Let me take back what I wrote yesterday, about how I miss those days when bus services 182, 182M, 254, 255 and 257 were at Boon Lay.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Went out to Jurong Point just now... I feel that it is better, if we re-route the remaining Jurong-Industrial bus services out of Boon Lay Bus Interchange. If possible, out of Jurong West residential areas.</p>
                                          <p>Tuas Bus Terminal has around twelve bus parking lots. Joo Koon Bus Interchange has around eighteen bus parking lots. Together, both have around thirty bus parking lots.</p>
                                          <p>When the MRT Tuas West Extension opens next year, why not transfer some bus services over to originate/terminate at Tuas Bus Terminal, and let all Jurong-Industrial bus services originate/terminate at only Tuas and Joo Koon?</p>
                                          <p>If possible (it is possible!), re-route 192, 193, 194, 246, 249, 251, 252 and 256 out of Jurong West residential areas. Likewise, re-route 78 and 79 out of Jurong East residential areas.</p>
                                          <p>Meanwhile, re-route 258, 98 and 99 out of the Jurong Industrial Estate.</p>
                                          <p>After all, Joo Koon and Tuas combined can handle around fifteen bus services. They are definitely enough to contain every bus service in the Jurong and Tuas industrial areas. How many bus services at there anyway? Sixteen? (78, 79, 182, 182M, 192, 193, 194, 246, 249, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257) Okay la. Not enough. But if create one more bus interchange or roadside bus terminal in the industrial area, confirm got enough space for all the bus services in the industrial areas.</p>
                                          <p>I do not care if there would be route duplications or what, I just want all the industrial bus services out of Jurong West and Jurong East residential areas!</p>
                                          <p>The bird park bus service can revert to original form, running express and calling at only the bird park, only at certain hours of the day. </p>
                                          <p>However, the problem is that the foreigners know how to take MRT to Boon Lay and Jurong East! I do not know why they still come to Boon Lay and Jurong East, even though the one at Joo Koon has everything they can afford to buy. Except it does not have a supermarket where they can buy things at. No wonder. :(</p>
                                          <p>If there is ever a shopping centre at the industrial area, along the Tuas West MRT Extension, I hope it can feature a big field and a supermarket, and have nice design. Then the foreigners would want to go there, instead of come here. As if Fairprice Hub is not nice like that. The only set back about Fairprice Hub is that the supermarket only members can buy. :(</p>
                                          <p>By the way, I am NOT against them. I welcome them with open arms. However, their behaviour is really a let down. Was on the train just now, from Jurong East station to Pioneer station. The foreigners were like touching here and there, and moving around when there is no need to.</p>
                                          <p>I have been staying in Jurong West for all my life. I think it is only on Sundays and Public Holidays that they are around. So, it is my fault for going out at the wrong time. :(</p>
                                          <p>But, really, if want to seperate, separate completely. Do not move only some over to Joo Koon and keep some here at Boon Lay. Best is to remove all direct bus connections between Jurong West and Jurong East residential areas and the industrial areas in Jurong and Tuas.</p>
                                          <p>Anyway, it is only some people in Jurong West and Jurong East residential areas who really go to the industrial areas to work. They can take feeder to Boon Lay (or Jurong East) and take MRT to Joo Koon (or Tuas), before taking a bus to their work place - like many other people working at other places.</p>

              <p>I have noticed that some of those amended services are still using old destos.</p>
              <p>I saw SBS9538H (SLBP 192) still using the side desto which still stated the services plied Jurong West Avenue 4 and Lok Yang Way. I suspect it might be the case too for 193 and 251 since most buses which used destos will be gone within the next 2 years so no point making new side destos for those services.</p>

              extension line; only bus services 502 and 242 were amended and only
              bus service 241 was introduced. But now, ... I think early closure
              is the only option.</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongresident, are you trying to tell us that there must be much more bus services that is required than the current no at each bus interchange so that they can at anytime cater to the mrt breakdowns? Everywhere must plan more services as we will not know when and where the next breakdown will occur. Come on, this will not work. The root cause of breakdown must be addressed. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

                      <p>SINGAPORE: About 65 passengers aboard a train travelling towards Joo Koon from Pioneer MRT stations were told to get off the train close to Pioneer MRT station after train services between Joo Koon and Boon Lay were disrupted due to a traction power trip on Thursday evening (Dec 17).</p>
                      <p>Public transport operator SMRT announced on Facebook at 9.07pm that Joo Koon and Pioneer stations were closed, and its engineering staff were working to resolve the fault.</p>
                      <p>Half an hour later, it said it was in the process of recovering a train that stalled between Joo Koon and Pioneer MRT stations.</p>
                      <p>Just past 10pm, train service resumed after a two-hour disruption. SMRT said the faulty train was taken out of service and that it is investigating the cause. It first sent out a tweet about a delay at 7.49pm on Thursday and warned commuters about additional travelling time of up to 20 minutes.</p>
                      <p>Free bus services and shuttle buses were activated between Joo Koon and Jurong East MRT stations.</p>
                      <p>Some commuters took to social media to warn members of the public about the disruption, which started just after rush hour.</p>

              <p>I think buses serving Joo Koon Interchange (99, 256, 258) will be serving well during the breakdown yst.</p>
              <p>So it is good that there is an Interchange that can cover the load of Boon Lay Interchange. If not, there will be over crowding at Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>It's one of the reasons why I support bus-MRT rationalisation to increase overall system efficiency. (Just not at the scale LTA did it in 2003)</p>

                  <p> </p>

                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Conclusion:</p>
                  <p>Yes, there is less duplication of resources.</p>
                  <p>No, there is no savings in resources. In fact, more resources are used.</p>
