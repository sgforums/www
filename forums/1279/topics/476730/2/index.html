              <p>I agree. with Joo Koon, the focus has to be to provide more connectivity between Tuas / Jurong Industrial estates to MRT. Today many sectors/avenues do not have any bus service. People have to walk long distance if have to take bus. This has to be first priority. Then people can take bus from Boon Lay or MRT and go wherever they need. But first priority is at least provide those people connection to get to MRT.</p>

              <p>When LTA properly designs the bus network, everything remains unchanged; because you know why: Tseung Kwan O Line broke down on 17 December 2013 which causes a lot of catastrophe: Restricted services between Tseung Kwan O and Quarry Bay. Unfortunately this is stubborn; and they dispose the services without thinking. No bus rationalisations is allowed after 2011 MRT train disruptions, and if possible allow them to bring back bus routes parallel to MRT: 9 from Yishun to Orchard with N9; 11 from Geylang Lorong 1 to Rifle Range Road.</p>

              17 December 2013 which causes a lot of catastrophe: Restricted
              services between Tseung Kwan O and Quarry Bay. Unfortunately this
              is stubborn; and they dispose the services without thinking. No bus
              rationalisations is allowed after 2011 MRT train disruptions, and
              if possible allow them to bring back bus routes parallel to MRT: 9
              from Yishun to Orchard with N9; 11 from Geylang Lorong 1 to Rifle
              Range Road.</p>
              <p>Hope we don't want Hong Kong's example to repeat again in
              Singapore. Is like u want to sack anyone in the school. U remember
              the new Rapid Transit Systems Act?</p>

              <p>actually, I do not think it is sufficient to separate the entire industrial area into only six zones. based on how many people work and live in the industrial area, we have to separate the area into at least twelve zones: Lokyang-Kianteck, Joo Koon, Gul, Benoi, Shipyard, Pioneer Sector, Tuas Crescent-Tuas Basin, Pioneer Road-Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, Tuas West, Tuas South (North), Tuas South (South). </p>
              <p>To ensure efficiency, there has to be another bus interchange at Tuas. so let it be Tuas Bus Terminal. Of the (at least) twelve zones, Joo Koon take six, Tuas take six.</p>
              <p> as for the intra-town bus services, I agree we should let them start at Tuas Bus Terminal. whereas for the other end, it can either be Boon Lay, Jurong East or anywhere else.</p>

              <p>people can simply make a transfer from the "feeders" to the intra-town bus services and go to whichever bus interchange or whichever MRT station along the way, and find their way home from there.</p>

              <p>no la. I think the "trunks" will only run between Tuas Bus Terminal and Joo Koon Bus Interchange, and between Joo Koon Bus Interchange and Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel that the bus network currently at Tuas, Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning areas) is not effective - evident from the regular peak hour traffic congestion. With the Tuas MRT line coming along, <strong>there has to be bus rationalisation at Tuas area</strong>, with a new set of bus services in Tuas, Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning areas).</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I think the new set of bus services will consists of peak hour bus services<strong> (PHBS)</strong> and <strong>"trunk"</strong> bus services.</p>
              <ul>
              <li># The peak hour bus services (<strong>PHBS</strong>) will <strong>operate only during peak hours</strong> and run between the MRT stations and industrial area, to <strong>serve as last/first leg of public transport</strong> for people working there. </li>
              <li># Similar to service 42 at Kembangan MRT Station, <strong>each PHBS will loop inside one/two industrial area(s) and go to a MRT station</strong>.  They will not go to any bus interchange or terminal.</li>
              <li># PHBSs goes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span></strong>to (along the minor roads) industrial areas.</li>
              <li># Since there are seven MRT stations (Tuas Link, Tuas West Road, Tuas Crescent, Gul Circle, Joo Koon, Pioneer &amp; Boon Lay), there should be around 7-14 such bus services, with <strong>1-2 of them per MRT station</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>% The <strong>"trunk"</strong> bus services will <strong>operate throughout the day</strong> and run along the main roads of Tuas, Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning areas), to<strong> provide bus connection to other parts of Singapore</strong> (including from Tuas to Joo Koon).</li>
              <li>% These shall be<strong> the only bus services in Tuas/Pioneer&amp;Boon Lay (planning area) during off-peak hours</strong> when the demand for bus services there is low.</li>
              <li>% "trunk"s goes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">around</span></strong> (along the main roads)(without going in) industrial areas.</li>
              <li>% Tuas's "trunk" shall be those serving west of Benoi Road, whereas those serving east of Benoi Road shall be Pioneer and Boon Lay (Planning areas)' "trunk". </li>
              <li>% <strong>All "trunk"s shall originate from Joo Koon Bus Interchange</strong>. </li>
              <li>% Tuas's "trunk" may either end at Tuas Bus Terminal or loop somewhere in Tuas.</li>
              <li>% Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning areas)' "trunk" may end at any other bus interchange (eg. Boon Lay, Jurong East, etc.) or loop anywhere.</li>
