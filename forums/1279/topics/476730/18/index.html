                                              would change route while 192 will remain course, as 192 is almost
                                              full fleet DD required for ave 4 (especially with one service
                                              gone).</p>
                                              <p>243G/W can lose its BSEP buses to 258 once this route kicks in.
                                              No need for so many buses on 243G/W. </p>

                                              <p>With regards to 243,</p>
                                              <p>Actually, I notice 243 has been getting additional buses regularly, since around year 2011 when bus services started improving (quarterly) and since 2012 when BSEP started. </p>
                                      <p>I feel that this new 258 is meant to complement 243, rather than substitute. </p>
                                              <p>Hence, I do not think we should reduce the fleet size of 243.</p>
                                              <p>If want, we should replace some DDs with SDs during non-peak hours, and that's about it. </p>
                                              <p>Otherwise, just maintain the fleet size would do.</p>
                                              <p>Another way to see it is that now with this new 258, there is no longer the need to expand 243 bus fleet, any more. :)</p>
                          <p>I guess there are strong demands for a complementary bus connection to Boon Lay Bus Interchange at Jurong West Street 64/75, and strong demands for a bus connection to Pioneer MRT Station at areas along Pioneer Road North. That's why there is this new 258.</p>
                  <p>During peak hours, there may be many people taking 258. I think High-Capacity buses are required. </p>
                  <p>During non-peak hours, there may be only a small number of people taking 258. I think Low-Capacity buses are good enough. </p>
                          <p>I am not sure if this new 258 would affect the loading on 243.</p>
                      <p>I think we should maintain 243 bus fleet as it is, at least for the time being. There may be changes in travel patterns and stuff, but let's let everything settle first, before we make any adjustment to 243.</p>

              <p>I was literally shocked when I saw the posters... Like seriously, what's this? So many route amendments that make no sense...</p>
              <p>And why are there still so many services at Boon Lay? I hope 256, 258 will loop at Boon Lay instead of terminating there... If not, it's a total failure of planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>99: Good.</p>
              <p>258: The section between Boon Lay and Pioneer is very good... Will be a major hit in Jurong West. It may even become the next 860 especially during AM peak, as the walking distance from Pioneer MRT to the bus stop is much shorter than from Boon Lay MRT to Boon Lay Int, and there's higher probability of getting seats at Pioneer MRT as compared to Boon Lay.  </p>
              <p>However, the section between Pioneer and Joo Koon is weird... Other than having a terminating point (if 258 loops at Boon Lay) and connecting Jurong West town with Joo Koon, I don't find it useful in any other ways. And is there such a strong demand between Jurong West and Joo Koon that warrants connection to the doorstep? From my experience, most commuters on JIS (except 246) are foreign workers. How many of them stay in areas where 258 plies?</p>
              <p>And why the hell is 258 a JIS when its main demand comes from Jurong West town? (If not, why is it using this service number?) There may even be 258M from Boon Lay looping at Pioneer MRT... Because it's loading will be much higher than the Pioneer - Joo Koon sector.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>182/M: Expected. </p>
              <p>192 and 193: Again, this doesn't make sense at all... Is it fun to just give 192 a heavily duplicated route from Boon Lay to Joo Koon, and just let 193 take over 192's deleted sectors? I can't think of any reason for 192's amendment - except for a faster journey from Tuas to Pioneer/Boon Lay, which doesn't sound really necessary to me, especially when 192 already calls at the bus stop outside Joo Koon ITH and more than half of the pax already alight there; and faster journey from Upp Jurong Road to Boon Lay, which is again unnecessary. Especially considering 193 is the service with weaker loading and lower capacity than 192, and now 193 has to take all the pax from Lok Yang, Soon Lee Dormitory (there are foreign workers going to Boon Lay, and soon there will be many going to Joo Koon to transfer to 253/254/255/257), and Jurong West Ave 4... How can 193 handle a route with such high loading, when 192 just slacks between Joo Koon and Boon Lay? </p>
              <p>257: Expected.</p>
              <p>256: Although it's a good service in mantaining 256's link in Jurong West and unique sector along Jln Ahmad Ibrahim, it shows no uniqueness at all... As if it's simply breaking up 257 into 256 and 257. Not sure if people will be happy... Furthermore, judging by the route, 256 may have poor frequency. Which is worrying because it will be the only service from Soon Lee Dormitory to Joo Koon Int (with 193 only calling at the bus stop along Benoi Rd), and also from Soon Lee to Pioneer/Boon Lay. To be honest, I think the route amendments did not consider those workers at all, or to a very limited extent. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>254: Expected.</p>
              <p>255: Expected.</p>
              <p>253 and 251: I want to discuss these 2 services together... Because 251's amendment again doesn't make sense. 253's Benoi Sector part and 251's Boon Lay Way part I can understand... But 251's big loop at Shipyard/Pioneer for what? It appears to me that this kind of amendment is just for profits without considering convenience of commuters. Shipyard Rd now has a bidirectional service, and after the amendment, only unidirectional 251? Same for Pioneer Rd (although they have 253). And Benoi Rd left with 253 which winds along Benoi Sector... Again, I cannot figure out why.</p>
              <p>194: Is this a joke? A bird park service being used just to cover the deleted sectors of 251? And expecting all those visitors from Bird Park returning to Boon Lay to cross the road... Moreover Jurong Bird Prk will be moved soon... Then what's the function of 194? Just to serve the few bus stops along Jln Ahmad Ibrahim?</p>

              <p>Can I say I'm really disappointed with the route amendments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was literally shocked when I saw the posters... Like
              seriously, what's this? So many route amendments that make no
              sense...</p>
              <p>And why are there still so many services at Boon Lay? I hope
              256, 258 will loop at Boon Lay instead of terminating there... If
              not, it's a total failure of planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>99: Good.</p>
              <p>258: The section between Boon Lay and Pioneer is very good...
              Will be a major hit in Jurong West. It may even become the next 860
              especially during AM peak, as the walking distance from Pioneer MRT
              to the bus stop is much shorter than from Boon Lay MRT to Boon Lay
              Int, and there's higher probability of getting seats at Pioneer MRT
              as compared to Boon Lay.  </p>
              <p>However, the section between Pioneer and Joo Koon is weird...
              Other than having a terminating point (if 258 loops at Boon Lay)
              and connecting Jurong West town with Joo Koon, I don't find it
              useful in any other ways. And is there such a strong demand between
              Jurong West and Joo Koon that warrants connection to the doorstep?
              From my experience, most commuters on JIS (except 246) are foreign
              workers. How many of them stay in areas where 258 plies?</p>
              <p>And why the hell is 258 a JIS when its main demand comes from
              Jurong West town? (If not, why is it using this service number?)
              There may even be 258M from Boon Lay looping at Pioneer MRT...
              Because it's loading will be much higher than the Pioneer - Joo

                                  <p>Whereas for the berth, it would be good if 258 and 243G can be together at the same berth, so that the people staying at Street 64, 75 and 81 can (jump-queue and) take whichever bus service that comes first. They can move 179 to the innermost row, move 243G to the middle, and put 258 at the outermost row. 182 can put at the outside row (yellow colour) during that remaining one week at Boon Lay, while we temporarily move 405 to another berth (28 November then move back again, or even give it a proper row at another berth, that is either red, blue or green).</p>

              <p>258: The section between Boon Lay and Pioneer is very good...

              <p>However, the section between Pioneer and Joo Koon is weird...
              Other than having a terminating point (if 258 loops at Boon Lay)
              and connecting Jurong West town with Joo Koon, I don't find it
              useful in any other ways. And is there such a strong demand between
              Jurong West and Joo Koon that warrants connection to the doorstep?
              From my experience, most commuters on JIS (except 246) are foreign
              workers. How many of them stay in areas where 258 plies?</p>
              <p>And why the hell is 258 a JIS when its main demand comes from
              Jurong West town? (If not, why is it using this service number?)
              There may even be 258M from Boon Lay looping at Pioneer MRT...
              Because it's loading will be much higher than the Pioneer - Joo
              Koon sector.</p></div></blockquote>
              <p>Actually, when I first saw the route, I also have such remarks. Like, 258 could have simply looped around or near Pioneer MRT Station. Then, I realise it is good that they route it to Joo Koon, via Upper Jurong Road. </p>
              <p>At Upper Jurong Road, there is SAFTI. NS men staying at Jurong West can take this (or 99) direct bus back home when they book-out. :)</p>
              <p>At Joo Koon, there is Fairprice Hub. There got this hyper-market called "Warehouse Club", where I (if I have their membership) can buy things at discounted prices. :)</p>
              <p>For the section between Boon Lay and Pioneer, yes, I feel that if 258 is well-received,  there may be short-working trips, like 241A.</p>
              <p>Whereas for service type, I hope 258 is a Jurong-Industrial Service (JIS), because JIS frequency is feeder-like (6 minutes) during peak hours and trunk-like (at least 10 minutes) during non-peak hours. </p>

              <p>Can I say I'm really disappointed with the route amendments?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was literally shocked when I saw the posters... Like
              seriously, what's this? So many route amendments that make no
              sense...</p>
              <p>And why are there still so many services at Boon Lay? I hope
              256, 258 will loop at Boon Lay instead of terminating there... If
              not, it's a total failure of planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>99: Good.</p>
              <p>258: The section between Boon Lay and Pioneer is very good...
              Will be a major hit in Jurong West. It may even become the next 860
              especially during AM peak, as the walking distance from Pioneer MRT
              to the bus stop is much shorter than from Boon Lay MRT to Boon Lay

              There may even be 258M from Boon Lay looping at Pioneer MRT...
              Because it's loading will be much higher than the Pioneer - Joo

              <p> </p>
              <p>182/M: Expected. </p>
              <p>192 and 193: Again, this doesn't make sense at all... Is it fun
              to just give 192 a heavily duplicated route from Boon Lay to Joo
              Koon, and just let 193 take over 192's deleted sectors? I can't
              think of any reason for 192's amendment - except for a faster
              journey from Tuas to Pioneer/Boon Lay, which doesn't sound really
              necessary to me, especially when 192 already calls at the bus stop
              outside Joo Koon ITH and more than half of the pax already alight
              there; and faster journey from Upp Jurong Road to Boon Lay, which
              is again unnecessary. Especially considering 193 is the service
              with weaker loading and lower capacity than 192, and now 193 has to
              take all the pax from Lok Yang, Soon Lee Dormitory (there are
              foreign workers going to Boon Lay, and soon there will be many
              going to Joo Koon to transfer to 253/254/255/257), and Jurong West
              Ave 4... How can 193 handle a route with such high loading, when
              192 just slacks between Joo Koon and Boon Lay? </p>
              <p>257: Expected.</p>
              <p>256: Although it's a good service in mantaining 256's link in
              Jurong West and unique sector along Jln Ahmad Ibrahim, it shows no
              uniqueness at all... As if it's simply breaking up 257 into 256 and
              257. Not sure if people will be happy... Furthermore, judging by
              the route, 256 may have poor frequency. Which is worrying because
              it will be the only service from Soon Lee Dormitory to Joo Koon Int
              (with 193 only calling at the bus stop along Benoi Rd), and also
              from Soon Lee to Pioneer/Boon Lay. To be honest, I think the route
              amendments did not consider those workers at all, or to a very
              limited extent. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>254: Expected.</p>
              <p>255: Expected.</p>
              <p>253 and 251: I want to discuss these 2 services together...
              Because 251's amendment again doesn't make sense. 253's Benoi
              Sector part and 251's Boon Lay Way part I can understand... But
              251's big loop at Shipyard/Pioneer for what? It appears to me that
              this kind of amendment is just for profits without considering
              convenience of commuters. Shipyard Rd now has a bidirectional
              service, and after the amendment, only unidirectional 251? Same for
              Pioneer Rd (although they have 253). And Benoi Rd left with 253
              which winds along Benoi Sector... Again, I cannot figure out
              why.</p>
              <p>194: Is this a joke? A bird park service being used just to
              cover the deleted sectors of 251? And expecting all those visitors
              from Bird Park returning to Boon Lay to cross the road... Moreover
              Jurong Bird Prk will be moved soon... Then what's the function of
              194? Just to serve the few bus stops along Jln Ahmad Ibrahim?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Visitors from Bird Park returning to Boon Lay Int dun hv to cross over ah. There is a roundabout at Pioneer Circus. So buses just use the roundabout.</p>
              <p>As for Jurong Bird Park moving soon. How soon will it move? I dun think it will soon move. If let's say it moved or closed early for migrating the birds to elsewhere, Svc 194 may extend? Well, can't please everyone right.</p>

              <p>Actually, I feel that it would be good if they can take this

              <p>For convenience, they should put all feeder bus services at B4
              and B3, since they are the most accessible from Boon Lay MRT
              Station back gate.</p>

              <p>the feeders are seperated for a reason. putting all together will cause a jam and bunching as feeder loading is longer and the boarding queues will all snake together and cause more confusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even now sometimes the 241/242 queue overlaps each other ... </p>
              <p>example: put 243g 243w together die, both already take so long to load. </p>

              <p>if lets say lah (IF lah) 258 the numbering used is for JIS, do u think 258 will be extended in the future when tuas MRT extension opens? (if not why LTA suka suka want to put number 258)</p>
              <p>I wonder if there are any bus service that will be amended when tuas MRT extension opens</p>
              <p>oh and i just realise that the new 253 is the old 253 lol</p>
