              <p>The number of bus shuttle operations should reduce once LTA launches more services to Tuas, Pioneer and Gul. Just look at Sv 20. People are preferring this service and within months you can see packed to door buses at Simei between 7.45 and 8.30 every morning. </p>

              <p>[well, I know it's off-topic, but just to keep this thread going (preventing it from expiring before Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens)...]</p>
              <p>you know, at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, there is this section next to Jurong West Street 64 that is open air and currently used as a sheltered walkway for people to walk from Boon Lay Bus Interchange/Jurong Point to Jurong West Library/Frontier CC and beyond (to the HDB flats).</p>
              <p>just wondering. </p>
              <p>is it possible (feasible) if LTA create another driveway at that side, so that buses (of sawtooth bus services) can enter/exit the interchange from there and go directly to Street 64 - instead of making one big turn to the alighting berths area and ply Jurong West Central 3, before going to Street 64?</p>
              <p>for instance, we can create a traffic light junction next to the existing HDB driveway at blk 664A, and create the driveway for buses at the other side of the road, for buses to enter/exit Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>this will relieve the traffic at Jurong West Central 3, which can be very heavy during peak hours. if buses can enter from street 64 side, travelling times may be shortened, which will benefit the commuters (can travel faster), bus drivers (can drive faster) and the bus company (can deploy less buses for the same frequency, since distance is shorter).</p>
              <p>of course, it can be argued that this is not feasible because the driveway to Jurong Point carpark is quite near. well, a solution for this is to expand the road and create a lane (nearest to the road divider) specially for drivers who want to drive into the Jurong Point carpark, from the st64-central3 junction to the possible new traffic light junction.</p>
              <p>this can also benefit drivers who want to drive into Jurong Point carpark from Jurong West Street 63.</p>

              <p>I went to Joo Koon MRT area just now and asked one man about the Joo Koon Bus Interchange. He told me that the <strong>buses will enter at Benoi Road and exit at Joo Koon Circle</strong>.</p>

              <p>6 years ago, there was a tender released by LTA, for a proposed temporary bus terminal infrastructure at Joo Koon Circle (South of the upcoming Fairprice Hub building).</p>
              <p>This was a drawing in the tender, retrieved from <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?p=26609816">a thread in SkyscraperCity</a>:</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v637/tamagoo/bus2/JKT/JKT2.png" alt="" width="1036" height="420"></p>
              <p>The proposed temporary terminal was supposed to have eight parking lots.</p>
              <p>Since one bus service occupies two end-on parking lots at a bus interchange (eg. Boon Lay, Bedok [old] and Jurong East [old]), it can be deduced that Joo Koon Bus Interchange was to have only four bus services, as of 2008/9.</p>
              <p>Five/Six years on, I discovered that Joo Koon Bus Interchange might have around ten parking lots.</p>
              <p>Assuming the plan has not changed - where there will only be four bus services using Joo Koon Bus Interchange when it opens - there is provision for around one-two new bus services in future.</p>
              <p>Since it's just four to six bus services, I think we can rule out quite a number of possible routes to/from Joo Koon Bus Interchange. In my opinion, I think the routes will only cover Tuas and Jurong Industrial Estate.</p>

              <p>From what I have heard Joo Koon interchange will be used solely for Benoi-Gul-Pioneer-Tuas industrial estates and not really have city direction trunk services.

              <p>The whole JIS service needs a re-routing. Some routes are very winding. This is a good opportunity for LTA to make a proper routing including 182/192/193/254/255/257.</p>

              <p>Hopefully, after the re-routing, there can be still be one bus route that goes into Jurong West Extension area, before going into the industrial area and end at Joo Koon Bus Interchange. Maybe can stop at Pioneer MRT Station before going into industrial area, so the load can be seperated, since after all there are two distinct types of commuters: residents (before Pioneer MRT) and employees (after Pioneer MRT).</p>

              <p>Joo Koon will have 2 new services in 2015. 1 service either 249 or 251 will get extended to Joo Koon and start from here looping @ Boon Lay. 1 service from Boon Lay will get transferred to Joo Koon. Don't know which one it would be but I guess it could be 255 or 257. </p>

              <p>regarding 49, since the buses for it will be supplied from Bulim Bus Depot from second half of 2016, I think it will be extended to Bulim Avenue and start from Bulim Drive where Bulim Depot is located. similar to 185 at Soon Lee Bus Depot. by then, if the route is extended to Bulim Depot, I think the Taman Jurong Terminal will no longer exist. Rather, 49 will simply loop around Jurong Secondary School area and return to Bulim Depot.</p>

              <p><br> to be honest, I feel that Joo Koon Bus Interchange is kinda like a JoKer interchange.</p>
              <p>around four services only, still can call 'bus interchange'?</p>
              <p>I support your idea. </p>
              <p>it could have been better if there is another Bukit Merah Bus Interchange there instead.</p>
              <p>then can fit in more services and really help to relieve load off Boon Lay and Jurong East Bus Interchanges (and the associated roads).</p>

              <p>Dear friends, I am sorry to confess that the things I wrote on 13 August 2014 was only partial correct. While it is correct that the buses will enter from Benoi Road and exit at Joo Koon Circle, it is not correct to say that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange has only end-on berths.</p>
              <p>In fact, Joo Koon Bus Interchange does not have any end-on berth. From my observation (where I can go in a little to see what's inside, since some metal barriers have been removed) today,  it seems that Joo Koon Bus Interchange is somewhat similar to Eunos Bus Interchange and Clementi Bus Interchange, where there is <strong>one bus bay</strong> (with several parking lots), <strong>one <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alighting bay</span></strong> (kinda similar to the one at Eunos Bus Interchange) and <strong>a few <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sawtooth berths</span></strong>.</p>

              <p>Apparently, there seems to be around three sawtooth berths, which means the Joo Koon Bus Interchange may have around nine to twelve bus services.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, here's an update on the exit at Joo Koon Circle:</p>

              <p>Apparently, it seems that the NTUC Fairprice Hub is ready for occupancy already. 
              I am currently applying for a part time job at one of the stores there. They say the store will open at around end-October/early-November.</p> 
              <p>
              From the looks of it, the Joo Koon Bus Interchange may open at around December this year.</p>
