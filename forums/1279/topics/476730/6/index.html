              <p>Hi Mr array88, I am sorry, but shouldn't you be studying for
              your O level examination?</p>
              <p>My advice is that you should do something else instead of
              writing in forums or following news. For example, you can watch
              dramas when you are taking a break. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The English language used in
              forums is not always perfect. You should read other forms of media
              that use perfect English, such as news portals, etc.</span></p>
              <p>The O level examination is a major examination. It determines
              your future.</p>
              <p>Please do not be distracted.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange will only affect
              people working in Jurong Industrial Estate. Even with Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange, things will go on as per normal. So do not think about
              it.</p>
              <p>Just focus on your O level examination.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Thanks for your advice. Anyway I'm quite confident in my O levels, and I have already received an offer from a JC by DSA...</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, shorten routes 178, 30, 154, 99, etc??? I can imagine the big cry coming up if that is to happen. Nowadays residents get extremely vocal at MP session if their bus routes can cut. So I doubt this will ever happen. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Regarding the rumor that it would be incorporated into Westgate

              <p>Nonetheless, that part may indicate that the future new Jurong

              <p>Anyway, regarding the development that will contain Jurong East Bus Interchange, I think it will be mostly (if not entirely) underground, with Jurong East Bus Interchange at the first storey. This is because that site is constraint with the MRT tracks above.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, they already announced so they will have it in their plans. If they really bother that it is an opposition area, they may as well don't care to announce plans initially. However they do not do that. So please do not link politics to bus services. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Agree... Hmmm... From the map that jurongwestresident show... Is it that the buses will turn right from the constructed road into the future interchange? And then like that Svc 98 will exit from where the current road leads to Boon Lay Way?</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, I doubt so. This should not be used as indication. But good news for you. 2 new bus services are going to be implemented for east side and 3 new bus services will be implemented for west side over the next few months.</p>
              <p>Since you stay in west, I believe you should be more concerned for the west of Singapore. Jurong east, bukit batok and west coast benefit as announced by LTA. I believe the one for west coast should start from kent ridge terminal towards west coast and maybe even further up to Boon Lay. Let's see over the next few months. Cheers. </p>

              <p><br>Service 513 guides are also available in Tampines Int office, and last time they had service 10e guides. Does this mean that 513 and 10e will be extended to Tampines Int? No.</p>
              <p>Service 128 guides are available in Yio Chu Kang Int office, so does this mean that 128 will be amended to Yio Chu Kang Int? No.</p>
              <p>And nowadays service guides can fly everywhere. I used to see sv 25, 55 and 87 guides in Tampines, sv 5 guides in Hougang, and sv 21, 105, 168 guides in Eunos etc.</p>

              <p>Just saw the<a href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/press/2014/20141006_BSEP_3rd_qtr_2014_map_ANNEX_B.pdf"> image</a> at LTA website regarding BSEP. It seems that in the next few months, there will be three new bus services at Bukit Batok, Jurong East and West Coast.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">With the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange opening next month (or in December), there will be changes to bus routes, to re-route some of them here.</span></p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that the new bus routes at Jurong East and West Coast may involve Joo Koon Bus Interchange. Or maybe not. </p>
              <p>Well, just saying.</p>
