              <p>It's not official. There was just one plastic sample electronic
              display board hanging above one of the berths in there, with the
              "next arriving" timings shown, and the date was listed as "13
              July". These were the eight routes on the board: 99, 182, 253-258.
              So my guess is that this was probably the preliminary plan LTA had
              in mind. None of the berths or route description boards are up.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately I forgot to bring my phone in to take a snapshot,
              and I couldn't remember all the routes' destinations before I got

              <p>Why not? If the only problem is length-wise, it shouldn't be an issue; 16km is only marginally longer than 15.5km, and that is certainly better than 25.6km straight.</p>
              <p>If you look at 103, each of its current one-direction route is about 18km, while previously the loop spans across 24.9km.</p>

Unfortunately all the gates are closed so I cannot enter the int and see the routes of 99, 253, 256, 258 etc. (I wonder how someone here managed to enter the Interchange previously)</span></p>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">Anyway, there are 2 entrances: one along Joo Koon Circle (only for direction towards the west) and one along Benoi Rd (only for direction towards the north, after 192's stop). The only exit is along Joo Koon Circle, but a unidirectional slip road across Joo Koon Circle (near MRT) is being built so that buses can turn to the right. </div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">From what I see when peeping through the entrance at Benoi Rd, the layout of Joo Koon Int is quite similar to Eunos Int, except entrances and berths. There are 2 alighting berths and likely 3 boarding berths. Although most of the signboards in the int are completed, berth allocation is not done yet and I didn't find service numbers on any of the signboards. But overall it seems that the interchange is ready to open on 5th September. </div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">The FairPrice hub is already in operation with a food court, a Warehouse Club, some small shops and food outlets, so I feel that Joo Koon Int will still have some passenger flow during weekends, instead of being empty or even not in operation during non-peak hours (as previously suggested by some forumers). There was even a family walking to Benoi Rd to take 192 towards Boon Lay Int with shopping bags. Plus, even JIS are having a considerable amount of passengers during weekends nowadays.</div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;"><br></div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">On the other hand, here are my speculations about JIS affected by Joo Koon Int:</div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">255 will be split into 255 and 256, one looping at Gul Circle and the other looping at Benoi Cres.</div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">254 will be split into 253 and 254, one looping at Tuas West and the other from Boon Lay to Joo Koon plying current 254 route (as there are quite a lot of unique sectors).</div>
              <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.701961); font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal;  text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">As for 257, one of the routes will be from Joo Koon to Pioneer Sector 2; whether the sector from Boon Lay to Joo Koon will remain depends. It can be a new service from Boon Lay to Joo Koon, but I hope that's not the case; alternatively, 99 can be made to ply Jln Ahmad Ibrahim (where current 257 plies) and a new feeder can be introduced in Boon Lay plying 257's route, eliminating the need of current 257's Boon Lay - Benoi Rd sector. Then the last JIS can be a new service from Joo Koon to Tuas South (where 182 doesn't ply - I feel this is the only place that needs a new JIS).</div>

              <p><span>Went to Joo Koon Int today... Unfortunately all
              the gates are closed so I cannot enter the int and see the routes
              of 99, 253, 256, 258 etc. (I wonder how someone here managed to
              enter the Interchange previously)</span></p>
              <div>Anyway, there are 2 entrances: one along Joo Koon
              Circle (only for direction towards the west) and one along Benoi Rd
              (only for direction towards the north, after 192's stop). The only
              exit is along Joo Koon Circle, but a unidirectional slip road
              across Joo Koon Circle (near MRT) is being built so that buses can
              turn to the right. </div>
              <div>From what I see when peeping through the entrance at
              Benoi Rd, the layout of Joo Koon Int is quite similar to Eunos Int,
              except entrances and berths. There are 2 alighting berths and
              likely 3 boarding berths. Although most of the signboards in the
              int are completed, berth allocation is not done yet and I didn't
              find service numbers on any of the signboards. But overall it seems
              that the interchange is ready to open on 5th
              September. </div>
              <div>The FairPrice hub is already in operation with a food
              court, a Warehouse Club, some small shops and food outlets, so I
              feel that Joo Koon Int will still have some passenger flow during
              weekends, instead of being empty or even not in operation during
              non-peak hours (as previously suggested by some forumers). There
              was even a family walking to Benoi Rd to take 192 towards Boon Lay
              Int with shopping bags. Plus, even JIS are having a considerable
              amount of passengers during weekends nowadays.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>On the other hand, here are my speculations about JIS
              affected by Joo Koon Int:</div>
              <div>255 will be split into 255 and 256, one looping at
              Gul Circle and the other looping at Benoi Cres.</div>
              <div>254 will be split into 253 and 254, one looping at
              Tuas West and the other from Boon Lay to Joo Koon plying current
              254 route (as there are quite a lot of unique sectors).</div>
              <div>As for 257, one of the routes will be from Joo Koon
              to Pioneer Sector 2; whether the sector from Boon Lay to Joo Koon
              will remain depends. It can be a new service from Boon Lay to Joo
              Koon, but I hope that's not the case; alternatively, 99 can be made
              to ply Jln Ahmad Ibrahim (where current 257 plies) and a new feeder
              can be introduced in Boon Lay plying 257's route, eliminating the
              need of current 257's Boon Lay - Benoi Rd sector. Then the last JIS
              can be a new service from Joo Koon to Tuas South (where 182 doesn't
              ply - I feel this is the only place that needs a new JIS).</div>
              </div>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
                                  <p>I feel that we should close this thread.</p>
                                  <p>We have already discussed every part of Joo Koon Bus Interchange that can be discussed before there is press release about it.</p>
                                  <p>I have no idea when they would finally open Joo Koon Bus Interchange. In year 2013, they say March 2015. Early this year, they say Q3 of 2015. Now, apparently, the opening has been postponed again. </p>
                                  <p>If we continue to write random replies, just to keep this thread alive, I feel that we are only wasting time, effort and the battery of our handphone/tablet (or laptop/computer).</p>
                                 <p>The discussion that we are having now is going nowhere. We are only bringing up past topics, that has already been discussed thoroughly.</p>
                           <p>Let us stop here.</p><p>Let us close this thread.</p>
                                  <p>If a Moderator is reading this, I hope he/she can lock this thread.</p>
                                  <p>Thank you for taking time to read this reply.</p>
