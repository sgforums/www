              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>it really depends on the frequency of the bus services. there
              are eighteen parking lots. three sawtooth boarding berths. if the
              frequency is high throughout - feeder frequency - maybe between six
              to nine. if the frequency is low throughout - say around 15 mins -
              maybe nine to twelve, or twelve to eighteen.</p>
              <p>Boon Lay Bus Interchange has thirty eight bus parking lots (30
              standard, 8 elongated) in the sawtooth section. In the sawtooth
              section, there are twenty one bus services. On average, it's 1.8
              bus parking lots per bus service. On the assumption that Joo Koon
              is also 1.8 parking lots per service, actually, Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange can have ten bus services.</p>
              <p>185 &amp; 502 together I think only need three. The other
              fifteen can be for around five to seven services with feeder
              frequency. Really depends on how many parking lots per feeder-like
              services. Currently, the 25X services use two parking lots at Boon
              Lay Bus Interchange, right? So, quite likely there is space for up
              to seven 25X services.</p>
              <p>7 or 9 or 10. 10 less likely. On the other hand, it also depends
              on how many 25X services. 10 may be likely. Greater than 10 is also
              likely. </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, for the new Tuas Bus Terminal, I guess the number of
              parking lots is either greater or equal than the number in the
              existing Tuas Bus Terminal: 12 / 13.</p>
              <p>Joo Koon and Tuas combine is around 30 bus parking lots. Boon
              Lay has around 60 bus parking lots. Actually, if want, we can
              remove around half of the load off Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>in fact, we can even create another new bus interchange/terminal
              somewhere else in Jurong, with around 30 bus parking lots, to
              replace Boon Lay Bus Interchange completely. nah. Boon Lay has the
              five feeder services. nonetheless, the new bus interchange/terminal
              can take over some load from Jurong East Bus Interchange, since
              Jurong East Bus Interchange also operating near/at its peak
              already.</p>

              <p>The de facto of Joo Koon is to relieve Boon Lay bursting bus svc..Most probably 4 svc will be diverted to Joo Koon and probably only 1-2 new bus svc will be introduce</p>

              <p>Agreed, I don't think Joo Koon will run out of space, the industrial estates around Pioneer, Benoi, Gul are mostly mature and won't need new bus svcs in future.

              <p>Will be interesting to see the bus svc amendments when Joo Koon Int opens... 182, 254, 255, 257 should be shortened there, 246, 249, 252 likely unchanged, not so sure abt the rest, but should have some other new/amended bus svcs to cover the lost links of the shortened svcs, and maybe to improve the bus connections to the upcoming MRT stns at Tuas West.</p>

              <p>For the current density of bus svcs in the area (1-2 bus svcs for most main roads and some smaller roads), I think the capacity is enough. Of course there are many roads that aren't directly served by bus svcs, but I think it's still ok since many ppl working in Tuas actually have private transport by their company. More impt would be to improve bus coverage to the MRT stns along the Tuas West extension, especially along Pioneer Rd.</p>

              <p>The new Tuas Bus Terminal very likely is one-for-one replacement for the existing Tuas Bus Terminal, except the new one may not have facilities for boarding and alighting. Same number of parking lots. Probably only for the existing Tuas Bus Terminal to make way for future developments. Either the High Speed Rail or AYE realignment, or something else.</p>

              <p>I do think it would be logical to have 193 start from Joo Koon, given 192 will still cover ave 4 to Boon Lay and keep that link. </p>
              <p>As you rightly said 246, 249. 251, 252 will not change since all go to industrial areas closer to Boon Lay / Pioneer than Joo Koon... </p>
              <p>I do expect 255 and 257 to originate from Joo Koon... + there should be 2 new services that will cover industrial areas not covered by service today</p>
              <p>182 / 254 might still originate from Boon Lay. </p>
              <p>One new feeder service 244 can be launched in Boon Lay that will cover lost sector of 257 + cover untapped sector of JW St 93, looping around st 91. </p>
              <p>So in total:</p>
              <p>Joo Koon: 193, 255, 257, <strong>258, 259 (new services)</strong></p>
              <p>Boon Lay: 192, 246, 249, 251, 252, 254,<strong> 244</strong> (new feeder to cover st 61 and extend to st 93) </p>

              <p>5 September is likely. Serangoon Bus Interchange also opened on first day of  September school holidays.</p>
              <p>The route changes should be about the same as Serangoon BI route changes. Some 25X routes are obviously re-routing (shortening) to Joo Koon because currently there is duplication of resources. New routes are likely only covering deleted sectors, with only one or two serving new sectors.</p>
              <p>I do not think Tuas is under Joo Koon Bus Interchange. The bus network at Tuas quite likely is under Tuas Bus Terminal. I expect changes in Tuas bus networks only when Tuas MRT stations open. Hence, 192 &amp; 193 not likely affected by Joo Koon BI. 182 &amp; 254 may shorten to Joo Koon BI and 192 may split at Joo Koon BI when it opens. Next year, there may be major route changes to the bus routes in Tuas.</p>
              <p>Serangoon Bus Interchange press releases published on 25 August, opened on 3 September.</p>
              <p>If the notice period remains the same, if Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens on 5 September, press release is expected on 27 August.</p>

              <p>Hi. I notice at the bus bay of Boon Lay Bus Interchange sawtooth boarding berths section, there are sets of two bus parking lots with bus route numbers painted beside them.

It seems that the bus parking lots at Boon Lay Bus Interchange will change to two parking lots per bus route arrangement when some bus routes are re-routed away to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>
                      
                      <p>Boon Lay Bus Interchange has sixty bus parking lots; 38 Sawtooth 22 End-on. If every bus route allocate two parking lots, Boon Lay Bus Interchange still can have thirty bus routes.</p>
                  
                  <p>Currently, Boon Lay Bus Interchange has thirty three bus routes. Hopefully, after Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, the number is less than thirty, so can have new bus routes at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>Currently, Boon Lay Bus Interchange has thirty three bus routes.
              Hopefully, after Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, the number is less
              than thirty, so can have new bus routes at Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange.</p>

              <p>My hope is 182, 193, 254, 255, 257 will originate from Joo Koon while other JIS services 192, 246, 249, 251, 252 will continue to operate from Boon Lay. This way 5 services will go to Joo Koon + Joo Koon should introduce 2 or 3 new JIS services. So totally 8 services at Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>With 5 services going, there is opportunity to introduce at least 3 new services at Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>1 service has to be feeder to cover missing link of 257. This is the service I propose should do st 93 as well. 255 duplicates 179/241 route, so no need for replacement here. </p>
              <p>1 service can be Jurong Lake District service. I hope 178 can be reduced to Jurong East while have new service mimmicking 178 route to Jurong East with better frequency. </p>
              <p>In addition, there can be 1 JIS service originating from Boon Lay that covers the industrial areas close to Boon Lay / Pioneer that do not have direct service today.</p>
              <p>These are 3 services I can think right now that will be useful.</p>
