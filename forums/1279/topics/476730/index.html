              <p>In terms of<strong> length</strong>, it would be good if the route is the shortest, so that it is easier to manage and there would not be much implication to the existing route when it gets extended to Joo Koon. Currently, there are 4 SMRT bus services originating from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, of which route 172 is 14.3km, route 178 is 29.6km, route 180 is 20.6km (with Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange, it is around 10.1km) and route 187 is 24.4km.Therefore, since it is the shortest, route 180 should be the SMRT bus route extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>In terms of <strong>advantages to the Jurong West Extension area</strong>, it would be ideal if the extension of route can have benefits to the people staying in Jurong West Extension area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If 180 is extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, the possible extended route may be, from Boon Lay Way:</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Boon Lay Way</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Upper Jurong Road</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Benoi Road (Joo Koon Bus Interchange)</span></li>
              </ol> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The possible extended route is around 3.9km (4km), while the possible skipped section is around 0.7km. Hence, the route would be 3.3km longer.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>If route 180 is extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, people staying along <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Boon Lay Way</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upper Jurong Road</span> will have a direct bus link to the Lakeside, Chinese Garden, Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang areas, besides Boon Lay MRT station.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If route 172 is extended, it may be extended from Jalan Bahar and go to Joo Koon Bus Interchange in this sequence:  </span></li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Jalan Bahar </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Jurong West Avenue 4 </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Jurong West Street 61 (unless there are bus lanes, or less bus routes, there should not be anymore new bus route introduced to Pioneer Road North, as the road experiences traffic jams during morning peak hours.) </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Boon Lay Way </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Upper Jurong Road  </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Benoi Road (Joo Koon Bus Interchange) </span></li>
              </ol>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This is perhaps the shortest possible extended route for 172, if it is extended to Joo Koon from Jalan Bahar. The possible new section is around 4.9km(5km), while the possible skipped section is around 2.2km; the route would be 2.8km longer. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The extension of route 172 would benefit Jurong West Extension residents, in particular those staying along <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong West Avenue 4</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong West Street 61</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upper Jurong Road</span>. Therefore, as the extended route covers more areas of the Jurong West Extension residential areas, route 172 should be the SMRT bus route extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In terms of <strong>possible implications</strong>, it would be good if the implications are minimal and it is easy to compensate the loss. If route 180 is extended, LTA would have to create a bus stop at the bridge near Boon Lay MRT station and next to the Jurong Central Park, for affected commuters to board 180 from Boon Lay MRT station/bus interchange or transfer to there. If route 172 is extended, affected commuters (mostly people in the Military) from Boon Lay Bus Interchange going to Jalan Bahar and Old Choa Chu Kang Road would have to "re-locate" to Chua Chu Kang Bus Interchange and take 172 from there. Those staying in Jurong West Extension can easily board the bus from the possible extended section (at Jurong West Avenue 4, Street 61 and Upper Jurong Road). However, those staying nearer to Boon Lay MRT Station will nolonger have a direct bus link to the cemetery area, Old Choa Chu Kang Road and the CCK town(although it may be faster to get to the town via MRT), unless service 405 becomes a regular service. Therefore, route 180 should be the SMRT bus route extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, as the implications are minimal and it is easier to compensate the loss of bus link resulted due to it being extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> In terms of <strong>length</strong> and <strong>possible implications</strong>, route 180 should be extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange as it is currently the shortest route and if it is extended, there would be minimal implications and it is easy to compensate the possible loss of bus link resulted if it is re-routed. In terms of<strong> advantages to the Jurong West Extension area</strong>, route 172 should be extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange as the possible extended route of 172 would cover more residential areas of Jurong West Extension than the possible extended route of 180. Therefore, if a SMRT route is to be extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, route 180 is the SMRT bus route that should be extended.</span></p>

              </ul>
              <p>I went to Joo Koon just now and managed to randomly ask 2 workers about the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange. </p>
              <p>Both told me that <strong>the interchange will be completed by the end of the year</strong> (there was a orange LTA signboard which mentioned some road works completing on 31 December 2014. not sure if it is related to Joo Koon Bus Interchange or the MRT construction nearby). </p>
              <p>1 worker told me that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will only open next year, which I believe it is early next year. Previously, when I asked LTA, LTA told me that the bus interchange would open in March 2015. Maybe it is indeed true that <strong>Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open in March 2015</strong>.</p>
              <p>Somehow, the worker I (casually) spoke to revealed that <span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>SBS Transit</strong> would operate the new bus interchange, and</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> there would be <strong>3 to 6 bus services</strong> (<em><span style="color: #999999;">not sure if he lied to me, because I previously predict 8 bus services, or maybe this is because the bus network at the surrounding areas would be re-designed.</span></em>) using the new bus interchange.</span></p>
              <p>When I asked him if the entrance/exit of Joo Koon Bus Interchange is at Benoi Road (opposite Hitachi building), he said yes. <span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>But</strong> when I took bus 182 (to go home) after that, I looked at the area from the upper deck and realised that it does not seem right to have a traffic light junction there (because otherwise... well, it just doesn't seem to fit), and the "service road"does not seem wide enough to accomodate 2 buses. </span></p>
              <p>I guess the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange (and the pair of bus stop next to Joo Koon MRT station) would be similar to Clementi Bus Interchange (and that pair of bus stop next to Clementi MRT station). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is more likely that the entrance/exit for the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange is along Joo Koon Circle</span>, </p>
              <ul>
              <li>I have a feeling that the "<a title="void space" href="https://maps.google.com.sg/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=1.327655,103.677761&amp;spn=0.002234,0.00327&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=1.327656,103.677668&amp;panoid=nie7UUvzt1qaM11UzqtCxA&amp;cbp=12,27.55,,0,3.84">void space</a>"(directly in front of bus stop 23491) underneath Joo Koon MRT station will be expanded (in width)(there are white structures in the way but I think that can be easily removed and shifted outwards) and a traffic light junction will be created there, for bus to enter/exit from/to the other side of Joo Koon Circle. Since the height is similar to the overhead bridge nearby, it can definitely accomodate Double Decker bus. </li>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The bus interchange will be at NTUC Fairprice's new distribution centre as part of an integrated development. From the render above, there is an entrance along Benoi Road, but it should be for cars and trucks instead of public buses.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I agree that the entrance for public buses is likely to be along Joo Koon Circle, with the so-called "void space" used as an access road for buses to turn towards the other side of Joo Koon Circle. It will be a bit of a squeeze, but I don't think the "white structures" can be removed if you're referring to the white pillars supporting the station structure.</p>

              <p>Hoe Pei Shan. (2014, February 27). Joo Koon integrated transport hub to be ready by the end of this year. <em>The Straits Times</em>. Retrieved from <a title="http://www.straitstimes.com/" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/joo-koon-integrated-transport-hub-be-ready-the-end-year-20140227">http://www.straitstimes.com/</a> .</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Works on the Joo Koon integrated transport hub featuring a new <strong>bus interchange located next to the existing MRT station</strong> will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
              <p><strong>The bus interchange will be on the first floor of a brand new 16-storey FairPrice Hub</strong>, a $350 million facility scheduled to be launched by December, NTUC FairPrice Chairman Ng Ser Miang announced on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The building will house a new distribution centre, which will be able to process goods faster than FairPrice's existing centres.</p>
              <p>FairPrice and FairPrice Foundation also announced $4.3 million donation to NTUC for initiatives to benefit low-income working families.</p>

              <p>from the picture, it seems that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will be under the "grass roof".</p>
              <p>currently, at Joo Koon MRT station, there is another bridge, located next to the paid-area. I guess there will be faregates there and MRT commuters would be directly connected to the bus interchange through that bridge.</p>

              if you look closer at the other end of the MRT Station, you can see a service road behind the distribution centre. 
              
              near to the service road, there is something that looks like a roundabout, underneath the MRT Station. I guess it is a 2-lane road, with 1 lane for each direction, for buses to enter/exit from/to the other side of Joo Koon Circle.

              <p>Straits Times's page B2 say the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open at the end of the year, at the same time as the NTUC development. </p>
              <p>I really doubt that Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open at the end of this year.</p>
              <p>Reference: Boon Lay Bus Interchange opened only one year after Jurong Point Extension (JP2) opened. Bedok Mall opened last year and until now Bedok Bus Interchange still not open. </p>
              <p>so I guess Joo Koon Bus Interchange will only open a few months after the NTUC development is completed. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">as mentioned, LTA say it will open in March 2015. so I think Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open in March 2015. Unless, the NTUC development is actually in use already but NTUC just want to open both together at the end of the year.</span></p>

              <p>I rather 182 to be shortened to Joo Koon while 193 to ply the current 182 route to SAFTI instead.

Another possibility is to amend 254 to start at Tuas Terminal while passingby or looping at Joo Koon Interchange but the chances are quite low.<br><br>By the way when Tuas MRT extension opens those services which plys Tuas South/extension might get shortened to Tuas Terminal as there will be a MRT station nearby.</p>

              <p><br>There are so many sectors/avenues within Tuas that are not covered by bus service today. I expect the below 3 services to be introduced:</p>
              <p>256 - Joo Koon Interchange &lt;--&gt; Gul Crescent (loop)</p>
              <p>258 - Joo Koon Interchange &lt;--&gt; Pioneer Sector 2</p>
              <p>259 - Joo Koon Interchange &lt;--&gt; Tuas South Extension</p>
              <p>I think these will be introduced under BSEP as LTA anyway has to do its quota of 40 new services and has done only 21 until now.</p>
              <p>There has to be some modification to existing Tuas services originating in Boon Lay to create space in Boon Lay. Now it needs to be seen which services are shortened out of 182, 192, 193, 252, 254, 255, 257. There would still be a need to have 3 or 4 of these services to start at Boon Lay.</p>
