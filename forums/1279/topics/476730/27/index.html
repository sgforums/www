              <p>Okay guys. This is it. Today is the last day Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange has the most number of bus services (33 + 1 added last
              week) in Singapore.</p>
              <p>After today, it will have two less bus services, effectively
              making it have the same number of bus services as Bedok Bus
              Interchange (32).</p>
              <p>Two weeks later, there will be another two less bus services at
              Boon Lay, effectively making it have the same number of bus
              services as Woodlands Bus Interhange (30).</p>
              <p>but it will still be quite a large bus interchange in Singapore
              though. :|</p>

                                  <p>Hi everyone. Please be reminded that this thread is about Joo
                  Koon Bus Interchange. It is not only about one or two bus
                  services.<br>
                  <br>
                  If there is nothing to discuss at the moment, I think it is better
                  to not write anything here. I do not think it is wise to dilute the
                  content by going off-topic and write extensively on bus service
                  258.<br>
                  <br>
                  Five years ago when we were discussing about the opening of the new
                  Boon Lay Air-Conditioned Bus Interchange, we severely diluted the
                  last thread with personal attacks. Although that thread had eight
                  hundred over postings, only some are really about the bus
                  interchange.<br>
                  <br>
                  Let us not make the same mistake here.<br>
                  <br>
                  I rather we have the quality, rather than the quantity.<br>
                  <br>
                  The second phase of the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange is this
                  Saturday, 28 November 2015.<br>
                  <br>
                  Existing bus services 182, 182M, 192, 193 and 257 will have their
                  routes amended, while new bus service 256 will be introduced.<br>
                  <br>
                  Let us discuss about it, shall we?<br></p>

                                                  <p>There is so much inconvenience caused as a result of bus services amended or shortened to Joo Koon Bus Interchange!</p>
                                                  <p>Firstly, Jurong West residents last time only need to take feeder to Boon Lay and take the bus to their work place. Now, they have to take 258 (which is not frequent) or 99, to Joo Koon and take bus from Joo Koon to their workplace. It's worse if they stay elsewhere in Jurong West (ie. Boon Lay and Wenya). The travel time is actually longer.</p>
                                                  <p>Secondly, the direct bus connection between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and the Singapore Discovery Centre is gone. :(</p>
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p>Actually, I feel that they could have done something else, instead of creating this Joo Koon Bus Interchange. </p>
                                                  <p>They could have retained the temporary facility of Boon Lay Bus Interchange and used it for the industrial bus services. That is, if the objective is to reduce the number of bus services and improve traffic flow at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p> <p>There is another objective which would also be met, but due to the sensitive nature of it (about foreign talent), I shall not write about it.</p>
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p>Anyway, what has been done is permanent. We can only accept it, and deal with it.</p>
                                                  <p>Suggestions:</p>
                                                  <p>- Improve the frequency of bus service 258, to match the frequency of other Jurong-Industrial bus services.</p>
                                                  <p>- Re-route 192 to ply the entire stretch of Upper Jurong Road, and use the Pan-Island Expressway to connect to Tuas Road, and continue as per current routing. Anyway, there is 193 at Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. This also reduces duplication.</p>

                              <p>Why not let the route of bus service 172 take the shorter path, by plying Upper Jurong Road straightaway. It could ply to the roundabout at the intersection of PIE and AYE, and return in the opposite direction.</p>
                          <p>To optimise resources, we could let only the "to Boon Lay" direction of bus service 172 ply to the PIE/AYE roundabout and return to terminate at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
                      <p>To minimise inconvenience caused, we could let the bus call at Boon Lay Bus Interchange first, before making the extended trip to the PIE/AYE roundabout and return back to terminate. A separate boarding queue (ie. 172 - to Singapore Discovery Centre) can be created at Boon Lay Bus Interchange for this purpose.</p>
                          <p>The other direction ("to Choa Chu Kang") can continue as per current routing.</p>
                  <p>Alternatively, we could create a new bus service for this, or simply amend the route of bus service 192 to provide this - or even revert the original route of bus service 182.</p>

                  <p>Even if we amend the routes of bus services 192 and 193, they should still call at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, or at least at Joo Koon Bus Interchange.

              <p>You do have a point on 182 being less convenient to transfer to - but at the same time, some Jurong West services have been introduced / modified precisely to allow a direct bus to Joo Koon Int / Benoi Rd, namely 99, 192, 193, 256 and 258, for such a transfer to be less of a hassle. Currently the problem is that their frequency is not as good as the Boon Lay feeders. You have also mentioned this <a title="jurongresident's earlier rant on Joo Koon" href="/forums/1279/topics/476730?page=27#post_11127349">in an earlier post</a>.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding that however, extending 256 to Tuas does indeed repair the link between Tuas checkpoint / Pasir Laba camp and Boon Lay. Perhaps any further route adjustments from Joo Koon to Tuas will come only after the integration of the MRT / bus terminal and enhancement to the services between Tuas Terminal and Jurong West. In time we'll see about that.</p>
              <p>Do you have any other comments with regards to my <a title="Tuas area route suggestions" href="/forums/1279/topics/489281?page=38#post_11125528">suggestion on the Tuas West route changes</a>?

              <p>I know this may offend some people... but, really,</p>
              <p>There is so much inconvenience caused as a result of bus
              services amended or shortened to Joo Koon Bus Interchange!</p>
              <p>Firstly, Jurong West residents last time only need to take
              feeder to Boon Lay and take the bus to their work place. Now, they
              have to take 258 (which is not frequent) or 99, to Joo Koon and
              take bus from Joo Koon to their workplace. It's worse if they stay
              elsewhere in Jurong West (ie. Boon Lay and Wenya). The travel time
              is actually longer.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the direct bus connection between Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange and the Singapore Discovery Centre is gone. :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, I feel that they could have done something else,
              instead of creating this Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>They could have retained the temporary facility of Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange and used it for the industrial bus services. That is,
              if the objective is to reduce the number of bus services and
              improve traffic flow at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>There is another objective which would also be met, but due to
              the sensitive nature of it (about foreign talent), I shall not
              write about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, what has been done is permanent. We can only accept it,
              and deal with it.</p>
              <p>Suggestions:</p>
              <p>- Improve the frequency of bus service 258, to match the
              frequency of other Jurong-Industrial bus services.</p>
              <p>- Re-route 192 to ply the entire stretch of Upper Jurong Road,
              and use the Pan-Island Expressway to connect to Tuas Road, and
              continue as per current routing. Anyway, there is 193 at Jalan
              Ahmad Ibrahim. This also reduces duplication.</p>

              <p>But really, since the opening of Joo Koon MRT Station on 28 February 2009 there is a need to have a bus interchange in the first place at Joo Koon, which will be considered an integrated transport hub if that's mattered, and the only way for reducing congestion at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. The MRT is there, because it is a fast, good and convenient alternative. The only target is Jurong Industrial and Tuas workers, Tuas West Road (I know Joel Chua will be moving here if he is in SP), and Jurong West residents.</p>
              <p>The integrated transport hub is called FairPrice Hub, or Joo Koon Mall.</p>
              <p>The direct connection has been encouraging commuters to take the train to Joo Koon and walk to Singapore Discovery Centre, SAFTI Military Institute and Pasir Laba Camp, all these amenities, localities or hostilities are located nearby.</p>

                                                                          <p>This is probably the last time we have a thread which discusses only one bus interchange/terminal, until next time when nobody talks about bus interchange/terminal and there is a new bus interchange/terminal to talk about.</p>
                                                                          <p>Before we close this thread, I feel that perhaps we should talk about the future.</p> <p>Since this thread is about Joo Koon Bus Interchange, it is the future of Joo Koon Bus Interchange and the bus services in the Jurong Industrial Estate that I am referring to.</p>
                                                                          <p> </p>
                                                                          <p>- Could the new Tuas Bus Terminal take away some of the bus services at Joo Koon Bus Interchange? If yes, could there be more bus services transferred from Boon Lay Bus Interchange to Joo Koon Bus Interchange?</p>
                                                                          <p>- The Jurong-Industrial bus services appears to be a loss-making business, yet it has to be provided for bus connections. Are there ways to reduce the losses?</p>
                              <p>- How do you think the bus services at Joo Koon Bus Interchange could be packaged for the Government Contracting Model (GCM)?</p>
                                                          <p>- By around year 2030, there will be a new MRT line (Cross Island Line) along the south of the Jurong Industrial Estate. By around year 2025, there will be a new MRT line (Jurong Region Line) along Jalan Boon Lay. How could the bus routes in the Jurong Industrial Estate be amended to connect to the two new MRT lines?</p>
                                              <p>- During the National Day Rally in year 2014, it was revealed that the southern section of Jurong West (Planning Area) will be re-developed for residential uses, over the next twenty to thirty years. How could this affect the bus routes in the Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong West?</p>
                          <p> </p>
                                                                          <p>Let us end this thread by discussing about the future.</p>
                                                                          <p>For a better tomorrow. :)</p>
