              <p>I would like to announce my official retirement from the transport "industry", from Tuas West Extension onwards.</p>
                  <p>I have been following the transport related developments since 2006 when they announced the Boon Lay MRT Extension project – which comprises of Pioneer and Joo Koon on the East West Line.</p>
                  <p>When Pioneer MRT station in 2009, it was a gamechanger to me, as Pioneer is nearer to my house, and I am no longer restricted to just Boon Lay MRT station.</p>
                  <p>2009 was also the year Boon Lay Bus Interchange returned to its original location within Jurong Point, after three years at the temporary location at Jurong West Street 64, as the original facility was redeveloped into an integrated development – comprising of a new shopping mall (JP2), some residential apartments (Centris condominium) and a new air-conditioned bus interchange.</p>
                  <p>Boon Lay Bus Interchange did not move back entirely in 2009. 179, 179A and 199 remained at the temporarily location until 2010. Coincidentally, I was in a secondary school along one of the bus routes, so there were occasions when I walked along the concourse of the temporary facility, and reminisced the days when all the bus services were at that location.</p>
                  <p>Then came the Youth Olympic games in 2010. 179 had a minor route amendment inside NTU campus, while 199 was temporarily diverted to Jurong West Avenue 3. It was this period when one could take a bus that goes from Jurong West Avenue 3 to Boon Lay Bus Interchange via Jalan Bahar and Jurong West Central 1. The authorities probably took this opportunity to observe the demand on this diverted route, as after all, it is obvious that this route is what a feeder to that area would take if it was ever launched – but as we all know, a change in plans for that area has made the feeder redundant, that’s why there is only 181 that goes to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, via Jurong West Street 75.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, it’s also obvious that the demand turned out to be low. That’s why until now there’s still no bus service to Jurong West Avenue 3 that is more direct than 181.</p>
                  <p>Throughout 2011, I was hoping to see the demolishment of the temporary bus interchange, but the demolishment only came in 2012. The entire facility was demolished around March that year, and grass was patched on the site. Even so, the back gate of Boon Lay Bus Interchange remained opened. I was waiting for them to close the gate, so that everything could be reinstated back to how it was like many years ago before all that relocation of bus interchange and influx of foreign talent happened. But I guess it would never happen.</p>
                  <p>In 2013, the government announced the Jurong Region Line. When I first heard about it, I was surprised, as it was announced previously that the line was shelved “indefinitely”. But when I saw that the line would go to Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East, I knew it’s going to be something else, and not the LRT line that I had thought to be.</p>
                  <p>In 2014, I joined the forums. I got the chance to interact with many transport enthusiasts, and immerse in the joyrides and bus spotting that they recommend. In the beginning, I was speaking on behalf of my fellow countrymen at Jurong West, to negotiate for better bus services at Jurong West. At the same time, I was looking forward to the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange, a new bus interchange which would relieve the loading at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. It was nice having the company of the people at the forum, to accompany me on my quest to understand more about the buses.</p>
                  <p>This went on to 2015, when SBS Transit brought in the hybrid bus from Australia, to trial on bus service 185. I had a few encounters with this bus. It was hot and stuffy, probably because the bus lacked air ventilation, or the air-con was not strong. There was once I alighted one stop after I board this bus, without tapping out, and I took the next 185 that comes, which seemed to follow that Australia bus from behind. When I board the bus, I was not able to tap my card. I tapped and tapped, but I was just not able to tap the card. The driver seemed to understand what happened. He told me that it was okay, and after much contemplating, I retreated into the bus feeling embarrassed. After all, I never tapped my card for that bus, but I guess the driver knew why, and decided to close one eye. Until now, I still feel embarrass about it.</p>
                  <p>2015 was also the year I had a six weeks’ internship with a company at Jalan Bukit Merah. I had the opportunity to experience the daily commute of those working at Jalan Bukit Merah, where we take the bus from Commonwealth MRT Station in the morning, and returned there in the evening. There was once I alighted at Red Hill and walked to Jalan Bukit Merah, but I guess it was not convenient, so I continued to take bus from Commonwealth instead.</p>
                  <p>2016 was an adventure for me. It was the year I went over to Johor Bahru several times, and visited the gym at Sengkang on many occasions. Somehow, Sengkang is like the twin of Jurong West, as both towns were created around the same time. I witnessed the daily commute on the Sengkang LRT, and saw how the Sengkang residents travel around. In fact, it was Sengkang that gave me the hope that the grass is greener elsewhere. Well, it could be that Sengkang is newer than Jurong West, that’s why I feel that it is better, or it could be that Sengkang is a place I had never been to before, that's why I like it so much. Anyway, it was a nice experience.</p>
                  <p>Right now, it is 2017. I have been following the transport developments for 11 years, and I guess it is time I go.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Tuas West Extension is opening, I am presented with the opportunity to withdraw from the forum community and pursue other interests altogether.</p>
                  <p>As we approach the next wave of changes, the time has come for me to leave, and allow for a new generation of forum participants to take over from here on. Tuas West Extension is opening, bus routes will change, and so will the forum, as we usher in a new phase of transport developments.</p>
                  <p>To be honest, I do not know how I managed to maintain my fascination about buses and trains for a very long time, and talked to people I have never met, or would never meet at all. All this is only about following the news, and writing on a website to get response; never is it about physical interaction.</p>
                  <p>Nonetheless, I agree I have learnt a lot about the wonderful public transport system that we have.</p>
                  <p>It has been my privilege to witness so many changes over the past 11 years, from the announcement of Boon Lay MRT Extension in 2006 to the opening of the Tuas West Extension in 2017. The developments have followed me through my teenage years, that as an adult fare commuter now, I truly appreciate the money I spend on public transport every day.</p>
                  <p>I am grateful to be able to live in a place with very good public transport, and I look forward to the many changes to public transport in the years to come.</p>
                  <p>Good bye, my friends.</p>
                  <p>This time, I am really leaving.</p>
                  <p>Thank you for accommodating me all these years.</p>
                  <p>All the best for your future endeavors.</p>
