              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange is a new bus interchange. This is the first time many
              of us (born after 1990 and staying in the West) will witness the
              opening of a new bus interchange, so it is something I believe many
              are excited about.</span></p>
              <p>While we await the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange, these
              were what happened when <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sembawang Bus Interchange and Punggol Bus
              Interchange - both new bus interchanges - opened on 17 November
              2005 and 30 November 2003 respectively, </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some bus routes (eg. 83, 3,
              62 and 136 at Punggol) (eg. 167, 859, 980, 981 at Sembawang) were
              extended to the new bus interchanges.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">new bus route 882 at
              Sembawang was created at the new bus interchange when it
              opened.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on these, I believe when Joo Koon Bus Interchange
              opens, </p>
              <ul>
              <li>some bus routes (mainly Tuas-dominant bus routes) (eg.
              257, 254, 182, 192 and 193) may be shortened to originate from Joo
              Koon.</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some bus routes (eg.
              251, 252 and 255) may be re-routed and extended to terminate at Joo
              Koon while continue to originate from Boon Lay.</span></li>
              <li>those bus routes (eg. 251, 252 and 255) re-routed may
              be re-routed to cover loss due to shortening of Tuas-dominant bus
              services (eg. 254, 192).</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some new bus
              route(s) may be created from Joo Koon to cover the loss, should 252
              or/and 255 be re-routed.</span></li>
              <li>I foresee a new bus route replacing 182 and 193 at
              Upper Jurong Road.</li>
              <li>In all, I believe there will be ten bus routes (eg.
              257, 254, 182, 192, 193, 251, 252, 255, new A and new B) at Joo
              Koon Bus Interchange.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>However, due to the possibility that Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange may only have three sawtooth berths and the capacity
              for only nine bus routes, I believe some Tuas-dominant bus routes
              may instead (be extended to Tuas Bus Terminal, if they are not yet
              at Tuas, and) loop elsewhere.</li>
              <li>193 and 192 may be shortened to loop around Joo Koon
              MRT and Joo Koon Bus Interchange (only driving through Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange and exit to Benoi Road)(without stopping at Joo Koon
              Bus Interchange) for a few years, then shortened again to loop at
              Tuas Flyover, when Gul Circle MRT opens.</li>
              <li>182 may be shortend to Joo Koon for a few years, then
              shortened again to Tuas Bus Terminal, when Tuas Link MRT
              opens.</li>
              <li>Eventually, when the Tuas West MRT Extension opens, I
              believe Joo Koon Bus Interchange should have around seven (eg. 257,
              254, 251, 252, 255, new A, new B) bus services, with capacity for
              two/five (if there are three sawtooth berths) to five/eight (if
              there are four sawtooth berths) new bus services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Press release wise, we may expect something like these:</p>

              <p>Was looking through <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2004feb.aspx">the archives at SBS Transit websites </a>where I found some posters that were created when Hougang South Bus Interchange closed.</p>

              <p>Hi. It is confirmed that Joo Koon Bus Interchange has only <strong>three</strong> sawtooth boarding berths and <strong>eighteen</strong> bus parking lots. The alighting berths can accommodate around <strong>three</strong> buses at the same time. Glass walls. Theme is mostly silver/grey with some orange.</p>
                  <p>With only eighteen parking lots, this means that Joo Koon Bus Interchange can only host around nine bus services. </p>
                  <p>I believe there will be new bus services at Tuas Bus Terminal when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, because nine bus services may not be enough to serve the Jurong Industrial Estate (excluding areas nearer to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) and Tuas Industrial Estate.</p>

              <strong>three</strong> sawtooth boarding berths and
              <strong>eighteen</strong> bus parking lots. The alighting berths
              can accommodate around <strong>three</strong> buses at the same
              time. Glass walls. Theme is mostly silver/grey with some
              orange.</p>
              <p>With only eighteen parking lots, this means that Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange can only host around nine bus services. </p>
              <p>I believe there will be new bus services at Tuas Bus Terminal
              when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, because nine bus services may
              not be enough to serve the Jurong Industrial Estate (excluding
              areas nearer to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) and Tuas Industrial
              Estate.</p>

              <p>If only 18 parking bays, will say LTA has planned for 6 services for Joo Koon. May add 1 service more - 7 would be the max # of services the interchange can carry.</p>
              <p>this means apart from 2 or 3 services, most will continue to operate from Boon Lay coz you need new services as well to connect areas in Tuas, Pioneer Sector not connected with bus today.</p>

              <p>boon lay will be relieved of much needed space when some services shift to joo koon but i doubt all of the JIS services will move over. as for a new interchange, don't forget tuas terminal and the new one that will be constructed with the new mrt station to replace the current one. surely more services can start from there even now as its massively underused for its size. i think tuas terminal should be used more extensively first, no need to build so many bus interchanges/terminal when current ones are underused. if they must, they could psuedo-rationalize routes like what LTA did with bukit merah's 131, 131M, 275, 123 and 123M albeit on a much larger scale in the western region of jurong.</p>

              <p>They might make alternate provisions in long term. For now, it's a good step even with Joo Koon interchange. I think with 20 parking bays, 7 services should be easily manageable, but the interchNge might start with only 5. </p>
              <p>Tuas Terminal is quite big and unused. Once Tuas MRT is built, they might make it hub for services like 182, 192, 193, 254 with more halting time at Tuas than at Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>We should know soon. Maybe Q1 next year JIS plan might already b rolled out.</p>

              <p>I was shocked to see Bedok interchange has walls and not glass panels. Seriously, haven't they learned their lesson from Boon Lay. Long queue for 225G and though it was dd, some mid-age ladies did not board even though there were just 42 pax on board and queue had some 34 pax more which bus would easily carry. Pax behind thought bus full and dd left interchange under-utilized. This never happened in open Bedok temp interchange. 225G DDs easily carry 80+ pax from interchange during PM peak.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, Joo Koon Bus Interchange may open in February/March (Lunar New Year period), because this is when ridership on the Jurong Industrial Estate services is relatively low.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Have been reading for quite some time, here are my predictions/suggestions for how bus svcs might be amended when Joo Koon Interchange opens.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff7129;" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zjdIlrdPZTg8.kpXHFMGvup7s"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">map of proposed changes</span></strong></a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zjdIlrdPZTg8.kZKXmn6YNViA"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">map of existing services, for comparison</span></strong></a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-No change to 246 and 249, since the areas they serve are quite far from Joo Koon</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-No change to 252, pax can easily access Joo Koon MRT/Int from the bus stops along Joo Koon Circle</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-182, 192, 193, 254, 255, 257 shortened to Joo Koon Int via Benoi Rd (on the map, they enter/exit Joo Koon Int via Joo Koon Circle, although they may enter/exit via Benoi Rd instead)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-251 amended to skip Benoi Rd, looping via Shipyard Rd and Pioneer Rd, replacing lost link of 254 between part of Pioneer Rd and Boon Lay</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-New svc 256 from Boon Lay looping at Lok Yang Way, via Jurong West St 62/61, Pioneer MRT, Pioneer Rd North, Jln Ahmad Ibrahim and Benoi Rd/Joo Koon MRT. Replaces lost links of 257 (Jurong West St 62/61, Jln Ahmad Ibrahim) and 192 (Pioneer Rd North, Lok Yang Way)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-New svc 253 from Boon Lay looping at Benoi Rd/Pioneer Rd/Benoi Sector, via Jurong West St 63/Pioneer MRT, Upper Jurong Rd and Benoi Rd/Joo Koon MRT. Replaces lost links of 182/193 (Upper Jurong Rd), 251 (Benoi Rd) and 255 (Jurong West St 63, Benoi Sector)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Svcs 253 and 256 may stop at bus stops along Benoi Rd, which requires pax to walk more to Joo Koon Int/MRT but is faster for the bus, or turn into Joo Koon Int from Benoi Rd, which provides a more direct connection but slows the bus down and lengthens journey time.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-New feeder 244 from Boon Lay, via St 64, Ave 4, Pioneer Rd North, St 91/92/93 and Boon Lay Way. Circular route similar to 243, operating with G/W to indicate direction of travel. Replaces lost links of 192/193 (JW Ave 4) and 254 (Boon Lay Way), and provides new links to JW St 93. Will be more frequent and easier to manage compared to existing JIS serving residential areas.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-In summary, Joo Koon Int to have 6 or 8 svcs (182, 192, 193, 254, 255, 257, <em><span style="color: #808080;">253, 256</span></em>), requiring 6 or 10 boarding berths (2 each for 253 and 256, for different directions), with 252 at bus stops along Joo Koon Circle (no change).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Boon Lay Int from 10 svcs serving Jurong Industrial area (182, 192, 193, 246, 249, 251, 252, 254, 255, 257) to 6 svcs serving Jurong Industrial area (246, 249, 251, 252, 253, 256) and 1 new feeder svc (244).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Bus svcs may be amended again in future when Tuas MRT extension and new Tuas bus terminal open in 2016. 182 may be shortened to Tuas Terminal via the new MRT station(s) and new svcs may be needed to cover more of Tuas South.</p>
