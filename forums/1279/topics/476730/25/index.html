              <p>A lot of people take 258 thinking that it is 243G, because all these while only have 243G. Many of them were surprised when the bus was at Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
                          <p>Meanwhile, on 99, a lot of people willingly take it to Joo Koon. It's like almost the entire double decker size of loading on 99 towards Joo Koon.</p>
                          <p>If 99 can like that, 258 can also be like that. It's going to take some time before people get used to having 258 in their neighbourhood.</p>

              <p>Some observations...</p>
              <p>Now onboard 3487K on 258... not bad. Only 3 ppl take from joo koon.</p>
              <p>Abt 2-3 ppl take from pioneer mrt bus stop</p>
              <p>And majority of loading from blk 844A CP bus stop onwards(like obviously)</p>
              <p>Then nxt 2 bus stop(one bus stop b4 gek poh) some ppl including 2 NSFs still waiting for 243W though, didnt knw 258 can go boon lay haha. In the end, they take SD bus of 243W</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for 99, abt 4-5 pax board at joo koon. I think it will take time for ppl to get use to it</p>

              <p>BTW if you have noticed the route map at Joo Koon Int, 258 s
                  considered s a trunk service instead of industrial service which is
                  quite logical as it mainly serves Jurong West new town.</p>

                                                                                  <p>Bus Service 258 is new. Many people still do not know that there is this bus service. Give it a few weeks, months or years (up to three years). As more people know about this bus service and the new bus connections that it provides, the loading will increase.</p>
                                                                                  <p>This reminds me of bus service 185 (Soon Lee - Buona Vista). When bus service 185 was launched in (late-) December 2006, only a few people knew about it. Although bus service 185 complements bus service 99 and connects to Westwood, many people at that time continued to take bus service 99, or make transfers at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. It is only after a while when more people became aware of bus service 185 and began taking bus service 185, that bus service 185 became a heavily-utilised bus service it is now.</p>
                                                                                  <p>I am sure the new bus service 258 will be well-received and well-utilised. It is only because not many people know about it yet, that is why the loading on new bus service 258 is still so low.</p>
                                  <p>When bus services 182 and 182M are amended to terminate at Joo Koon Bus Interchange, the people at the affected sector of Upper Jurong Road will have to use bus service 258 for bus connection to the MRT (at Pioneer Station) or Boon Lay Bus Interchange. This is partly why there is bus service 258.</p>
                          <p>The other purpose of bus service 258 is to relieve the extremely high loading on bus services 243G and 243W during peak hours. These bus services had been enhanced regularly since around year 2010 when bus services were reviewed quarterly. Hopefully, with the introduction of bus service 258, there is no longer the need to enhance bus services 243G and 243W again.</p>
                          <p>The bus connection between Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong West Street 81 is only one of the reasons why bus service 258 was created.</p>

              <p>Well, I feel that bus services 192 and 258 will replace bus service 182 and 182M, while bus service 99 will replace 193.</p>
                                      <p>Before 21 November 2015, there were three bus services at Upper Jurong Road, namely 182, 182M, 193. Apparently, bus services 182 and 182M are regarded as two seperate bus services.</p>
                                      <p>After 12 December 2015, there will be three (different) bus services at Upper Jurong Road, namely 99, 192 and 258.</p>
                      <p>I feeI that this is a one-for-one replacement.</p>
                                      <p>However, the part of Upper Jurong Road between Benoi Road and the AYE will have one less bus service. I guess when the MRT Tuas West Extension opens next year, bus service 192 will be amended to ply this part of Upper Jurong Road and the AYE, before continuing on its original route at Tuas.</p>

              <p>Anyway, got people actually take long bus route just to study on

              OOTD, was one one of the long bus routes. On that bus, got one
              couple sitting at one corner, like reading some books and studying.
              That's how I know got people take bus just to study.</p>
              <p>Imagine taking bus 99 at Clementi Bus Interchange and study all
              the way to Jurong West. Actually, on the bus can really study

              <p>Drop by JooKoon ITH this afternoon via 258 (SBS3491Y). When boarded near Jurong West Sec School, bus lower deck was fully seated and upper deck at least have 5 pax...70% of the pax alighted at pioneer and 1 got off the bus stop after pioneer... so at least 10 pax took to JooKoon.</p>
              <p>Was quite quiet but i see students there. Didnt really go around the ITH and decided to wait for 99. Boarded SBS6022Z. At least 10 pax boarded and 2 alighted 2-3 stops after...</p>
              <p>As of today, 3481, 3483, 3485, 6597-6599 still parked with do not deploy notice at windscreen...for 253/256?? not parked at SL?</p>
              <p><strong>Interesting to note: </strong></p>
              <p>1) One pax took the wrong bus..wanted to take 243G but took 258 instead... so BC advise him to take 99 opposite and change to 198 as he want to go Buona Vista area.</p>
              <p>2) A family of 4 took wrong direction of 99 at Jurong West St 91..ended up at Upper Jurong Road and have to cross the road and take opposite bus..</p>
              <p>3) Many pax keep asking the direction of 99 when on St 91...</p>

              <p>Took svc 258 on 3491 earlier. The bus smells new, the wheel rims are shiny, and the stairs are slightly different... So exciting.</p>
              <p>In Boon Lay, it was amusing to see most people in the long queue for 243G staying in the queue when 258 arrived. I guess it takes time for people to get used to 258.</p>
              <p>Btw I have found a good place to study for my exams - Joo Koon KFC or McD.</p>
