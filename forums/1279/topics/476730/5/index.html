              <p>Dear friends, I am sorry to confess that the things I wrote on
              13 August 2014 was only partial correct. While it is correct that
              the buses will enter from Benoi Road and exit at Joo Koon Circle,
              it is not correct to say that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange has only
              end-on berths.</p>
              <p>In fact, Joo Koon Bus Interchange does not have any end-on
              berth. From my observation (where I can go in a little to see
              what's inside, since some metal barriers have been removed) today,
               it seems that Joo Koon Bus Interchange is somewhat similar to
              Eunos Bus Interchange and Clementi Bus Interchange, where there is
              <strong>one bus bay</strong> (with several parking lots),
              <strong>one <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alighting
              bay</span></strong> (kinda similar to the one at Eunos Bus
              Interchange) and <strong>a few <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sawtooth berths</span></strong>.</p>

                                  occupancy already. I am currently applying for a part time job at
                                  one of the stores there. They say the store will open at around
                                  end-October/early-November.</p>
                  <p>From the looks of it, the Joo Koon Bus Interchange may open at
                                  around December this year.</p>
                  <p>(I know I have made a promise earlier that I will stop using
                                  this account to make postings, but instead I will use the new one.
                                  However, please let me make this one-off posting using this

                  <p>I am sorry, but I wish to further clarify that the part where I say the buses enter from Benoi Road and exit at Joo Koon Circle may actually also be wrong.</p>
                  <p>To think about it, since the alighting bay and the sawtooth berths are at 'this side', how can the buses come in from Benoi Road where the doors would not be facing the alighting bays and sawtooth berths?</p>
                  <p>I think more likely is that the buses enter from Joo Koon Circle and exit at Benoi Road.</p>
                  <p>For all I know, I may have also mistaken the alighting berth wrongly, where actually it is at the other end nearer to Joo Koon Circle.</p>
                  <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Somehow, as I think and think, I think the Joo Koon Bus Interchange is quite similar to the temporary Boon Lay Bus Interchange, like a smaller (and air-conditioned) version of it - where in the beginning (the part nearer to Joo Koon Circle) is for alighting, then subsequently (towards Benoi Road) it's the sawtooth berths.</span></p>

              <p>There are plans for a Tuas South MRT Extension which is a branch line from Gul Circle MRT Station, but only 2 stations. So it is true that Tuas South still needs to rely on buses in the near future.</p>

              <p>I think he is just predicting. Also among all other JIS services starting at Boon Lay, makes the most sense to cut short 193 to start at Joo Koon as all others have unique routes even within Jurong West while heading out to JIS. 192 and 193 have parallel routes until Pioneer, which can help 193 to be cut short to Joo Koon, creating space for 1 new service at Boon Lay.</p>

              <p><br> Another clarification (well, I think this will be the last):</p>
              <p>It seems that the two access points - at Joo Koon Circle and at Benoi Road - allows buses to enter <strong>and </strong>exit, instead of just enter or exit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Buses can enter from Joo Koon Circle and exit at Benoi Road</li>
              <li>Buses can enter from Benoi Road and exit at Joo Koon Circle</li>
              <li>Buses can enter from Benoi Road and exit at Benoi Road</li>
              <li>Buses can enter from Joo Koon Circle and exit at Joo Koon Circle</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is what I deduce when I saw the access point at Joo Koon Circle.</p>
              <p><img src="https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10408861_1465823220362687_3746433108132124636_n.jpg?oh=72b0d3b5cb95ff5865b6a75dbfcbb521&amp;oe=549E0BDA" alt="" width="960" height="540"></p>
              <p>Notice the road divider feature in the middle of the access road.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This implies that vehicles can drive in and drive out at the same time.</span></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, this is the access point at Benoi Road, as at 4 September 2014 (yesterday):</p>
              <p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10629586_1465824930362516_6738448938510963526_n.jpg?oh=94820f56c960df3eaa715b15f98ba288&amp;oe=54A76DEB&amp;__gda__=1415753056_caf68faf454e573c2d412d8c20bff66b" alt="" width="960" height="540"></p>
              <p>Although the road divider feature is not yet installed there, I think it will soon be installed there because the access road seems wide enough for vehicles to drive in and drive out at the same time.</p>
              <p>On a side note, notice (on the left hand corner of the picture at Benoi Road and on the background of the picture at Joo Koon Circle) there's the fence (standard one found in other bus interchanges) being installed.</p>
              <p>While visiting Joo Koon Bus Interchange yesterday, I took some pictures of the development:</p>

              <p>^notice the escalator inside the building. I suppose commuters from the MRT will enter the building via the bridge and ride the escalator down to the bus interchange.</p>

              <p>If it is indeed true that Joo Koon Int will have three sawtooth berths, it will make it similar to Serangoon Int (which also has three sawtooth berths), that means Joo Koon Int will have two alighting berths (since Serangoon Int has two alighting berths). </p>
              <p>I think <span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>Serangoon Bus Interchange</strong> offers the best preview of </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Joo Koon Int - except Serangoon has 8 services whereas Joo Koon might have only 5 - since both have same no. of berths (and possibly also same no. of parking lots) and are air-conditioned.</span></p>
              <p>Location wise, being close to Ayer Rajah Expressway and Pan Island Expressway (via Upper Jurong Road), I think we can expect routes similar to those at <strong>Toa Payoh Bus Interchange</strong> (close to Pan Island Expressway).</p>

                  <p>4 services is too little. At least they should have left scope
                  for expansion. I think their thought process is to make it hub only
                  for JIS as off-peak very low passengers. Also no residential
                  complex (except dorm that LTA doesnt care about) - so weekend
                  interchange as good as closed. </p>

                  <p><br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Actually, if want to have feeder services at Joo Koon Bus Interchange, still can have.</span></p>
                  <p></p><ol>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. Create a route from Joo Koon Bus Interchange to Jurong West HDB.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2. Make it terminate at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">3. Make sure the length from Joo Koon Bus Interchange to Boon Lay Bus Interchange is within 5km.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">4. Have two feeder services ply that route, one in one direction and another in the other direction.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">5. As a result, you get one new feeder bus service at Joo Koon Bus Interchange and one new feeder bus service at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</span></li>

              <p>Well, I am expecting to see quite a handful of new numbers at Boon Lay Bus Interchange when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens.</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When some bus routes are being split to have services to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">he other half of the bus routes will definitely have to be reformed somehow into new routes and have new services operating on them, right?</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Even if remain intact - and also terminate at Joo Koon Bus Interchange - there has to be another bus service to ply that route, right?</span></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>So, yeah, maybe this is how the new bus services may come about.</p>
                          <p>While some are really new ones as a result of routes being merged and re-configured to enhance connections, some would simply be another number to ply the Boon Lay-Joo Koon section of routes that have been split at Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>
                          <p>So, yeah, I think there will be two kinds of new services:</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. really new.</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2. just re-numbering.</span></li>

              <p><br> Hi Mr dupdup77, I am sorry. I do not know when the Joo Koon Bus Interchange is expected to open.</p>
              <p>I am not an employee of LTA, SBS or any transport company. I do not have access to any insiders' information, circulars or whatever. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am only a full-time student; not working at all.</span></p>
              <p>Well, when I was at the Joo Koon Bus Interchange site and at the Boon Lay Bus Interchange, I did hear people say that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open in mid-November.</p>
              <p>Usually, it is only during school holidays when new bus interchanges open, as observed with Boon Lay (27/12/09)(sunday), Serangoon (3/09/11)(saturday)(during september holidays), Clementi (26/11/11)(saturday), Jurong East (17/12/11)(saturday) and Bukit Panjang (16/12/12)(sunday).</p>
              <p>Based on what I heard that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open in mid-November, and the trend that new bus interchanges open on either a saturday or sunday, I <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>predict</strong></span> the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open on either 15, 16, 22 or 23 of November 2014.</p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that since the Joo Koon Bus Interchange is a brand new bus interchange, LTA and SBS Transit may need more time to adjust and fine-tune the bus operations at Joo Koon Bus Interchange (and the nearby bus interchanges (eg. Boon Lay) and terminals (eg. Tuas)). Hence, I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">think</span></strong> the opening date will be on a Saturday, which means it is either 15 or 22 of November 2014.</p>
              <p>The new Serangoon Bus Interchange started operations on the first day of September holidays on 3 September 2011. I think the first day of September holidays was choosen only because the dates were limited to that particular weekend, and there was quite a bit of adjustments (eg. 2 bus services have to be removed from Serangoon Bus Interchange and a new bus service in Punggol was launched as a result.) that needs to be done due to the relocation. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The other reason I can think of is that the first day of september holiday is less busy than the first day of december holiday.</span></p>
              <p>The first day of december holidays is usually very busy, because this is when primary school is off for holidays and it is also around this time when the O level exams are over (when I took my Os in 2012, my last paper was a Science (Chem/Phy) paper 1 and it was on 16 November 2012). There will be an exceptionally large traffic at the causeway, roads and all transport infrastructures. Knowing that, it may not be wise to open the Joo Koon Bus Interchange on 15 November 2014.</p>
              <p>This leaves us with only 22 November 2014. If I heard correctly that the Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open in mid-November, I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">think</span></strong> 22 November 2014 is the day.</p>

              <p>This year the schedule of O-levels is a bit earlier.
              My last paper (Bio Paper 1) is on 13 Nov 2014.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr array88, I am sorry, but shouldn't you be studying for your O level examination?</p>
              <p>My advice is that you should do something else instead of writing in forums or following news. For example, you can watch dramas when you are taking a break. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The English language used in forums is not always perfect. You should read other forms of media that use perfect English, such as news portals, etc.</span></p>
              <p>The O level examination is a major examination. It determines your future.</p>
              <p>Please do not be distracted.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange will only affect people working in Jurong Industrial Estate. Even with Joo Koon Bus Interchange, things will go on as per normal. So do not think about it.</p>
              <p>Just focus on your O level examination.</p>

              <p>Well, I am not sure if there is a restriction on which areas it can serve, but even if there is, the bus networks at Jurong West will still be affected.</p>
              <p>But then again, I am sure any loss of bus connection in Jurong West will be prevented, if not minimised.</p>
