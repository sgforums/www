              <p>After almost two years of discussion, the big day is finally here. In just three more days, the brand new Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open.</p>
                                                      <p>  </p>
                                                      <p>Today, I saw something at boarding berth B4 of the new Boon Lay Air-Conditioned Bus Interchange. Next to the green colour signboard for bus service 199, there is a new addition. It is a blank grey colour signboard, with what seems to be a sticker of the same colour pasted over it. I guess it is for the new bus service 258 that will begin in three days' time.</p>
                                                      <p>It is probably temporary; When bus services 182, 182M and 257 are amended out to the brand new Joo Koon Bus Interchange the following week, that signboard could be replaced with a new one at another place.</p>

              <p>As I studied the timetables of the bus stops along the route of bus service 99, I noticed there is one additional trip starting from the bus stop at Jurong West Avenue 5, after Jurong West Street 71 and before Pioneer Road North. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

                                                      <p>Currently, until this friday, there are 137 weekday trips on bus service 99 at Jurong West Avenue 5 before Street 71, and 138 weekday trips after Street 71, in the direction towards Street 91. The additional trip seems to start at 17:48hrs.</p>
                              <p>With effect from this saturday, 21 November 2015, there will be 146 weekday trips on bus service 99 at both sides of Jurong West Avenue 5.</p>
                  <p>From the looks of it, the six trips that will be added w.e.f 21/11/15 arrives at Jurong West Avenue 5 between 5pm and 7pm, and departs Clementi Bus Interchange at around 3pm-3:30pm.</p>

              <p>The number of double decker buses at the side. :O The fire hydrant drawing shows only two parking lots, but there are up to five buses. I think during normal day with bus services running, there can be around four buses parked there, considering the gap is wider (otherwise how to drive in and out of the gap?). This means Joo Koon Bus Interchange has the capacity for around twenty buses, or around ten bus services.</p>

              <p>That wouldn't be my reason. sv 30 has super high loading between Boon Lay and Lakeside estate. PM load on every bus varies between 60-90 pax. Severe inconvenience if sv 30 is diverted to Joo Koon.</p>

              <p>That is for any service. After service is introduced you need to give at least 2 months to assess loading. It is not just awareness of new service, but also changing your travel routine that you have been used to.</p>
              <p>Hence, I have still not surveyed 102 but now plan to do it today or Dec first week as these two times I will be in Hougang/Sengkang estate with work. </p>

              <p>I think that would be waste of paper to have posters on each bus and HDB flats. Singapore is a literate society, and most can read. The Joo Koon announcement and routes have come in newspapers, online websites etc multiple times. All those for whom it matters, will or should take the pain to read it.</p>
              <p>Compared to 120, 49 where the routes are announced a week to 10 days in advance, LTA has done a nice job with preparing from before. I also like the phased approach, rather than do all at once. I think this is one the best managed communication, compared to the CCK one or other route launches.</p>
