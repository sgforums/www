              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Few days ago, I went to look at Joo Koon Bus Interchange. The site is still (mostly) under construction. Cannot really see any fitting of fixtures yet. Most importantly, there's no signboard saying "Joo Koon Bus Interchange" or something like that. Needless to say, there is no sighting of buses going inside and coming out. </span></p>
              <p>With such sighting, I think the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange may not open in mid-November this year. When the news report mentioned Joo Koon Bus Interchange will be ready by end-2014, I guess they only meant the bus interchange complete construction.</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">New predictions on opening date:</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- end-Decemer 2014</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- March 2015</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- June 2015</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>Personally, I think Joo Koon Bus Interchange will only open in December 2014 or June 2015, because this is a new bus interchange, and its opening will mean a revamp to the bus networks at Tuas, Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong West.</p>
              <p>This is unlike the other bus interchanges where the bus routes are already fixed and re-location would not have much impact on the routes.</p>
              <p>Since there will be a revamp of bus networks, I think it would be wise to open it only during a certain time of the year where there are low traffic and changes to traffic volumes would not change so fast (long period of time), so people can make smooth adjustments and adapt well to the revamp, with minimal disruptions to their lives. Likewise for the bus company and the bus drivers.</p>
              <p>Joo Koon Bus Interchange is a completely new bus interchange. Everything is new. Since it is everything new, there is really a need for time to make adjustments. #justsaying</p>

              <p>If it is 4 sawtooth boarding berths, can already accommodate 12 services.. (provided there are at least 24 parking bays) which is good enough, much more than what Serangoon can offer. </p>

              <p>In the industrial area, there are hostels and dormitories, and eateries and commercial places. I believe the Feeder bus services at Joo Koon Bus Interchange will connect the hostels/dormitories to the hangout places and Fairprice Hub (Joo Koon MRT Station).</p>
              <p>That said, if Joo Koon Bus Interchange has such bus services, Tuas Bus Terminal should also have Feeder bus services, since the entire industrial area is quite large, and further more, the new Tuas MRT Stations will be ready in a few years' time.</p>
              <p>The feeder bus services there should serve two purposes:</p>

              loop at Boon Lay when Tuas can be the main resting/starting point

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Joo Koon Bus Interchange is a new bus interchange. This is the first time many of us (born after 1990 and staying in the West) will witness the opening of a new bus interchange, so it is something I believe many are excited about.</span></p>
              <p>While we await the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange, these were what happened when <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sembawang Bus Interchange and Punggol Bus Interchange - both new bus interchanges - opened on 17 November 2005 and 30 November 2003 respectively, </span></p>

              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some bus routes (eg. 83, 3, 62 and 136 at Punggol) (eg. 167, 859, 980, 981 at Sembawang) were extended to the new bus interchanges.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">new bus route 882 at Sembawang was created at the new bus interchange when it opened.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on these, I believe when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, </p>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">some bus routes (mainly Tuas-dominant bus routes) (eg. 257, 254, 182, 192 and 193) may be shortened to originate from Joo Koon.</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some bus routes (eg. 251, 252 and 255) may be re-routed and extended to terminate at Joo Koon while continue to originate from Boon Lay.</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">those bus routes (eg. 251, 252 and 255) re-routed may be re-routed to cover loss due to shortening of Tuas-dominant bus services (eg. 254, 192).</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some new bus route(s) may be created from Joo Koon to cover the loss, should 252 or/and 255 be re-routed.</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">I foresee a new bus route replacing 182 and 193 at Upper Jurong Road.</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">In all, I believe there will be ten bus routes (eg. 257, 254, 182, 192, 193, 251, 252, 255, new A and new B) at Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</li>
              <p> </p>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">However, due to the possibility that Joo Koon Bus Interchange may only have three sawtooth berths and the capacity for only nine bus routes, I believe some Tuas-dominant bus routes may instead (be extended to Tuas Bus Terminal, if they are not yet at Tuas, and) loop elsewhere. </li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">193 and 192 may be shortened to loop around Joo Koon MRT and Joo Koon Bus Interchange (only driving through Joo Koon Bus Interchange and exit to Benoi Road)(without stopping at Joo Koon Bus Interchange) for a few years, then shortened again to loop at Tuas Flyover, when Gul Circle MRT opens.</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">182 may be shortend to Joo Koon for a few years, then shortened again to Tuas Bus Terminal, when Tuas Link MRT opens.</li>
              <li style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside;">Eventually, when the Tuas West MRT Extension opens, I believe Joo Koon Bus Interchange should have around seven (eg. 257, 254, 251, 252, 255, new A, new B) bus services, with capacity for two/five (if there are three sawtooth berths) to five/eight (if there are four sawtooth berths) new bus services.</li>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange is a new bus interchange. This is the first time many
              of us (born after 1990 and staying in the West) will witness the
              opening of a new bus interchange, so it is something I believe many
              are excited about.</span></p>
              <p>While we await the opening of Joo Koon Bus Interchange, these
              were what happened when <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sembawang Bus Interchange and Punggol Bus
              Interchange - both new bus interchanges - opened on 17 November
              2005 and 30 November 2003 respectively, </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some bus routes (eg. 83, 3,
              62 and 136 at Punggol) (eg. 167, 859, 980, 981 at Sembawang) were
              extended to the new bus interchanges.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">new bus route 882 at
              Sembawang was created at the new bus interchange when it
              opened.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on these, I believe when Joo Koon Bus Interchange
              opens, </p>
              <ul>
              <li>some bus routes (mainly Tuas-dominant bus routes) (eg.
              257, 254, 182, 192 and 193) may be shortened to originate from Joo
              Koon.</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some bus routes (eg.
              251, 252 and 255) may be re-routed and extended to terminate at Joo
              Koon while continue to originate from Boon Lay.</span></li>
              <li>those bus routes (eg. 251, 252 and 255) re-routed may
              be re-routed to cover loss due to shortening of Tuas-dominant bus
              services (eg. 254, 192).</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">some new bus
              route(s) may be created from Joo Koon to cover the loss, should 252
              or/and 255 be re-routed.</span></li>
              <li>I foresee a new bus route replacing 182 and 193 at
              Upper Jurong Road.</li>
              <li>In all, I believe there will be ten bus routes (eg.
              257, 254, 182, 192, 193, 251, 252, 255, new A and new B) at Joo
              Koon Bus Interchange.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>However, due to the possibility that Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange may only have three sawtooth berths and the capacity
              for only nine bus routes, I believe some Tuas-dominant bus routes
              may instead (be extended to Tuas Bus Terminal, if they are not yet
              at Tuas, and) loop elsewhere.</li>
              <li>193 and 192 may be shortened to loop around Joo Koon
              MRT and Joo Koon Bus Interchange (only driving through Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange and exit to Benoi Road)(without stopping at Joo Koon
              Bus Interchange) for a few years, then shortened again to loop at
              Tuas Flyover, when Gul Circle MRT opens.</li>
              <li>182 may be shortend to Joo Koon for a few years, then
              shortened again to Tuas Bus Terminal, when Tuas Link MRT
              opens.</li>
              <li>Eventually, when the Tuas West MRT Extension opens, I
              believe Joo Koon Bus Interchange should have around seven (eg. 257,
              254, 251, 252, 255, new A, new B) bus services, with capacity for
              two/five (if there are three sawtooth berths) to five/eight (if
              there are four sawtooth berths) new bus services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Press release wise, we may expect something like these:</p>

              <p>I am not sure if both 192/193 will be truncated. One of them for sure, but 192 should stay as it is. </p>
              <p>I think 249, 251 might not go to Joo Koon but high likelihood of 252, 255, 257 to start from Joon Koon.</p>
              <p>One of the two - either 182/254 might start from Joo Koon, while the other will continue to operate from Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>In totality, JIS services from Joo Koon could be:</p>
              <p>193, 252, 255, 254, 255, 257</p>
              <p>JIS services that will continue to operate from Boon Lay</p>
              <p>182, 192, 246, 249, 251 </p>
              <p>* This in itself will give space for 6 new services to call at Boon Lay Interchange. Hoping with this move, 49 will be extended to Boon Lay (loop), 79 will terminate at Boon Lay (rather than loop). There should be 2 new JIS services from Boon Lay introduced, one for Jurong Island Road &amp; other for the remaining part of International road not covered by 246/252. (sv 248, sv 253)</p>
              <p>* There should be 2 new services launched from Joo Koon, one covering Tuas south (sv 256) and other covering lost parts of Pioneer Sector not covered by 257 (sv 259)</p>
              <p>* There should be a service along Kim Tian Industrial area/dorms that do not have service today. This one could also do International road before terminating at Boon Lay (sv 253) </p>
