              <p>well, I think when deciding which routes to change and which to remain, the key consideration is on the distance - on the assumption that the people working in Tuas/Pioneer (planning area) all stay in areas east of Pioneer (planning area).</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel that the bus network currently at Tuas,
                                                      Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning areas) is not
                                                      effective - evident from the regular peak hour traffic
                                                      congestion. With the Tuas MRT line coming along, <strong>there has
                                                      to be bus rationalisation at Tuas area</strong>, with a new
                                                      set of bus services in Tuas, Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning
                                                      areas).</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I think the new set of bus services will consists
                                                      of peak hour bus services <strong>(PHBS)</strong> and
                                                      <strong>"trunk"</strong> bus services.</p>
              <ul>
              <li># The peak hour bus services (<strong>PHBS</strong>) will
                                                      <strong>operate only during peak hours</strong> and run
                                                      between the MRT stations and industrial area, to <strong>serve as
                                                      last/first leg of public transport</strong> for people working
                                                      there.</li>
              <li># Similar to service 42 at Kembangan MRT Station, <strong>each
                                                      PHBS will loop inside one/two industrial area(s) and go
                                                      to a MRT station</strong>.  They will not go to any bus
                                                      interchange or terminal.</li>
              <li># PHBSs goes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span></strong>to (along the minor
                                                      roads) industrial areas.</li>
              <li># Since there are seven MRT stations (Tuas Link, Tuas West
                                                      Road, Tuas Crescent, Gul Circle, Joo Koon, Pioneer &amp; Boon
                                                      Lay), there should be around 7-14 such bus services, with
                                                      <strong>1-2 of them per MRT station</strong>.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>% The <strong>"trunk"</strong> bus services will
                                                      <strong>operate throughout the day</strong> and run along the
                                                      main roads of Tuas, Pioneer and Boon Lay (planning areas), to
                                                      <strong>provide bus connection to other parts of Singapore</strong> (including from Tuas to Joo Koon).</li>

                                                      Tuas/Pioneer&amp;Boon Lay (planning area) during off-peak
                                                      hours</strong> when the demand for bus services there is low.</li>
              <li>% "trunk"s goes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">around</span></strong> (along the
                                                      main roads)(without going in) industrial areas.</li>
              <li>% Tuas's "trunk" shall be those serving west of Benoi
                                                      Road, whereas those serving east of Benoi Road shall be

              <li>% Tuas's "trunk" may either end at Tuas Bus

              <p>mmm... sorry to say, but I think your article is a bit theoretical/not practical. if we have it your way, we will have a bus connection that is weaker than what is already there today.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>nontheless, I agree that all bus services west of Benoi Road shall be Tuas's bus services. </li>
              <li><strong>182</strong>, <strong>192</strong>, <strong>193</strong>, <strong>251</strong>, <strong>252</strong>, <strong>254</strong>, <strong>255</strong> and <strong>257</strong>'s current route at west of Benoi Road should be split at Benoi Road and go to Joo Koon Bus Interchange. <em><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">(254 should be adjusted to go to Tuas Crescent MRT)</span></em></li>
              <li>The other part (at east of Benoi Road) of their routes would become new bus services.</li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">192's other part should remain largely the same, except </span></li>
              <span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span></ol> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">before Pioneer Road North, it goes along Jurong West Street 61 and 63 (Pioneer MRT) - to skip peak hour jam and provide bus connectivity to MRT for a few groups of people.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">after Boon Lay Way, it should turn into Kian Teck Way, loop around it and enter Lok Yang via Kian Teck Avenue-First Lok Yang Road. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">people in Kian Teck and Lok Yang will have access to Pioneer MRT.</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><span style="color: #339966;">252's other part should be extended to serve Neythal Road, since now it has been shortened. The remaining part of the route shall remain the same.</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><span style="color: #ff6600; line-height: 1.231;">193's other part should be replaced entirely by the Joo Koon-Bukit Panjang bus service that was suggested yesterday at 'Route Suggestions (Part 5)'.</span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><span style="color: #ff0000; line-height: 1.231;"><br></span></li>
              <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"><span style="color: #ff0000; line-height: 1.231;">182's other part would become rather redundant after the split. so we should just delete it.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">251's other part can be re-routed to ply 182's section and use Pioneer Road North to enter Pioneer Road. After Shipyard Road, it can use Pioneer Road to loop back to Pioneer Road North. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No need to go to Joo Koon Bus Interchange</span>.</span></li>
              </ol> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">this will duplicate and replace the other part of 254.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">now, 251's other part express along Jalan Boon Lay (which experiences traffic congestion during peak hours) and serves only Jurong Bird Park before going to Pioneer Road.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">so might as well re-route it to go shorter route while avoid the jam. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">personally, I think having 194 to Jurong Bird Park is enough.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="color: #993366;">255's other part could simply loop at Benoi Sector, Benoi Road and return to Pioneer Road North via Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No need to go to Joo Koon Bus Interchange</span>.</span></li>
              </ol> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #993366;">This will duplicate and replace the other part of 257.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #993366;">To compensate the loss of connection to Pioneer MRT from Jurong West Street 62, the other part of 255 could ply St61,62 and 64 after Pioneer MRT.</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #993366;">People staying along Boon Lay Way would have the other part of 251. So no need for this other part of 255 to ply Jurong West Street 63 (after MRT).</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In short, I think</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">i) there will be eleven bus services at Joo Koon Bus Interchange - consisting of 182, 192, 193, 251, 252, 254, 255, 257 and three (two from 192 and 252) new services.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">since a standard sawtooth berth can have three bus services, I guess JK is designed for 12-15 bus services and there is provision for around 1-4 new bus services in future. (assuming JK only has sawtooth and no end-on) </span></em></span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ii) 251, 255 and two new services (from 192 and 252) will call at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">iii) 182, 193, 254 and 257 will have their other parts replaced and deleted, no longer calling at Boon Lay Bus Interchange - Boon Lay Bus Interchange will have four less services.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do not think any non-JIS from Boon Lay, Jurong East or any bus interchange elsewhere should be extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, since this will only increase the distance and may result in more consequences than benefits. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Nonetheless, we can create</span> a new service - running between Jurong East and Joo Koon - to serve areas (eg. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">between Boon Lay MRT and Lakeside MRT) </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">that currently do not have any bus service.</span></p>

              <p>you mean like 187 which goes around Bukit Batok Bus Interchange along the southern perimeters (going straight towards B. Gombak instead of BB Int at Ave3 junction) ? </p>
              <p>but there is Boon Lay Way in the way. last time the section of Boon Lay Way at that area was always congested with buses during peak hours. it was after Joo Koon MRT opened that the congestion problem was resolved. </p>
              <p>I think there can only be new bus services at the bus stop beside the temporary bus int site at street 64 if there are bus services edited to skip that section of Boon Lay Way.</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">regarding the wiki articles, there used to be two articles (Nanyang and Gek Poh), but in 2012/3, I merged the two articles into 'Yunnan' and created a new article named 'Wenya'. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This was done after I saw <a href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications_and_papers/population_and_population_structure/population2013-map1.pdf">the URA map </a></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><a href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications_and_papers/population_and_population_structure/population2013-map1.pdf">showing planning areas and subzones</a>, and realised there was kind of a misunderstanding that everyone (most people) in JW area has.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Personally, I feel that things make more sense when I found out that 'Gek Poh', 'Nanyang' and 'St 93' is actually all 'Yunnan'. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">for instance, it makes more sense that the neighborhood centre for st82 ppl is Gek Poh Shopping Centre (at st75), instead of Nanyang Neighborhood Centre (at st91), although they stay in 'Nanyang' ward of Chua Chu Kang GRC and Gek Poh SC is in Hong Kah North SMC. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Nanyang NC is actually for people staying in western part of 'Yunnan', whereas Gek Poh SC is actually for people staying in the eastern part.</span></li>

I was trying to portray two different characters with different mindsets who give different views. Though it is a stunt, I'm sure you would agree with me that it has added life to the forum threads. Nonetheless, I am sorry for irritating you, and offending you with the ignorant reply I made yesterday.</p>

                              along Jalan Boon Lay (which experiences traffic congestion during
                              peak hours) and serves only Jurong Bird Park before going to

                      <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">so might as well re-route it to

                      <li><span style="color: #993366;">To compensate the loss of
                              connection to Pioneer MRT from Jurong West Street 62, the other
                              part of 255 could ply St61,62 and 64 after Pioneer

                              would have the other part of 251. So no need for this other part of
                              255 to ply Jurong West Street 63 (after MRT).</span></li>

                      <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">since a standard sawtooth berth can have three
                              bus services, I guess JK is designed for 12-15 bus services and
                              there is provision for around 1-4 new bus services in future.
                              (assuming JK only has sawtooth and no

                              at Boon Lay Bus Interchange - Boon Lay Bus Interchange will have
                              four less services.</span></li>
                      </ol>
                      <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do not think any non-JIS

                              be extended to Joo Koon Bus Interchange, since this will only
                              increase the distance and may result in more consequences than
                              benefits. </span></p>

              <p>@Gus.chong Yes, there is concrete evidence. @SBS8131D posted
              some of them here yesterday. I acknowledged them.</p>
              <p><br> @BusAnalayzer May I apologise to you for the stunt I have been
              playing using the two accounts. I was trying to portray two
              different characters with different mindsets who give different
              views. Though it is a stunt, I'm sure you would agree with me that
              it has added life to the forum threads. Nonetheless, I am sorry for
              irritating you, and offending you with the ignorant reply I made
              yesterday.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify, the part in my profile where I admitted was
              only added yesterday. I have been using this account ever since. I
              will not use the obscene name again.</p>

              <p>by the way, according to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/YourSay/DiscussionForum/tabid/101/mode/3/Default.aspx?ssFormAction=%5B%5BssBlogThread_VIEW%5D%5D&amp;tid=%5B%5B14184%5D%5D">www.reach.gov.sg/</a>, the LTA says that they are
                  "reviewing the bus network in Tuas and this network will be
                  restructured in tandem with the developments there."</p>
              <p>as mentioned earlier </p>
              <p>, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I think the
                  restructuring would be </span></p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">split services at Benoi Road
                  to divert them to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">adjust the other parts to
                  improve connectivity.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">adjust a little bit to the
                  services west of Benoi Road, to serve Tuas Crescent MRT
                  Station.</span></li>
              </ol> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">it is amazing how there are
                  already good bus connections to Gul Circle, Tuas West Road and Tuas
                  Link. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It seems that when LTA
                  planned the MRT extension, they added stations along points where
                  bus services intersect. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Only Tuas Crescent MRT
                  Station does not have bus services intersecting it.</span></li>

              <p>Cause using the iPad to reply makes it very buggy for me to use the forums.</p>
              <p>The idea is to connect those around the roads mentioned to Tuas Cres MRT. But 192's current route prevents it from connecting it to the station. So by swapping the two routes at Tuas Rd and Ave 4 will cause the two routes to cross at a certain point, which in this case, is the MRT station. This is also in-line with LTA's Hub and Spoke policy (Not a fan of it). The issue is that the upcoming viaduct along Pioneer Rd may cause problems with the junction.</p>
              <p>Quick question, should 255 serve Gul MRT before going to Gul, or go from Joo Koon straight? Which is better?</p>

              <p>Distance wise, it is better to connect directly to Joo Koon instead. </p>
              <p>Rather than go west to Gul Circle station via bus and go east to Joo Koon station (and beyond) via MRT, might as well go straight West to Joo Koon station and take MRT from there.</p>
