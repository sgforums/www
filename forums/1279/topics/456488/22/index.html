              <p>63xx is for the rest of the BSEP batch I presume. That's why
              they're continuing to reg under the 63xx for the new BSEP
              Citaros.</p>
              <p>64xx series I'm thinking they're skipping cause of the unlucky
              fengshui or something. Try pronouncing it in Chinese and you'll
              know what I mean. Just my guess.<br> <br> Then the 65xx series is perhaps for the next wave of BSEP after
              they run out of 63xx series regos since they're nearing the end of
              63xx range?</p>
              <p>So yeah, 66xx might be for the latest Citaros they ordered or
              something~</p>

              <p>The bus was obviously drove to the depot. Plus it is non-bsep,
                      so it is valid to put sp. Unless you got a photo of the non-bsep
                      bus towed to depot, then dunnid put SP. Simple as thar.</p>

              <p>First of all, are you that 'SBS3107H' guy or related to him in any way on Wiki? I believe you have your own Wiki account don't you? Unless you're that guy, then you talk. Otherwise, none of your business, and I didn't even ask for your comment. I directed that comment to him, in case you read my post too fast.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it's not just me. Others like lemon1974 have talked about this before, and the senior bus fans have been doing it for ages, for KUBs, for Wrights, and Citaros with the same system. If the bus in question isn't deployed yet on the roads, put only the depot it is under as the status of that bus in wiki. When the bus is out on the road for REVENUE SERVICE, then you put it as SP. Revenue service is the one I'm focusing on. This is so that other bus fans can tell when the bus is out on its FIRST DAY OF REVENUE SERVICE. <br><br>If that is clearer to you, I capitalise the words I wanted to focus, out for REVENUE SERVICE. Don't try to keep up the act &amp; play along so forcefully to die die force that you're right with things like 'the bus is out on the roads etc cause driven to the depot' blah blah, 'not part of BSEP scheme' blah blah. Other bus fans have been using this so-called system for ages to identify when a bus is out for revenue service or still in the depot as new-new. If people didn't have a prob with that for ages, then why change? I was only highlighting that to just stick with that system to avoid confusion. To use your words, "simple as that".</p>
              <p>Thirdly, this has nothing to do with BSEP at all. Nothing. The previous time when the KUBs, Citaros &amp; Batch 1 &amp; early Batch 2 Wright B9TLs came out, many of the bus fans did the same thing too. Did BSEP existed back then? I don't see why must we change the system because of how the newer bus fans like you, stubbornly insist that you're right.</p>
              <p>If you still don't understand what I'm talking about, then I'll leave it to lemon1974 and the rest of the senior bus fans to shoot anyone who makes the same mistake from now on, since you guys can't pick it up despite us repeating to just stick with the system. </p>
              <p>If you're not the guy I was shooting, don't bother to reply cause it's not your fault if you're not '3107H'. Otherwise, you'll think that I'm picking on you when I'm not. Thank you very much. </p>
              <p>And anyway, I already explained this thingy with '3107H' on Wiki, so I don't see if you have a need to comment back too. Peace.</p>

              <p>Uh, thanks for the update. I guessed the AMDEP ones are out since yesterday. <br><br>anyway, that guy I was shooting on Wiki, he edited both the statuses of BNDEP &amp; AMDEP Batch 2 Citaros. Which I believe the BNDEP ones are still sleeping in BNDEP as of yesterday.</p>
