              <p>IMO, i would think BNDEP got some catching up to do when it comes to maintenance. Take 6171B for example, the interior esp the front air con vents at the first few row of seats is extremly dirty/dusty, the left rear CCTV is also missing and it's like that for nearly 3 weeks with nothing done to it.</p>
              <p>I would say AR/BB is much better in maintaining but i do not know about the situation for other depot.</p>

              <p>Actually my initial post about the rims was to bring out the idea that BN's mechanics seemed to have given up in fitting back the rim covers after tying the lugnuts with the coilwires, while the other depots' mechanics figured out how to tie the coils &amp; yet still fit back the rim covers properly.

              It's a shame to see Citaros so dirty and without their rimcaps. They looked gorgeous when on their 1st and 2nd week of service. Some are terribly dirty in the interior, especially around the air vents. I must say the cleaning is terribly done. It seems like no one cares about dust, just sweeping away any left-behind trash. Just look at the Wrights' bottom deck ceiling. You can see the dust and dirt stains and the fingerprints of those who unknowingly touched them. Eew.
              
              However, I must still give credit to the maintenance crew especially at HGDEP for maintaining the Citaro engines and gearboxes so well. They are all extremely smooth even after weeks of flooring by some BCs. The acceleration and turbo whistle at 2nd and 3rd gears are amazing. First gear is useless, but once the turbo kicks in in 2nd or 3rd, it's just awesome.

              <p>Yeaps, there's also some services that will get more attention than the other services. Just look at Sv 90 &amp; 94 initially when the Euro IV &amp; V KUBs came out.

              <p>This bus is without rim covers as well. Like I said, BNDEP
              mechanics somehow forgot how to fit back the rim covers after tying
              the lugnuts. LOL.</p>

              <p>Yes CGA service buses will always be in better condition than
              normal buses.</p>
              <p>But from what i observe it isnt just between CGA service buses
              and normal service buses.</p>
              <p>Like for Svc 852, SMB190U rims are polished quite often and is
              mostly shiny but for 189A and for it is always/seldom polished.
              It's interior is also dirtier than 190U.</p>
              <p>Also when both SMB109G and 133K were both perm 858 which goes to
              CGA, 133K was much cleaned much more often and engine was much
              better than 109G</p>
              <p>Anyway sorry for being off-topic...</p>

              <p>I do think that SMRT might have cleaned up SMB190U's body since its advert is already removed.</p>
              <p>SMB189A may get a cleanup once its advert is removed? Im not sure though.</p>
