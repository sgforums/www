              <p>You're not making any sense here. Tell me why would the LTA
              SPECIFICALLY want to buy SBST buses? What is so outstanding bout
              SBST design (none btw) that makes LTA so craving for it?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What's outstanding (to LTA) is how basic SBST specifications are. Using normal plug doors, PIW Backrest without foldable seat, no announcer system, and fleet standardization. SBST has more Citaros than SMRT so LTA buys in SBST-spec. A22s are only owned by SMRT so obviously SMRT-spec. </p>

              <p>My opinion of the B9s and Citaros are not gonna change as much as you talk me into it. What I can do is just stop saying it lor if that's what make everyone happy. But ya. I still hold to my opinion. The B9 has a good chassis but have everything else done wrongly. Including that bloody ugly bodywork. The citaro is just hopeless compared to the A22. </p>
              <p>And because of this I would still think the bus is trash. There. Cheerio! I'll stop saying all these not coz my opinion has changed, but coz I dont think this need to escalate any more.</p>

              issue with and as a bus former I'm just here to talk about it. Now
              you wanna place a value judgement on discussion too! Keep it going

              <p>Someone said here. </p>
              <p>Does the door really make a difference? Would the commuters would even care the doors which open and close the same way like all exit doors and is safe to use? </p>
              <p>As fare paying users for the services, they care more of when the bus is coming, the frequencies, the availability of more bus service choices, comfort/seats, availability safety and reliability. Not the bus body, not the doors. They won't want to pay more fares, for the sake of high tech complex sliding door where a cost effective plug out door can do the same job. You want it, you want to fork out that million dollars to LTA to retrofit it for all the 5,000 odd public buses here? No, the commuters are not going to pay a cent fare increase for that unnecessary feature. </p>
              <p>European chassis and fitted with European body. Even tested to withstand topples. What more do you want? You want a bus body made out of wood and paper?</p>
              <p>Ugly? You want those design from Tata buses? Or I give you some better solutions? Next time you persuade LTA to get buses from designer houses, can? Or even better, you design your most awesome bus design and submit to LTA? But be prepared because there will be people saying your design is ugly. </p>
              <p>Fair enough in this hobby, everyone has their likes and dislikes about the bus models here. But buses design here are for meeting the most basic requirements for daily operations, safety, comfort, reliability and cost effectiveness. And these standards are considered higher than many countries, including those developed countries, around the world. Exterior aesthetics, I can even say for most designs here is modern and yet practical. </p>
              <p>I don't like Citaro's lack of eyeball air con vent. I don't like the A22 because there are lesser seats than the Citaro. I don't like the Lionhead design of the A22 because it's impractical. It makes the bus heavier which consumes more fuel, it adds more cost to the bus where the costs can be saved by tens of thousands, if say that Lionhead structure from front to end costs e.g. $500. Many people dislike the green paint scheme for all the buses in future. So? Do I need to highlight all these in every thread here? It's ok if you vent your unhappiness on these small issues a few times here but what you are doing, your incessant bashings and impractical solutions are irritating people who are looking for information more useful to them through those tens of pages in the thread.</p>
              <p>Get a new hobby, if the hobby doesn’t suit your needs, satisfy your own desires. Like I have said, get your own car. Do what you please with it.</p>
              <p>Public transport, public buses doesn't just revolve all around you. Not for your own desires, needs only. It serves the masses. It has to look at the interests of the masses using it, the practicality, effects to the users and even non users, the costs/fares, even limitations like space, cost, resources, logistics. It's not private transport to just give you what you want only. </p>
              <p>So if you please don't mind, don't make this hobby a joke to everyone. Many people are actually reading it even if they are not contributing anything. </p>
