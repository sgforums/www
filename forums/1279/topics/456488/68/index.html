              <p>Why didnt LTA buy more A22 instead? It is so superior in every
              aspect, the Citaro stands worse in any way. And it isnt much
              cheaper than the A22 (if it even is to begin with), since SMRT also

              <p>To LTA, it's not about how great the bus is, it's cost. As good as the A22 is, it's also damn expensive too. So what if the Citaro isn't much cheaper, LTA wants to buy SBS-spec buses, which is Citaro. And they spent on 122 A95s. </p>

              <p>Yes. Thats why I said the A22 would not have cost any much different from Citaro.. In fact I'm convinced if LTA bulked A22 instead of the citaro they would be much cheaper than Citaro, more than the citaro is cheaper than the A22 now.. Thats coz 1. Gemilang OBVIOUSLY charges lower than Evobus, and 2. Buses are assembled out of Asia and shipping costs will obv be higher. Its not just a game of which bus gets bulk purchase yknow. Its proven that the A22 will be cheaper than the Citaro.</p>

              <p>Honestly I'm sick and tired of hearing this bus fare thing. </p>
              <p>How bloody much does it cost to even install a PIS? Something so ESSENTIAL to the commuters? Dont use the smartphone gimmick to shoot it down btw, there are MANY instances where apps could fail, all likely to happen. </p>
              <p>Did you see NWST bus increase its fares after they installed PIS in 2010? No they did not. Shenzhen recently decided to mass install PIS into buses, where's the hike? I feel that the fact that uplifting service standards will necessarily cause prices to SOAR is an exaggeration. Increase yes, but not a bloody 3 dollar jump my dear friend!! This is a case of POOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, not increased costs. </p>

              <p>Honestly I'm sick and tired of hearing this bus fare
                  thing. </p>
              <p>How bloody much does it cost to even install a PIS? Something so
                  ESSENTIAL to the commuters? Dont use the smartphone gimmick to
                  shoot it down btw, there are MANY instances where apps could fail,
                  all likely to happen. </p>
              <p>Did you see NWST bus increase its fares after they installed PIS
                  in 2010? No they did not. Shenzhen recently decided to mass install
                  PIS into buses, where's the hike? I feel that the fact that
                  uplifting service standards will necessarily cause prices to SOAR
                  is an exaggeration. Increase yes, but not a bloody 3 dollar jump my
                  dear friend!! This is a case of POOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, not
                  increased costs. </p>

              <p>If this design goes into mass production, LTA will have to introduce a new campaign telling passengers not to look at their handphone while alighting (MTR style), which will be as successful as any campaigns so far (especially that "Someone else is driving, I can daydream" poster). Or eventually disable the third door making it as useful as the Borismasters without conductors right now...</p>
