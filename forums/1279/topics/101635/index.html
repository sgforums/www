The main purpose of bus photography is bus. The main purpose of terrorist linked bus photography is the area. So the area of focus and objective of the picture is vastly different. Which is why law enforcement officers seldom create trouble with us. Which other nut would want occupy more than 50% of the frame with a boring public bus and nothing else?<br><br>It works on a basis of trust between us as the bus photographers and the SBST staff. Firstly, the photos obtained are for our own personal collection and not used in any commercial area. Secondly, we try to be as discreet as possible while we go around enjoying clicking and the staff mind their own business. Thus, there would not be any major conflict.<br><br>However, I do know that some bus captains are somewhat terrorised by the sight of the cam as there are those public who sit around and do nothing type and snap the pix to send to HQ to launch a complain. On our part, we exclude photographic evidence whenever we complain ourselves, in fact if one phrases the complain in a tactful and clear manner, there is no need for a pix.<br><br>So this is why there are people who enjoy taking photographs of public buses and the difference between a terrorist and an enthusiast holding a cam aimed at buses. Personally, I am proud to be part of this community and celebrating my first anniversary in quality digital bus photos this week. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

They attract attention then suddenly blows the place up. However, I agree that the Singaporean authorities are slightly on the panaroid side, such as posting guards at the school gate to ward off terrorism. Any sane terrorists would use the  peak periods when students and teachers to stream into the school and set off an attack unaware lah!</div>

The main purpose of bus photography is bus. The main purpose of terrorist linked bus photography is the area. So the area of focus and objective of the picture is vastly different. Which is why law enforcement officers seldom create trouble with us. Which other nut would want occupy more than 50% of the frame with a boring public bus and nothing else?<br><br>It works on a basis of trust between us as the bus photographers and the SBST staff. Firstly, the photos obtained are for our own personal collection and not used in any commercial area. Secondly, we try to be as discreet as possible while we go around enjoying clicking and the staff mind their own business. Thus, there would not be any major conflict.<br><br>However, I do know that some bus captains are somewhat terrorised by the sight of the cam as there are those public who sit around and do nothing type and snap the pix to send to HQ to launch a complain. On our part, we exclude photographic evidence whenever we complain ourselves, in fact if one phrases the complain in a tactful and clear manner, there is no need for a pix.<br><br>So this is why there are people who enjoy taking photographs of public buses and the difference between a terrorist and an enthusiast holding a cam aimed at buses. Personally, I am proud to be part of this community and celebrating my first anniversary in quality digital bus photos this week. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>The main issue here is the ambiguity of instructions issued by their head offices. For instance, the old auntie at Woodlands Int is notorious for stopping photographers and threatening to confiscate the camera, while the staff at Yishun seem the least perturbed. However, it seems that SMRT has recently changed their policy regarding photography at their interchanges. Moreover, the interchange is an open place, I don't see how taking photos at interchanges accounts for trespassing.<br><br>Some green martians have this paranoid fear, some are actually quite nice and understanding. The people at Tampines don't really seem to care, after all they're used to bus fans barging into their office to get service guides all the time, and when one talks to them, they are very friendly and professional.</div>
