              <p>Here's a few questions I'm itching to ask, all if not mostly technical ones. InfoÂ has mostly been unreliable and so I ask here for proper answers if possible.</p>
              <p>1. Are the Voith 0405Gs and DAFs equipped with 3 speed or 4 speed Voiths? If I'm not mistaken, it should be 4 speed, but half the sources say it is 3 and the other half, 4. My guess leans towards 4 speed, but capped at the 3rd due to speed limitors. It won't be surprising since we have 4 speed voith MKIVs. Ah yes, while at it, how about the SBST 0405s? I am also not completely sure that these are equipped with 3 speed Voiths.</p>
              <p>4. 1688K is equipped with ZF5 or ZF4? Conflicting sources again. And the CNG brethren, are they equipped with ZF4?</p>

              <p><br>1. try taking 886L on Sv 39. 4-speed Voith with 60km/h speed limiter.</p>

              <p><br>Don't think so. The MKIV DM should be fitted with the THD101, at least the majority. If I'm not mistaken, the PSV MKIVs too. The most obvious reason is the difference in power between the DM and Strider variants. Just like that between the SMRT and SBST 0405 variants. If its just gearbox and body difference, we should see little difference, just like that between the B9TL (Voith/ZF), the MKIIIs (Voith/ZF), B10TLs (Voith/ZF) and theÂ 0405s (SBST Voith/ZF/MB), just to quote some examples.Â </p>
              <p>If its so difficult to confirm which voith MKIVs are at least confirmed to be 4 speed, what makes many of you so sure that the information passed around is necessarily correct?</p>

              <p>So far that I have went through the older Voiths, including 863.3 and variants come with only 3 speed. This is mainly due to their DIWA technology; large ratio first gear, smaller ratio second gear and a 1:1 third gear. Having a fourth gear means a overdrive, for this chain of products.</p>
              <p>The .3 range has two exceptions: the 854.3 and 864.3. Both have four speed, one is for articulated buses and one for super single decks (or "Superlong", if you will). The power ratings for 854.3 is at 220kW max and the 864.3, 290kW max.</p>
              <p>Going further technical, here are the gear ratios for the 854.3, 863.3 and 864.3, differential 3.</p>
              <p>854.3: First gear 5.9 - 6.2, second gear 1.43, third gear 1.0, fourth gear 0.7 <br>863.3: First gear 5.9, second gear 1.43, third gear 1.0Â <br>864.3: First gear 5.9, second gear 1.43, third gear 1.0, fourth gear 0.7 (which is essentially the same as the 854.3 but with higher power rating).</p>
              <p>864.5, the model used on the B9TLs, have the same ratios as with 854.3 and 864.3.</p>

              <p>So far that I have went through the older Voiths, including 863.3 and variants come with only 3 speed. This is mainly due to their DIWA technology; large ratio first gear, smaller ratio second gear and a 1:1 third gear. Having a fourth gear means a overdrive, for this chain of products.</p>
              <p>The .3 range has two exceptions: the 854.3 and 864.3. Both have four speed, one is for articulated buses and one for super single decks (or "Superlong", if you will). The power ratings for 854.3 is at 220kW max and the 864.3, 290kW max.</p>
              <p>Going further technical, here are the gear ratios for the 854.3, 863.3 and 864.3, differential 3.</p>
              <p>854.3: First gear 5.9 - 6.2, second gear 1.43, third gear 1.0, fourth gear 0.7<br>863.3: First gear 5.9, second gear 1.43, third gear 1.0Â <br>864.3: First gear 5.9, second gear 1.43, third gear 1.0, fourth gear 0.7 (which is essentially the same as the 854.3 but with higher power rating).</p>
              <p>864.5, the model used on the B9TLs, have the same ratios as with 854.3 and 864.3.</p>

              <p><br>Ok...so it is confirmed then that the DAF and the 0405Gs' Votih are 3 speed type...thanks a lot for the figures.</p>
              <p>Now for the SBST 0405s with Voiths, there are sources that state that they use the 381.4 which is similar to the MKIV Voiths. Anyone can substantiate on that? Much appreciated, thanks.</p>

              <p><br>I think you meant TIB847G because it has the same ad as TIB743Y and TIB848D is adless. That one shouldn't be expired yet. One way to find out if an ad is expired is to check if the ad is being torn and replaced with parts of livery like this bus here:</p>

              <p>Just a disclaimer though: It doesn't 100% gurantees that the ad is expired. Certain Merz with Tourism Malaysia ad has been torn but its not expired. On the contrary many buses with President's Challenge 2008 ad are not torn but they are expired</p>
