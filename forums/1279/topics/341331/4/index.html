              <p>The second incarnation, though for a very very short time, is
              the stretch of KPE between TPE and Tampines Road.</p>

              <p>Wasn't the stretch of KPE between TPE and Tampines Road called Tampines Service Road when it was first opened to the public?</p>
              <p>To be exact, the current Tampines Link stretches from TPE, and past Tampines Ave 10, to the junction with either TP Industrial Ave 4 or 5. After which, it is still Tampines Road. The first few pairs of bus stops on Tampines Link, especially near the temples, reflect this change.</p>

              <p>You have to be more exact. Old Tampines Rd refers to the stretch between Loyang Ave and Upp Changi Rd Nth where svc 5 and 29 ply. It was never used to refer to the stretch of road where 72 now plies.</p>
              <p>There was never a Tampines Way. Although, a few years back, I do vaguely recall a signboard somewhere on the ECP-bound PIE that did have 'Tampines Way'. It was somewhere near the TPE/PIE flyover, IIRC.</p>

              <p>8031J has been perm on Sv17 throughout the whole Holiday1 but replaced by another bus. I hope you don't want to go into precipitation. Just look at what happened to <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1279/topics/329284?page=7#post_8714233">8030L</a>.</p>

              <p><br>ok so what if we know the duty no? Duty type is essential so that ppl can camp for it anytime of the day. But would sane people waste 1h45min camping for a bus? Give duty codes are not useful enough. If its accompanied by timing then I would consider useful. and timing is not just 1 timing somewhere in the early morning and another somewhere in the afternoon. People want full schedule timing so that they know exactly which part of the day they can spare to camp for it.</p>
              <p>Timing is not enough alone. What if the bus is cameoing on another block/timing? Then whatever i said in the previous paragraph is deemed useless. So dont predict the future, predict <strong>NOW</strong>.</p>

              <p>but u still need a certain timing before u are able to determine when the buses are going to arrive. Duty code doesnt help at all. Theres many different start point for a bus for some of the services. With that, it is abit difficult for u as the buses dont arrive according to the order of the duty code.</p>
