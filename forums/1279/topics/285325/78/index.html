              <p>To add on, I think all Airport Services should use Mark III or Mark IV. Tourists and our locals who came down from the plane are tired and will need a seat on the highway. Today I saw 2 svc. 34 buses, one a Mark IV and one a K230UB. The Mark IV was about 3/4 seated which is just nice and so good for service 34. But when I saw the K230, I see people miserably standing.</p>

              Lets stop this arguement. For DD, SBST can buy buses like B10TL.
              You should know that a B10TL's floor is slopped to the back, which
              is good.</p>

              <p><br>Yea but usually by the second day of service the BCs will be more familarised with the controls. Usually one can expect to see BCs braking very hard on the Scanias, engaging parking brake everywhere they stop, pressing buttons here and there on the first day of service...</p>
              <p>It takes time to learn. :)</p>

              <p>Firstly, how many tourist and locals takes buses with their bulky luggage? Secondly, why would they be tired from sitting on a plane for at least an hour, if they really are tired, dont u think they glad to board a bus without lugging a luggage up the 2 steps onto the Mk III and Mk IVs? Thirdly, where do u put the luggage if u carry it on the Mk III and Mk IV? I think that would block other passengers instead.</p>
              <p>I believe most of the ppl who use the buses are airport staff or friends &amp; family who sent someone off. Tourist will take trains, or taxis in my opinion.</p>

              <p>Firstly, how many tourist and locals takes buses with their bulky luggage?

              <p>I believe most of the ppl who use the buses are airport staff or friends &amp; family who sent someone off. Tourist will take trains, or taxis in my opinion.</p>

              <p><br>Haha, I've been to Japan last year and find the so called "Limos" are very efficient. They don't crawl on the road neither do they go round in circles before reaching the airport. Still, I think it's a classy name for a bus. People may mistake them as real Limos. Haha</p>
