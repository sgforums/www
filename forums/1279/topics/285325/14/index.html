No prizes for guessing why the above 2 got installed first.<br><br>For those who took S100 yesterday evening, you would notice that the Serangoon-bound direction buses came in pairs. This is because that there was an MRT disruption in town hence more human traffic which led to buses being late.

            <div class='col-md body'>SBS8038R is on S-shift today and is confirmed with sticker a 100 perm bus. And the aircon is so cold that the BC driving it have to wear jacket. I'm forced to wear a turtleneck and it is damn cold, especially at the rear. The BC complained to me about the coldness of the bus. I should nickname SBS8038R as 'Mr Fridge'.<br><br>You guys forgot to photograph the new Scanias at this place:<br><br><img src="http://fc04.deviantart.com/fs21/i/2007/306/b/2/Star_Shining_Out_by_tintinspartan.jpg"></div>
