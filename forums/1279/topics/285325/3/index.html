This package not only includes the delivery of the chassis but also other things such as the supply of spare parts, warranty and on-site service. I'm sure SBS Transit had invited several bus makers to send in a proposal and somehow, Scania managed to pip its competitors and get the contract.<br><br>Scania are now into its 4th(or 5th?) generation chassis with a wide range of quality products. You have to give credit for their improvements over the old generation 113s.<br><br>SBS Transit made a profit of nearly S$18 million in the second quarter of 2007. With such a profit margin, I don't think that they cannot afford to buy Volvo or Mercedes. Furthermore, cost cutting is now a very common practice in almost every company, not just SBS.</div>
