You have to look at it this way; last time, many singaporeans couldn't read English, thus, the characters. Now, in an ever globalizing world, most Singaporeans can read. Furthermore, we can't expect them to use han, especially with the tourism industry booming. People all over the world who come to Singapore read English as a common language. And also, in a multi-racial society, I have heard of minority groups complaining that the usage of han characters is unfair as their languages are not put up. Just imagine, if the PTC had decided to change the MRT station displays to only han or only tamil or only malay- tons of complain would come in.

You have to look at it this way; last time, many singaporeans couldn't read English, thus, the characters. Now, in an ever globalizing world, most Singaporeans can read. Furthermore, we can't expect them to use han, especially with the tourism industry booming. People all over the world who come to Singapore read English as a common language. And also, in a multi-racial society, I have heard of minority groups complaining that the usage of han characters is unfair as their languages are not put up. Just imagine, if the PTC had decided to change the MRT station displays to only han or only tamil or only malay- tons of complain would come in. So, it would be in the best interest of businesses to not trouble themselves by making trouble not available in the first place.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*This post isn't meant to be offensive to anyone, if it is, feel free to delete.</span></div></blockquote>SMRT already trying to put han characters inside their trains already....<br><br>saw them testing chinese words before...being a chinese everywhere english no chinese i see liao also bueh song</div>
