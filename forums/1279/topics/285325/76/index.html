              <p>but most probably B9TL and K230UB use the same gearbox (ZF 6HP502C). the model of gearbox used can be deduced by looking at the specs, the maximum torque part. buses with diff max torque use diff gearboxes. with the B7RLE max torque at 1200nm, it's most suited to use the 6HP592C gearbox, as 6HP502C is more suited for engine torque of max 1100nm, while K230UB max torque is only at 1050nm, therefore the best gearbox for it is the 6HP502C. our B9TL has a max torque of 1100nm, therefore it uses the most suitable gearbox available for it, which is the 6HP502C. the new OC500LE will be using 6HP592C, with a max torque of 1250nm.</p>

              <p><br>I was also initially excited about the K230s when the first few units came in. But now I hate K230s to the core. Its not only the gearbox that is noisy. The engine is noisy too. I rather have NAC Mark IIs. Even a 20 year old Mark II can acclerate faster than a K230.</p>

              <p>After a few weeks on the scania of bus service 185. I want the mercs back. The acceleration is slow, it noisy, it capacity seem reduce, it not smooth, it just not as good. At first, was excited about the new fleet of buses on 185 but few weeks later I just want the mercs o405 back.</p>

              <p><br>I had seent he loading in the morning. K230Ub are able to load more passengers than mercz. Due to less seats but more standing area. K230UB are good for such service which had high load just only the first few stops and empty after that.
