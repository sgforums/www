              <p>Huh, I don't really see how paying the cheapest rate concerns our right to complain. It's not like you pay more to be able to speak up, and what's more we take the same bus and receive the same type of service. These are completely different grounds.</p>
              <p>Besides, why would we not "dare" to stand all the way back to the rear? What's so frightening about moving to the rear? o_0 And why would we be so bored as to follow what these "adults", as you speak of, are currently doing, even if it's "implied revenge"? I don't get it.</p>

              <p>The bus was packed with students from a certain school on its way back to AMK MRT. Students were all on the front part of the bus, back was totally void of standing pasengers.</p>
              <p>Driver quickly drove into a bus stop, believe he was late too, and kept shouting at them to move to the rear and etc so that people at this stop could board.</p>

              <p>Huh, I don't really see how paying the cheapest rate concerns
              our right to complain. It's not like you pay more to be able to
              speak up, and what's more we take the same bus and receive the
              same type of service. These are completely different
              grounds.</p>
              <p>Besides, why would we not "dare" to stand all the way back
              to the rear? What's so frightening about moving to the rear? o_0
              And why would we be so bored as to follow what these "adults", as
              you speak of, are currently doing, even if it's "implied revenge"?
              I don't get it.</p>

              <p>standing at the back also sometimes quite troublesome..esp if u are carrying alot of stuff to school...at the stop where you want to alight then u have to make ur way through alot of people with your heavy school bag and other stuff...</p>

              <p>Srsly, the root of the problem is that ppl wants to stay near to the exit doors and not because of the steps and stuffs (as claimed by the PTO). <br><br>I think its high time that the 2 PTOs bring in a bus with an additional exit door place right at the end of the bus.</p>
              <p>+ People are now more willing to move to the back of the bus <br><br>- Sacrifice of seats twrds the end (up to 2 seats may be gone)<br>- Fare evaders (trying to board from the rear thinking that they can escape).</p>
              <p><br>Whether this is feasible is up to your OWN personal views. But this is just MY personal opinion.</p>
