              <p>Maybe you should explain why you want to extend svc 64, and what the benefits are... (e.g. to provide connectivity between Mei Chin and Queenstown MRT, between Mei Chin and Kent Ridge MRT, etc) </p>
              <p>Alternative suggestions:<br>- Extend svc 63 from Rumah Tinggi to Kent Ridge (via Jln Bukit Merah) to improve connectivity in Rumah Tinggi &amp; Redhill <br>- Merge svc 63 or 64 with svc 191, to provide better connectivity to Mediapolis and Portsdown</p>

              <p>502's route is something that none of the western residents or
              commuters will ever go to the north east. That is the reason why
              they cut it. First, most of the route may duplicate 501. Second, to
              provide connectivity to MBS and Suntec.</p>
              <p>501 is upgraded to Transcity Bus Services bus service 550 and
              City Direct service 654.</p>
              <p>81: cut south of Serangoon, about 5 SDs and 6 DDs lost</p>
              <p>82: cut south of Serangoon, all the double deckers transferred
              to 107.</p>
              <p>85: withdrawn. About 5 SDs and 20 DDs gone.</p>
              <p>97: cut north of City Hall (and diverted to Marina Centre via
              Esplanade Dr and former 79 routing), about 12 DDs gone.</p>
              <p>103: cut south of Serangoon, about 8 SDs lost</p>
              <p>106: cut east of Dhoby Ghaut (and diverted to Marina
              Centre/MBS/Suntec), about 3 SDs and 8 bendies lost</p>
              <p>111: cut east of Dhoby Ghaut (and diverted to Marina Centre
              only), about 9 DDs gone</p>
              <p>147: after NEL rationalisation, the rest of single deckers all
              convert to double deckers.</p>
              <p>501: withdrawn. about 1 SD and 10 DDs gone</p>
              <p>502: cut east of Dhoby Ghaut (and diverted to Marina
              Centre/MBS/Suntec), about 4 DDs and 5 SDs gone</p>
              <p>511/512: withdrawn. about 5 SDs and 7 DDs gone</p>
              <p>Net loss:</p>
              <p>SDs - 5 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 32</p>
              <p>DDs - 6 + 20 + 12 + 9 + 10 + 5 + 7 = 69</p>

              <p>LOL... I remember that my blood was boiling with anger when I saw the massive rationalisation of bus services parallel to the NEL back in 2003. At that time, I was a poor student who only bought bus concession, so I avoided the MRT and took buses only. I depended heavily on svc 23 to travel from Bedok North Rd to Bendemeer Rd so that I can transfer to other buses to downtown and western SG. After the NEL rationalisation, I lost 7 options along Bendemeer Rd / Jalan Besar. The sense of injustice was overwhelming. It seemed that the government had totally forgotten about commuters with bus-only concession pass. (I heard that LTA wanted to cut svc 133 &amp; 147 too, but luckily 133 &amp; 147 were spared due to intervention by grassroot leaders.) </p>
              <p>Thankfully there are no rationalisations (so far) after CCL &amp; DTL started operations. But then, the good times won't last, as KBW said "Bus services may be re-routed, merged or rationalised to optimise resources." Let's wait and see which routes will "kena the axe".</p>

              <p>LOL... I remember that my blood was boiling with anger when I
              saw the massive rationalisation of bus services parallel to the NEL
              back in 2003. At that time, I was a poor student who only bought
              bus concession, so I avoided the MRT and took buses only. I
              depended heavily on svc 23 to travel from Bedok North Rd to
              Bendemeer Rd so that I can transfer to other buses to downtown and
              western SG. After the NEL rationalisation, I lost 7 options along
              Bendemeer Rd / Jalan Besar. The sense of injustice was
              overwhelming. It seemed that the government had totally forgotten
              about commuters with bus-only concession pass. (I heard that LTA
              wanted to cut svc 133 &amp; 147 too, but luckily 133 &amp; 147 were
              spared due to intervention by grassroot leaders.) </p>
              <p>Thankfully there are no rationalisations (so far) after CCL
              &amp; DTL started operations. But then, the good times won't last,
              as KBW said "Bus services may be re-routed, merged or rationalised
              to optimise resources." Let's wait and see which routes will "kena
              the axe".</p>
