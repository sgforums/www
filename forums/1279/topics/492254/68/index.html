              <p>For ur cross border 250, i think CW are going strong over the second link. While i agree that there is a lack of cross border service at Tuas area, and i hope that there would be a new route that serve there soon, i rmb there was this problem that our local bus not allowed to use 2nd link or smth like this. That is why until now there isnt any public routes going there, except private operators.</p>

              <p>Hi all, we would like to know that they can indicate the interest for our bus service from the designated bus terminus in Singapore to the Legoland and Hello Kitty Town for the tourists and passengers like Resorts World Sentosa. The LTA will, really promise that since the time Legoland opened in 2012.</p>

              <p>Singaporean and Malaysian Private operators are operating numerous daily trips to and fro Legoland/Puteri Habour. A notable example would be WTS Travel. There are also other scheduled tour groups held by various communities to these theme parks, so no worries that there are no services there</p>

              <p>858E sounds like a good idea, but don't u think it is a bit too exclusive? Like it only stops at MRT stations, and not other impt stops along the way. Maybe can also include other stops like in Chong Pang area</p>

              <p>For ur cross border 250, i think CW are going strong over the
              second link. While i agree that there is a lack of cross border
              service at Tuas area, and i hope that there would be a new route
              that serve there soon, i rmb there was this problem that our local
              bus not allowed to use 2nd link or smth like this. That is why
              until now there isnt any public routes going there, except private
              operators.</p>
              <p>Good attempt on suggesting this idea, but unlikely this would
              happen for our operators</p>

              <p>there is TS6 that is going to serve 2nd link.</p>
              <p>Cost of operating by Singapore operators is too high...that why there isnt any Singapore operators serving 2nd link...  even for those private operators (SJE/TS8/AC7) using 1st link, dun think they are making much profit. TS1 is definitely losing money that why they have tied up with airlines. </p>
              <p>there is a quota of 150 buses from each countries that can registered to serve cross border routes... SBST plus SMRT already took up 100 buses.. plus SJE, TS1/TS8/AC7.... So the balance quota is just enough for TS3/TS6.... </p>

              <p>True. But TS6 is still MIA, i suspect there are still a lot of paperwork issues behind the scenes. Rmb last year Q1 sinming paper released news abt the new TS3 and TS6 services. However, it took a year's delay for TS3 to even start ops when it was scheduled to start in April last year. So obviously there are many issues regarding cross borders.</p>
              <p>Note also that the newest "cross-border" service by causeway link CW7L didnt even cross the 2nd link. 2 reasons: 1. Likely the quota issue; 2. Maybe the complicated paperwork lo.</p>
              <p>So im guessing there are many issues having cross borders services</p>
              <p>Talking abt 2nd link, it is definitely not profitable. Think abt it, the closest place that would fetch pax aft 2nd link is the legoland area, and that place is rly a distance away. Given also that the vincity of 2nd link and Legoland are not close to city centre, no of pax taking the services would also be little, compared to those merely crossing the woodlands causeway....</p>
              <p>Hence whatever the case, i think these are the reasons why bukit merah is still kept to SBS~</p>

              <p>Thats why everyone cant wait for the start of RTS. With that, i think it will revolutionise the way ppl cross the causeway everyday. By then buses may not be mainly relied on so much and who knows even withdrawing them~</p>
