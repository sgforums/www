              <p>Idea for Route amendment for service 925# (Woodlands --&gt; CCK):</p>
              <p>Woodlands Temp Int --&gt; Current routing to Kranji Way (Opp PUB Headquarters) --&gt; Neo Tiew Cres --&gt; Neo Tiew Road --&gt; Lim Chu Kang Road --&gt; Old CCK Road --&gt; Same routing as 975 --&gt; CCK Int</p>
              <p>Rationale:</p>
              <p>1. Improve connectivity to kranji countryside, especially to places such as D'Kranji Farm Resort, Bollywood Veggies, Kranji Marshes (becoz I saw the kranji express minibus being packed to the brim on weekends, coz a lot of visitors want to visit these places deep into kranji not served by public buses).</p>
              <p>2. A good route duplication for 975 to relief loadings, especially CCK Ave 3 to CCK area</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Downsides:</p>
              <p>1. Could cause a possible competition with kranji express shuttle service. The operations of it has recently been rather bumpy as due to high operational costs, only a few farms are willing to pay for it to run. If 925# does run on weekends, the service could be further affected and hence might even withdraw in the future, affecting workers and visitors travelling there.</p>
              <p>2. Idk how the loading would be, but it could end up quite empty still</p>
              <p>3. Only operates on weekends, so the loading problem faced by residents on 975 cannot be effectively tackled :( </p>
              <p>Well idk if this has already been suggested b4, but this is my idea, do share your thoughts about it, thanks!</p>

The frequency is quite low as the demand for zoo is not as much during week days, hence on weekdays they can ply 927 with lower frequency and 927M with higher frequency, possibly even with DDs.</p>

              <p>Idea for Route amendment for service 925# (Woodlands --&gt;
              CCK):</p>
              <p>Woodlands Temp Int --&gt; Current routing to Kranji Way (Opp PUB
              Headquarters) --&gt; Neo Tiew Cres --&gt; Neo Tiew Road --&gt; Lim
              Chu Kang Road --&gt; Old CCK Road --&gt; Same routing as 975 --&gt;
              CCK Int</p>
              <p>Rationale:</p>
              <p>1. Improve connectivity to kranji countryside, especially to
              places such as D'Kranji Farm Resort, Bollywood Veggies, Kranji
              Marshes (becoz I saw the kranji express minibus being packed to the
              brim on weekends, coz a lot of visitors want to visit these places
              deep into kranji not served by public buses).</p>
              <p>2. A good route duplication for 975 to relief loadings,
              especially CCK Ave 3 to CCK area</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Downsides:</p>
              <p>1. Could cause a possible competition with kranji express
              shuttle service. The operations of it has recently been rather
              bumpy as due to high operational costs, only a few farms are
              willing to pay for it to run. If 925# does run on weekends, the
              service could be further affected and hence might even withdraw in
              the future, affecting workers and visitors travelling there.</p>
              <p>2. Idk how the loading would be, but it could end up quite empty
              still</p>
              <p>3. Only operates on weekends, so the loading problem faced by
              residents on 975 cannot be effectively tackled :( </p>
              <p>Well idk if this has already been suggested b4, but this is my
              idea, do share your thoughts about it, thanks!</p>

              <p>Since the 925# service only operates on Sundays, I think it will not help much with svc 975, so might as well terminate at Lim Chu Kang Rd End (Neo Tiew Rd &gt; LCK Rd End) or loop around the farms near LCK Rd End instead of going all the way to CCK.</p>
              <p>The whole reason for the existence of Kranji Express is because there are no public transport options to get into the area; I'm sure the farms and businesses there will be very happy to welcome such an extension to service 925 on Sundays so that they don't have to pay for the private shuttle. Fares on svc 925 are also the regular fares which is cheaper than what the Kranji Express shuttle charges so this may encourage more people to visit the farms on Sundays. All-in-all probably a win-win situation for all parties involved. Cheers.</p>

              <p>True, and that was what happened to 925# in 2005 when it was extended to LCK lane 3, but was then shortened, probably due to low ridership, so idk whether it is wise to even extend it in anyways</p>

              <p>Might just end up being another white elephant route like 120/122. Introducing new "Intra-town" trunk routes on Bukit Merah/ Queenstown might not be feasible since these 2 are low population density estates unlike Bedok or Tampines... Plus I think the left-turn into Redhill Close from Jln Bukit Merah may be abit too tight for 12m buses.</p>

              the nearest bus stop to CCK MRT is at Teck Whye Ave. 307M will
              bring about more convenience to the students of these schools as it
              saves walking time to the bus stop at Teck Whye Ave. 307's route
              will not be affected during AM Peak as 307M will operate
              concurrently.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>While I was schooling in that area quite a few years back, I usually rely on svcs 190, 975 and 985 to bring me from Lot 1 to that area. Never have to wait more than a few minutes and it's a easy walk into the various schools that you've mentioned from the CCK Polyclinic and/or Blk 6 stops along Teck Whye Ave, so I think svc 307M is redundant in this manner. Just my few cents on this suggestion, regards.</p>

              <p>Why amend svc 197 route only to get svc 135 to cover its route? Might as well simply extend svc 135 to UEC Terminal?</p>
              <p>To divert svc 43 along Bedok South Ave 1 and Bedok South Rd -- but there's already svc 47, so not sure what this would achieve?</p>
