              <p>I don't think that svc 119 looping at Kovan is redundant. After
              all, there's the shopping center Heartland Mall Kovan, a hawker
              center and market at Kovan so it is still a key activity node. If
              not for the fact that Hougang South Bus Interchange has been closed
              in favor of consolidation at Hougang Central, svc 119 could very
              well terminate there as well. Now no more bus interchange there so
              svc 119 continues as a loop service back to Punggol. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, 119 potential could be further enhanced if it is extended to eunos or st michaels. It will still pass by kovan mrt (thus serve the mall and hawker centre and the market and shops) en-route to either eunos or st Michaels. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Basically what i m trying to say to u is that u shldnt be too fixated on ur hypothesis of LTA route planning, theres no right or wrong. Just because the proposed sv 82M start from an outlying int which is not controlled by the PTO (in this case GAS) doesnt make it a bad suggestion in terms of the routing. I m sure there r ways to counter the operational problems if u r talking abt the issues of GAS operating sv out of sbst controlled hg int. In any case TTS also operate minority of sv at clementi though it does not control clementi int so i actually dont see too much of a problem as well. U can just treat sv 82M as a separate sv from sv 82 if the parent/supplementary sv issue is bothering u. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi mr Tranzort08, no? Not just because of PTO issue? Also because of difference between the principal 82 originating from different interchange thereby causing confusion to general public, especially elderly? As of current, no service in Singapore with an M variant operating from different interchanges. If you want treat as separate service, no problem of course but don't tag to the number 82M. Just make it 114. </p>
              <p>Essentially there are actually 2 issues. 1 is M variant operating from different interchange from principal bus no. 2 is M variant operating from different bus interchange which is not from their same service provider. Yes TTS operate minority of services at Clementi interchange. However, they do not have an M variant departing from different interchanges (regardless of whether it is controlled by them or not). Feel free to check it out. What I mean is if 82 (Go Ahead) starts from hougang int (sbs transit), then 82M by all means can start from hougang int.</p>
              <p>You just cannot expect service 145 to start from buona vista terminal and then service 145M to alleviate the loading and start from Bukit merah int? Or service 2 to start from new bridge road terminal and then service 2M to start from eunos interchange to assist service 2? In this case, it will be too chaotic to the public. May as well name as 2 different service no. If people are not going to follow LTA way of naming a variant A/B/M to start from either same interchange or part of its parent route with exception of 1 bus-stop for looping, then you can start renumbering 965 as 969M and 972 as 190M. Cannot expect the chaos if it were to happen then.</p>
              <p>But as you can see, the demand as of today does not really warrant 82M at this moment. If you also need M for service like 82, you will need many services to have M variant already. In any way, you are entitled to your opinion too. No offence? Happy holiday! Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes 82/107 is more logical. 113/119 too. 119
              obviously turns one round around Kovan mrt as LTA purposely does
              not want it to duplicate 136 excessively so make it loop and return
              back. 119 seems like unfinished business. Extend much further to
              eunos or st michaels seems too long to LTA and now just loops
              around hougang st 21 makes it a bit redundant. Like in no man's
              land. I mean they just find nearest looping point for 119 to
              accommodate it after serving rivervale drive and hougang and upper
              serangoon. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Duplication with 136 is not the reason why 119 loops at Hougang st 11. It is to connect to the mall/hawker center and amenities there. Moreover, st 11 has many BTOs and condos that get a direct link to Hougang and Sengkang. <strong><em><span style="color: #888888;">119 route is unique and good, the only thing is it doesn't need DDs</span></em></strong> as the loading is SD loading. I don't see a reason why 119 should be extended unless it is to merge/rationalize with another service to save resources.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I was thinking of 119 going the current way till kovan mrt then extend along upper Serangoon road all the way till PIE then come out Jalan eunos to eunos mrt. Like that, it will help further in diverting people from NEL and most importantly take up more loading. Moreover, it also helps and speeds up travel a bit if northeast people use it as a medium fast gateway to the east (eunos mrt) without duplicating hougang ave 3-eunos link method to go eunos. </p>
              <p>I understand you are fine with 119 looping at kovan area and I am good with it too if you find this extension not very appropriate. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Tranzort08, no? Not just because of PTO issue? Also
              because of difference between the principal 82 originating from
              different interchange thereby causing confusion to general public,
              especially elderly? As of current, no service in Singapore with an
              M variant operating from different interchanges. If you want treat
              as separate service, no problem of course but don't tag to the
              number 82M. Just make it 114. </p>
              <p>Essentially there are actually 2 issues. 1 is M variant
              operating from different interchange from principal bus no. 2 is M
              variant operating from different bus interchange which is not from
              their same service provider. Yes TTS operate minority of services
              at Clementi interchange. However, they do not have an M variant
              departing from different interchanges (regardless of whether it is
              controlled by them or not). Feel free to check it out. What I mean
              is if 82 (Go Ahead) starts from hougang int (sbs transit), then 82M
              by all means can start from hougang int.</p>
              <p>You just cannot expect service 145 to start from buona vista
              terminal and then service 145M to alleviate the loading and start
              from Bukit merah int? Or service 2 to start from new bridge road
              terminal and then service 2M to start from eunos interchange to
              assist service 2? In this case, it will be too chaotic to the
              public. May as well name as 2 different service no. If people are
              not going to follow LTA way of naming a variant A/B/M to start from
              either same interchange or part of its parent route with exception
              of 1 bus-stop for looping, then you can start renumbering 965 as
              969M and 972 as 190M. Cannot expect the chaos if it were to happen
              then.</p>
              <p>But as you can see, the demand as of today does not really
              warrant 82M at this moment. If you also need M for service like 82,
              you will need many services to have M variant already. In any way,
              you are entitled to your opinion too. No offence? Happy holiday!
              Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hmm i get what u mean here, but i think it is essentially up to LTA to decide the route numbering conventions. In hong kong, KMB would indeed probably call sv 972 as 190M and 965 as 969M. Yes, it will cause some confusion to the singapore public initially but then again i think we can be open to such naming conventions. Think abt sv 240M, ppl taking the bus towards boon lay might be confused over whether it will enter int or loop outside boon lat mrt. Same for 979M.  </p>
