              <p>Some suggested DTL3 amendments (again):</p>
              <p>========================</p>
              <p><strong>Service 65</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(From Tampines)</em></li>

              <li><span style="color: #993300;">Paya Lebar Rd</span></li>
              <li>Circuit Link</li>
              <li><em>(Towards Harbourfront)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Rationale: To improve connections between Ubi / MacPherson and
              Kg Ubi industrial estate, as well as with Kaki Bukit. Lost links on
              east side covered by 21/22, and west side by 66. Plenty of
              transfers en route as well. Only major miff is the lost direct link
              to Orchard area, which is not backed up by DTL3.</p>
              <p>========================</p>
              <p><strong>Service 66</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(From Jurong East)</em></li>

              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Bedok North Rd</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Chai Chee St</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Chai Chee Rd</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">New Upp Changi Rd</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">Bedok North Ave 1</span></li>
              <li>Bedok Int</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Rationale: To reduce travel distance on 66 and link Chai Chee
              with DTL3. For the lost stretch near Bedok Reservoir, links towards
              Bedok are provided by 228, links to western Bedok Reservoir Rd and
              Ubi Ave 2 are provided by 22. Other links further west up to Jln
              Besar are provided by (modified) 65.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Service 66 (alternative)</strong></p>

              <li><span style="color: #ff6600;">BNDEP</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Rationale: To connect Bedok North Ave 4 area with DTL3. Link
              alternatives are as above. Though admittedly less desirable than
              the above.</p>
              <p>========================</p>
              <p><strong>Service 228</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(From Bedok)</em></li>
              <li>Bedok Reservoir Rd</li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff99cc;">Jln Tenaga</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff99cc;">Kaki Bukit Ave 1</span></li>

              <li>Bedok Reservoir Rd</li>
              <li><em>(Towards Bedok)</em><br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Rationale: With 66 no longer lining its route, 228 would gain
              greater prominence and importance. Granted that some areas are
              already close to Bedok North MRT, but it is still relatively
              inconvenient for those staying near Telok Kurau Pri to cross over
              and squeeze on board 60 towards the MRT, so this adds another
              option. Also a loop across doesn't increase as much distance
              compared to that lost by 66.</p>
              <p>[However ... I'm not sure if the eastbound bus stop is directly
              linked? It seems that it's the next one down the road that is.
              Doing the loop the other way would cause 228 to skip the bus stop
              at Blk 119 though.]</p>
              <p>========================</p>
              <p><strong>Service 18</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(From Bedok)</em></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Bedok North Ave 1</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Bedok North St 3</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Bedok North Ave 2</span></li>
              <li>Bedok North Rd</li>
              <li>Bedok North Ave 3</li>
              <li><em>(Towards Tampines)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Rationale: To connect the hard-to-reach areas of Bedok North
              with DTL3. Though this may result in a serious loading imbalance,
              so probably short-trips could be deployed.</p>
              <p>The lost bus stops at Bedok North Ave 2 could be covered by
              amending 69 or 168, seeing that there are already many services
              along Bedok North Ave 3.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I'm afraid 228 will have super heavy loading if 66 is amended like this, as 228 will become the only service for that sector of Bedok Reservoir Rd to Bedok Reservoir DTL (going by your first 66 route) and Bedok EWL. It will probably need DDs.</p>
              <p>But other than that, looks fine.</p>

              <p>Some comments:</p>
              <p>There is no direct two-way road connection between Bedok North
                          MRT and Chai Chee (specifically you cannot go from Bedok North Rd
                          to Chai Chee St) so it would be challenging to link these two areas
                          up by bus. What might work best could be a modified svc 60 that
                          skips Bedok Int and loops around Chai Chee instead? (in b4 anyone
                          starts a lecture on the history of svc 60, this is just an
                          convenient example because svc 60 comes down Bedok North Rd and
                          terminates at Bedok Int)</p>
              <p>Also since svc 66 is under TT now, it's not a good idea to
                          terminate it at BNDEP ...</p>
              <p>The proposed new looping point for svc 228, I think it's best
                          done counter-clockwise (Jln Damai, Kaki Bukit Ave 1, Jln Tenaga) so
                          as to directly serve the MRT station (no great loss about the Blk
                          121 (not 119) stop though, people there can do an easy 5 mins walk
                          to the train station ...)</p>
              <p>I think some of your other suggestions can be made with a single
                          route, svc 66, as follows:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Svc 66 from
                          Jurong East:</strong></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>... Circuit Link</li>
              <li><span style="color: #800000;">Paya Lebar Rd, Ubi Ave
                          3</span></li>
              <li>Kaki Bukit Ave 2, Rd 3 (new bus stops here), Ave 1 (x-fer to
                          Kaki Bukit MRT)<br></li>
              <li>Bedok Reservior Rd</li>
              <li>Bedok North Rd (x-fer to Bedok North MRT)<br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #339966;">Bedok North Ave 1, St 3, Ave 2,
                          St 1</span>, Bedok Int<br></li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Dunno about that. Amending 66 for all of the above seems too drastic a change and would make the route much longer than the current 33+ km (in one direction), and the demand along the current stretch of route is not negligible. 65 is shorter and has the safety of backups (22, 66).</p>
              <p>I'll still stick to my suggestion for 65 (along Ubi Ave 3) and 18 (in Bedok North). If need be, either 60 or 87 can do Chai Chee (whichever has lower peak-hour loading; I'm not familiar with these two).</p>
              <p>I may have a better solution for <strong>228</strong> -- though this could result in it being converted to a trunk:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(from Bedok)</em></li>
              <li>Bedok Reservoir Rd</li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Jln Damai</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Kaki Bukit Ave 1   [<span style="color: #3366ff;">DT28 Kaki Bukit</span>]</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">KB Rd 3</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">KB Ave 2</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Eunos Link</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">KB Ave 1</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Jln Tenaga   [<span style="color: #3366ff;">DT28 Kaki Bukit</span>]</span></li>
              <li>Bedok Reservoir Rd</li>
              <li><em>(to Bedok)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The additional loop now also takes care of part of the Kaki Bukit industrial area. (There can be an off-peak variant where the service skips that area and head towards Jln Tenaga directly.) The Jln Tenaga bus stop near Blk 658 will be reinstated and bridged to the station exit.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Dunno about that. Amending 66 for all of the above seems too
              drastic a change and would make the route much longer than the
              current 33+ km (in one direction), and the demand along the current
              stretch of route is not negligible. 65 is shorter and has the
              safety of backups (22, 66).</p>
              <p>I'll still stick to my suggestion for 65 (along Ubi Ave 3) and
              18 (in Bedok North). If need be, either 60 or 87 can do Chai Chee
              (whichever has lower peak-hour loading; I'm not familiar with these
              two).</p>
              <p>I may have a better solution for <strong>228</strong> -- though
              this could result in it being converted to a trunk:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(from Bedok)</em></li>
              <li>Bedok Reservoir Rd</li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Jln Damai</span></li>

              <li><span style="color: #008000;">KB Rd 3</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">KB Ave 2</span></li>

              <li><span style="color: #008000;">KB Ave 1</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Jln Tenaga  
              [<span style="color: #3366ff;">DT28 Kaki Bukit</span>]</span></li>
              <li>Bedok Reservoir Rd</li>
              <li><em>(to Bedok)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The additional loop now also takes care of part of the Kaki
              Bukit industrial area. (There can be an off-peak variant where the
              service skips that area and head towards Jln Tenaga directly.) The
              Jln Tenaga bus stop near Blk 658 will be reinstated and bridged to
              the station exit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following the above, should there be an imbalance of loading at
              the west end, then 66 can be amended away to give 228 (or whatever
              its new number is) full reign of the stretch of Bedok Reservoir Rd
              such that it would be a heavy loading service overall (with DDs
              ceded over). The new 66 would also speed up the journey between
              MacPherson / Ubi and Bedok.</p>

              <p>It may sound surprising, but my proposed change to svc 66 is not significantly longer than the existing route (&lt;100m difference). Svcs 22, 65 and 66 are all trunk routes that duplicate each other through Bedok Reservior &lt;--&gt; Ubi, also svcs 22 and 65 are the high-ridership routes so I think it would be better to just amend 66 instead of changing svc 65 as well. That way svc 18 also can be left alone ...</p>
              <p>Both svcs 60 and 87 have high ridership to/fro Bedok during the peak hours so personally I would not change either service. If there really is a need for a route to connect Chai Chee to a DTL3 station this would arguably have to be a new route instead of an amendment of an existing route ...</p>

              <p>Nice ideas for 250 and 259. Tuas area does need more connectivity for those working at the area.</p>
              <p>For 182, would it be too short, so is the cut rly necessary? I think extending 256 is a terrific idea, coz i heard 256 now has vry low loading right?</p>
              <p>For 254 and 192 idk abt it, but i feel 192 shld not change the tuas ter to loop at tuas area.</p>
              <p>Btw, did any press release suggest or hint that the new tuas ter will host cross-border buses, given that it is so close to tuas CIQ?</p>

              <p>Valid point. Too many buses plying Lor 4. </p>
              <p>The best would be to divert 28 to ply Lor 6 given that there is alternative of 153 &amp; 155 till Upper Serangoon Road junction.</p>
              <p>28 given that has DD fleet will also be able to alleviate load well along Lor 6.</p>

                  crowded at the Lor 6 blk 27 bus stop as it also serves the Kim Keat
                  Ave area and probably the upcoming 36 story Toa Payoh Apex housing
                  project across the road. Appreciate the respective authorites look
                  into it or who could we forward this request to. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Would like to see this too, with 129 plying alongside between Toa Payoh - Bartley, some of 28's loading would be lost anyway. If need be, can further amend 57 to serve Lor 7. There are plenty of transfer services up to Lor 6 / Braddell Rd so it should not be too great a concern.</p>
              <p>Perhaps should suggest to LTA.</p>

              <p>Doubt that will happen because that will mean route extension or major diversion for these services. </p>
              <p>Caldecott may see new service when TSL opens. Currently usage with CCL is limited at Caldecott and has a feeder and trunk service meeting demands well. 141 still has huge capacity as its loading continues to be mediocre and 235 covers most of TPY town to Caldecott (not covered by 141). </p>

              <p>Pretty sure someone must have suggested this before, why not just let 53M terminate at Kovan MRT/Kovan City (the former bus terminal)? And then at that point, might as well rename svc 53M to something like svc 114 ...</p>
              <p>Just an idea: While this is unlikely to happen given LTA's penchance for creating many many short routes, <strong><em>operationally</em></strong>, would it be a good idea to merge svcs 53M with 116 and then get the merged service to loop at Kovan MRT/Kovan City?</p>

              <p>I can see how the two routes will be similar but I don't think there's too much similarities. On one end, the Hougang-Punggol sector is quite different, whereas on the other end, 82 does Kovan MRT before going to Lor Ah Soo, whereas 62 goes straight there. And of course 82 goes to Serangoon MRT whereas 62 goes to Geylang Rd. So they would probably be as similar as svcs 969 is to 965. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Have seen many proposals for the simplification of route
              redundancy in the Kovan / Hougang area (e.g., 82+107, 113+119,
              62+113, etc...) but haven't recalled anyone suggesting this:</p>
              <p>Merge <strong>82</strong> with <strong>113</strong>.</p>
              <p>Essentially let 82 <span style="color: #008080;">turn in towards
              Hougang St 21, Hougang Ave 1 and Lorong Ah Soo, then continue to
              loop around Serangoon Central</span>. Also <span style="color: #008080;">skips Hougang Ave 10 (Blk 421/414 bus stops) in
              favour of Ave 6 and Ave 8</span>. Three pairs of bus stops are
              skipped.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>(In short: Punggol Int -&gt; Punggol Field -&gt; Punggol Rd
              -&gt; Hougang Ave 10 -&gt; Ave 8 -&gt; (113 route) -&gt; Lor Ah Soo
              -&gt; loop around Serangoon Ctrl)</em><br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Then <span style="color: #ff6600;">113 can be withdrawn</span>.
              <span style="color: #993366;">62 has to be extended to serve the
              bus stop at Hougang St 11</span>, as it is the only service that
              can still do so (passengers heading back towards Kovan / Lorong Ah
              Soo have to walk to board at the Blk 160 bus stop; an expensive
              extension would be to build a bus stop opposite and let 82 serve it
              towards Punggol).</p>
              <p>If need be, operate short-trips (82M?) between Hougang Int and
              Serangoon Ctrl during peak hours to replace 53M. Can use DDs.</p>
              <p>===================================</p>

              <p>Good suggestion to have 82 merge with 113 and remove 113 &amp; 53M. 82 can play with majority DD fleet.</p>
              <p>HG ST 11 bus stop can be removed. sv 62 cannot really go and ply there, moreover bus stop is within 200m of bus stops along Lor Ah soo and Upper Paya Lebar. The reason there is a bus stop there in the first place because they needed a place for 113 to loop and decided to make it loop at st 11. </p>
              <p>I am not sure how dupdup finds proposed 82 and 62 similar when they have completely different routes from Hougang. In the Lor Ah Soo - Hougang sector, you still have 62 and 113 with similar route and proposed 82 will replace 113. </p>
