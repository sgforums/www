              <p>Great suggestion! Actually all along I feel that there is a need to connnect Woodlands West residents to Marsiling MRT to lighten the load from Woodlands Regional Int.</p>
              <p>Since the commercial areas at Woodlands Centre Rd is going to be demolished soon, I have suggested these 3 route amendments to the current Woodlands Intratown services (only the west loop portion is shown). These current routes will instead be renamed as sv 911T, 912T &amp; 913T respectively (T=Woodlands <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>T</strong></span>rain Checkpoint) running at 20mins-30mins interval to maintain the connection to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. </p>

              <p>Nice route. Especially since it can replace 43M and 53M.</p>
              <p>HGDEP is probably the best terminus if SBST allows it to terminate there. An alternative would be Eunos (covering some areas in Ubi/Kaki Bukit without services along the way), but the route would be too long.</p>

              <p>To add on to what orange28 has said, the Woodlands Train Checkpoint bus stops actually functions as a mini-interchange for pax from these intratowns to transfer to 170, 178, 856, 903 and other intratowns, without going through Woodlands MRT/Int.</p>
              <p>Having said so, demand to WTC is probably much smaller than Marsiling MRT (I'm not sure about the loading patterns there so won't comment further). Just that 20-30 mins interval for the 'T' services may be too long I guess? As for demand from Woodlands MRT to Woodlands Train Checkpoint, there's still 856/903/178 and I think these intratowns should not be the ones responsible for this link.</p>

              <p>Great suggestion! Actually all along I feel that there is a need
              to connnect Woodlands West residents to Marsiling MRT to lighten
              the load from Woodlands Regional Int.</p>
              <p>Since the commercial areas at Woodlands Centre Rd is going to be
              demolished soon, I have suggested these 3 route amendments to the
              current Woodlands Intratown services (only the west loop portion is
              shown). These current routes will instead be renamed as sv 911T,
              912T &amp; 913T respectively (T=Woodlands <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>T</strong></span>rain
              Checkpoint) running at 20mins-30mins interval to maintain the
              connection to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. </p>

              <p>It is precisely because the residents have to walk quite far to marsiling mrt that i suggested amending these 3 routes to marsiling mrt. Personally i feel this connection is important as it also provides a sheltered route to the mrt station and also benefits those with mobility issues. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Students of marsiling and woodlands secondary can also transfer at marsiling mrt instead of WRI.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway there will be a huge bto project beside marsiling secondary school so when it is ready the amended services will connect this bto to marsiling mrt as well. </p>

              <p>Yes 43M that was the reason I had recommended 114 be routed that way. 3004X extended it to HGDEP which is not likely as HGDEP does not house revenue services, otherwise we would have had SWT to Serangoon from there long time ago + have 115 start from there.</p>
