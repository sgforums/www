              <p>That would put a lot of pressure on 172 as there are 3 new HDBs that svc 308 covers along ave 1 </p>
              <p>(1) Keat Hong Axis</p>
              <p>(2) Keat Hong Quad </p>
              <p>(3) Keat Hong Mirage (LRT alternative)</p>
              <p>Considering all these have just TOP, the occupancy is still low, but soon 308 should get heavy loading.</p>
              <p>172 already operating at 05-07 min frequency. If 308 not there, 172 need to be 20 buses full fleet high capacity and that would make it imbalance for the CCK - Boon Lay side as the loading may not be heavy. Then will need to introduce 172A (just like 975A)</p>
              <p>IMO, AM is not a problem on ave 3 as people take 300 to MRT + have 975/975A. PM is more of an issue where people still prefer taking 300 but will either do a roundabout or have to walk some more. </p>
              <p>With Keat Hong region growing, I expect a trunk to BPJ via ave 3/ave 1 just like 983 and this should then cover ave 3 - CCK MRT as well.</p>

              <p>Why blue plate 170A? I think the 170X is quite a good suffix. Having an A is like a short working trip, but the current 170X is does not follow the parent service in the JB sector, may cause confusion. Note that the X on the EDS is like a superscript, not rly like the same font, so it suggest smth different abt the suffix as compared to others</p>

              <p>I rmb someone suggest to renumber 170X to 160M, but in that case most ppl would need to hav transfer, coz most ppl travel frm kranji to larkin, and uses 170X generally. </p>
              <p>Btw i toyed with the idea to reroute 170 to wond ard city area first b4 going to the highway coz DTL duplication makes the current route less effective</p>

              <p>Came up with this (definitely ridiculous) idea in a whim.</p>
              <p><strong>Service 148:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bedok -- Kaki Bukit Ind Estate (loop)</span></p>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Service 18</strong> modification:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Bedok Int</li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Bedok North Ave 1 / St 3 / Ave 2</span><br></li>
              <li>Bedok North Rd</li>
              <li>(usual route to TAM Concourse; may include further DTL3 amendments in Tampines)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Service 228</strong> minor modification:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Bedok Int</li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Bedok North St 1 / Ave 2 / Rd</span></li>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, 18 mostly replaces 225G, and 148 mostly replaces 225W. Then 225G/W can be withdrawn and its DDs split between 18 and 148. 228 would replace 18's lost section along Ave 2.</p>
              <p>Only problem is the unknown expected loading in Bedok North. Currently it is almost unidirectional towards Bedok Central (which explains 225's high loading). Even with DTL3 opening, loading transfer may not even be at 30%. Frequency would also be an issue.</p>

              <p>81: A big no. Go unneccessary route for what? A route has been upgraded since 1993 to air-con double deckers, more capacity. In 2003, it was shortened to Serangoon as the demand is not that great between Serangoon and Outram Park after the opening of NEL. The unneccessary route is compensated by NEL and 147. Perhaps there are people still taking 81 from Serangoon, Kovan to Tampines, Pasir Ris during peak hour. A lot of winding take place at Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>292: A big no. There is a heavy loading on 292 during peak hour. There is only two primary schools to support 292 - Tampines and Angsana. People are more aware of 292 and will never ever bother to change it. But the only problem is 61, because of the demolition of Tanglin Halt flats in 2017/18 (after SERS, most of them moved elsewhere; remaining waited for Dawson Estate).</p>
              <p>The only alternative is to divert 46, via Tampines Ave 7, Ave 9, St 45, St 34, St 32 to reduce congestion on service 291/293, and allow the reduction of extra buses to bring the frequencies to lower levels. No one will eventually take 46 from the interchange as there is a lot of people using 69, 72 or 291W's berth. This is the "most redundant route ever". They feel that the route is even, not existent.</p>
              <p>39 amended to new interchange is not a problem. Its like having my 2nd Facebook is not an eyesore.</p>

              Currently it is almost unidirectional towards Bedok Central (which

              <p>81: A big no. Go unneccessary route for what? A route has been
                  upgraded since 1993 to air-con double deckers, more capacity. In
                  2003, it was shortened to Serangoon as the demand is not that great
                  between Serangoon and Outram Park after the opening of NEL. The
                  unneccessary route is compensated by NEL and 147. Perhaps there are
                  people still taking 81 from Serangoon, Kovan to Tampines, Pasir Ris
                  during peak hour. A lot of winding take place at Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>292: A big no. There is a heavy loading on 292 during peak hour.
                  There is only two primary schools to support 292 - Tampines and
                  Angsana. People are more aware of 292 and will never ever bother to
                  change it. But the only problem is 61, because of the demolition of
                  Tanglin Halt flats in 2017/18 (after SERS, most of them moved
                  elsewhere; remaining waited for Dawson Estate).</p>
              <p>The only alternative is to divert 46, via Tampines Ave 7, Ave 9,
                  St 45, St 34, St 32 to reduce congestion on service 291/293, and
                  allow the reduction of extra buses to bring the frequencies to
                  lower levels. No one will eventually take 46 from the interchange
                  as there is a lot of people using 69, 72 or 291W's berth. This is
                  the "most redundant route ever". They feel that the route is even,
                  not existent.</p>
              <p>39 amended to new interchange is not a problem. Its like having
                  my 2nd Facebook is not an eyesore.</p>
              <p>18 amended to new interchange is a problem, they added a new bus
                  stop too. But they can also start at the new interchange.</p>
              <p>Possibilities:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Split 51 into two because of the longest route.<br> 51: Hougang Central - Labrador Park?<br> 351: Jurong East - New Bridge Road?</li>
              <li>Split 66 into two because of the enlargement problems.<br> 66: Bedok - Newton Circus (Loop)<br> 466: Jurong East - Queen Street</li>
              </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Why would I even want to care about 51, 61, 66 and NEL rationalisation when I'm talking about route changes in Tampines here?? Thanks for your irrelevant input.</p>

                  service. 28 DD downroutes do not serve the 2 stops covered by 29
                  only.</p>

              <p>28M will not work out because there would only be a one-way connection to/from MRT for either side, especially St 32. Unless you make the loop do the other direction as well (or loop at St 33 instead), and in that case it would be as good as introducing a new feeder service.</p>
              <p>29M seems alright.</p>
              <p>Is it really not possible to amend any other nearby services? Suppose 4 gets a few more DDs, can it manage the diversion into St 32/34?</p>

              <p>46 extension can cover ave 7, st 32/34/45 and back to ave 7 via ave 9. This will take care of both the proposals you are making. </p>
