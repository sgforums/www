              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>As a matter of fact, I think DDs on the existing 82 route would
                                              make more sense than DDs on the existing 83 route so yes, I would
                                              actually think that such a swop would be a good idea, in terms of
                                              maximizing efficiency of bus capacities.</p>
              <p>If you were to mention about the "third town" argument, I can
                                              argue that svc 117 is best suited to be a Yishun - SAP - Punggol
                                              service, so there's that.</p>
              <p>I can see where you are coming at with the svc 85 example though
                                              I want to point out a big difference, and that is that the Sengkang
                                              West portion of svc 85 is in the middle of its route, whereas the
                                              Sembawang portion of svc 117 is at one end of its route. So getting
                                              svc 85 to serve Sengkang West is a good idea because it "sort of"
                                              has to pass by around that area anyway, whereas getting svc 117 to
                                              serve Sembawang is in a sense extending that route northwards from
                                              Yishun. Here I argue that there are other services that can take
                                              the place of this northwards extension to Sembawang so as to
                                              maximise bus capacity efficiencies.</p>
              <p>If people are going to SAP they will be able to get there,
                                              whether or not there is a direct bus service. Doesn't mean that if
                                              there is no direct bus means that they will not be able to travel
                                              to SAP, they can always transfer at a suitable transfer point (e.g.
                                              Yishun MRT). I enjoyed this discussion so far, and hope you can
                                              understand my perspectives. Regards.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, if you think by swapping 82 and 83 routes (point of swapping is at Punggol road in my earlier message) is a more sensible suggestion, then I really got nothing to say. With due respects to you, I am just glad you are not a route planner. You are just giving suggestions only and shall stay as that. Please do not take offence.</p>
              <p>Why? If you really swopped 82 and 83, 82 just serves a bit of Punggol and straight onto Punggol road and turns right into compasvale street and then to Sengkang east road to Sengkang int. Haha. Then the whole of Punggol central/east/field lost their direct link to Sengkang int. Then you will see the loading of the revised 82 drop tremendously since Punggol whole east area is skipped. The revised 82 merely benefits compassvale street area and the route is too short. What sort of logic is this???</p>
              <p>The correct thing to maximize efficiency is just to use 82 DD and 83 SD. Not to swop a portion of route to maximize efficiency. The most important feature of introducing bus service is to connect people to destination. Feed people to the location by bus routes and not to feed bus routes to capacity of buses which indirectly causes people to transfer. </p>
              <p>There are still many different services to illustrate my example. However, the correct way to really uphold this is to change the type of bus to suit the route. And definitely NOT the other way round.</p>
              <p>As for the third town argument, hey come on. SAP is not a HDB town. </p>
              <p>Then back to the argument of extension. Yishun interchange already has a link to SAP through 103. When the authorities plan route, they also don't plan it in such a way that the same interchange has 2 direct links to SAP. Another town should get it. 117 from sembawang or another service from Woodlands will get it. This is to maximize coverage. So did you consider this? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Maybe I wasn't too seriously thinking when I replied earlier, you 
                  make some valid points, though I offer some of my thoughts below.</p>
              <p>Perhaps
                   you're the Punggol expert so do you know where the bulk of 83 loading 
                  is? Usually when I see the svc 83 DDs from the TPE bus stop the upper 
                  decks are usually barely occupied in both directions so I am under the 
                  impression that the main bulk of 83 loading stays within Punggol itself ...
                   There would still be other links to Punggol from Sengkang such as svcs 
                  43, 50, 85, 119, etc.</p>
              <p>You can say that the "whole of Punggol central/east/field lost their
              direct link to Sengkang int" but then the "whole of Punggol central/east/field" would <em>also</em> gain a direct access to more places along Punggol Rd, as well as facilities in Hougang/Serangoon, so it's also not a lose-lose scenairo as you'd imagine.</p>
              <p>Yes the shortened svc 82 would be so 
                  short it would almost be useless. Of course then you might look at for 
                  instance, cancelling svc 82 altogether and getting svc 965 to cover the 
                  deleted sector on Compassvale St if you <em>really</em> need coverage there (as an example!) ...</p>
              <p>Yes
                   if svc 103 takes the route of svc 117 to Sembawang then Yishun Int 
                  (117) and Sembawang Int (103) each gets one service to SAP. No offence, 
                  but if you do look/think through my suggestions clearly  you'll see that
                   they are not all silly points that should be disregarded.</p>
              <p>I'm not
                   sure if there are any more relevant discussion points that we can talk 
                  about, perhaps as an endnote, I want to know what you think if the situation was that svc 103 was extended first to Yishun and Sembawang (via Yishun Ave 
                  11, Ave 2, Canberra Link) <em>and then</em> svc 117 to Yishun (via Yishun 
                  Ave 1) was only introduced later? Would you then argue that svc 117 
                  should be extended to Sembawang and svc 103 cut back to Yishun? Would 
                  like to get at least a simple yes/no reply on this, instead of a "this 
                  obviously will not happen so it's not worth discussing" comment.</p>
              <p>Cheers and regards.</p>

              <p>Maybe I wasn't too seriously thinking when I replied earlier,
                      you make some valid points, though I offer some of my thoughts
                      below.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you're the Punggol expert so do you know where the bulk
                      of 83 loading is? Usually when I see the svc 83 DDs from the TPE
                      bus stop the upper decks are usually barely occupied in both
                      directions so I am under the impression that the main bulk of 83
                      loading stays within Punggol itself ... There would still be other
                      links to Punggol from Sengkang such as svcs 43, 50, 85, 119,
                      etc.</p>
              <p>You can say that the "whole of Punggol central/east/field lost
                      their direct link to Sengkang int" but then the "whole of Punggol
                      central/east/field" would <em>also</em> gain a direct access to
                      more places along Punggol Rd, as well as facilities in
                      Hougang/Serangoon, so it's also not a lose-lose scenairo as you'd
                      imagine.</p>
              <p>Yes the shortened svc 82 would be so short it would almost be
                      useless. Of course then you might look at for instance, cancelling
                      svc 82 altogether and getting svc 965 to cover the deleted sector
                      on Compassvale St if you <em>really</em> need coverage there (as an
                      example!) ...</p>
              <p>Yes if svc 103 takes the route of svc 117 to Sembawang then
                      Yishun Int (117) and Sembawang Int (103) each gets one service to
                      SAP. No offence, but if you do look/think through my suggestions
                      clearly you'll see that they are not all silly points that should
                      be disregarded.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if there are any more relevant discussion points
                      that we can talk about, perhaps as an endnote, I want to know what
                      you think if the situation was that svc 103 was extended first to
                      Yishun and Sembawang (via Yishun Ave 11, Ave 2, Canberra Link)
                      <em>and then</em> svc 117 to Yishun (via Yishun Ave 1) was only
                      introduced later? Would you then argue that svc 117 should be
                      extended to Sembawang and svc 103 cut back to Yishun? Would like to
                      get at least a simple yes/no reply on this, instead of a "this
                      obviously will not happen so it's not worth discussing"
                      comment.</p>
              <p>Cheers and regards.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, where did you see the 83DDs? 83 did not stop at TPE bus stop as claimed.</p>
              <p>I am afraid 83 is more crucial to Punggol central/east/field people than hougang/Serangoon amenities. For Punggol rd, hougang and Serangoon, we can still tap on 62/136 along Punggol field/central. As you can see, when doing route planning, they also take into account the routes other services in same town bring the residents to. So by just doing swapping certain parts of routes, it will break certain connection deemed more necessary than others. </p>
              <p>I hold no grudges against you. So be don't mistaken. If 103 is first extended to sembawang, then 117 must be further extended to woodlands. It should not terminate at yishun as the loading can be further improved. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>To clarify, I meant to say "spotting the svc 83 DDs crossing TPE" i.e. as viewed from the bus stops at TPE, not necessarily the svc 83 DDs actually stopping at the TPE stops (it's easy to identify because that's the only DD service now that crosses from Sengkang to Punggol at that point).</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree cannot anyhow swop parts of routes, thus why I have thought about this before posting. As my judgement, swopping the northern terminus of svcs 103 and 117 would bring about the least impact to the current travelling patterns.</p>
              <p>Just as a thought experiment, since you seem quite keen on extending svc 117 northwards. What would you think about a southern extension of svc 117 instead? So instead of going into Punggol interchange svc 117 can continue on Punggol Central, then cross the TPE (using either Punggol Rd or Punggol East) and enter Sengkang and perhaps terminate at the extension interchange? Because by your arguments so far, this will also bring about increased loadings as well, no? Cheers and have a good day.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, if 117 is extended to Sengkang via Punggol rd, it duplicates function of 83 and also 965 (also comes from northern Singapore). If 117 is extended to Sengkang via Punggol central-continue to Punggol east, it duplicates 50 or 85 enroute to Sengkang int. Thus very difficult to find a resting place. No wonder 117 stops at sembawang at northern tip to make it slightly unique. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I thot 825 is good enuf? Unless 263 is going to complement it, which can be a good idea. But then the ridership would be very low and lentor mrt coming up, which means leeser ppl would even take it, let alone 825</p>

              <p>This is probably not going to happen:</p>
              <p>Instead of having a new separate service between BPJ and Dairy Farm, 920 gets extended there (and renumbered). This saves a space at BPJ Int and also links more of interior BPJ with Hillview MRT to benefit commuters during PM and off peak.</p>
              <p>Downside is the longer journey to BPJ Central though ... so an alternative would be to introduce a new BPJ - central/NE town trunk service plying 920 route in the BPJ stretch and then withdraw 920. But that's beside the point here :)</p>

              <p>This is probably not going to happen:</p>
              <p>Instead of having a new separate service between BPJ and Dairy
              Farm, 920 gets extended there (and renumbered). This saves a space
              at BPJ Int and also links more of interior BPJ with Hillview MRT to
              benefit commuters during PM and off peak.</p>
              <p>Downside is the longer journey to BPJ Central though ... so an
              alternative would be to introduce a new BPJ - central/NE town trunk
              service plying 920 route in the BPJ stretch and then withdraw 920.
              But that's beside the point here :)</p>

              <p>The route seems too specialized (specifically only for people travelling between the two ends, which there is currently not many), and would not pick up any crowds from the passing-by areas such as Mandai and Yio Chu Kang. It may not gain enough demand as a result.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Seveneighteightsix, looks good. Fit the three towns criteria of new TRUNK bus services launches lately. Bukit panjang-Punggol-sengkang. Will be a relatively fast service and be used often by people who needs to go to northwest fast. May still need transfer to another service on either ends to exact destination. Nonetheless, good. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Rationale: With 66 no longer lining its route, 228 would gain greater prominence and importance. Granted that some areas are already close to Bedok North MRT, but it is still relatively inconvenient for those staying near Telok Kurau Pri to cross over and squeeze on board 60 towards the MRT, so this adds another option. Also a loop across doesn't increase as much distance compared to that lost by 66.</p>
              <p>[However ... I'm not sure if the eastbound bus stop is directly linked? It seems that it's the next one down the road that is. Doing the loop the other way would cause 228 to skip the bus stop at Blk 119 though.]</p>

              <p>Feel that in time to come there can be a swap ... perhaps 101 or 103 gets extended to Bidadari, then 142 can take its place.</p>

              <p>Some comments:</p>
              <p>There is no direct two-way road connection between Bedok North MRT and Chai Chee (specifically you cannot go from Bedok North Rd to Chai Chee St) so it would be challenging to link these two areas up by bus. What might work best could be a modified svc 60 that skips Bedok Int and loops around Chai Chee instead? (in b4 anyone starts a lecture on the history of svc 60, this is just an convenient example because svc 60 comes down Bedok North Rd and terminates at Bedok Int)</p>
              <p>Also since svc 66 is under TT now, it's not a good idea to terminate it at BNDEP ...</p>
              <p>The proposed new looping point for svc 228, I think it's best done counter-clockwise (Jln Damai, Kaki Bukit Ave 1, Jln Tenaga) so as to directly serve the MRT station (no great loss about the Blk 121 (not 119) stop though, people there can do an easy 5 mins walk to the train station ...)</p>
              <p>I think some of your other suggestions can be made with a single route, svc 66, as follows:</p>
