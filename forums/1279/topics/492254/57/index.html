              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, yes precisely. 62 duplicates 2 and 12 to new bridge road. Thus it was cut back to loop at geylang lor 1 with the bus stop nearest kallang mrt at the stop along sims ave right immediately after geylang lor 1.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, 2 was also cut back to new bridge road terminal because it duplicates 147 and 196 (198 a section as well) from Jalan Bukit merah all the way until buona vista. 12 used to go to buona vista too and was cut back to new bridge road upon 32 introduction. That was in the heydays. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>62 was cut back from New Bridge Road to Geylang Lorong 1, unrelated to NEL but because it makes people go round the world where people do not want. They cut it short only at Geylang Lorong 1. But it make sense owing to the closure of Hougang South and relocation to Punggol. so there is no more direct CBD bus service from the terminus station of the EWL West (Tuas/Joo Koon) and NEL (Punggol) unlike Pasir Ris where we have 2,12,518.</p>

              <p>I like the idea of a bus service for Bedok North St 2.</p>
              <p>However, I foresee some difficulty for a bus to turn right from Bedok North Ave 3 into Bedok North St 2, because Bedok North Ave 3 often has heavy traffic in both directions. LTA can install traffic lights at the junction of Ave 3 and St 2, but the new traffic lights may exacerbate the traffic jam on Ave 3 (esp northbound).</p>

              <p>137 should be diverted via Bedok North Street 1 and Bedok North Avenue 1 instead of Bedok North Street 1, Bedok North Avenue 3 and New Upper Changi Road.</p>
              <p>This is to prevent duplication with 155 and to ensure optimum utilisation of bus services.</p>
              <p>298 should be diverted via Tampines Street 41, Tampines Avenue 9, Tampines Avenue 7, Tampines Central 7 andÂ Tampines Concourse.</p>
              <p>This is to prevent duplication with 129 and to ensure optimum utilisation of bus services.</p>
              <p>That is why they will start on 21 October 2017 as we need time to go through their bus services bit by bit to make sure it does not duplicate services that are already extended.</p>

              <p>62 was cut back from New Bridge Road to Geylang Lorong 1,
              unrelated to NEL but because it makes people go round the world
              where people do not want. They cut it short only at Geylang Lorong
              1. But it make sense owing to the closure of Hougang South and
              relocation to Punggol. so there is no more direct CBD bus service
              from the terminus station of the EWL West (Tuas/Joo Koon) and NEL
              (Punggol) unlike Pasir Ris where we have 2,12,518.</p>

              <p>Punggol used to have 82 going to the CBD but it was cut to Serangoon during the NEL rationalisation...</p>
              <p>The EWL used to end at Boon Lay, where 30, 174, 197 and 502 used to go to the CBD. 30 used to go to Shenton Way/Robinson Rd but was amended to bypass the CBD in the 1990s (with the bypassed portion covered by 10).</p>
              <p>197 used to serve Jurong East/West Ave 1 and terminated at Geylang Lor 1, but the western portion was shortened to Jurong East (with the deleted portion covered by 198) and the eastern portion extended to Bedok in the 1990s to cover the deleted 41.</p>
              <p>174 originally terminated in NTU, but it was amended to Boon Lay in the 1990s when NTU bus terminal closed down. (I still feel that NTU deserves its own bus terminal, like NUS Kent Ridge.)</p>
              <p>502 used to serve Boon Lay to Sengkang. The western portion was extended to Pioneer Rd North and later to Soon Lee Depot, while the eastern portion was amended from Sengkang to Suntec during the NEL rationalisation, later amended to a uni-directional service via Bayfront, and later amended to Shenton Way when ECP closed and MCE opened).Â </p>

                                  (as far as 966 from Woodlands/BPJ) to CBP</p>

              <p>- Enhances connectivity for Toa Payoh East (the part where 57

              <p>Some considerations:</p>
              <p>- For AMK side, can be amended to serve some of the new BTOs along Ave 1. Can even be partially merged with the rumoured service 71 if need be.</p>
              <p>- Can consider serving Bedok North Ave 4 area instead of Tanah Merah MRT (seeing that there is less need for it given DTL3)</p>
              <p>- Changi South Ave 3 to Xilin is closed for DTL3e works.</p>
              <p>- Route is somewhat long overall, and there may not be enough "express" elements to sway many commuters from CBP (if they still prefer existing premium services).</p>
              <p>Aside those, route is quite good. I like the links from AMK and Toa Payoh to Bishan MRT as well as Geylang Bahru MRT (on the PIE). Can serve as a good relief to some areas during NSL disruptions.</p>
              <p>================================</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">IMO a good alternative could be via Braddell Rd / Bartley Rd East directly to Bedok North Rd / Bedok Reservoir Rd / PIE / Simei Ave / Xilin Ave / CBP. Skips Toa Payoh and Bedok, but gives a much faster route to Bishan to allow for transfers.</span></p>

              <p>That's a shame then. Perhaps loop near BNDEP? Not sure whether extending to Simei or CBP would be helpful given the additional length.</p>
              <p>Using 149 because it still bears resemblance to 229. 1 can be reserved for a popular CBD--Punggol route. 164 is better utilized in either Clementi, Sengkang or central area. (P.S. no point fighting over a route numbering!)</p>

              <p>Not sure if this is viable but once Kampong Bahru Terminal opens, 122 can be amended to do College Rd (SGH) and Jalan Bukit Merah in its return direction, and Jalan Bukit Merah &gt; CTE &gt; Tiong Bahru Rd in its forward direction.</p>
              <p>So the amended route is something like this:</p>
              <p>Kampong Bahru Terminal</p>
              <p>Jalan Bukit Merah</p>
              <p>CTE</p>
              <p>Tiong Bahru Rd</p>
              <p>(Continues original route)</p>
              <p>Tiong Bahru Rd</p>
              <p>(Skips Outram Rd)</p>
              <p>College Rd (New stop opp Duke NUS building)</p>
              <p>Jalan Bukit Merah</p>
              <p>Kampong Bahru Terminal</p>
              <p>I know SGH already has shuttle bus services from Outram Park MRT, but this amendment provides new connection between Tiong Bahru MRT and Duke NUS (which the shuttle bus does not directly serve), and furthermore, Silat Rd residents will now have direct access to Tiong Bahru MRT/Market. I Â feel that this amendment is better than just extending 122 to Kampong Bahru from its currrent route and honestly, no one really takes 122 from Tiong Bahru MRT.</p>
