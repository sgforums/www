              <p>Now that we have 25 and 46, I believe we can safely remove 506's connection as very few people are paying express fares when other trunks can do the job.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I believe most CBP workers from Toa Payoh and beyond will still take MRT or 129-118, both of which are faster. 506 is basically too winding in Bedok.</p>

              <p>When I boarded 506 at Bedok North Avenue 3 in the morning I noticed a number of students heading towards the schools along Bedok Reservoir Road. So there is a demand between Bedok South / New Upper Changi Road and Bedok Reservoir Road (albeit during school hours). In the evening and on weekends there is also a demand between Bedok Reservoir Road and Upp East Coast Terminal due to NSmen taking IPPT/RT at Bedok Camp.</p>
              <p>Of course, one can argue that these passengers can take 46 to Bedok North Avenue 3 and transfer to 66 or 228 (and vice versa). This way, they can save the surcharge (30 cents for students, 60 cents for adults) for express bus. However, if you are in a hurry, having a direct bus is always better than waiting twice, and the additional cost doesn't really matter.</p>

              <p>After 155 was extended to Bedok, I often see empty 155 buses along Bedok North Street 1 and Bedok North Avenue 3. I am wondering if it will be better if 155 is amended to the following</p>
              <p>Towards Toa Payoh:<br>- Bedok Int<br>- Bedok North Ave 1 (Go straight at Block 546 instead of turning left)<br>- Bedok North Street 3<br>- Bedok North Ave 2<br>- Bedok North Street 1<br>and so on....</p>
              <p>Towards Bedok:<br>- Bedok North Street 1<br>- Bedok North Ave 2 (Go straight at Block 515 instead of turning right)<br>- Bedok North Street 3<br>- Bedok North Ave 1<br>- Bedok Int</p>
              <p>Benefits:<br>- relieve long queues for 225G/225W at Bedok Interchange<br>- direct access between Bedok North St 3 and Heartbeat@Bedok &amp; Bedok Post Office<br>- direct access between Bedok North St 3 and Bedok South Ave 1 &amp; Siglap</p>
              <p>If such an amendment is approved, 155 should switch to berth B1 or B2 in Bedok Interchange. If 155 uses the current berth, nobody from the 225G/225W queues would walk all the way to the 155 queue, practically bringing little or no benefits to the route amendment.</p>

Definitely there will be new bus routes hopefully linking residents to both Buangkok &amp; Serangoon (suggested by many enthusiasts in previous pages, and by virtue that Buangkok is the nearest MRT station) - or else the route planners are really kumgong to think 101 can serve every residents there, albeit taking a more winding route to Hougang.</span></div>

              there could had been more potential paxes using Buangkok MRT if you ask me. Nowadays, Sengkang and Hougang stns are packed but Buangkok is underutilised.
              New bus links would be good to reduce crowding on the LRT and to spread out the load.

              <p>I have suggested quite a few bus services here to improve bus links from Hougang/Sengkang towns to Buangkok MRT.</p>
              <p>Besides making it easier for residents in Hougang/Sengkang to use Buangkok MRT (and avoid the crowds at Hougang/Sengkang), these services also link residents around Buangkok MRT to other parts of Hougang/Sengkang, as the area is also under-served by bus services currently.</p>

              <p>I dont support that. First of all 39 has never been amended all this while as its main role is to directly bring northern people to the eastern area. Many people get to that area for some reasons, and by amending it they can no longer have easy access to there (like what u said), since people dont really like to waste time. Its not easy to make amendments there now since people have used this route for more than 10 years <span style="font-size: 16px;">already</span></p>
              <p>Then, resources and road conditions must be at the top of all priorities. I know its easy to convert SDs into DDs since there is probably a LOT of DDs available, however from what I know going through that road actually takes a long time, in addition to the extension of SLE it has to serve (although its probably just 2km), and as I said the people cannot afford to accept this since this has been the fastest and only link to PSR, not to mention that it has been here for a long time</p>
              <p>Though ironically I have a route which can help that</p>
              <p>man this is a throwback of when someone wanted to cut short 966...</p>
