              <p>Does 113 and 62 not do the same? In fact, they duplicate at one

                      of the route of 113 and that's why you think it is more direct from

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, from all the replies I give above, I did not even say that 113 is more direct from hougang bus interchange to hougang ave 1/Lorong ah soo at all. I merely stated that hougang bus interchange should have a bus service as hougang ave 1 is part of hougang bus interchange planning. This means you either misread or your opinion of me is already fixed before you start to reply. If you keep having tendency to misread, go and read countless times before attempting to argue. All I want to say is if ever 82 is amended, it should not be amended to be so similar to 62 at hougang area. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange, why do we need even to introduce 82M in the first
              place? They want to cut 113 and 53M and then amend 82 and introduce
              another 82M? Whatever for? Reduce bus services or reduce
              buses??? </p>
              <p>Take out 113 and introduce 82M to complicate matters? Remove 1
              and put in 1? What'a the point? Have you ever seen a parent service
              82 and a subsidiary service 82M start at different interchanges?
              Name me a bus service in Singapore having parent/subsidary bus
              service starting from different interchange. </p>
              <p>Do you know that 17A just because it cannot enter the bedok
              north depot and 17A needs to loop one round to be back onto its
              route and then treat as 17 on one direction and 17A on the return
              route? The point of bringing up 17A is to tell you that Go ahead
              bus services cannot originate from sbs transit depots. It also did
              not park at bedok bus interchange for that matter. Cheers.

              <p>Hi mr orange28, 53M starts from hougang ave 1 which is a portion of the route of its parent service 53. 53M does not start revenue service from hougang int because its parent service 53 did not start there.

              <p>Hi mr orange28, then what you suggest? Take out one service???
              If a service duplicates a huge portion of another, you want to
              remove it like what mr busanalyser always suggests? Come on, the
              most crucial issue for 965 and 969 is the other 20% of the route
              ensured the loading of the bus service to be very substantial.</p>
              <p>Same reasoning for 190 and 972 which duplicates 75-80%. When LTA
              wants to introduce 972, they also ensured totally different routing
              inside Bukit panjang to catch a bigger portion of the residents
              staying around there. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>See, how come over here, you are saying that there is no issue with 190/972 and 965/969 duplicating because there are places in which the pair of services diverge, and then insist there is a problem with AJQZC's svc 82 duplicating with 62, even though the proposed svcs 82 and 62 don't even travel all the way together from Hougang to Punggol, and in the other direction, svc 82 passes by Kovan before going to Hougang Ave 1/Lor Ah Soo, which is something that svc 62 does not do? The whole point of the proposal is to replace svc 113's route from Hougang MRT south to Kovan by the modified svc 82, so even though the modified svc 82 and svc 62 both go from Hougang MRT to Ave 1/Lor Ah Soo they have very different routes in between, and this is the important detail which you seem to not understand.

                      stop at hougang ave 10. Not start from hougang interchange which
                      was stated in the previous messages. </p>
              <p>But is there a need to? The purpose is to removing 113 one bus
                      service. But now introduce another new service 82M? It counteracts
                      against the need. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>It's the exact same logic as withdrawing svc 275, and introducing svc 131M, even though they have the exact same route. The whole point is to help improve the efficiency of bus resource utilization through better coordination of bus services, and having a svc 82M means that bus service can run mainly during peak hours, whereas svc 113 will have to be run throughout the day. Regards.</p>
              <p>Also I wasn't the person suggesting svc 82M in the first place, so no need to direct the feedback regarding its start/end point to me. It can start at Hougang MRT/Ave 10 or even at Kovan MRT/Upp Serangoon Rd for that matter. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, if 82M starts from bus stop outside hougang ave 10 to Serangoon central as per proposal, fine with it. But what's the point? A lot of logistics issue with all these M services departing from sides of roads. The section of this portion are not considered heavy. Just increase the current frequency of service 82 at peak hours will solve it. Rather than introducing another M service for the sake of introducing. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Who are you to tell others not to bother about me??? While mr orange28 and I are having our own conversation, did it intrude into your private space? You are always the first to start picking on me when I did not even do so. If you don't like the fact that i seldom provide route suggestions, just keep quiet. My style is like this. There is nothing wrong with my style. To each, his own. I did not offend you so please don't expect everybody to follow your style. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes 82/107 is more logical. 113/119 too. 119 obviously turns one round around Kovan mrt as LTA purposely does not want it to duplicate 136 excessively so make it loop and return back. 119 seems like unfinished business. Extend much further to eunos or st michaels seems too long to LTA and now just loops around hougang st 21 makes it a bit redundant. Like in no man's land. I mean they just find nearest looping point for 119 to accommodate it after serving rivervale drive and hougang and upper serangoon. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr tranzort08, yes. </p>
              <p>143M because of the way the route is structured to perform a loop around pandan gardens while its principle route 143M to head on to west coast/pasir panjang road, etc. </p>
              <p>43M and 53M for the loop issue. Additional stop along boundary road. </p>
              <p>Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes 82/107 is more logical. 113/119 too. 119
              obviously turns one round around Kovan mrt as LTA purposely does
              not want it to duplicate 136 excessively so make it loop and return
              back. 119 seems like unfinished business. Extend much further to
              eunos or st michaels seems too long to LTA and now just loops
              around hougang st 21 makes it a bit redundant. Like in no man's
              land. I mean they just find nearest looping point for 119 to
              accommodate it after serving rivervale drive and hougang and upper
              serangoon. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I don't think that svc 119 looping at Kovan is redundant. After all, there's the shopping center Heartland Mall Kovan, a hawker center and market at Kovan so it is still a key activity node. If not for the fact that Hougang South Bus Interchange has been closed in favor of consolidation at Hougang Central, svc 119 could very well terminate there as well. Now no more bus interchange there so svc 119 continues as a loop service back to Punggol. Cheers.</p>
