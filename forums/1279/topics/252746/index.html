            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, but anyway, to be honest, since Singapore is a very small country, it's public health standards should be much better than that of bigger countries as we have a smaller population to cater to in out everyday lives.<br><br>On Tuesday, i took TIB509H on 855, and I was shocked to see that the bus was clean and didn't smell bad. The aircon was also cold and this is one of those rare occurances. Another bus on SMRT that isnt undermaintained is TIB430A. I've taken that on 961 and 187 and they both were clean (not on the same day).<br><br>But i do agree that the hygeine on buses has gone down. There are tissue papers, leaking aircons. And its usually the SMRT buses, but i dont know. Maybe SMRT doesnt give as damn. And SBS Transit buses arent so spotless either, as there are too many buses to mantain the chances of getting to be on a dirty or smelly bus is nearly 1:40.<br><br>But we, as passengers can do our part too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> We can help by not eating, drinking, bringing durians (or other strong smelling items) or littering in the bus.</div>

The buses obviously are not up to standard at all.</div>
