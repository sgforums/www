              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;">City Service <strong>652</strong>, which starts on Jan 6, will ply Upper Thomson Road, Yio Chu Kang Road, Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, Ave 3 and Ave 10, before taking the Central Expressway (CTE) downtown. Meanwhile, from Jan 13, City Service <strong>653</strong> will serve Hume Avenue, Hillview Avenue, Bukit Batok East Ave 2 and East Ave 3 before taking the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE).</p>

A total of nine will be rolled out. For a start, the new bus services will make two one-way trips to the city on weekday mornings and two one-way return trips in the evenings. More trips may be added depending on demand, said the spokesman.</p>

              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Six new City Direct bus services from the heartlands to the Central Business District (CBD) will begin operations from January 2014. Three of these services will be implemented in January 2014, followed by another three in February 2014. The three services commencing operations in January 2014 are:<ol style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">6 January 2014      : Ang Mo Kio City Direct Service <strong>652</strong>;</li>

              </ol></li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">For a start, these bus services will make two one-way trips to the CBD on weekday mornings and two one-way return trips in the evenings, excluding public holidays. More trips may be added depending on the demand for the services. With limited stops and the use of expressways, journey times will be comparable to that of taking a bus or LRT and transferring to the MRT into the city. </li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">From 6 January 2014, commuters travelling from Ang Mo Kio to the CBD on weekday mornings will be served by City Direct Service <strong>652</strong>. Operated by Ren Quan Transport, the bus service will ply Upper Thomson Road, Yio Chu Kang Road, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, Avenue 3 and Avenue 10 before taking the Central Expressway (CTE) to get to the CBD, including areas such as Bras Basah Road and Shenton Way. On weekday evenings, the service will connect commuters from Robinson Road back to the Ang Mo Kio neighbourhood.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">On 13 January 2013, City Direct Service <strong>653</strong> will start its operation from Bukit Batok / Hillview. Service 653 will ply Hume Avenue, Hillview Avenue, Bukit Batok East Avenue 2 and Bukit Batok East Avenue 3 before heading towards Robinson Road and Marina Boulevard via the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) and the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). In the evening, it will bring commuters back to Bukit Batok / Hillview. Service 653 is operated by ComfortDelGro Bus Pte Ltd.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Ren Quan Transport will operate City Direct Service <strong>654</strong> from Sengkang from 20 January 2014. The service will ply Anchorvale Street, Compassvale Street and Rivervale Drive before heading towards Central Boulevard and Shenton Way via the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and East Coast Parkway (ECP). Similarly, the bus service will bring commuters back to the Sengkang housing estate in the evening.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The other three City Direct bus services from West Coast, Sembawang and Jurong East will begin their operations in February 2014. More details will be announced closer to the implementation dates.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Last month, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) awarded contracts for six City Direct services to five private bus operators (PBOs) under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), with a total value of about $7.16 million over a two-year period.</li>
              <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The move is in line with the Minister for Transport’s announcement at the Committee of Supply 2013 to tap on the resources of PBOs to augment those of the public transport operators (PTOs). Of the fourteen parallel bus services which will be introduced under BSEP, four will be operated by the PTOs<sup style="margin: 0px;"><a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #006699;" title="#1" href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=1d358274-03cc-4108-9caf-47d4686d2dbd#1">#1</a></sup> and ten others will be operated by the PBOs as City Direct services through competitive tenders. The tendering process allows the most cost-efficient operators to win the rights to operate the services. Successful operators will have to apply for bus service licences from the Public Transport Council (PTC), which regulates bus services.</li>
