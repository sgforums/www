              dug around Newspaper SG...
              
              It turns out the spark that caused SBS to takeover the SSB - Scheme B long haul rts was because of poor mgmt n relations bet Ng Ser Miang's SSB &amp; Private owners's Scheme B ops...
              
              Until SSB &amp; Pte owners's joint bus sv nearly became ghost bus sv... Hardly any bus! Even the Chinese press became medium of both side's arguments, accusing each other of not operating the svs in good faith...
              
              It became a problem until late ex President Ong Teng Cheong had to step in, asking SBS to clean up SSB's mess...
              
              It was a sensitive period to think of it, as SSB's Tibs [SSB was the one given the 2nd bus co license, but Tibs was later on used] was given the license to takeover SBS's rts around the same period...
              
              I guess competition was never to appear again...

              ah yes...
              
              Thanks to the gar-lor... Ng Ser Miang's SSB had to incur massive losses on running the Airport Rts...
              
              What the news reported was that... 
              
              1) Ng said if SSB takesover independently, SSB will do a better job...
              2) Pte owners say if allowed, they'll form a bus co instead to run it...
              
              Govt got tulan, ask SBS to takeover instead...

              SSB ran 4 routes... 
              
              The problem was, apparently when pte bus operator signed in to run SBS's sv slots [that time SBS allowed private operators to run some slots during the peak hours, to solve the peak hour fleet requirement crunch], there was less problems...
              
              But when the pte bus operator tied up w/ SSB on the 4 airport rts, so many problems...
              
              Last time private operators ran Scheme B rts also not many problems...

              <p>SG public transport should be controlled by Transitlink. SBS, SMB and maybe one more operator can be contractors. We can have roughly 7 contract areas with 3-4 route groups/new towns for each area.</p>
              <p>EG:</p>
              <p>West Coast area: Jurong West (Boon Lay), Jurong East, Clementi, Queenstown (Buona Vista, Ghim Moh)</p>
              <p>Bukit Batok area: Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Chua Chu Kang</p>
              <p>Sembawang area: Woodlands, Sembawang, Yishun</p>
              <p>Ang Mo Kio area: Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon, Bishan, Toa Payoh</p>
              <p>Hougang Area: Hougang, Sengkang, Punggol</p>
              <p>East Coast area: Geylang (Eunos), Bedok, Tampines, Pasir Ris</p>
              <p>Tanglin area: Bukit Merah, Downtown (Marina Centre, Shenton Way), Kallang-Whampoa (Saint Michael's, Geylang Fringe)</p>
              <p>Each area will be awarded to its respective contractor following a competitive tender.</p>

              <p>the problem is MRT and bus service end up killing each other. Also different operators will also end up killing each other. this is why some of the old bus services which parallel to MRT line were removed when mrt started operating in 1987. or else either bus service die or mrt die.</p>
              <p>of cos from 2012 onwards transports policy change and due to higher coe for cars middle income people started to "cow peh" has money cannot buy toyota cars, the cost is too high, so LTA LL must come out tax payers money to buy more buses and has more "new" bus services to serve in HDB new towns where people has money but not enough to own cars. while wait for new MRT line to complete in 5 to 15 years time in those HDB new towns.  </p>
              <p>this is why singapore can only have two operators with the support from PAP link investment firm. or else it will be in a mess if more than one operators in operation. now already has operating problems from SBST and SMRT , what happend if other companies step in? the transport system will died in no time. most companies will go bankrupt government cannot support more than 2 companies.  </p>

              <p>agreed that Sg cannot have more than 2 operators..</p>
              <p>My suggest will be SBST run All areas except Punggol/Yishun/Sembawang/Woodlands/Sengkang/Serangoon </p>
              <p>Rail is circle line,Thomson line and downtown line plus BPJ lrt</p>
              <p>SMRT takes Punggol Sengkang Serangoon Woodlands Yishun Sembawang </p>
              <p>provided they use DDs lor</p>
              <p>Rail will be east west line north south eastern region line northeast line </p>

              ironic right...
              
              The one who proposed to compete w/ SBS, ended up 1st attempt having SBS to clean up Tibs's mess...
              
              Tibs's success is overrated by media.. simi 37 to 800 bus, 1 small operator vs SBS...
