            <div class='col-md body'>Military Nuts is another big forum, but there are major differences in the running. The mods seldom if never post, for one. There are few of those major threads and its a pretty free-for-all forum, yet I notice that forumites there seldom bash each other, and though many threads are created every now and then, there are few duplicated threads. A totally opposite world there, you might say. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Howdy guys!<br><br>As a slightly more passive and neutral voice here (and one of those calling for a clean up of this forum, or its closure), I would like to add that even if we were once kids, we never behaved the way the "kids" on this forum have.  We did not steal, nor deface a public structure, nor did we even think about defaming any operators in public.  We also did not engage in any activities which would tarnish our hobby.  My suggestion is that every one of you take a look at yourselves in the mirror and ask yourself if you have done something to benefit this hobby.  Because, clearly, I cannot see many of the kids even contributing one iota or constructive information.  How I know this?  I am the administrator of a number of forums and closed membership groups, and I will do my utmost to keep as many of you out of these groups as my powers allow me.  Remember a certain Mike DTS?  Where has he gone now?  To the closed membership forums.  Why?  Because of you!  Think about it.  Your actions may even be to your own detriment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now for my feedback...<br><br>1. The ownership of the forum be handed over to an actual bus enthusiast (read, nothing personal).<br><br>2. Any posts which even closely resemble incitement to flaming to be deleted ASAP<br><br>3. All posts by known clones to be deleted as soon as they appear.<br><br>4.  All non-enthusiast posts to be deleted.</div>
