And to a certain extent, probably more than one year ago!  We have been trying to settle this matter as amicably as possible in privately.  There was room for negotiation and discussion.  Suggestions have been given.  Unfortunately, AirbusA330Captain left us no room for negotiation or discussion.  Hence, this is why I had to bring the matter to the attention of the people here.  That's all.<br><br>As for whether I like to sabotage people to the authorities in physical form, I would no comment on that.  You are entitled to whatever you think.</div>

I DO NOT SEE YOUR REASON FOR DOING ALL THESE. We, as the moderators of MRT/LRT forum, has NEVER did anything(other than medicheng's terrorist stuff) to obstruct any of the operation of any forum. I know that all the while, you have been in no favour of the MRT/LRT forum. But you need not do these actions and if you want to do something like this, why dont you also target at other transport forums? This is only your opinions and i do not see why all these actions are required. You have even voiced your dislike about the MRT/LRT forum in your signature which you did not show now.<br><br>The main purpose of my post is only to question why especially the moderators of the MRT/LRT forum are being disregarded by you. I have been patient for quite long. If you feel that the MRT/LRT forum should be taken moderatorship by people from the other forum, i will open the slots. NO NEED FOR FORUM OR PERSONAL ATTACK.</div>

Have you ever thought about how their actions on a PUBLIC DOMAIN can compromise our reputation in the eyes of the public? Things ARE NOT as simple as they seem. Your narrow-mindedness to this whole issue clearly shows you are DISINTERESTED in the affairs of the forum and the effect they have on others!
