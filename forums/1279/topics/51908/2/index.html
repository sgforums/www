They can't take as good photos as digital still cams, and their main purpose is to film, unless you want to upload the video from an entire journey of let's say, Sv. 56 for all to see? Images are more practical, IMO. And you can do artistic effects which video cams can't do.<br></div>

The Scania N113CRB, VO 2 Axle, Mk 3, Mk 4 DM 3500 (New ones, with pink seats) are fitted with Voith Gearbox. The Vo 3 Axle, Volvo Mk 2, Mk 4 Strider and DM are using ZF.

Although they change gear rather late, they accelearate quickly.

I thought that those MB O.405 are just with its  MB Gearbox, which may not change the gear as it is like. </div></blockquote>Yes, they are Voith-geared. You can tell by the way it changes gear and the sound of the retarder during deceleration. Those with MB gearbox will go "whoo...whoooooo..whoooo" while the Voiths have a whistling sound.</div>
