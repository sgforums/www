Also, it has alot of gear change when accelerating. Voith gearboxes changes gear slower, with a longer first gear. Also when braking, Voith gearbox will give out a "whining" sound.

DAFs with some crazy drivers ( they normally are ) are capable of reaching top speed often and leaving the buses behind eating the dust, and the acceleration is also quite smooth to boot. If you arrive in Yishun Interchange btw 0625-0640, you will often see 3 svc852 arriving together within 3 minutes, and over Friday and this week, I had sat on all 3 buses, and u may be interested to know that the first bus is TIB1013P, second is TIB1014L, and the third is TIB719T. The first bus goes slower than a snail, the second goes like a snail, so they meet up after YCK, and the third goes like a normal bus, and often meet up with those two after Khatib MRT. Now, what do u have to say? I dun think 3 days is sumthing one can manage w/o coincidence, and I can take the any of the 3 buses for the rest of the week cos of Funtasia Prep., but Im getting a bit sick of the 3, so Im going to excuse myself early for the next few days so I can catch the wave of DAFs back home.</div>

The gearbox goes into neutral when the brake pedal is depressed at standstill after 1 second.  The engine revs a bit higher because it is freewheeling, and the gearbox begins a mild high pitched whine.  After the brake pedal is released, the gearbox goes into first gear.  The change is instantaneous, so there is no need for the driver to pause before hitting the accelerator.<br><br>The TIBS Habits have an interlock system on the back doors only.  Once the doors are closed, the interlock releases the park brake (whch uses only 1/3 of the air supply used for a maxi brake).  It has no relation to the accelerator.

The DAF SB220/Hispano, which are now at CSS.  Has a Voith D851.3 gearbox.  This is followed by the DAF SB220/Alexander.  I don't think it is any of the Hino RKs or Hino AKs, or the Hino HT228Ks or HT238Ks, or the UDs, since the HT's and UD's have 4 speed ZFs, and the AKs and RKs had Allison automatics.</div>

Mostly they last served in neglected services too - 171, 851, 853, 167, 169 etc etc</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>I'm very puzzled that so many respondents in this website knows so much detailed information about Spore buses!

Most of the MB0405s, Volvos have the gear-change at the dashboard, and look out for 3 buttons "DNR" arranged horizontally. Besides these buttons there is usually either a circle with ZF inside to say the bus is ZF-ed, and if there is a word Voith in caps, then it is Voith-ed. However, most of SBST MB0405s do not have these symbols because of they have MB gearboxes.<br><br>It takes a bit of craze to actually trace the gaer changes when relaxing or studying on the bus, and it sort of becoming natural after some time. For me, to differentiate the gearbox, I normally listen to the first gear change and the retareder.<br><br>If the first gear change is sharp and goes like "piiiiooooooooouuur", then it is definitely ZF<br><br>If it is muted, then it is Voith or MB, and they can be differentiated by their retarder<br><br>If there is a nice whistling sound as the bus decelerates, it is Voith. If there are 3 stages of "whoooooo..." then it is MB for SBST0405s<br>If there is no distinct sound but you can hear the gear "dropping" back to neutral, then it is ZF<br><br>The endangered LO2-Ax have Allisons.<br><br>Some of the SBST DM 0405s have Voiths instead of MBs<br><br>Hope to be of help <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
