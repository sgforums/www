              <p>The Public Transport Council has fined both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses
              for breaches in the Quality of Service or QoS Standards following its
              six-monthly review of their operating performance.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit was fined $9,300; SMRT Buses was fined $1,000.</p>
              <p>These are for breaches in standards for scheduled trips operated,
              scheduled departing times from terminals as well as passenger loading.</p>
              <p>PTC Chairman Gerard Ee says the financial penalties imposed are a
              clear signal that the operators should strive for better results.</p>
              <p>The Council however acknowledged the bus operators’ ongoing efforts
              to improve their services to meet the stringent QoS standards.</p>
              <p>They include buying more buses and accelerating the recruitment and training of bus drivers.</p>
              <p>The Council says although more improvements can and should be made,
              on the whole the operators have been able to achieve the required
              standards on most services. -938Live</p>

              <p><em>the following report is from CNA..</em></p>
              <p><strong>SBS Transit and SMRT Buses fined for lapses in service</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Public Transport Council has fined SBS Transit
              S$9,300 and SMRT Buses S$1,000 for lapses in service standards in the
              six months from December 2007 to May 2008.
              <br> <br>The council said the fines are due to the incompliance of standards
              such as operating scheduled trips, adhering to scheduled headways or
              frequency of services, as well as passenger load.
              <br> <br>However, the council noted that the bus operators have been able to
              meet most required standards, and have kept breakdown and accident
              rates low.
              <br> <br> This penalty framework started in October 2007, to enforce "Quality of Service" standards set for basic bus services.
              <br> <br> Fines range from S$100 a day per bus service route, to S$10,000 a month per breach of standards.
              <br> <br> The council reviews the bus services, and announces the results every April and October.

              <p>See the SMRT frequency, it is quite obvious. Adding on, only 190 frequency look fine with me. Another possible reason is the old buses, SBST dereg Scannia 113CRB and Merc 0405T regulary but SMRT did not dereg the UD despite OC500LE addition...</p>

              <p>I will agree with anyone who thinks SMRT is to be fined much more, though I suspect size of company and favouritism <em>may</em> have played a part. Not trying to hint at anything, but I get a queasy feeling that the authorities are allowing SMRT to get away with a lot of service laspes.</p>
              <p>Then, thinking about it again, it may have to do with the fact that their MRT operations have already been fined heavily earlier - this may be just some sort of additional warning signal for them to get real serious with their public transit business as a whole.</p>

              <p><strong><span>PTC fines both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses for breaches in Quality of Service</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Public Transport Council has fined both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses for breaches in the Quality of Service or QoS Standards following its six-monthly review of their operating performance.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit was fined $9,300; SMRT Buses was fined $1,000.</p>
              <p>These are for breaches in standards for scheduled trips operated, scheduled departing times from terminals as well as passenger loading.</p>
              <p>PTC Chairman Gerard Ee says the financial penalties imposed are a clear signal that the operators should strive for better results.</p>
              <p>The Council however acknowledged the bus operators’ ongoing efforts to improve their services to meet the stringent QoS standards.</p>
              <p>They include buying more buses and accelerating the recruitment and training of bus drivers.</p>
              <p>The Council says although more improvements can and should be made, on the whole the operators have been able to achieve the required standards on most services. -938Live</p>

              <p>I wonder when some of you post, if you even have the information correct...</p>
              <p>Blatantly shooting without concrete proof... hopeless.</p>
              <p>The reality is what as mentioned in the news - SBST fined 9.3K and SMRT 1.0K. I find <strong>absolutely </strong>no reason for people to try and say that it should be the other way round. I am seriously fed up with people who are always thinking that SMRT is worse off than SBST. If you <strong>don't have any concrete proof</strong> that SMRT breached the QoS Standards way more than SBST, jolly well <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shut the hell up</span>.</p>
              <p>There are many reasons why SBST was fined much higher. SBST obviously handles many more bus routes than SMRT - The probability of breaching the QoS Standards for SBST is therefore, much higher isn't it? I quote the sentence in the news report for you - and you go digest it yourself. <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Fines range from S$100 a day per bus service route." </span></p>
              <p>I'm not trying to say that you guys must support SMRT - No, both companies have their own flaws and strengths - Just how you look at it. So I always hate it whenever such flawed comparison of the companies come up amongst you people, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you don't even know what you are talking</span>!!! </p>

              <p>If you say like this, let me ask you 1 question.</p>
              <p>Is $1,000 enough to make up the loss of the "Worst than worse frequency" that SMRT has provided to us? SURELY not...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IMO, SBST should manage buses and SMRT should manage trains.</p>

              <p>Well, if you want me to be fair...</p>
              <p>Deny all of SMRT's and SBS Transit's profits for the next three years. Let the LTA take their profits they will be earning and use it to improve public transit infrastructure the LTA owns.</p>
              <p>Then, deny them fare increases for the next three years unless oil prices go up - and any fare increase must be just enough to cover any increase in oil prices. Force them to lower their fares should oil prices drop.</p>
              <p>Also, force them to delist from the Singapore Stock Exchange. That will take away their financial motivations to profit.</p>
              <p>This should really wake them up once and for all.</p>
