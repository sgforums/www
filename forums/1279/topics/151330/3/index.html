            <div class='col-md body'>That validator can be seen with the centre mirror, the 1 at the top corner is to see the exit mirror &amp; the extra mirror on the ceiling is always facing straight down. I've also noticed that the buses with that extra mirror mostly ply routes that are always overcrowded such as 7, 99 &amp; some JIS VO2Xs.</div>
