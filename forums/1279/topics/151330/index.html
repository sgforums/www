            <div class='col-md body'>If the front is crowded like sardine fish and the back is empty like so... the BC can ask the commuters to board the back to fill up those space at the back. One more thing I noticed that whenever take 119 those students like to stand at the exit so much as if they will run away. They also stand on one side instead of both sides as their schools bag blocked the rest to move it or stand two side. I think the school should help out too by telling the bus rule and lighten their bag load. Those students sometimes won't listen to the BC when he/she tell them to move back but they still stand there like nothing happen. Even DD also like that all stand/crowd at the exit and not much people standing behind. I think we need to have campagin for this</div>

One more thing I noticed that whenever take 119 those students like to stand at the exit so much as if they will run away. They also stand on one side instead of both sides as their schools bag blocked the rest to move it or stand two side. I think the school should help out too by telling the bus rule and lighten their bag load. Those students sometimes won't listen to the BC when he/she tell them to move back but they still stand there like nothing happen. Even DD also like that all stand/crowd at the exit and not much people standing behind. I think we need to have campagin for this</div></blockquote>there is a campagin for this i think, not too sure...i tink tats y those "Pls move to the rear" sticker came out....but it failed....last time there are a few buses installed with PA systems....for BC to ask pax to move behind....now i dun tink haf liao...</div>
