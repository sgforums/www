              <p>but, from the replies here in this thread, it seems that on the
              contrary, bus lobbyists want Scania K230UB, not Mercedes Benz
              Citaro 0530.</p>
              <p>so, if I succeed getting the authorities to buy Scania K230UBs,
              I will be attacked by the bus lobbyists for helping them get what
              they want? It does not make sense.</p>
              <p>by the way, please avoid using those complicated words (vitriol
              &amp; gutter). i did not even bother checking the dictionary, but
              only guess the meaning.</p>

              actually, from the bus driver perspective, they prefer Mercedes, so it's definitely Mercedes Benz Citaro. because the Mercedes engine more reliable ma; won't so easily spoil. although Mercedes vehicle more expensive, but there's less maintenance required. so, I think in terms of long term expenditure, Mercedes Benz Citaro is better because it's cheaper.
              
              actually, I have been following this forum for quite a while, since around 2009, so I know roughly why. From what's written here last time, some ppl say that it's because the Scania K230UB not nice, that's why SBS regret buying, and dun wanna buy anymore of them.
              
              or... is the reason the same as what I wrote in the first paragraph, about Mercedes engine being more reliable?

              <p>Actually the main purpose for Scania KUBs are to replace the old mercedes buses 0405 buses while the citaros are used to replace the retiring volvo MKIII/B10Ms..</p>
              <p>But really, Scania KUBs are much better imo. Yes i do agree the pickup of the KUBs are much slower than the citaros but the interior of the citaro is super squeezy. Also, there can only be a 1 row of passengers standing in the citaro while the Scania KUB can fit 2 rows. And there's a super huge compartment at the back, wasting opportunity cost for implementing 1-2 more seats. Scania KUBs can be jerky, but trust me the legroom you have will compensate for the "jerkiness".</p>
              <p>Not to mention the unadjustable aircon ducts as well.. Sometimes on hot days its super hot and you can't feel the air-con as well. The sensors on the back doors can be quite frustrating at times as the drivers are unable to close the doors if the bus is super crowded and one of the items/ the foot of the passenger goes close to the sensor. You can feel the heat when seating at the back of the bus already.. and the citaros are only bought for less than 3 years? if im not wrong</p>
              <p>From driver's perspective, they just dont like the position of the door opening and closing buttons in the citaros, as they are more used to the traditional style, where the door closing and opening buttons are on their right.</p>

              <p>Who says mercedes benz citaro is cheaper?? Mercedes Benz itself is already a premium and superior good and utilises exclusive distribution in Singapore by Cycle and carriage, and i am sure that their buses do not come cheap as well otherwise everywhere in the world are already using their buses already ad not volvo or man..</p>
              <p>Imo the scania kubs are cheaper.. and SBS Transit does get discounts for bulk purchases, that's why they bought 1,001 Scania KUBs at once. Of course imo MAN A22 is the best in terms of pickup speed and comfortability. Scania KUBs for legroom.</p>

              <p>Actuallly, I am also neutral. For me, I am only concerned about the costs. I do not care about the comfort, since the seats and stuff are all designed with ergonomics and stuff in mind.</p>
                      <p>About the costs, I am looking at the cash flow analysis, about the cumulative cash flow (cumulative energy savings - cumulative maintenance costs - initial capital costs) after a period of time (the higher the better), about how long it takes to break even (the shorter the better).</p>
                      <p>Of course, only the people working for LTA, SBS, SMRT, etcetera. would know the costs and savings of the bus model. So, I am not able to compare the costs of Scania k230ub and Mercedes Benz Citaro and say which bus model has a higher projected cash flow.</p>
                      <p>What we (the commoners) can do is only to choose which seat design, etcetera. we prefer, and I think that's about it. In this case, I am neutral.</p>

              <p>They vibrate vigourously due to the aircon unit integrated with engine switch system unlike SMRT which has separate unit.To reduce heat,SBST tune the radiator to active mode thus the loud fan sound and tend to vibrate during idling,Im not a pro but a few of SBST mechanics told me this.</p>
