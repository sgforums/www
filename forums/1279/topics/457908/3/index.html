              <p>what a waste? What singaporeans have  no patience? do you
              think everyone is so free to go check on iris? so even if i check
              on iris, that the next bus is arriving in 3 mins, shall i wait for
              it? How would i know whether  the next bus is FULL or not? you
              wont know at all. of course, i have to try squeeze up the 1st
              bus...</p>
              <p>There are many cases, that the 2nd bus is full and is trying to
              catch up on the 1st bus... so if 1st bus is already 3/4 full and
              you saw on iris next bus 3 mins, so you wait for next bus and it
              skip the bus stop.. then you will come complain... things are not
              easy as what you think... from your so call analyzing, things look
              very simple... but in actual fact, it is NOT that simple at

              <p>U only analyse 1-2 trips and that is not bus analysing. It's called joyriding. U must board these svcs at least 4-5 trips to make your findings accurate. Svc 38 is packed at bedok stn during am peak. 113 is packed from lorong ah soo area to Kovan station and the opposite during pm peak hrs. I hope u get my point.</p>

              <p>132 has enough DDs</p>
              <p>However, 153 has too many DDs, they should swap 4 DDs(2 for 74 and 147 each) for 2 147 SDs and 2 74 SDs.</p>
              <p>In the end, 153 will have 12 SDs and 5 DDs, which is enough.</p>
              <p>153's DD gets redundant during off peak but useful for the peak hour uni-directional loading of 60-80pax.</p>

              <p>Agree with you. 163 need 5 DDs. # Dds on 147 and 153 are okay. No need for more. 132 may have more DDs than required that can be transferred to 74.</p>
              <p>I particularly like your point that "every thread does not need to be a warzone". Hope ppl appreciate this.</p>

              <p><br>Thank you, my friend. Will surely check the Tuas routes. So is the loading more at BNL or Pioneer station for these routes? Coz at BNL, I have counted the loading is about 30-40 pax in evening peak, don't know about morning peak.</p>
              <p>My guess is that it must be further filling up at Pioneer or Joo Koon????</p>

              <p>you think it is very easy for them to switch the buses? so let
              say 3148 reach shenton way, BC switch EDS to Sv133 and go on Sv133
              route? then 8240 (on sv133) reach Shenton way, change it to Sv186
              and go on service? so what happen after 3148 reach AMK and 8240
              reach St Michael? Find another service to switch again?  There
              are 3000+ buses to be deployed daily. .Really so easy to do such

              <p>This service is really screwed-up.</p>
              <p>Before CCL, NUS peeps complained too crowded and unreliable.</p>
              <p>After CCL, the buses are now crawling and frequency 10-15 minutes and just as crowded.</p>
              <p>As it is, public transport topped the woes again for students in NUS according to the student union. 95 was fingered once again as a major culprit with the NUS shuttles deemed to be still insufficient despite all the fleet increases.</p>
              <p>Despite the new KR MRT that's supposed to actually make life easier!</p>

              <p>what time you took it?  when you want to mention the load,
              pls mention the time/day that you took it.... if it is AM
              peak,definitely the crowds are all going to Shenton way/CBD.. not
              just sv186... lots of services also same situation.</p>
              <p>you think it is very easy for them to switch the buses? so let
              say 3148 reach shenton way, BC switch EDS to Sv133 and go on Sv133
              route? then 8240 (on sv133) reach Shenton way, change it to Sv186
              and go on service? so what happen after 3148 reach AMK and 8240
              reach St Michael? Find another service to switch again?  There
              are 3000+ buses to be deployed daily. .Really so easy to do such
              switching?</p>

              <p>Svc 186 goes to Shenton Way, changes EDS to svc 130 / 133 / 162. This continues on 130 whole day, until evening peak when the svc goes back to 186. </p>
              <p>The load on 186 is not more than 20-28 pax on the opposite direction, and there is 51 and 153 in parallel for most part of its route, which are also DDs.</p>
              <p>It is not so difficult. 186 deserves DDs but only for peak loading to Shenton Way, the other way round there are no takers on this route. </p>
