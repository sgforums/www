              <p>U only analyse 1-2 trips and that is not bus analysing. It's
              called joyriding. U must board these svcs at least 4-5 trips to
              make your findings accurate. Svc 38 is packed at bedok stn during
              am peak. 113 is packed from lorong ah soo area to Kovan station and
              the opposite during pm peak hrs. I hope u get my point.</p>

              <p>relax kiddo. U think dds on 163 are well-utilised? U think dds are for free? We need to pay unrequired amounts of tax for dds on ur svc 163! HGDEP make commuters boarding packed bus svcs in the hg or kovan area suffer and deploy dds on 163 instead? Lol. And u are saying I'm a clone? Aren't u a clone as well?

              <p>haha I am one of those on TCP.. Havent taken Service 95 since I gotten the pass last month. That 73cts more is srsly too much of a deterrent to take 95 even a few times per week. Srsly if A1 pua stunt I will just walk to LT29 for hopes of Service C/D2 appearing to save my day. And if I were from FOS I would just walk from KR everyday except when it rains. Waiting for A1 and trying to board is just too much..</p>
              <p>Talking abt B and C, I will only try them during the peak hrs, if not it is wiser to start walking than waiting for them. And their arrival timings are always missing on the LCD panels with the exception of during peaks (at times only). </p>
              <p>Shuttle D, though with plenty of buses, still screws up badly in the afternoon hours (2.30-3.30pm) at UTown. Virtually the whole world is waiting for D2 and a couple of them can't clear the crowd. Have been walking (or should I say running) out of UTown since the few incidences. At other times, D2 will be bunching like mad (just saw 4-5 of them bunched before &amp; aft OED last Fri around 4.30pm).</p>
              <p>Lastly, I would be more than willing to buy BCP and spare myself from the A1 agony if not for my 8am &amp; 9am classes when Service 151's frequency is most erratic and not mentioning the dangers of Bt Timah stretch trapping the bus.</p>

              <p>Same sentiments.</p>
              <p>I have a 9am class and taking 151 or BTC for that would be sucidal with all the crazy jams.</p>
              <p>Taking A1/A2 would be playing Russian Roulette.</p>
              <p>Taking 151e = Paying more, though I still take this service from time to time.</p>
              <p>The safest bet in fact would be to take 10 from Harbourfront, but 10 is another erratic service. To play safe, one can also take 30 or 143, and then proceed to climb the mountain.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>And before CCL, also far more complicated with 95 A, B, C. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, there was even a 95D!</p>
              <p>And also before CCL, it wasn't unusual for people to board 95 from the rear door....because the BC knows how much it meant for students to be able to get to their lessons on time!</p>
