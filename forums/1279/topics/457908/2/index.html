              <p>Where did you have to go from Macpherson? The good thing is that 43, 70 have a common route right upto Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 / Hougang Ave 2 Junction. This might be a rare situation but if it happens again, would suggest that you take 70, 43 to YCK road and then if your destination is beyond YCK road on Buangkok Green, switch over to 109. Better than waiting long.</p>

              <p>In sgwiki updated on 26th August, 2012 - I noticed quite a few service improvements.</p>
              <p>2 DDs have been added to svc 2 (2 SDs have been taken out)</p>
              <p>2 DDs have been added to svc 86 (total of 4 DDs now, 2 SDs have been replaced)</p>
              <p>1 DD added to svc 163 (1 SD replaced, total of 3 DDs)</p>
              <p>1 DD added to svc 31 (Fleet addition)</p>
              <p>1 DD added to svc 12 (Fleet addition)</p>
              <p>1 more SD converted to DD on svc 161 (only 1 SD left - close to becoming a full DD fleet)</p>
              <p>1 DD added to svc 59 (replacing 1 SD)</p>
              <p>3 DD added to svc 43 (this happened in July though)</p>
              <p>On the other hand, 2 DDs have been taken off svc 10, 1 DD taken off svc 56, 78, 179.</p>
              <p>Quite a few service improvements already for this quarter from SBST. Your thoughts?</p>

              <p>its quite hard to spot the full fleet of 179. need some skill and technique to see the fleet size of 179. for a start, you need to know the crossover buses to and from 179, and at what time.</p>

              <p>No - they are on 163.</p>
              <p>Regarding 74 that is a good question actually. If you see in the last month, DDs have been added to 2, 12, 31, 43, 59, 86, 161 and 163. But over the service improvements this year, there has been no DD added to 74.</p>

              <p>Sorry for the late reply. During peak hours in the morning, direction towards Toa Payoh is very crazy. U can see SD buses filled to the brim, and DD buses all seats taken and also quite abit of standees. From 7am - 8.30am is the busiest time for 163. </p>
              <p>Returning trip is also the same case. 5.30pm - 7pm is the busiest time. IMO, 163 needs 1-2 more DDs. but during peak hours only. Non peak hours SDs can handle, maybe 1-2 DDs during non peak hours is enough =)</p>

              <p>Sorry for the late reply. During peak hours in the morning, direction towards Toa Payoh is very crazy. U can see SD buses filled to the brim, and DD buses all seats taken and also quite abit of standees. From 7am - 8.30am is the busiest time for 163. </p>
              <p>Returning trip is also the same case. 5.30pm - 7pm is the busiest time. IMO, 163 needs 1-2 more DDs. but during peak hours only. Non peak hours SDs can handle, maybe 1-2 DDs during non peak hours is enough =)</p>

              <p>i usually take 857 to school in the morning. However, I always come out of my house quite early to observe the buses on 163. The direction towards Toa Payoh all the buses that passed by are always full, this includes the DD. of course the frequency ranges between 8-10 minutes during the peak hour. As for the other direction, not much pax but has reasonable amount of seats taken. </p>
              <p>During evening peak hours, sometimes ill take 163 home. It gets up to 80 pax already at Upper Thomson Road, and everytime it reaches opposite Apple and motorola, the buses will be packed. </p>

              <p>I reckon that that the DD you took either go too fast, or the bus in front was going to slow thats why it was only 3 mins ahead. And perhaps u didnt take 163 during peak hours or at the wrong direction? hmm.. </p>
              <p>Anyway the demand for 163 increases daily, especially so for the next few years when more and more residents are going to stay in Sengkang and Fernvale area. It is expected that another new bus service to be introduced in Sengkang/Fernavale area to cope with 163's load.</p>

              <p>Sequence of service 163 DD deployment went like this...</p>
              <p>9669M - Debut DD deployment in June last year, 948S out.</p>
              <p>9678L - Direct swop with 938X that went to 62 in May. This also marks the 1st Trident appearance on 163 with a new formatted EDS.</p>
              <p>9673A - Seems like an unofficial deployment but always on same slot during weekdays since July. 951G kept running around until it finally settled down to perm 85.</p>
              <p>9326C 9327A - Replaced 1688K 2695H in early August. Eventually 3161A and think another WEG2 (suspecting 3172T) took over.</p>

              <p>what time you took it?  when you want to mention the load, pls mention the time/day that you took it.... if it is AM peak,definitely the crowds are all going to Shenton way/CBD.. not just sv186... lots of services also same situation.</p>
              <p>you think it is very easy for them to switch the buses? so let say 3148 reach shenton way, BC switch EDS to Sv133 and go on Sv133 route? then 8240 (on sv133) reach Shenton way, change it to Sv186 and go on service? so what happen after 3148 reach AMK and 8240 reach St Michael? Find another service to switch again?  There are 3000+ buses to be deployed daily. .Really so easy to do such switching?</p>

              <p>what a waste? What singaporeans have  no patience? do you think everyone is so free to go check on iris? so even if i check on iris, that the next bus is arriving in 3 mins, shall i wait for it? How would i know whether  the next bus is FULL or not? you wont know at all. of course, i have to try squeeze up the 1st bus...</p>
              <p>There are many cases, that the 2nd bus is full and is trying to catch up on the 1st bus... so if 1st bus is already 3/4 full and you saw on iris next bus 3 mins, so you wait for next bus and it skip the bus stop.. then you will come complain... things are not easy as what you think... from your so call analyzing, things look very simple... but in actual fact, it is NOT that simple at all.</p>
