              <p>do you realise you only point out am/br and not slbp buses? and the true implications is that i can list down a long list of slbp buses that need attention. am/br have their bad buses but that doesnt mean slbp doesnt. you can point out bad buses but not only of the same depot am/br right? what about bbdep, bndep, hgdep and your very own clan? i do like slbp buses only i dun really mention it out loud but i really truly find slbp's maintenance not up to par with some of the other depots and buses. i once loved 2770Z but it just keeps getting more terrible, the suspension to the engine sound, pickup and brakes. one can clearly tell the difference of the quality of the buses from the different depots from time to time again.</p>

              <p>I find that you are very biased when you are comparing buses between AMDEP &amp; SLBP. Don't try to even deny it, your posts already showed it to all of us. Each time SLBP buses are mentioned in a negative way, you simply love to shoot ppl off. Do you even realised that?? Seriously I dun even knw what on bloody earth did AMDEP offended you. I agree that some of SLBP buses are not bad, but also have to agree that some of them are also need to be better well-maintained. I believe that you've taken SLBP buses and should knw which one are bad and good. Want me to proof you further?? I use 9114Y as an example, I once remembered you mentioned that this bus can run but have you ever taken the bus?? If you didn't knw, I taken the bus 2 days ago and it can't even run. It even drag on the straight roads and climbing the hills like nobody business along Bukit Batok East Ave 6. Even the BC also agree with it. Don't believe me, take that bus. And don't even try to shoot me back without even getting your facts right.</p>

              <p>I knew that someone would say that. why? why always AM VS SL? Cos they got quite a lot of similar buses these 2 depots have. SLBP definitely got many so called bad buses (esp merc). I am always reply to the faulty buses u guys provided but there are many times that when they checked and the buses are doing well.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is really unfair to compare SLBP with other depots as SLBP got the most old buses in the depot.Old buses are not so easy to maintain. That's why there are request to buy so many new buses. I understand SBS 2770Z is nt as good as before. But it is a SP bus u see. At least as passenger comfort, the A/C is working and interior is clean. Let's look at the SLBP effort on maintaining the kub, cleaning rims, rectify buses that are vibrating seriously.</p>
              <p>I hope that things can go well and we can understand each other better. </p>

              <p>I really took it last 2 weeks(when it still got the ads), that time it bunch with SBS 8047P. I really find the bus is goin at the normal speed. I think it depends on the BC really. Would ask to check again and get back to u again.</p>
