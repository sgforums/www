Shopkeepers were told it has been scheduled for completion within the next two years.<br><br>According to Mr Lim Eng Leong, 65, an Ang Mo Kio resident for 24 years, voting on whether or not to proceed with the LUP was supposed to proceed in October. But there has been no news, he said.<br><br>An HDB spokesman told Today that "the LUP for Blocks 710, 714, 716, 725 and 729 along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6/8 are still in the design stage".<br><br>Once the design is finalised and endorsed by the working committee, residents will be asked to vote. The timeline for the upgrading is "about 2.5 years".<br><br>Residents are similarly concerned over the upgrading of the hawker centre, overseen by the National Environment Agency (NEA) as part of the HUP. The NEA said while the hawker centre at Block 724 "is eligible" for upgrading, the schedule and details "have not been decided yet".<br><br>"As the Ang Mo Kio town centre is undergoing upgrading and this hawker centre is located within the town centre, the NEA will work with the HDB, Town Council and the HUP working committee to work out an appropriate upgrading schedule for the hawker centre," said an NEA spokesman.<br><br>Remarked Mr Lim: "Why can't someone coordinate by bringing the three relevant authorities together and set a time frame to commence simultaneously, so that the residents and shopkeepers will not be hampered by the on-off construction work?"<br><br>Mr Goh Ang Jee, chairman of the Ang Mo Kio Constituency Merchants' Association, said association members have complained that business suffered a 30 to 40 per cent drop since construction work started in May and metal fences were put up in front of - and around - their shops.<br><br>Mr Leong San Cheng, the owner of the famous Tip Top curry puff stall at Hiap Hwa Eating House at Block 722, said: "Fewer people sit down to eat because of the dust."<br><br>Mr Goh, who owns a furniture and renovation store at Block 728, griped: "My own business has dropped by half."<br><br>But on whether all the upgrading works should be done simultaneously, Mr Goh said: "Now it's very messy and there are more mosquitoes as water collected in the holes turns to breeding grounds Â… If the town and hawker centres were to be upgraded together, that would be total chaos!"<br><br>The original plan in August 2001 was to develop a mega-complex - featuring a 31-storey condominium, a 21-storey office building and an NTUC hypermarket - at the 2.57ha plot of land opposite the MRT station to be completed by 2006.<br><br>This was put on hold by the Singapore Labour Foundation, in charge of building on the plot of land, due to "changing economic conditions".<br><br>Now, $325 million has been set aside for the whole redevelopment project, which will include a three-storey shopping centre on a 1.93ha plot instead and a bus interchange linked to the MRT station.<br><br>Mr Seng Han Thong, MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, promised residents earlier that the new mall would be ready in the first half of 2007. - TODAY</blockquote>Apparently, work on AMK Int was delayed due to the state of the economy, as this report seems to suggest.</div>
