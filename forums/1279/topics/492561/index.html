                                  <p>Meal breaks at 10am, 5pm and 12am. During which the next shift takes over. The employee can go home, since his work and already.</p>
                                  <p>The bus drivers working third shift only need to park their buses at the bus interchange or terminal. Then the 3am shift people later come collect and bring back to depot.</p>
                                  <p>Bus services operate from 5am to 12am.</p>

                                  <p>Also, when planning the shift timing, I will also make sure every employee got time to travel, have time to bond with his family, and got time to sleep eight hours everyday.</p>
                                  <p>Women who kanna pregnant can get 9 months of paid leave* once they confirm that they are pregnant. Then after they give birth, they get another 3 months to take care of baby and find childcare centre.</p>
                                  <p>*of course, not 100% of the pay, since they never do work. I will only give around 25% nia, enough for them to buy food and pay bill.</p>
                                  <p>In addition, if an employee refers his friends to join us, he gets a one-off 5% bonus for that month.</p>
                                  <p> </p>
                                  <p>All these is to make my employees happy. If they feel happy, they want to work for me, thus productivity increases. :)</p>

              Which dumb people would have their mealbreak 1h before ending shift? If u become our boss, bus will definitely die liao changing shift at weird timings. U think bus is office hours jobs ah?! Wake up lah. This is transportation industry lah not some office hour work 8h rest 1h. 
              
              Seriously u have no or little knowledge about the inside bus jobs really.

              5 days work, 1 weekday off 1 weekend off. If u work OT pay OT. If u work less, get the base pay. No such thing as office hour work, working on weekdays only. 
              
              If u work on a Sunday/PH, got additional pay. If u work on your off days, u get extra pay.  
              
              Incentive wise just follow the normal standard
              
              maternity leave up to 4 months
              paternity leave up to 1 month
              21 days AL per year
              The more MC a driver incur the lesser bonus he get at the end of the fiscal year. 
              If the BC never follow timing, the lesser bonus he get
              If the BC kena complain numerous time, lesser bonus also
              Accident, punctuality also plays a part. If ure late, u earn lesser at the end of the month. $20 deducted per latecomings. I will grace time of 10 minutes only. 
              
              Excuses of miss the bus, wake up late, no taxi, no uber, no grab are unacceptable, if ure not happy can go F off. 
              
              If got family excuse, then negotiate on the number of days off u need but dont step over my head. If u fail to oblige by the deal, you will face the axe.

              <p>Ensure no train breakdown. Ensure there's a quota to be achived every month(i.e. 0 breakdown in a month = bonus) etc.</p>
              <p>Ensure that buses are deployed at the right amount with the no. of BCs available, not add bus and have ghost bus. </p>

              <p>Anyway, with regards to the buses, I want as many bus models as possible. Then the bus drivers and technicians got the opportunity to try out different kinds of buses. Because everyday do the same thing very sian, so might as well spice things up a bit: have all the bus models that the company possibly can.</p>
                  
                  <p>Same method as Tower Transit: no fixed deployment. The depot got what bus jiu take what bus.</p>

              I am a fair and balanced individual, i am not too kind and im not too cruel. If u keep thinking abt people feelings, u get stepped over. If u keep thinking abt urself, u will feel egoistic. So must strike a balance. U can think about people problems at the same time u have to assure that he doesnt repeat his mistakes.

              <p>good idea.</p>
              <p>I agree that bendy buses should remain on our roads, so that the future generations will know what is a bendy bus and how it feels like riding on one.</p>
              <p>full-day bus lanes on all busy roads would really help with the frequency and reliability, but I think more can be done, like dedicated bridges and traffic lights (you know, the one ever used before by TIBS?)</p>
              <p>about the smart deployment, actually that one is already being done. that's why we have SWTs and capacity upgrade, and now we also have real-time tracking.</p>
