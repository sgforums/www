Only TIBS did.<br><br>At least u guys should be appreciative that Tibs was at least willing to splurge a few more thousands to provide style and maximum comfort to passengers (well, if you fail to feel these, too bad). The problem now is that SMRT has more services to handle with the same number of buses TIBS had, so even if SMRT continues to follow TIBS and buy expensive buses but also improve their service, I dont see why not buses tt are a bit more expensive be bought.</div>

Infact, many of the developed countries bus co do that. I believe the make and chassis of European buses are having more plus points over regional counterparts.<br><br>For SMRT, take the UDs and Mercedes O.405s for example, their age difference is only by a year, but differences in performances are far beyond that.</div></blockquote>although i am not a guy living in Singapore<br>i really support yr ideas<br><br>in my view,European buese hv a higher perforamce<br>like Man,Scania,Volvo<br>although they need a higher price,but they worth it<br>for example,they can provide SLF,a more powerful engine,<br>a better shock absorb etc.............<br>and the important is,a better and user-friendly control</div>
