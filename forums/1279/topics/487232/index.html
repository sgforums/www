              i would not hope for buses to become driverless; or else lots of people are going to lose job opportunities. if every trade becomes automated, it going to spell big trouble for the society. and the economy looks like declining now. as more unemployment is expected to rise, we may expect bus captains vacancies to be filled up more easily.
              
              Rather i would hope for truly clean fuel technology where vehicles will not emit any pollutants at all. the roads air quality are getting worse due to increase in vehicle population. even with euro 5 or 6 technologies, its still polluting the air and as these vehicles ages, emission only get worse.
              
              and i also long for a breakthrough in suspension system for double-deck buses. suspension for ADDs which are as good as the current single-deckers such as MAN A22 and Citaros. And are we able to develop a brake system that cause minimal impact to standing pax even when the bus brakes sharply?

              <p>I'd say the government thought of another rather different approach to replace large use of buses here in sg and that is the construction of the various automated medium capacity rail lines.</p>
              <p>The circle line, downtown line, and thomson-marine parade line replaces or will replace some of the corridors that have rather heavy bus usage, by providing stops that are within walking distance and with stable frequency unlike buses.</p>
              <p>Doing so helps to stablise the frequency/headways as well as removing some traffic off the roads, and hopefully in turn providing a smoother and faster journey for the remaining bus services which can help to reduce route-fleet sizes.</p>
              <p>The only downsides are the cost.</p>
