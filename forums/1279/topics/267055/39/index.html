              <p>Ride summary:</p>
              <p>Bus was SBS0923M (BNDEP SP). I had waited at the bus stop at Lor 4, wondering what would be the deployment today. I 74744'ed it. It replied: 11 mins.</p>
              <p>At 08:11, I saw it coming. I took it. The bc straightaway asked me, "Going where?" The reply "shenton way" and i dropped in three $1 coins, a 20c coin and a 10c coin. With a button press, the validator chimed to life and out came a piece of paper with several numbers and letters mixed together, apparently in code. The words:</p>
              <p>0923   09AP   535   1A   02*   3034<br>08:11   PA      330c</p>
              <p>with a background "SBS Transit  NOT TRANSFERABLE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS FARE INCLUSIVE OF GST". Twice. And half a T below that.</p>
              <p>As i sat down on the side-facing seats, the bus engine started. The bus turned. It stopped at Lorong 6, picking up 4? passengers. It then went over the flyover at top speed and raced for the Central Expressway. Caught by a red light, it stopped there as we queued up to turn. A green signal came on and we turned and went head-on into a jam.</p>
              <p>Meeting up with a sv569 bus, the bc carefully manoeuvered the big bus through the narrow gaps on the cte. We passed an EMAS vehicle and the bus began to speed up. We travelled at top speed, like as if it were in a race, and then entered a tunnel. We continued going at full speed, the minutes ticking away and the driver's display giving out a dull "beep". The light soon came on and we left the tunnel. Still speeding furiously, I realised we had lost sight of the sv569 that was behind. The bus kept going. It passed by an exit within mere meters of slamming into the side. The bus kept going. And going. And going.</p>
              <p>Soon another tunnel popped by. We still went through it, smoothly as ever. The ride through that tunnel probably took 4 minutes or so. The lights first were Orange. Then just plain white light. Then as quickly as we got in, we left the tunnel and went straight for the outram road exit. Passing by a bus stop on the right lane, the bc tried to get to the destination as fast as possible. He kept going at cantonment road, avoiding other vehicles and trying hard to reach on time. He then turned and went onto Anson road, the bell rang and a few passengers got off.</p>
              <p>He kept going. The bus then went towards the 4 other bus stops. Bell ring. Brakes applied. Bus stops. Sounds of cards tapping. Again. Again. Again. Soon we pulled into Fullerton Road, the final bus stop. With another bell ring, another application of brakes and another grinding to a halt at the bus stop, I left via the front door, smiling to the bc in the process. It was 8:43 am. It had only taken 32 mins.</p>

With a button press, the validator chimed to life and out came a piece of paper with several numbers and letters mixed together, apparently in code. The words:</p>

              <p>with a background "SBS Transit  NOT TRANSFERABLE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS FARE INCLUSIVE OF GST". Twice. And half a T below that.</p>
              <p>As i sat down on the side-facing seats, the bus engine started. The bus turned. It stopped at Lorong 6, picking up 4? passengers. It then went over the flyover at top speed and raced for the Central Expressway. Caught by a red light, it stopped there as we queued up to turn. A green signal came on and we turned and went head-on into a jam.</p>
              <p>Meeting up with a sv569 bus, the bc carefully manoeuvered the big bus through the narrow gaps on the cte. We passed an EMAS vehicle and the bus began to speed up. We travelled at top speed, like as if it were in a race, and then entered a tunnel. We continued going at full speed, the minutes ticking away and the driver's display giving out a dull "beep". The light soon came on and we left the tunnel. Still speeding furiously, I realised we had lost sight of the sv569 that was behind. The bus kept going. It passed by an exit within mere meters of slamming into the side. The bus kept going. And going. And going.</p>
              <p>Soon another tunnel popped by. We still went through it, smoothly as ever. The ride through that tunnel probably took 4 minutes or so. The lights first were Orange. Then just plain white light. Then as quickly as we got in, we left the tunnel and went straight for the outram road exit. Passing by a bus stop on the right lane, the bc tried to get to the destination as fast as possible. He kept going at cantonment road, avoiding other vehicles and trying hard to reach on time. He then turned and went onto Anson road, the bell rang and a few passengers got off.</p>
              <p>He kept going. The bus then went towards the 4 other bus stops. Bell ring. Brakes applied. Bus stops. Sounds of cards tapping. Again. Again. Again. Soon we pulled into Fullerton Road, the final bus stop. With another bell ring, another application of brakes and another grinding to a halt at the bus stop, I left via the front door, smiling to the bc in the process. It was 8:43 am. It had only taken 32 mins.</p>

              <p>I summarise for you:</p>
              <p>I boarded SBS 0923 M (BN SP) on 535 at Toa Payoh Lor 4. I waited 11min after finding out thru irisnextbus sms service.</p>
              <p>I boarded the bus at 08:11. As I was not in working attire, the BC asked for my destination. I paid the fare by coins just as I answered "Shenton Way" to him. I received a ticket from the validator with the following details on it:</p>
              <p>0923   09AP   535   1A   02*   3034<br>08:11   PA      330c</p>
              <p>with the bus company's logo and terms and conditions disclaimer in the background.</p>
              <p>I sat down on the side-facing seats. The bus picked up about 4 more passengers at the Toa Payoh Access Rd stop before continuing its journey to Shenton Way. As there was a heavy traffic on Braddell Rd, the bus was not able to clear the Braddell Flyover junction within the first traffic cycle.</p>
              <p>My bus met up with a S569 bus on the CTE. When the bus got onto lane 3 of the expressway, it sped into its top speed as it was running late. As a result, the S569 bus was nowhere to be seen from behind.</p>
              <p>The bus finally arrived at Anson Rd, the first stop in the Shenton Way district. A few passengers got off at this bus stop. More passengers alighted subsequently and we arrived at the last stop - Fullerton Rd at 0843hrs. I thanked the BC for the ride and alighted via the front door after a good 32min on the bus.</p>
              <p>==================================================</p>
              <p>Your ride details sounds like you are talking on msn. I hoped you have passed your summary skills in sec sch.</p>

              <p>Ride summary:</p>
              <p>Bus was SBS0923M (BNDEP SP). I had waited at the bus stop at Lor
              4, wondering what would be the deployment today. I 74744'ed it. It
              replied: 11 mins.</p>
              <p>At 08:11, I saw it coming. I took it. The bc straightaway asked
              me, "Going where?" The reply "shenton way" and i dropped in three
              $1 coins, a 20c coin and a 10c coin. With a button press, the
              validator chimed to life and out came a piece of paper with several
              numbers and letters mixed together, apparently in code. The
              words:</p>
              <p>0923   09AP   535   1A   02*  
              3034<br> 08:11   PA      330c</p>
              <p>with a background "SBS Transit  NOT TRANSFERABLE SUBJECT TO
              CONDITIONS FARE INCLUSIVE OF GST". Twice. And half a T below
              that.</p>
              <p>As i sat down on the side-facing seats, the bus engine started.
              The bus turned. It stopped at Lorong 6, picking up 4? passengers.
              It then went over the flyover at top speed and raced for the
              Central Expressway. Caught by a red light, it stopped there as we
              queued up to turn. A green signal came on and we turned and went
              head-on into a jam.</p>
              <p>Meeting up with a sv569 bus, the bc carefully manoeuvered the
              big bus through the narrow gaps on the cte. We passed an EMAS
              vehicle and the bus began to speed up. We travelled at top speed,
              like as if it were in a race, and then entered a tunnel. We
              continued going at full speed, the minutes ticking away and the
              driver's display giving out a dull "beep". The light soon came on
              and we left the tunnel. Still speeding furiously, I realised we had
              lost sight of the sv569 that was behind. The bus kept going. It
              passed by an exit within mere meters of slamming into the side. The
              bus kept going. And going. And going.</p>
              <p>Soon another tunnel popped by. We still went through it,
              smoothly as ever. The ride through that tunnel probably took 4
              minutes or so. The lights first were Orange. Then just plain white
              light. Then as quickly as we got in, we left the tunnel and went
              straight for the outram road exit. Passing by a bus stop on the
              right lane, the bc tried to get to the destination as fast as
              possible. He kept going at cantonment road, avoiding other vehicles
              and trying hard to reach on time. He then turned and went onto
              Anson road, the bell rang and a few passengers got off.</p>
              <p>He kept going. The bus then went towards the 4 other bus stops.
              Bell ring. Brakes applied. Bus stops. Sounds of cards tapping.
              Again. Again. Again. Soon we pulled into Fullerton Road, the final
              bus stop. With another bell ring, another application of brakes and
              another grinding to a halt at the bus stop, I left via the front
              door, smiling to the bc in the process. It was 8:43 am. It had only
              taken 32 mins.</p>
