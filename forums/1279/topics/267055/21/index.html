              today Premium 548 was severely late. SBS3787 of Sv 13 only reach YCK Terminal at 8.22am. BC rest for a while and then change the desto to Premium 548 and departed YCK at 8.27 am. Think it reach the first bus stop at around 8.33 am. By the time, it reach Anson road, i think it will be around 9.45 am, as roads in AMK and CTE were severely jammed as well. Just before SBS3787 departed YCK Terminal, 4 more service 13 buses arrive at YCK terminal.
              Maybe SBST should give free rides for these passengers who are waiting patiently for this bus, as it is late for more than 30 mins. Passengers are paying premium but then they are not compensated when the bus is late and thus these passengers are also late for work and they do not know when the bus will be coming..
              Wonder what is the contingency plan for such situation? Today is worst case, cos a lot of buses were late due to jam everywhere in Singapore.

              <p>That aside, I think buses should have the right to a dedicated bus lane during peak hours for premiums along the expressways. Best of all, widen the road shoulder and let buses pass through if there are no emergency vehicles using it.</p>

              it reach Anson road, i think it will be around 9.45 am, as roads in
              <span>AMK</span> and <span>CTE</span> were
              severely jammed as well. Just before <span>SBS3787</span> departed <span>YCK</span> Terminal, 4 more service 13
              buses arrive at <span>YCK</span> terminal.<br> Maybe <span>SBST</span> should give free rides for these
              passengers who are waiting patiently for this bus, as it is late
              for more than 30 mins. Passengers are paying premium but then they
              are not compensated when the bus is late and thus these passengers
              are also late for work and they do not know when the bus will be
              coming..<br> Wonder what is the contingency plan for such situation? Today is
              worst case, cos a lot of buses were late due to jam everywhere in
              Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Actually if the YCK route master is flexible enough, he may allow the earlier SD/DD bus to operate on S548 so that the departure time would not be affected.

              <p><br>think SBST really need a back up plan for these premium service. Cos it is only one trip and any delay, will results in the passengers being late and then affect the ridership. What you say is true cos the route master should know whether the buses will be late or not. BUt then today, almost 5 sv 13 buses arrive at YCK terminal within a space of 8 mins. First bus arrive was 3787. So i think it is quite difficult to use the earlier bus also.</p>
              <p>So u mean the sBST staff will be on board to apologize ah? SBST should really consider giving free rides to compensate for the delay.. or maybe just ask standby BC at AMDEP to do this premium sv if the original slated bus is late? Each premium service should have a backup bus/service to relay on.</p>

              <p><br>You waste resources if you specially assign one BC and one bus on standby. The best way is to do an adhoc xover from another service say 162 76 or 70.. if route is DD friendly just use the DD.</p>
              <p>There was once 1971S broke down at the toa payoh stadium stop as 31. the BC koped the next available bus which was 9402R and did 535 thereafter.
