              <p>Personally, I feel like some routes can be numbered so that it meets other routes of the same numbers, if you know what I mean</p>
              <p>For example, 111 is a complete oddball in the west and the city now. If it is not going back to its old route, it may be renumbered 90. Why?</p>
              <p>1. Meets 92 &amp; 97 along the way</p>
              <p>2. 111 can be reused for a future northeast service</p>
              <p>3. The old 90 can be renumbered as 144, as it is based at TPY along with other 14x services. It also meets 151 (1xx) &amp; 94 (x4)</p>

              <p>Hi mr smb145B, there are many long distance bus routes in the past. Some people travel 30% of a bus route, some people travel the other 70% of the bus route. Some travel 20%, some travel 45% of a route. This was made possible by the nature of the bus routes introduced in the early decades. Nowadays the new routes introduced do not allow this sort of commute anymore as they are basically very short in nature. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr smb1368T, you don't need to feel this way. Those additional numbers 41, 49 are introduced as BSEP much later on than the 40s series. By then, they do not feel any necessities to follow the need to restrict to west or east. With the contracting model implementation, it is going to be even more messy with each company to a different bus service number. Cheers. Thanks.Â </p>

              <p>My take.</p>
              <p>1) Â  182 and 258 should have swapped numbers, given that the current 258 bears more similarity to 181 than the other JIS services.</p>
              <p>2) Â  990, 941, 945, 947 may do well with new service numbers 340, 341, 345, 347.</p>
              <p>3) Â  Bt Panjang service numbers are a mess and would have been better organized if 700, 971E, 75, 184, 176, 177 become 971, 972E, 973, 974, 976 and 977 respectively.</p>
              <p>4) Â  980 and 981 should get out of the 9xx regions when CCK services start occupying them. Probably to either 88x or 84x. Alternatively 980 can be renumbered 164 to follow 166 and 167.</p>
              <p>5) Â  76 would made sense to be renumbered 71, for 70-74 all to serve in the NE and 71-74 to passby AMK.</p>
              <p>6) Â  158 should be renumbered 108 such that all Serangoon trunks follow 10x, even if some 10x don't go to Serangoon.</p>
              <p>7) Â  4xx should be open for new trunk services, such that new SBST/TTS/GAS services don't have to fight over 1, 44, (68), 71, 104, 108, 110, 114, 126, 127, 129, 137, 144, 146, 148, 149, 152, 164, 202-209.</p>
              <p>8) Â  0 can be used on a circular loop service, with 0G and 0W denoting the direction of the loop.</p>
              <p>9) Â  Neither 995 nor 999 should be used as bus service numbers.</p>
              <p>Then again, most of the stuff here are just our one-sided wishes that most likely won't be implemented anyway.</p>

              <p>Just like our route suggestions</p>
              <p>147 should have been 164 too to meet other 16x services. All other 14x services are at TPY while this one is at Hougang although it might meet 143 on the way</p>
              <p>As for 980, it can be renumbered as 880 to meet 882</p>
              <p>I thought the route for 971E would have been different?</p>

              <p>It appears to be time for another history lesson with regards to how the bus numbering system evolved to its present state.</p>
              <p>As part of the mass bus service reorganisation in April 1971, the bus numbering systems for STC and the 10 smaller Chinese bus companies were integrated into a new standardised and shared bus numbering system, which initially ran between 1 and 208.</p>
              <p><strong>0x (1 - 4):</strong> Changi Point (present day Changi Village; excluding 5 from Sungei Bedok)<br><strong>1x (10 - 13):</strong> Bedok (present day Sungei Bedok)<br><strong>2x (20 - 22):</strong> Opera Estate<br><strong>3x (30 - 33):</strong> Changi Rd (near present day Siglap)<br><strong>4x (40 - 46):</strong> Telok Kurau (excluding 45/46 from Kallang Park/Tg Rhu)<br><strong>5x (50 - 52):</strong> Kaki Bukit/Eunos<br><strong>6x (60 - 65):</strong> MacPherson Estate<br><strong>7x (70 - 72):</strong> Geylang? (excluding 72 from S'goon Gardens)<br><strong>8x (80 - 84):</strong> Tampines (present day Upper Changi)/Punggol<br><strong>9x (90 - 95):</strong> Paya Lebar Airport (excluding 94 from Kolam Ayer)<br><strong>10x (100 - 104):</strong> Serangoon Gardens Estate<br><strong>11x (110 - 112):</strong> Hougang<br><strong>12x (120 - 126):</strong> St. Michael's Estate<br><strong>13x (130 - 131):</strong> Balestier<br><strong>14x (140 - 149):</strong> Toa Payoh New Town<br><strong>15x (150 - 159):</strong> Toa Payoh New Town (excluding 154 from MacPherson Est via TPY)<br><strong>16x (160 - 166):</strong> Sembawang/Sembawang Hills Estate<br><strong>17x (170 - 177):</strong> Queen St and mixture of western regions (Lim Chu Kang, Princess Elizabeth Estate, NU/NTI, Tuas Village, Jurong)<br><strong>18x (180 - 182):</strong> Bukit Timah<br><strong>19x (190 - 199):</strong> Mixture of western and southern regions (Delta, Ulu Pandan, Buona Vista, Bukit Timah, South Canal Rd, Bukit Merah, Jurong)<br><strong>20x (200 - 208):</strong> Mixture of short trunk services in the western and southern regions (Bukit Timah (includes Toh Tuck Estate), Jurong, Kranji)</p>
              <p>When SBS was merged from the 3 bus operators in 1973, more bus services were introduced, which led to the introduction of more bus service series in the 1970s:</p>
              <p><strong>21x (210 - 219):</strong> Initially meant for any feeder service around the island since 1976<br><strong>22x (220 - 229):</strong> Feeder buses based in Bedok New Town since 1976<br><strong>23x (230 - 239):</strong> Feeder buses based in Toa Payoh New Town since 1976<br><strong>24x (240 - 249):</strong> Industrial/residential feeder buses based in Jurong since 1977<br><strong>25x (250 - 258):</strong> Industrial feeder buses based in Jurong Industrial Estate since 1978<br><strong>26x (260 - 269):</strong> Feeder buses based in Ang Mo Kio New Town since 1978<br><strong>27x (271 - 275):</strong> Feeder buses based in Bukit Merah New Town since 1979<br><strong>28x (282 - 287):</strong> Feeder buses based in Clementi New Town since 1979<br><strong>30x (301 - 308):</strong> Blue Arrow peak hour buses since 1975<br><strong>40x (401 - 409):</strong> Special buses, usually operating on weekends/PHs only<br><strong>45x (450): </strong>Special buses, usually operating on weekends/PHs only</p>
              <p>When TIBS commenced operations in 1983, more bus service series were introduced into the 1980s, along with more bus services series from the SBS:</p>
              <p><em>TIBS series</em></p>
              <p><strong>80x (800 - 806):</strong> Feeder buses based in Yishun New Town since 1984<br><strong>82x (825):</strong> Lentor Estate bus service since 1988<br><strong>85x (850 - 859):</strong> Trunk buses based in Yishun New Town since 1985<br><strong>90x (900 - 906):</strong> Feeder buses based in Woodlands New Town since 1985<br><strong>92x (925 - 927):</strong> Special buses based in Woodlands New Town since 1986<br><strong>95x (950 - 952):</strong> Trunk buses based in Woodlands New Town since 1989</p>
              <p><em>SBS series</em></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"><strong>29x (290 - 297):</strong> Feeder buses based in Tampines New Town since 1983</span><br><strong>31x (312 - 318):</strong> Feeder buses based in Serangoon New Town since 1984<br><strong>32x (321 - 329):</strong> Feeder buses based in Hougang New Town since 1982<br><strong>33x (331 - 336):</strong> Feeder buses based in Jurong East New Town since 1983<br><strong>34x (343 - 345):</strong> Feeder buses based in Bukit Panjang New Town between 1988 and 2000<br><strong>35x (353):</strong> Feeder buses based in Bishan New Town between 1986 and 1988<br><strong>36x (361 - 367):</strong> Feeder buses based in Bukit Batok New Town between 1985 and 2003<br><strong>37x (372):</strong> Feeder buses based in Woodlands New Town between 1982 and 1996<br><strong>38x (382 - 385):</strong> Feeder buses based in Eunos between 1986 and 2002<br><strong>39x (390 - 395):</strong> Changi Airport bus services</p>
              <p>As the 1990s arrived, more bus service series were rolled out by both SBS/TIBS:</p>
              <p><strong>41x (410):</strong> Initially meant for Townlink services in general in 1992; now limited to feeder buses based in Bishan New Town<br><strong>50x (501 - 508):</strong> Express buses (SBS) since 1997<br><strong>52x (520 - 521):</strong> Express buses (TIBS) since 1997<br><strong>60x (602 - 608): </strong>City Shuttle buses since 1997<br><strong>70x (700): </strong>RapidBus buses since 1998<br><strong>81x (811 - 812):</strong> Intra-Town buses based in Yishun New Town since 1996<br><strong>86x (860 - 866):</strong> Trunk buses based in Sengkang New Town between 1998 and 1999<br><strong>91x (911 - 913):</strong> Intra-Town buses based in Woodlands New Town since 1996<br><strong>96x (960 - 969):</strong> Trunk buses based in Woodlands New Town since 1996<br><strong>98x (980 - 981):</strong> Trunk buses based in Sembawang New Town since 1998</p>
              <p>And finally, a few more bus service series only came out in the new millennium (2000s and 2010s):</p>
              <p><strong>51x (511 - 518):</strong> Express buses (SBS) since 2000<br><strong>53x (530 - 539): </strong>Premium buses<br><strong>54x (540 - 549): </strong>Premium buses<br><strong>55x (550 - 559): </strong>Premium/CityShopper buses<br><strong>56x (560 - 569): </strong>Premium buses<br><strong>57x (570 - 579): </strong>CityShopper buses<br><strong>58x (580 - 589): </strong>Premium/CityShopper buses<br><strong>59x (590 - 599): </strong>Premium buses<br><strong>71x (711 - 718): </strong>Jurong Island buses since 2000<br><strong>76x (760 - 769): </strong>Premium buses<br><strong>88x (882):</strong> Trunk buses based in Sembawang New Town since 2005<br><strong>94x (941 - 947): </strong>Feeder buses based in Bukit Batok New Town since 2003<br><strong>97x (970 - 979):</strong> Trunk buses based in Bukit Panjang New Town since 2000<br><strong>99x (990):</strong> Trunk buses based in Bukit Batok New Town since 2014</p>
              <p>And now, the changes to the service coverage of bus services in different bus service series over the decades:</p>
