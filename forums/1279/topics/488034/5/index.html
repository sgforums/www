              <p>I'm not arguing for the merits and demerits of the policy, but I
              think I should lay down the extreme ends and you decide for
              yourself, where Singapore could lead to if it swings to either
              extremes.</p>
              <p>When I say find alternatives, I mean they don't wait for
              problems to be resolved on their own when a train line is
              disrupted. They move their butts, and take taxis or buses to their
              destination. They don't expect the Government or the corporations
              to hold their hands and bring them around. They are not spoilt
              brats, they are a resourceful people who will give you a run for
              your money. If a Hongkonger were to wait for the bus for an hour,
              if he senses that buses are not arriving or are always full, he
              would already have walked to the train station or took a minibus
              (in HK). A Singaporean would cry injustice and malice, and demand
              an answer, as if it would solve anything. But I'd agree that when
              indeed a bus turns up after an hour, he might have infringed QoS
              which they must consent to abide to before operations can
              commence.</p>
              <p>May I point out that migrant workers, or even skilled migrants,
              are not entitled to preferential rates in many government
              institutions like HDB and polyclinics. Their right to use public
              resources comes from the tax they pay. The Government is definitely
              on its way there in augmenting its resources, while population
              growth has slowed down significantly last year. But, let's say, we
              remove all these people overnight, you will realise the difference
              they make. Costs, and hence prices, will escalate sharply. I don't
              want to debate about immigration policy not only because our focus
              is on public transport, but that it is irrelevant to say we do away
              with them. Migrant workers will be needed where justified (do you
              want a 3-room HDB to cost $800,000?), and infrastructure must be
              strengthened as quickly as possible to match it without a strain on
              construction capital.</p>

              <p>further, if those students dont really bother about 30 cents increase, then you should be seeing full fleet of DDs deploying on 74E/151E....</p>

                                      <p>That's because their activity centre is dense. Take 271 for example. Do you even think you can fill up a DD every 5 to 10 minutes for a bus service from Orchard Road to Pasir Ris? Dream on! Then we take 74X for example, it's like Tampines to Chinatown, or an equivalent area where the buildings are older and people are poorer. Buses depart as quickly as once every 3 minutes. Boarding never quite stops at the terminus. When your area is less dense, you get trunk services or long headways, just ask those living in Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi, how do they get to Mongkok. 30X, 31B, 32, 33A, 234X, 35A, 36B, 37, 41, 44, 46. Entire journeys can take more than an hour! Tsing Yi has a 41A that should have been a 41X, but I have never seen a standee even during peak hours. There is a 63X that skips Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan, huge population centres. But after a year plus, even Enviro 400's got downgraded to KUB's. And that famous 51 that has 60-minute headway. Industrial routes like 72A and 74A with at least a wait of 30 minutes, up to an hour. You can say it is profit-driven, you can also say it's sustainable and demand-driven. They have express routes for certain places because I have a ready pool of commuters who are all headed to one area, and it must make sense to run express. I just make sure that I cover my cost and fill up every bus to the best utility.</p>
                                      
                        <p>Here in HK, bus companies run services on profit, and each route has a different fare because different kinds of routes have different cost structures. Are you willing to pay the fares HKers pay and live with their density in towering blocks to enjoy the kind of services they enjoy? One bus stop/terminus could be shared by a dozen point blocks or "+" shaped blocks of over 40 storeys. No wonder we can gather over 100 people all ready to head to town within 5 minutes during peak hours! Even running a headway of 15 minutes during off-peak is profitable because there will be standees. You think the buses in HK are not efficiently utilised? You think private enterprises running on profit å‚»å˜…? I have mentioned in one example earlier that a bus ride from Stanley to Kwai Fong will cost S$4.18 and 1 hour; a similar journey in Singapore using MRT will probably take only 5 minutes more but costs just S$1.93.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>And some routes, they are express because, for example, Shatin and Kowoon is probably just seperated by a tunnel or a forested area. There is nothing of interest to the commuters because their origin and destination are so dense. Let's not forget that the resident density of Kowloon is 46,000. That is 7 times the density of the entire Singapore. Even HK Island is 15,000. The amount of people here would have driven most Singaporeans crazy if they had to reside here, but it made perfect sense to skip stops because the people at bus stops are freewheeling. å®¢å¦‚è¼ªè½‰. And it would have been much worse, the roads would be immovable, had there not been MTR, no matter how often it breaks down as well. And their fare is higher than SG too because their cost base is high! And I know the basis that MTR do price determination, it is not by cost, but by placing themselves at the right price point versus alternatives. Why would they price themselves at cost? They are also not doing a public service, eveb if they are in the public transport business and wholly owned by the Government!</p> 
                                      
                                      <p>And at evey other post, you refuse to acknowledge that LTA is working on the rail system again. Am I talking to a broken recorder? And so you recognise that HK has insufficient coverage of bus services in TKO. So, HK has its problems too. But at least these people, while complaining, they find alternatives. Go down to Kwun Tong via 601/619  and then take 98A or something. I don't see people doing that in Singapore yet. Do you even see a breakdown guide telling people the bus service alternatives in HK? No, they know exactly how to get themselves out of the situation.</p>

              <p>The utility derived from the same 30 cents varies between people, between things. When I say "people will not spend that 30 cents more to take an express bus", it does not mean they will not find a 30-cent upgrade to a larger drink more enticing, and of a higher utility.</p>

              <p>That's because their activity centre is dense. Take 271 for
              example. Do you even think you can fill up a DD every 5 to 10
              minutes for a bus service from Orchard Road to Pasir Ris? Dream on!
              Then we take 74X for example, it's like Tampines to Chinatown, or
              an equivalent area where the buildings are older and people are
              poorer. Buses depart as quickly as once every 3 minutes. Boarding
              never quite stops at the terminus. When your area is less dense,
              you get trunk services or long headways, just ask those living in
              Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi, how do they get to Mongkok.
              30X, 31B, 32, 33A, 234X, 35A, 36B, 37, 41, 44, 46. Entire journeys
              can take more than an hour! Tsing Yi has a 41A that should have
              been a 41X, but I have never seen a standee even during peak hours.
              There is a 63X that skips Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan, huge
              population centres. But after a year plus, even Enviro 400's got
              downgraded to KUB's. And that famous 51 that has 60-minute headway.
              Industrial routes like 72A and 74A with at least a wait of 30
              minutes, up to an hour. You can say it is profit-driven, you can
              also say it's sustainable and demand-driven. They have express
              routes for certain places because I have a ready pool of commuters
              who are all headed to one area, and it must make sense to run
              express. I just make sure that I cover my cost and fill up every
              bus to the best utility.</p>
              <p>Here in HK, bus companies run services on profit, and each route
              has a different fare because different kinds of routes have
              different cost structures. Are you willing to pay the fares HKers
              pay and live with their density in towering blocks to enjoy the
              kind of services they enjoy? One bus stop/terminus could be shared
              by a dozen point blocks or "+" shaped blocks of over 40 storeys. No
              wonder we can gather over 100 people all ready to head to town
              within 5 minutes during peak hours! Even running a headway of 15
              minutes during off-peak is profitable because there will be
              standees. You think the buses in HK are not efficiently utilised?
              You think private enterprises running on profit å‚»å˜…? I have
              mentioned in one example earlier that a bus ride from Stanley to
              Kwai Fong will cost S$4.18 and 1 hour; a similar journey in
              Singapore using MRT will probably take only 5 minutes more but
              costs just S$1.93.</p>
              <p>And some routes, they are express because, for example, Shatin
              and Kowoon is probably just seperated by a tunnel or a forested
              area. There is nothing of interest to the commuters because their
              origin and destination are so dense. Let's not forget that the
              resident density of Kowloon is 46,000. That is 7 times the density
              of the entire Singapore. Even HK Island is 15,000. The amount of
              people here would have driven most Singaporeans crazy if they had
              to reside here, but it made perfect sense to skip stops because the
              people at bus stops are freewheeling. å®¢å¦‚è¼ªè½‰. And it would have been
              much worse, the roads would be immovable, had there not been MTR,
              no matter how often it breaks down as well. And their fare is
              higher than SG too because their cost base is high! And I know the
              basis that MTR do price determination, it is not by cost, but by
              placing themselves at the right price point versus alternatives.
              Why would they price themselves at cost? They are also not doing a
              public service, eveb if they are in the public transport business
              and wholly owned by the Government!</p>
              <p>And at evey other post, you refuse to acknowledge that LTA is
              working on the rail system again. Am I talking to a broken
              recorder? And so you recognise that HK has insufficient coverage of
              bus services in TKO. So, HK has its problems too. But at least
              these people, while complaining, they find alternatives. Go down to
              Kwun Tong via 601/619 and then take 98A or something. I don't see
              people doing that in Singapore yet. Do you even see a breakdown
              guide telling people the bus service alternatives in HK? No, they
              know exactly how to get themselves out of the situation.</p>

              <p>One main problem with SG is, even many of its trunks have become like a long feeder svc spanning over multiple areas. It doesnt encourage long-distance travel at all! How to use as alternatives when you hv trunks that randomly spur into narrow alleys in the middle of a major road. And no, SG rail hasnt been properly done until when i see the CRL. And even then i still dont know if the final outcome will be as desired. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>To make long story short it would be best if express svcs could operate for peak hours on weekdays, and then for full day after the early hours of morning for weekends. Liddat more flexible and effective coz categorising weekends under "off-peak" is just ridiculous. I mean, look at all 'em ppl heading to town and other key places like JE! Launching express svcs on weekends could not only ease congestion on MRT lines, but also give commuters a direct, fast and relatively more comfortable choice of transport to go home.</div>

              <p>506 doesnt skip stops, but rather makes use of the PIE all the way to Bedok Reservoir.</p>
              <p>Considered express I guess due to the fact that they serve less than four pairs of bus stop per direction</p>

              <p>in my opinion, I feel that, seriously feel that, the entire public bus network needs a revamp.</p>
              <p>99 (Jurong West) can be shortened to terminate at Jurong East, since not many people actually take it all the way to Clementi. Likewise for 198, which is only heavily utilised up to Jurong East/West Avenue 1.</p>

              <p>Yes. I know this may result in some bus interchanges becoming redundant, as new bus interchanges are built at new strategic locations (need not be next to MRT, just need to be a convenient place for bus routes to terminate). So be it. Let this be an investment. Short-term expenditure for Long-term savings.</p>
