We have unlimited wants, but limited resources to bear; between using buses to reduce commuting times to what the MRT can achieve and bringing the first bus service to a new estate, I will choose the latter.</p>

              <p>Well, I think one reason why the Government is not relying solely on transport fares, is to help the lower income people. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">this is related to "Progressive tax", whereby the poor pay less tax, while the rich pay more tax.</span></p>

              <p>There's an easy solution to this. Have 518 serve Shenton Way (the same stops as 502 currently serves) before hitting the expressway.</p>

              <p>196E should have 2 SDs --&gt; DD</p>
              <p>14E should have its Orchard touch 8.30am service as DD </p>

              <p>If there is growth in ridership in the evening trips for 513, I would see no reason why they won't add a bus. But if you make 513 operate on a whole day basis, 518 could end up being withdrawn due to low ridership, especially after DTL comes onboard.</p>

              <p>For express services to be feasible full day, you must be able

              <p>Singapore's bus operations are very simplified due to its
              frequency. In other countries, it is not unusual for a particular
              bus duty to operate more than 5 routes in a single day. This is to
              allow maximization of resources by reducing the layover time at the
