              <p><br> well, just sharing with you an idea that I have. no right or wrong.</p>
              <p>well, if in the end only one person buy the ticket, it means the service not viable to provide. since buy already, of course must provide the service mah. after that, we should cancel the service. when comes to providing public bus services, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">majority wins.</span></p>
              <p>of course, when we implement, there will be some challenges. We need a ticket inspector on every bus to ensure that only people with the ticket board the bus.</p>
              <p>alternatively, we can simply implement a penalty system. if a person takes the bus without a valid ticket or over-ride, he pays more money.</p>
              <p>well, just sharing an idea I have. If not feasible, we can reject it.</p>

              If we only need buses at every corner, we can jolly well withdraw many, many services that have unique links but not serving any area solely on its own. Just have 1 service for each street and ask everyone to go to MRT/Bus Int to transfer. 
              Don't forget that not everyone is willing to take the MRT for 1 or 2 stations, or transfer from feeder to MRT and to feeder again. Especially for inter-town travel. Who would like to travel from Sengkang to Ang Mo Kio by NEL, CCL and NSL when sv 50 is already there? Likewise, services like 3 and 28 are all doing very well even though they ply the so-called minor roads. This kind of services really enhance inter-town connectivity.  Even for some city-bound services, it works - imagine if 972 doesn't make one big round in Bukit Panjang.

              <p><br> If we only need buses at every corner, we can jolly well withdraw
              many, many services that have unique links but not serving any area
              solely on its own. Just have 1 service for each street and ask
              everyone to go to MRT/Bus Int to transfer. Don't forget that not
              everyone is willing to take the MRT for 1 or 2 stations, or
              transfer from feeder to MRT and to feeder again. Especially for
              inter-town travel. Who would like to travel from Sengkang to Ang Mo
              Kio by NEL, CCL and NSL when sv 50 is already there? Likewise,
              services like 3 and 28 are all doing very well even though they ply
              the so-called minor roads. This kind of services really enhance
              inter-town connectivity. Even for some city-bound services, it
              works - imagine if 972 doesn't make one big round in Bukit
              Panjang.</p>

              <p>We could always chop up existing routes and make some sectors express. svcs like 28 are doing well NOT coz it serves many areas. In fact i guarantee you, less than 10 of its pax really take it from the east to central Singapore.</p>
              <p>And feeder - MRT - feeder demand is very very low. Like reallg very lo<span style="line-height: 1.231;">w. So how does that even matter?</span></p>
              <p>Besides, why wont anyone take the MRT if it is FASTER than bus? Surely you wouldnt take like bus 82 from Nex to Punggol MRT, when the MRT could cover the same trip in a fraction of the time taken by bus?</p>

              <p>well, if in the end only one person buy the ticket, it means the
              service not viable to provide. since buy already, of course must
              provide the service mah. after that, we should cancel the service.
              when comes to providing public bus services, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">majority wins.</span></p>
              <p>of course, when we implement, there will be some challenges. We
              need a ticket inspector on every bus to ensure that only people
              with the ticket board the bus.</p>
              <p>alternatively, we can simply implement a penalty system. if a
              person takes the bus without a valid ticket or over-ride, he pays
              more money.</p>
              <p>well, just sharing an idea I have. If not feasible, we can
              reject it.</p>
