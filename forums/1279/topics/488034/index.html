              <p>Yes, we need express bus routes. They will do a great deal in improving our public transport connectivity and attractiveness.</p>
              <p>However, the current express bus routes are those that ply along express-ways and call at every bus stop. We need express bus routes that are truly express - calling at only selected critical bus stops. Otherwise, they are really no different than long trunk bus routes.</p>
              <p>I have suggested this before at the route suggestions thread, but apparently it has been ignored.</p>

              <p>Hi. I would like to suggest a slight re-routing of express bus route 502, at Jurong. The purpose of this is to enhance the express bus connection in Jurong, while improve the express feature of this express bus route.</p>
              <p>Before I go on writing the re-routed route, let me list down the major bus stops in Jurong, which this re-routed route would only serve.</p>
              <p>The intention is for people to take a feeder or trunk bus from their houses to a major bus stop, then transfer to this express bus route. </p>

              <div>Personally, I feel that this is quite a good amendment. It enhances the express bus connection in Jurong residential areas.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>However, although it is better than the current routing, there may still be room for further improvement.</div>

              </blockquote>
              Basically, express bus routes should be like MRT lines. Running long distances but only call at critical bus stops, for people to transfer to/from their local bus routes.
              
              This will ensure coverage, efficiency and profitability.

                  <p>963E works because the demand on 963 is so excessive that I could skip stops and still fill up a bus, even with a higher fare of 60Â¢ more.</p>
                  
                  <p>If Jurong East and Jurong West ain't such massive estates, 502 would have flopped. But it has a time-advantage over the MRT. Same reason why CT8 flourished, but not CT18 or 518. Indeed, if I could get to Chinatown just 10 minutes slower for around 60Â¢ less, why not? Gets me half a cup of coffee!</p>
                  
                  <p>The Singaporean commuter is willing to part with next to nothing for a faster ride. That's the reason why trunk routes help to keep cost pressures down while improving connectivity. MRT fills in as a mode for efficient long-distance travel; we just need effort to keep the systems running well and improve capacity on these lines.</p>

              <p>Take HK for example. Their bus operations should cover the cost, right? I went on a 31-km journey from Stanley to Kwai Fong MTR, entirely by buses. Two trips. Rt 6, then transferring to Rt 930 at Admiralty. I reached my destination in exactly an hour's time. The fare is HK$23.9, or S$4.18.</p>
                              
              <p>Travelling that same distance in Singapore would only cost you S$1.93. Are you willing to pay more than double for express bus services? Maybe, the Government should shield us from this ridiculous pricing. But I have no doubt then that the burden of this difference between revenue and cost will be borned squarely by taxpayers.</p>

              <p>For express services to be feasible full day, you must be able to read timetables and tell the difference between prefixes/suffixes. This is an example used in Adelaide.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/var/metro/storage/original/application/48f25cf256ce337009469234d23e926e.pdf">https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/var/metro/storage/original/application/48f25cf256ce337009469234d23e926e.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Operating hourly services may be a more feasible plan with a published timetable.</p>
              <p>Singapore's bus operations are very simplified due to its frequency. In other countries, it is not unusual for a particular bus duty to operate more than 5 routes in a single day. This is to allow maximization of resources by reducing the layover time at the interchange where bus services are not as frequent.</p>
