              <p>Actually, why don't the LTA just conduct consultations with the
              local RCs and commuters - while check EZ-link card data along the
              way - and introduce bus plans for every town, like what was done by
              SBS around twenty years ago?</p>
              <p>By now, many things have changed. Maybe it is time to implement
              a new set of bus plans for every town of Singapore.</p>

              <p>After the chair-fetching days of 578 &amp; 581, I'm not sure if
              they will still dare to venture into it again. Population might
              have increased, and maybe if the fare is 85¢ more, there will be
              takers. But Orchard Rd, being a retail area, mostly attracts people
              on discretionary travel, who may not see the need to pay more for
              convenience. If they've got hands and legs, why wouldn't they take
              the LRT and NEL and NSL to save that money? But such services
              during peak hours to offices have proven popular, because they go
              to work to earn money. Therein lies the value of express
              services.</p>

              <p>and add on, not many ppl go to orchard road to shop as well nowadays with all those neightbourhood shopping centre... esp during weekday off peak hour... those are working are working, and who else will usually travel during off peak hour? students? will they pay extra for the express services? </p>

              <p>I'd reiterate something I have previously mentioned.</p>
              <p>The government has grossly underestimated the demand for MRT lines after NEL. By building shorter stations (3 cars), they have locked themselves into a fixed capacity limit they cannot resolve in future.</p>
              <p>This problem will eventually return to haunt them in the long run. They could have built longer stations but still run a 3-car service with a provision for twin coupling or addition of carriages per train</p>

              <p>Generally northwards, where there is low density housing. If LTA is willing to pay residents to tear down high rise buildings including Rochor Centre, I don't think this is really an issue. However in the absence of any station or construction diagrams, I can't really comment in detail.</p>
              <p>As a last resort, platforms about the length of 4 to 5 cars can be constructed if the first and last 2 doors of the trainset do not open at these stations. This is practiced in historical London Underground stations. Curved platforms are another possibility (with platform gap filler technology).</p>

              <p>DTL2 will not 100% replace NSL (JE-YT). DTL2 is only along the eastern fringe of Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang. It does not really serve Bukit Gombak. Only at Bukit Panjang is it in the "town centre".</p>

              <p>The capacity was decided based on data projections at that point
              of time and leaves little room for error. For instance, the Thomson
              MRT was supposed to be in three-car configuration, and was later
              increased to four when the numbers were recalculated after the
              GE.</p>

              <p>You can buy more trains, but there are that many trains you can
              squeeze onto a single line after factoring in signalling
              restrictions. Other than expensive upgrades with marginal increases
              that won't solve the problem, the only remaining option is to
              construct an entirely new MRT line.</p>

              <p>You are missing the point, but I will answer anyway.</p>
              <p>I will rather have a 6-car option because a profit-driven operator would rather operate a 3-car train that comes every 180 seconds if they can get away with it and save on one roving staff.</p>

              <p>I believe there are other reasons, could be engineering challenges or others, that has influenced the decision. The Government would not build for the profit of any operators, who can come and go. It will not, however, build without prudence. If the projected ridership is for a 3-car train line, and you decide on gut feel that it should be 4-car, then why not 8-car? If the line runs along unpopulated areas with no site constraints, why not 16-car? The more, the merrier! But I believe that for good reason that they have kept to a 3-car train line. At least they did not go about rationalizing the bus routes that run parallel to the line.</p>
                  
                  <p>Anyway, if I have to save on roving staff, I would rather operate a 6-car train that comes every 360 seconds....</p>

              <p>Currently we have 3-car trainsets at 420 seconds off-peak intervals.</p>
              <p>Anyway...</p>
              <p>The reason why this topic has sprung up in the first place is due to the general unreliability of the MRT network since the 2011 breakdown.</p>
              <p>Trains are running slow because there are too many trains on a given line, compounded by tracks needing repairs. A train has to wait for the train ahead to clear before its own signal is cleared. These delays add on to the commuting time. LTA thinks that adding more trains onto the legacy lines will solve overcrowding.</p>
              <p>In reality the signalling system is maxed out and marginal output is starting to bring negative returns. If you have ever ran a transport simulator, you will know what I mean. This has forced LTA to take a little peak hour demand off the lines through the introduction of City Direct services and perhaps a couple of extra buses on trunk routes.</p>
              <p>The signalling upgrade to EWL and NSL may bring a little breather, but as long as the open-door immigration remains for the forseeable future and 57 C151B trainsets are added on, line capacity is going to be maxed out again in a few years.</p>

                  <p>Do you think the other lines, especially the MTR which has attracted comparisons since the cities are similar, do not experience congestion and unscheduled stops along their busiest lines? The people may grumble but they are quick to find alternatives; they will not let the Government, or any big corporation like the MTR, bring them down. Yet in Singapore, there is this society so reliant on the Government that they believe the world ought to be like this and they cannot think on their feet.

                  <p>I'm not going to debate about the immigration policy here, but you will know that having a closed economy is going to hurt you as well. You can try to build everything with 3.5 million people, but are you able to deliver the kind of productivity that our 5.5-million economy current commands? HK has tried to preserve the local nature of its labour content, and with even manual workers asking for an ethical salary, government flats are smaller than half the size of a 3-room flat, yet costs at least 3 times more than ours. And they can't keep up with the pace; every flat selection exercise is grossly oversubscribed that they resort to throwing out applications where a circle is found where it should be ticked, a cross is found where it should be strokethrough. And they are clearing a hilltop site for a new town and building five rail lines at one go, with one cross-harbour tunnel and another cross-territory tunnel, amongst other major projects. They are reclaiming land to build a third runway and a new terminal building for S$25 billion; we could strength the soil and the third runway, and build Terminal 5 for just over S$3 billion. All that, just because they insist on using a workforce drawn from a 7-million population. You will not see a single South Asian construction worker in Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>...find alternatives. You have just helped to justify carbikebus's argument for more express bus routes as it is the case in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>And I was arguing against it!</p>
              <p>Why do you think so many Hong Kong's youth marched on the streets last year? For "democracy"? Really? Tak boleh tahan!<br><br>I had an foreign bus operator once telling me "if you are not happy with our service, get a f***ing car!". No problem, I can buy one for a few grand in that country. <br><br>Let's say that operator wins a parcel tender, gives you the same reply and refuses to provide any explanation as to why your bus didn't show up for an hour. Do you think you can do the same in Singapore?</p>
              <p>I don't see how you are not debating about Singapore's immigration policy when you are arguing against Hong Kong's immigration policy. I am pointing out that migrant workers in any country still need to take the train, have a place to sleep, and see a doctor if he falls sick and earn a living wage as much as its citizens do.</p>
              <p>They are humans and they are not invisible. They still use public resources. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Whether the government likes it or not they have to make adequate provisions accordingly.</p>
              <p>At this point we have gone way off-topic. On that note I will stop here.</p>

              <p>I'm not arguing for the merits and demerits of the policy, but I think I should lay down the extreme ends and you decide for yourself, where Singapore could lead to if it swings to either extremes.</p>
                   <p>When I say find alternatives, I mean they don't wait for problems to be resolved on their own when a train line is disrupted. They move their butts, and take taxis or buses to their destination. They don't expect the Government or the corporations to hold their hands and bring them around. They are not spoilt brats, they are a resourceful people who will give you a run for your money. If a Hongkonger were to wait for the bus for an hour, if he senses that buses are not arriving or are always full, he would already have walked to the train station or took a minibus (in HK). A Singaporean would cry injustice and malice, and demand an answer, as if it would solve anything. But I'd agree that when indeed a bus turns up after an hour, he might have infringed QoS which they must consent to abide to before operations can commence.</p>
                  <p>May I point out that migrant workers, or even skilled migrants, are not entitled to preferential rates in many government institutions like HDB and polyclinics. Their right to use public resources comes from the tax they pay. The Government is definitely on its way there in augmenting its resources, while population growth has slowed down significantly last year. But, let's say, we remove all these people overnight, you will realise the difference they make. Costs, and hence prices, will escalate sharply. I don't want to debate about immigration policy not only because our focus is on public transport, but that it is irrelevant to say we do away with them. Migrant workers will be needed where justified (do you want a 3-room HDB to cost $800,000?), and infrastructure must be strengthened as quickly as possible to match it without a strain on construction capital.</p>

              I don't worry about 190. Because it is still faster to take 190 from CCK to Orchard as compared to MRT. 972 should stay because DTL does not pass through orchard. No duplication. 700/700A hard to say. High chance it may not survive.

              <p>North east side used to have quite a few trunk and express

              NEL rationalisation because NEL was losing money at that time. Same

              Don't forget Bukit Panjang doesn't have MRT yet... After DTL Phase
