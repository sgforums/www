If u go to AMK Int, you will find the reason why there are no new services in AMK in these 2 years... as there are hardly any more berths available! 24 takes up 2 berths... one to Tanah Merah and the other to Changi Airport. However, BNL Int is about 3-4 times AMK Int and certainly, there are quite a lot of space to have new berths.</div>
