            <div class='col-md body'>To all loyal bus fan in Singapore<br><br>For the posting of this topic it was a fake one and this led to many people to be angry. Actually this posting was not made by me personally but it was my cousin who did that. The story is like that, my computer had spoilt and need to use it for my school project purpose so I went to my cousin house to do it. I also use surf the net also using the forum too. When I was using my cousin saw it and was curious about it and asked about it so I told him about it. So he said he want to post new topic using my account and type this topic and also the 1979 bus guide thing. I told him that there isn't a such thing but he say he want to post as to see whether many people will believe it a not and also don't know that there are so many bus fan in Singapore. I tried to stop but to no avail. I was frustrated on it. I am regretful about this situation and want to say sorry to all of you on behalf on my cousin. I am a still a loyal bus fan and will not spoil the reputation of it by posting fake messages.<br><br>Yours sincerly<br>gorby107</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you refer to my previous post, I said close this thread and get on with life.<br><br>And yes, I've heard the same explanation which gorby107 had given from another person before by someone else from this forum over a different issue.  Anyway what I am trying to say is that since the thread has been closed, let's get over with in and move on.  I think gorby107 does not need to explain anything.  In this case, his explanation would only seem to make things worse.  A simple apology e.g. I'm sorry would be fine.<br><br>I take offence with the sentence 'I find it funny...'.  I reiterate my stand again...I only speak and point out the truth.  That's all I do and that's what I stop at.<br><br>And since when have I discussed rubbish and ludicruous things e.g triple decker buses?  So the 2nd sentence does not apply to me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sbskidz:</div><div class="quote_body">I find it rather funny that you kept involving in quarrels in this bus forum.

Yes, gorby's story may seem very ludicrous, whether it is purely fabricated or the plain truth, I am not interested.
