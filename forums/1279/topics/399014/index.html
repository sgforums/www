              <p>Hi all. This is my first post in this forum. I have read some of the threads posted in this forum which are interesting and i have gained much knowledge about buses, not to mention the beautiful bus photos taken by various bus fans.</p>
              <p>Currently, my fren and I are interested in finding the old interchanges and terminals controlled by SBS (SBST) and TIBS (SMRT) and taking photos of how it looks like after they are closed. I have searched under Sgwiki but i have some queries which I would like to seek advice from fellow bus fans in here.</p>
              <p>1) Does Empress Place Ter and Mei Chin Rd Ter exist? If have, wat are the bus services?</p>
              <p>2) Is last time Tuas Ter located at the junction of Pioneer Rd and Tuas Rd?</p>
              <p>3) The former location for Clementi Ter before the interchange is open.</p>
              <p>4) The former location for Upper Bt Timah Rd Ter (Woodlands Circus)</p>
              <p>Really appreciate the advice and suggestions from here. Thank you.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi all. This is my first post in this forum. I have read some of
              the threads posted in this forum which are interesting and i have
              gained much knowledge about buses, not to mention the beautiful bus
              photos taken by various bus fans.</p>
              <p>Currently, my fren and I are interested in finding the old
              interchanges and terminals controlled by SBS (SBST) and TIBS (SMRT)
              and taking photos of how it looks like after they are closed. I
              have searched under Sgwiki but i have some queries which I would
              like to seek advice from fellow bus fans in here.</p>
              <p>1) Does Empress Place Ter and Mei Chin Rd Ter exist? If have,
              wat are the bus services?</p>
              <p>2) Is last time Tuas Ter located at the junction of Pioneer Rd
              and Tuas Rd?</p>
              <p>3) The former location for Clementi Ter before the interchange
              is open.</p>
              <p>4) The former location for Upper Bt Timah Rd Ter (Woodlands
              Circus)</p>
