              <p>Prince Edward Terminal served the nearby Finger Pier, which the main port of call for people arriving by sea at that time. If I'm not mistaken, the original site for the terminal was just outside the Finger Pier Building. It was then relocated a bit further at Prince Edward Link; but I'm not very sure of this, though. When the facilites were moved to WTC, the terminal was also removed with services being amended to WTC terminal or Shenton Way Ter. The site was turned into a car park and if redevelopment has yet to claim the area,  you should be able to see it today.</p>

              <p>Long ago, there existed Anson Rd terminal. I've never seen the actual terminal so I don't know if it's a roadside facility or what. It should be located next to the Tanjong Pagar Complex. The terminal was where the First TIBS Service Flagging Off Ceromony was conducted. The service was 167. The site is now within the compunds of the Tanjong Pagar Container Terminal and I believe it's off-limits?</p>

              <p>Actually it wasn't at the junction but a bit further up. Or
              maybe it was moved further up? The terminal was located opposite

                          conducted. The service was 167. The site is now within the compunds
                          of the Tanjong Pagar Container Terminal and I believe it's

              <p><br>Anson Rd Terminal was never a roadside terminal. The terminal comprises only a bus bay lots (which means no alighting/boarding activities from that terminal) and a bus stop erected along Anson Rd. Passengers would have to board the services from Anson Rd Terminal from a bus stop at Anson Rd just near the terminal itself.<br><br>Previously, the location of the terminal was at the entrance of Tanjong Pagar Container Terminal, Scotts Green Rd.<br><br>Services from Anson Rd: 130, 131, 180, 186, 193, CBD1<br>As for 167, it used to terminate at Lim Teck Kim Rd.</p>

              <p>As far as i know, there was Redhill Close Ter where svc 41 terminates. Maybe someone can advise if there was a Bukit Merah Terminal before the interchange is existed.</p>
              <p>Labrador Ter is now a lorry park. The hawker centre had been demolished recently</p>
