              <p>Hi,<br><br>I personally think that the following bus service can be enhance to better serve the commuters:<br><br>Terminate all NR services at respective town areas on the journey back to city after 1am due to low demand during midnight. It means that all NR service will be 1-directional from city after 1am.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>There are people who take NR services to town just to transfer to another NR service. If its made one-way, then whats the difference between NR services and NiteOwl?</p>
              <p>Low Demand = No Demand? Like this then those who are in the heartlands have to be forced to take cab after midnight?</p>
              <p>Last of all, I dont see why the route should be split into two. NR1 from orchard to yishun takes barely 35-40mins dispite the long-winded route. Most of the SL i've taken max out at 60km/h provided the road is clear.</p>

              <p>For NR1 &amp; NR6,</p>
              <p>I find that they route now is pretty fine as it provides a way for ppl to get frm ysh to tpy area.</p>
              <p>If all the service go to expressway after town area, it makes no different from SBST Niteowl.</p>
              <p>In addition, If all buses go to RWS, you gt close to 0 chance to see bendy anymore. Cos RWS is nt bendy friendly.</p>
