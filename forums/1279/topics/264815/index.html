In the case of what you had experienced, the control Center monitors the bus and found it to be behind time. Thus the instruction to go off-service.<br><br>I guess you must understand that for Svc 89, the main demand for that service are those workers working inside the Changi Cargo Complex and along the Loyang Industrial Estate. Thus, you may find very good frequency during MOrning peak and evening peak and very bad frequency during off-peak hours. I would actually suggest you to use the iris system to check the next bus time arrival for Svc 89.<br><br>I hope it might help..<br>Cheers</div>

Its using a GPS technology called VLS and trhey name their system AVMS. Oracle was involved in the testing of the AVMS system. amdep services were the first to trial the AVMS system.
