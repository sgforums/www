              <p><strong>Marcel Lee Pereira <br>Tue, Jan 29, 2008<br>my paper</strong>  <br>  <br> <br>Bus driver snoozes on the job  <br> <br>For a careful driver like Madam Daphne Hoon, seeing an SBS bus driver seemingly asleep at the wheel at a red light junction was too much to take.</p>
              <p>The 33-year-old freelance nail artist took three pictures of the driver with her mobile phone.</p>
              <p>Then she sent them to online news portal Stomp yesterday.</p>
              <p>Her car was beside a SBS service 124 bus at 11.20am yesterday at the junction of Telok Blangah Crescent and Telok Blangah Way.</p>
              <p>Madam Hoon, who had just dropped her two children off at school, told my paper: "I noticed the driver had his elbows on the steering wheel, so I took a closer look and saw that his eyes were closed."</p>
              <p>The driver slept for about three minutes, Madam Hoon estimated.</p>
              <p>He did not wake up until the light turned green and she had begun to drive off.</p>
              <p>"He didn't even realise I had taken his picture," added Madam Hoon, who makes it a point to be alert while at the wheel.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's director for corporate communications, said: "We are appalled to learn about this incident and are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. We take a serious view of it."</p>
              <p>Bus captains on average work nine hours a day, of which about 12 per cent is spent on breaks in between trips, said Ms Tan.</p>
              <p>The story on Stomp drew mixed responses with several readers criticising the driver.</p>
              <p>Others, however, said he could be facing some personal problems and should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>
              <p>But Madam Hoon added: "No matter what, you are on duty. You can take a break when you reach the terminal, but not on the journey. Being a careful driver is not enough, you have to be alert to watch out for other drivers. The passengers' lives are in his hands."</p>

              <p>Seriously</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I experience drowsiness when I never sleep. I was trainspotting the Eastern and Oriental Express in November and I never slept since I woke up at around 12 pm the day before. I go out but when I reached Tanjung Pagar at around 8:30 I started feeling drowsy and slept on the bus from Kent Ridge to Buona Vista and then I looped back and slept again. Then 11:30 am, I spotted the train that I intended to spot and I went home only to find myself lost at Turf City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I took the Clementi Shuttle there and went on the Toa Payoh one. I then took the MRT home and I slept there untill the train reached Admiralty. I took the bus home and first thing I did is to jump on my bed and sleep</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Referring to this, I personally think that the driver must have watched EPL and never slept. Maybe he worked PM shift on Day A and worked the AM shift on the Day of the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me warn you, especially for students: Get at least 4 - 5 hour sleep or you won't concentrate in School as your brain won't be 'fresh' and that's when you feel drowsy</p>

              <p><br>SBST would not allow the driver to work A/S shift the following day after P shift that night. Don't know what is labour law ah? Go to the Singapore Statutes and read.</p>
              <p>Why not you try after your post-secondary education about your 4-5 hour sleep per night? If your ______ never scold/reprimand/alert you, I would not down here to tell you to wake up your idea.</p>

              <p>i dun think that the driver sleep for 3 mins. Maybe just for only 30 secs cos the traffic light wont turn red for 3 mins at that junction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the vehicle behind will definitely horn if the bus never move for 3 mins at the junction. Likewise for those vehicles behind that lady driver.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, that lady is also committing an offence by using HP to take photo while driving.  I hope TP will send her a summon for using HP while driving.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>A few months ago, I was talking to a 179 BC. He was called back to work during his off day and drove P shift because of lack of BCs. The next day, he was supposed to drive A shift, but his boss said he could come 2 - 3hours late on that day, lol!</p>

              <p>9 hours of driving with only 12% break time is damn little. Use increase in transport fares to ensure we have safer rides.. instead of fixing chao plasma tv everywhere.</p>
