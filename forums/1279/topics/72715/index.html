            <div class='col-md body'>This evening (at 2005h) I boarded TIBS106 at Bras Basah Road (Outside NTUC Income Centre). I alighted at Temasek Boulevard (Outside Suntec Convention Centre) at 2030h.<br><br>A whoppy 25 minutes ride which one may take 25 minutes to walk for the same distance!<br><br>Someone in this forum had ever told me about jams beyond Orchard Road (Something that I had ignored earlier), it seems it is a common sight for such heavy jams!<br><br>Anyone can verify if the jams happen on most days? happen only on friday nights? or happen only on weekends and friday nights?<br><br>Anyone can verify if for the same stretch of road they too had taken a 25 minutes ride?<br><br>If the jams are so frequent, do the bus captains feedback of such jams to their HQ?<br><br>Now understands why TIBS 106 could be so irregular.<br><br>Besides heavy traffic at that hours (due to IT Show 2004), another reason was due to the free shuttle service that spent 10-20 minutes in picking passengers at Suntec bus stop. That free shuttle service should not have picked up passengers at that bus stops, it cause jams at Temasek Boulevard.<br><br>If the jams are so frequent, did bus companies waste their resources in those jams? When PTC divert their (SBST 111, 97 and TIBS 106) routes to Suntec, are they aware of the traffic snarls at Bras Basah and Temasek Boulevard? TIBS should seriously  rethink of terminating at Suntec, to skip that jams and to service a bigger catchment, rather than to stuck in a 20 minutes jam each night.<br><br></div>
