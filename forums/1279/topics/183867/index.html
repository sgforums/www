            <div class='col-md body'>History of SMRT 178:-<br><br>I still remember that this bus service was one of the 3 Tibs services (other than 855 and 925) that was converted to fully aircon service in early 1997. It was using the CAC Hinos at that time. However it was converted back to a partial aircon service in 1999 by the newly opened WL depot due to the deployment problems by then.<br><br>Between yr 2001 to 2004 I also remember that there were a number of Nissan OAC cameos on a number of WL services including 178.<br><br>In yr 2004, I also gotta feeling that this service was somehow further "downgraded" ever since the introduction of service 950. It was when some of the the Scanias (TIB645Y, TIB647S, TIB649L just to name a few) were transferred to other services like 167 to make up for the MB0405s that were transferred to the new 950. As for service 178 it was replaced by the ex-css buses (TIB1248D etc). These ex-css buses at that time just joined in the SMRT fleet   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Especially since when the Bt Panjang feeders revert back to their originals, service 178 seemed to have increased in the number of Nissan UDs (some originals, some cameos) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I think that service 178 is seemed to be "biased" by the WL all this while since WL started operations  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, can't be blamed. Not forgetting there's Service 187 from woodlands to boon lay as well. Same service. Anyway, those Nissan buses are good. It's vintage. We don;t get to travel around and enjoy the engines of such buses. I miss the DAF CACs as well. And regarding their aircon, i think it;s such cooler and quieter than some MB0405s which are ill-maintained. It;s time to grab a ride on those buses before they get sent to the scrapyard.</div>
