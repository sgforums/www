              <p>Did anybody encounter with friendly BCs or SLs before? If so, lets share our experinces here!</p>
              <p>I joyrided service 36 (Rego:SBS8568C) on 26/november/2012 at 1020AM at PTB 2. When the BC entered the bus, the driver politely greeted the passengers in the bus with a warm "Good Morning!". The bus captain is a lady, who wears a blue tudong (?) [not sure if it is one, it just covers her hair and not her back], however, I did not manage to catch her name. Whenever she approaches a bus stop, she will smile and greet all the passengers without fail with a smile "hello!" or "good morning uncle!" etc. Since service 36 is a city bound service, she will also announce the places of shopping centres and MRT station to the passengers on board her bus eg: Lucky Plazza! Dhoby Ghaut Station! etc. She also drives smoothly with less jerks. As the bus approached Four Seasons Hotel, there was a caucasion women carrying alot of bags as she was going to the airport. She also asked if this service went to the airport and the BC answered her questions patiently. BC also offered to carry her bags but the women rejected. She also told her to take her time and would wait for her to put her bags down and to tap her card. I am impressed by the standard of customer service provided by her!</p>
              <p>If anybody had encountered this lady BC before, may i please know her name? And should I feedback my encounter to SBS transit?</p>

              <p>There was a driver who drove SMB93S last year (i think) on 851.</p>
              <p>He would always smile at commuters who board the bus. After taking his bus quite a few times, we started to greet to talk to each other. Think he also took care of the bus, i always see him sweep the bus at YIS Int and off the engine and EDS while parking. However i no longer see him SMB93S now driven by a random SL.</p>

              <p>Did anybody encounter with friendly BCs or SLs before? If so,
              lets share our experinces here!</p>
              <p>I joyrided service 36 (Rego:SBS8568C) on 26/november/2012 at
              1020AM at PTB 2. When the BC entered the bus, the driver politely
              greeted the passengers in the bus with a warm "Good Morning!". The
              bus captain is a lady, who wears a blue tudong (?) [not sure if it
              is one, it just covers her hair and not her back], however, I did
              not manage to catch her name. Whenever she approaches a bus stop,
              she will smile and greet all the passengers without fail with a
              smile "hello!" or "good morning uncle!" etc. Since service 36 is a
              city bound service, she will also announce the places of shopping
              centres and MRT station to the passengers on board her bus eg:
              Lucky Plazza! Dhoby Ghaut Station! etc. She also drives smoothly
              with less jerks. As the bus approached Four Seasons Hotel, there
              was a caucasion women carrying alot of bags as she was going to the
              airport. She also asked if this service went to the airport and the
              BC answered her questions patiently. BC also offered to carry her
              bags but the women rejected. She also told her to take her time and
              would wait for her to put her bags down and to tap her card. I am
              impressed by the standard of customer service provided by her!</p>
              <p>If anybody had encountered this lady BC before, may i please
              know her name? And should I feedback my encounter to SBS
              transit?</p>
