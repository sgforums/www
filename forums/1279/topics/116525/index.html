            <div class='col-md body'>Feb 7, 2005<br>Wheelchair-friendly buses may be on the way<br>Installation of ramps on buses may be approved by year-end<br><br>By Christopher Tan<br>SENIOR CORRESPONDENT<br>AFTER rejecting the idea for years, the Government is now considering making public buses accessible to the wheelchair-bound.<br><br>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports told The Straits Times it is working closely with the Transport Ministry and Land Transport Authority (LTA) to explore various options to better meet the transport needs of the elderly and the disabled.<br><br>The Straits Times understands a decision may be reached as early as year-end.<br><br>The news comes in the wake of a renewed call last month, by the public feedback group looking at physical development issues, to have handicapped- and elderly-friendly ramps on public buses.<br><br>Meanwhile, DaimlerChrysler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz buses, said it was approached by bus operators here two months ago about supplying wheelchair-accessible buses.<br><br>'They wanted to know if they needed them and would we be ready to supply,' said the company's senior manager (bus and coach), Mr Samuel Yeo. 'We said 'yes'.'<br><br>Asked if it is likely to go ahead and make its buses wheelchair-friendly, ComfortDelGro spokesman Tammy Tan cited two issues associated with the installation of powered ramps that can be lowered to kerb level - the cost and the delay in boarding times.<br><br>About $14,000 is needed to install each ramp and it takes a minute more if the ramps are used.<br><br>However, the company is 'in discussions with the authorities and feedback groups to see how buses can be more disabled-friendly'.<br><br>Its subsidiary, SBS Transit, which operates 2,700 public buses here, will start taking delivery by year-end of a fleet of new Volvo buses that can be redesigned to accommodate commuters in wheelchairs.<br><br>Rival SMRT Buses, which has a fleet of 838, pointed out that while it will consider buying such vehicles in the future, this is not practical as bus stops and interchanges are not fully accessible to wheelchair-bound passengers now.<br><br>However, that may change. The LTA revealed it 'may be exploring the feasibility' of making the 4,000-plus bus stops wheelchair-accessible 'in future'.<br><br>This will involve making some stops long enough for buses to pull up alongside, and building ramps on kerbs.<br><br>Currently, the 3 to 4 per cent of the population who are disabled either have to take a London cab or get a seat on one of only 12 buses that cater to them.<br><br>But the number of these special buses is too few to meet the demand, said the president of the Handicaps Welfare Association, Ms Judy Anne Wee, and taking them segregates the old and infirm.<br><br>'This system takes away their independence and spontaneity. If they don't book a bus, then an outing with friends is out of the question.'<br><br>As for taxis, 'not many people want to be physically lifted in public - it's not dignified'. So most opt for the bus, which has a hydraulic lift.<br><br>Manufacturers Volvo and Mercedes-Benz say demand for wheelchair-friendly buses is growing around the world.<br><br>Said DaimlerChrysler's Mr Yeo: 'As of last year, two-thirds of city buses Mercedes-Benz produced were equipped with wheelchair facilities.'<br><br>A Volvo spokesman said about 20 per cent of the 10,000 buses it supplied last year were low-entry types, and the number is growing.<br><br>Countries such as Britain and Japan require public buses to be able to accommodate the wheelchair-bound.<br><br>Ms Wee does not believe ramps will slow down a commute, as they 'also facilitate easier and swifter boarding for others, including people with loads, and even the able-bodied. This might actually save time'.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.<br></div>
