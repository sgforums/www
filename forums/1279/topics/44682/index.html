            <div class='col-md body'>As for me , I dont think i will want to take mrt . The extra costs of taking mrt has definately put me off and I am one of those who prefers taking buses then mrt no matter how long it takes to get from one place to another . If SBS are going to reduce a lot of routes just because of the mrt , I will probably be pissed off and try to find alternate routes to get to my destination unless i am in a hurry .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope that SBST and PTC would do something sensible with the routes that duplicate the NEL. It would be not feasible if most of the bus routes are amended to serve somewhere else. As you could see, most of the MRT Stations do have some services passing by. This is also to have some bus services to go places that the NEL would never pass by. If SBST and PTC withdraw bus services to Shenton Way, it would not be feasible to do so. This goes to the buses going to Orchard area. These bus services do reach the doorstep of most destinations. Withdrawal of bus services would cause more INCONVENICES than having more CONVENIENCES on taking MRT. Sometimes, you have to walk a few miles to the MRT Station!<br><br>In conclusion, NEL is not feasible is some ways. Also, the NEL is also NOT convenience in some ways. I hope that both SBST and PTC would have a better plan towards trransportation along the North East Part of Singapore.</div>

They follow the line for quite a substantial distance, so perhaps they may be amended or diverted, but this is only my guess.<br><br>I don't think 72 will end at Hougang Ctrl itself, its quite convenient to use 72 to Tampines, and who wants to take the NEL to Tampines from Hougang anyway?!<br><br>I think that perhaps some express sevices like 511 and 502 might be withdrawn with the intro of the NEL, as both time factor and cost may deter even more people from using them, and 501 is now quite empty already at times, causing SBST to deploy them at a freq of ~40 minutes, which is about 2X that they listed in their route guide in the same time frame.<br><br>An interesting thought: do you think that the load factor of 80 and 85 will decline so much after the NEL opens that they start using all single decks, especially service 85.</div></blockquote>My guess is that services 97 &amp; 111 will be amended.<br><br>No, what I mean is that service 72 will turn into Hougang Central (It will skip a pair of stops along Hougang Ave 4) and then proceed to Tampines or Yio Chu Kang.<br><br>I guess that Express 501, 511 &amp; 502 may be withdrawn but not 502. 502 may be integrated with another express service which I think is 518.<br><br>Service 80 won't be affected much before the completion of the Circle Line. Service 85, if not withdrawn, is most probably converted to all single deck.<br><br>I hope that service 85 will not be withdrawn as it is the only service connecting:<br><br>1. Great World City to the NE area.<br>2. Great World City to HarbourFront.<br>3. Tiong Bahru to NE area.<br><br>The most is that this service be amended in the stretch from Sengkang to Orchard.
