              I remembered some joker said that LE buses are banned by LTA...
              
              The very fact was it was because of the complains abt the KUB's step that led bus co to decide on the LF buses...
              
              But as far as I know... LTA received far more complains against the Citaro than the KUB by the general public...
              
              whoever that spread that LE is banned ought to be questioned and taken to task.... from whose mouth it came from?

              The problem is amplified by the MAN... How much ppl can you carry???
              
              I guess because of that, do see more people moving in to the rear on the KUB or OC these days whenever the bus is more crowded...

              <p>Take the instance of svc 16. I took it from Dhoby Ghaut to Great World City. It was a 0530 Citaro. The bus was packed with around 24 standies. At Orchard MRT, there were at least 10-12 pax who could not enter the bus, but when I saw the rear of the bus no one was standing. Everyone clogs around the entrance, and door.</p>
              <p>Also, since you have a space to keep bag at the entrance, I saw a school kid with his bag, and a lady with grocery standing right near the seat close to entrance where you can keep the bag. They weren't moving, and nor was anyone asking them to go ahead.</p>
              <p>During peak hours, the loading on DDs is faster than SDs just because of the more number of pax it can take. </p>
              <p>The max loading a Citaro can take cannot exceed 60 - 65 pax because people are unwilling to move to the rear.</p>

              There's no official word from VTL that they stopped PTO from LE buses... It's all purely commercial decision..
