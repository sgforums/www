              Not wanting to sound biased, I must say that the Citaros are still the best purchase ever made by SBST. The suspension is extremely comfortable and the gearbox is remarkably smooth. The turbo boost that comes on at high revs is exciting as well. True, the aircon's quite weak but blame SBST for not getting the double-glazed windows to keep out the heat. I think the aircon vents were designed to be non-adjustable to prevent pesky commuters from adjusting them to block airflow. I think it also helps with ensuring uniformity as there won't be weird eyeball vents facing in a myriad of different directions. But I must agree they could have designed the aircon better. SBST should have also gotten a 6-speed gearbox or a 4-speed Voith with a higher final drive ratio so that it wouldn't be so loud at 60km/h. It's always intriguing to me how the Germans are so particular on quality but then close one eye to engine noise as evident by how loud the O405s were. I've been to Germany and their older MANs are just as loud, especially the SD202s with their 3-speed gearboxes.
              
              Finding a good KUB is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Most of them roar, jerk and seem difficult to control by BCs. There are a few good Euro IVs on 27 though. Their gearboxes are fantastic and radiators totally silent. Unlike the Euro Vs though, there's that jerk when moving off in 1st gear. Most Euro Vs seem to be terribly maintained as many fail to shift up properly and have insanely loud radiators. I wonder how Scania isn't embarrassed to sell such a sub-par quality chassis with the Gemilang bodywork.

              carrying facility and is cheap but come on, Gemilang bodywork? I
              think the bodyworkâ€™s to blame for many of the problems since Iâ€™ve
              taken the Discovery Bay Gemilang-bodied MANs in Hong Kong and they
              are just as bad, but not as bad as the Scanias.</p>

              <p>because Scania is widely perceived as a 'budget' option. Volvo, Merc and MAN are not so 'budget' but they will offer you more bang for your buck. The Scanias currently in operation here in sg don't seem to be in good shape, both due to maintenance and chassis quality. you get what u pay for</p>

              <p>the point is that operators around the world are buying scanias to reduce costs at the cost of performance, SBST bought a relatively budget chassis with a relatively budget bodywork.</p>
              <p>and of course, SBST was allegedly offered the Citaros at firesale prices, the same price as the Euro IV KUBs. if Merc didn't slash their selling price, SBST would probably never have gotten the Citaros.</p>
