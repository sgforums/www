              <p>I have this feeling that SBST deploy KUBs and Citaros according to their old buses.</p>
              <p>If you remember taking the old SBST O405s, you will realise that the KUBs are the ones which replace them, in most cases.</p>
              <p>But again, doesn't have to be necessary this case. Just an assumption.</p>

              <p>I think SBST can better use their low floor buses for trunk
              services, like the Wrights which have higher capacity. As for LE
              and LF single deckers, it is better to be evenly spready out
              between feeders and trunk services, if feeder services have good
              services and trunk services have a good mix with double
              deckers.</p>
              <p>SMRT wise better that they use more LE for their feeders and use
              less bendy buses. LE and LF for trunk services and hopefully they
              switch to double deckers for feeders and some high capacity trunk
              services. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p><br>You are absolutely wrong and outdated.</p>
              <p>I went Tampines interchange last Thursday night and observed 291. Surprising many people are moving up to the double deck. The first Wright was fully seated in the upper deck with the lower deck filled to the brim. About 10 mins later, another CDGE B9TL has both upper and lower decker almost evenly spread out although the load is about 30 to 40 passengers.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>I guess it all takes time for people to adjust. Once they are all right, more people are willingly to move upstairs. So your logic of people not moving upstairs is outdated. </p>

              <p>Well, it depends on:</p>
              <p>1. Where the passengers are alighting. If they are alighting after one or two stops I dun think they will bother climbing upstairs.</p>
              <p>2. The number of passengers. If lower deck really full then got to climb up the upper deck, bo bian lah.</p>
              <p>I dun think you are wrong to say that but I also dun think that TIB 501 D's opinions are wrong as well, so yeah.</p>
              <p>Anyway, dun use the words "absolutely wrong and outdated". That is totally demoralizing.</p>

              <p>I observe the situation for the Wright on 291. Many people just move upstairs even the lower deck has no standees and not even fully seated. The situation however surprised me a bit.</p>
