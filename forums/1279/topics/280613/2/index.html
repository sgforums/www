            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of the crowd at 804 and 806 berth during evening peak hrs.<br><br>FYI, 804 and 806 shares the same berth.<br>It is like a bus 804 comes. People queuing up at 804 will board the bus. Normally, it will take around 4 - 6 mins depending on the demand at that point in time and usually, the bus will be fully packed. After this bus 804 has just left that berth, a bus 806 arrives and people queuing will board the bus.<br><br>Due to the sharing of the same berth by two very hot feeder services like 804 and 806, a lot of time is wasted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a feeling it will be very complicated to see how they coordinate the 179 and 179A services together since both services I believe would have different timings for 1 round.<br><br>Like maybe<br>179 takes 40min schelduled<br>179A takes 35min schelduled<br><br>Then they will need to coordinate to ensure 179 &amp; 179A don't depart at the same time.<br><br>And also, I think the crossover buses will more likely be doing 179A too. But come to think of it, it means they will need to carry 3 destos, and BC needs to keep changing destos.<br><br></div>

The main problem is bus bunching which is caused by the reasons I posted about 6 posts above. if you average out the bus loading, then each bus only about all fully seated.<br><br>I think the fastest route to BNL from NTU (&amp; vice versa) is to take Pioneer Rd Nth, Jurong West Ave 4, then Jurong West St 64, which is basically 192/193 route to BNL.<br><br>The Jalan Bahar/PIE route is used for AM peak down trips presently! But it wastes a lot of time. They give the bus 10min to get from BNL (16min from SLBP) to get to that down trip starting location.<br><br>Pro drivers can get from BNL to NTU using the standard route in 7-8minutes. The fastest I've seen was 5min. He must have been very lucky, with all clear traffic lights along St 63.</div>
