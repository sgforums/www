I actually fell asleep on 9690A. VSOs ah, too noisy, however there's an exception, me and 9816E both fell asleep on 9821P, maybe because the driver was driving TOO SLOWLY and the a/c was too cold.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, I think that Tridents are rather smooth buses, as in switching of gears, accelerating, and decelerating. VSOs are rather loud, especially the sound of the radiator+engine. I would never fall asleep on a Trident as I feel rather energize by its smooth 'sailing' on the road. Talking about suspension, I feel that both buses' suspension are designed to suit different types of road conditions. Volvo has their own way, while Dennis has their own way too.</div>

The schedule and deployment for svc 852 and 853 is unstable this wk, and TIB1013P had replaced for TIB1009C for this week. I guess that the bus had finally broken down, because it had very apparent problems for the past few wks, and required turbo and a gear drop to climb the meagre Lornie Flyover.......u still say its smooth, and I cun ever pick up the reatarder on the LAnce 211...if it exists at all...it stops on brute brake power and the motion of objects in it approaches ideality as much of the force is effectively transferred as a result</div>

The schedule and deployment for svc 852 and 853 is unstable this wk, and TIB1013P had replaced for TIB1009C for this week. I guess that the bus had finally broken down, because it had very apparent problems for the past few wks, and required turbo and a gear drop to climb the meagre Lornie Flyover.......u still say its smooth, and I cun ever pick up the reatarder on the LAnce 211...if it exists at all...it stops on brute brake power and the motion of objects in it approaches ideality as much of the force is effectively transferred as a result  </div></blockquote>Well, it goes fast enough without any shaking or vibrating. Any bus with a ZF would have a retarder.</div>
