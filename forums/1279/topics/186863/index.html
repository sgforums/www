            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I am writing behalf of the people staying in Jurong West St 91. I feel that svc 502 should also turn into Jurong West 91 like 174M. It was because there are more residents here but Pionner rd nth had lesser residents. My friends who stayed in Blk 906 had to walk out all the way to Ave 5. He had another option to take  99 or 242 out, but that make him spent more. So I trying to get support frm this forum to hope that SBS Transit would consider to make this amendment. I guess the company would not want to lose passengers in JW st 91 as there are more people staying along there compared to Pioneer Rd. Please make some comments..<br><br>Thanks..</div>

Also recommended that you draw up a route to modify the present route for the ops side to consider. Because routes are not said want to change then change. Becos it involves the strategical locations for the bus to travel with the least safety implications, highest revenue, any clashes with other routes etc etc. Must go through a lot of layers of checks.<br><br>No doubt in order to improve the quality of SBST, the public commuters with constructive ideas are best to get involved too.</div>

I need a direct bus.(Nowadays MRT still need to wait for 5min even at Boon Lay Stn). I had my breakfast in my office. Actually 502 is not veri EX. If u compare the time and fare, it is actually comparable. 502, u can sleep all the way when u get into the bus. (Not like Transfer bus to MRT) Mrt also very crowded, may cause breating difficulty.<br><br>PIONEER MRT ONLY COMPLETE AT 2009. 3 YEARS LATER.<br><br>if u got watch tv, boon lay residents most of them moving to St 93. If there is an additon bus stop, this can prepare for Pionner stn. But for now, It can link them to Toh Guan, Orchard, Suntec.<br><br>Pionner Rd got hostel there, u want bangldash to take 502? Pls... )Expensive rite?)<br><br>174E/174 still need to change 99, why dun u try waiting the bus in the nite, all r packed. Even DD. (You never know when u experience it.)<br><br>242 again, u really got to try taking 242 in 8.00pm-8.45pm. Hello those DD last bus is 7.45pm. Only one non- aircon DD starts at 8.45pm. Try then say la..<br><br>City harvest pple can take 502 to orchard/suntec in st 91. Do u know alot of pple there?</div>
