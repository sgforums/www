Dunno why got alot of dust, never clean sia! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Maybe SMRT cleaners might consider the Dyson vaccum cleaner? Never lose suction, and good at vaccuming fabrics, especially with the high velocity tools and mattress cleaner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> My home slippers was white in colour and became slightly blackish after some dust got collected in it. I used a small tool and vaccumed it, and it turned into white again, very efficient. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Only downside is its price, very pricey for a vaccum cleaner, at 498 bucks from Courts, other shops sell 598 i think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Infact i actually want to ask SMRT if i can help them vaccum the seats with my vaccum cleaner in exhange of $200/mth for the tips/salary, as i see that the seats are very dirty now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
