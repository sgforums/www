That's why 187 -&gt; 187 is considered 2 journeys.<br><br>Taking 190 and transfering to 187 is a single journey.<br><br>And if you had not realised earlier, this system has been in placed since the 1980s when the farecard system was 1st implemented and no one made noise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I once alighted a single-deckered 74 to board a less packed VO3x behind and lost my rebate too... Wasn't too happy about it and I really should have underpaid on that trip.<br><br>Claiming a fare is very easy. Just go to any Transitlink office and the person will just scan the card and probably ask you where you alighted or how much the fare would usually be and then just deduct accordingly. Of course I don't deny it's easy to lie to the person but I don't encourage it since I guess one should just be grateful enough to be able to get a refund after forgetting to tap on the exit reader.</div>
