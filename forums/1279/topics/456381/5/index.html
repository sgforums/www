              <p>153 is solely HGDEP controlled so SBST should deploy 1 or 2 dds from svc 153 to svc 113? Or dds from 153 can downroute 113 during peak hours AM/PM peak hours because i really dont think 153 need that much dds. The demand for svc 153 i think can be compared to svc 56, where the demand of a sd applies but dds are deployed. I seldom see dds on 153 really utilised. 113 can use the dds for service improvements so that pax would not need to squeeze like sardines and can find a seat on the way home. Most of the pax of svc 113 take the service above 4-5 stops. Also, the dds can also be deployed on svc 80. Damn -.- so many dds on svc 80 are downgraded to sds.. Eg. SBS1688K. Maybe svc 80 dosent need that much dds but alot of commuters taking svc 80 take long distances.. Took 8193A on 80 today. Few standees but bus wasnt packed.. So.. DDs on 113 and maybe freq should be adjusted for more dds to be deployed on svc 80. </p>

              <p><br>What are you talking, bro? Svc 80 already has 22 DDs in its fleet of 26. The other 4 SDs that are there are used more for 80A in the morning peak and do opposite route in peak hours. I think the deployment on 80 is quite right.</p>
              <p>113 has high loading only at Kovan for 3 stops. Does it really justify a DD? Not sure. It can - if 113A is withdrawn. Otherwise imagine a 113 DD following a 113A. The 113 DD will be completely empty and not utilized.</p>

              <p>113A is really useless as 113A always bunch with 113 during evening peak hours. I think 113A's freq should be longer and dds will be well utilised. bcs of 113A dont have proper toilet breaks when they are going to start trip. if dd is deployed might save resources right? Like that 113 bcs will have lesser stress and have less tendency to rush. The students taking this svc can also justify for a dd during off peak</p>

              evening peak hours. I think 113A's freq should be longer and dds
              will be well utilised. bcs of 113A dont have proper toilet breaks
              when they are going to start trip. if dd is deployed might save
              resources right? Like that 113 bcs will have lesser stress and have
              less tendency to rush. The students taking this svc can also
              justify for a dd during off peak</p>

              If use ADD, no of trips would be reduced to 16 - 17 mins per bus.
              
              But deploying ADD is pretty tricky... I ever remember someone posting a pic of 'packed' 113 on LTY's FB....
              
              the rear was w/ a few ppl only... a few is meaning 113 is packed....

              <p>there are reasons on why SBST deploy ADDs on some of its service, even though you wont see fully packed DDs on those services... There is actually no requirement that a DD must be fully packed for SBST to deploy ADDs.....  dunno why some smart alec keep saying that he observe this and that service with DDs and low demand..... 70ppl on a DD is low demand?  will you board a SD with 70 ppl or a DD with 70 ppl?</p>
              <p>actually if based  on the rational, all those services does not deserve any DD during off peak periods... all DDs should be parked in Depots during off-peak periods, since the DDs are not packed at all during peak periods...</p>

              <p>106 should be transferred to SBST too. But other services should keep their bendies, like 169 and 969 which move at an incredibly fast pace. Put DDs on these services later they complain too slow with Batch 2B Wrights, like 161's case now...</p>
