              <p>Hi,I know this kinda topic exist before previously but we can still open a discussion to improve bus service that you think need improvement especially on deployment,Frequencies etc.Pls keep it within topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SBST</p>
              <p>7 need to improve frequencies during weekends,Dunno why but Clementi bound feel like 12-18 mins per bus.Its good for BNDEP to take a few duties back.</p>
              <p>97 &amp; 174..Talking about cost saving especially with rising fuel cost.Its ironic to off service all the way from SLBP to Marina Ctr and New Bridge Rd respectively.Its better if ARBP cab take a few duties.Last bus from Jurong East and Boon Lay can be adjust till late midnight for ARBP side.</p>
              <p>93,Should adjust the headways during peaks,Off peaks still justified with 12-15 mins freq.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT</p>
              <p>75..Should convert 2 splits to full day.Its absurd to wait nearly 17 mins on average during off peak.</p>
              <p>77 should just loop at Suntec City.</p>
              <p>852 &amp; 855.Should add 2 more split duties.</p>
              <p>853 should just loop at Marine Terrace rather than Upp East Coast during Sundays/PHs.</p>
              <p>981.Timing should adjust.Add 1 more bus and loop at Senoko.I propose Monday-Fri 0600-0915 1630-2000,Saturdays 0600-0915 1330-1600.Sundays/PHs 0700-0915 1330-1500.Can relieve 169 loads too.</p>

              <p>981 now how's e demand?</p>
              <p>Yah Sv 7 needs more buses, but not too sure if 175 can help in CBD leg.</p>
              <p>Sv 93 needs peak hr adjustment, the demand now pretty good in spite of CCL.</p>
              <p>For my side</p>
              <p>Sv 24 (Changi - Bedok side). Old Sv 34 should be revived to incr ad hoc capacity during peak hrs.</p>
              <p>Sv 67, 75, 184, 961 needs some review. The headways not only unstable, the buses appear to siam bus stops.</p>
              <p>Sv 98's off peak freq. The return leg headways is oftenly unstable.</p>
              <p>Sv 124... The Bt Merah side loading pretty high even during PM off peak.</p>
              <p>Sv 187... Increase capacity level? Evening peak Woodlands - Bt Panjang high loading.</p>
              <p>Sv 194 should have their own fleet. AM peak 30 mins freq no longer applicable w/ BSEP.</p>
              <p>Sv 403 should get 1 more evening peak bus. The morning slot likely can be placed on Sv 15.</p>
              <p>Sv 960... How come they go cut so many O405G out? End up at night ppl at Little India no chance of boarding.</p>
              <p>Seriously I've been wondering how come even during off peak hrs, buses like 75, 855 can have bunching...</p>

              <p>buses are behind schedules becos of overstaying unnessarily at the bus stops</p>

              <p>BC/SL dare not anyhow close the front doors when the entrance passage is too crowded, sometimes they want to close..but the passengers at the bus stops, refusing to wait for next bus, still stubbornly want to squeeze on board</p>
              <p>during peak hours, at crowded bus stops, should deploy marshallers to enable the buses to close the front doors and move off quickly to avoid delay..just like what woodlands CIQ is practising now</p>
              <p>peak hours is the most stressful period, BC/SL cannot cope alone</p>
              <p>buses should be equipped with microphone and broadcasting capability so that BC/SL can speak into the microphone to request passengers to move inwards</p>
              <p>if possible, should install the Front door closing chime and let it play loudly</p>
              <p>"FRONT DOOR CLOSING!! PLS STAND CLEAR!!...* 3 seconds very loud beep *" then closed</p>
              <p>those clogging at the front door, still trying to squeeze on board will immediately give up and disperse, and wait for next bus</p>

              <p>I don't understand that if a route is heavy loading, you can't put SDs and DDs on it. It depends how lucky you are. If a SD comes on route 147, you squeeze into it, sticking with other passengers. If DD comes, you get a place to sit (comfortable journey). If it is a high loading route, make it fully DD.</p>

              <p>Kick out the SD on 23, and make it loop at Temasek Blvd and Temasek Ave instead, what a waste of it looping at Rochor Canal. And it's time for 23 to get some Wrights<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>And 963, why are there SO <span style="color: #008000;">MANy</span> rigids?!!</p>

              <p>I don't understand why BBDEP is still so silly to deploy SDs.<br>For HGDEP side we can't help it. ADVERTISEMENTS like MUSTAFA only makes ads on SD. But those SDs on 74 are relatively adless...<br>Like SBS1922J and SBS1928T are adless.<br>Better call BBDEP deploy some Vo3x Batch 2 or WEGS.</p>
