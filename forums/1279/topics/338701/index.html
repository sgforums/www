              <p>agree....anyway....just start with a bus i boarded today</p>
              <p>SBS 9166 Y (BRBP 28)</p>
              <p>Aircon: Red refub aircon, good, when the weather is hot today, the bus remain cold</p>
              <p>Seats: Generally good conditions, clean of vandalism</p>
              <p>Suspension: Smooth except some parts where occasional jerks could be experienced and some vibrations could be experienced when the bus is at a halt</p>
              <p>Accerlation: Had not experienced high gears on the ride, porbably BC was early, but accerlation is smooth.</p>
              <p>Verdict: 6.5/10 and good work BRBP in upkeep</p>

              <p>I have one article about TIB1049L =P I had written a very long time ago but had no where to post it:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/nqwzmc.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong><em>(The bus back then in the year 2007)</em></strong></p>
              <p>TIB1049L is one of the more iconic Mercedes 0405G Hispano Habit in the SMRT fleet as many memorable events had happened on this bus, both ill-fated and good events.<br><br>TIB1049L started life on 16 Jun 2000 as a bus based in Ang Mo Kio depot. Being one of the buses among the first batch of Hispano Habit bodied Mercedes 0405G buses to appear on the roads, they were put on service 800 by AMDEP. Due to the introduction of these new buses, the then TIBS (now known as SMRT Buses) placed the first batch on a free ride campaign to let their commuters try out the new bus.<br><br>Soon after, TIB1049L was redeployed to do service 859, also controlled by Ang Mo Kio Depot (service 859 had been under the hands of Woodlands Depot for a certain period of time as well). After being with service 859 for a while, it was transferred to Woodlands Depot to do Service 901, which is a feeder service in Woodlands. In the year 2002, TIB1049L met an unfortunate accident with a non air-con Mercedes 0405 Hispano serving Intratown feeder service 912 in Woodlands Regional Interchange while turning out of the berth. The accident the caused the windscreen to be smashed and the non-aircon bus from 912 had its rear window damaged. If you had noticed its license plate long enough, perhaps you will find the wordings weirdly positioned due to the accident in 2002.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i34.tinypic.com/x9aut.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>(The bus having the NEA: They Breed You Bleed advertisement in March 2008)</em></p>
              <p><br>5 years down the road after the accident in 2002, it is still performing fine, however, it broke down on 5/10/07 (DD/MM/YY) in the morning while serving feeder service 900. Pasengers were diverted to TIB1106E on 913 that morning and TIB1049L was gone for 2 days, being replaced with TIB1194A on one day and TIB1142A for another. Before the breakdown, the bus had been going on for a few times of mantainance for serveral months because ever since the accident, this bus had problems with its transmission. The transmission problem was not yet fixed even after the breakdown, but other than that the bus is working fine, though with some graffiti at the back and is slightly slower than the other buses.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i36.tinypic.com/29nwmk0.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>(TIB1049L with the NEA: It's Closer Than You Think advertisement)</em></p>
              <p><br>2007 also marks the year where feeder service 900 and 901 share their permanent buses together, switching buses within a few weeks.  March 2008 saw the time for it to get the NEA: They Breed, You Bleed advertisement, and was the first ever bendy on 900 ever since the deployment of TIB855H to KJDEP to get a full body advertisement. Since then it got 2 more advertiesments and the current version is the NEA: What will Dengue Cost You Today? advertisement. During June 2008, 900 and 901 ceased sharing buses with each other and it was destinied that service 900 receives an ex KJDEP bendy, TIB878S, together with TIB904A, TIB999B, TIB1049L and TIB1245L. As of now the bus is running well on service 900 and rarely cameos around.</p>

              <p>Haha, now my turn.And i did not know what's the thread for, Sorry for being rude.</p>
              <p>My favourite bus is SBS3661Z for last time, until the current KUBs.</p>
              <p>Air-con:Very cold, so cold, and i like it.Just like house air-con 18-degree-celsius</p>
              <p>Seats:Only discover back seats with graffiti<br><br>Suspension:Si beh smooth.</p>
              <p>Accerlation:This bus really likes to speed a lot<br><br>History:</p>
              <p>To me, it was kind of a baby series to me, when i was born, and really likes to speed a lot.When it had it's brothers(you know them), I really had my chance to get upon N113CRBs coz i already know that they are Old-and power buses. Upon knowing that N113CRBs are going to small metals, was so heart-broken.I had only 29 to get N113CRBs around me.The bus worked in BRBP for feeders, but i did not know how's it, then BNDEP 293, it was it's heyday with it's brothers, SBS76H, SBS3659G, SBS3663T, SBS3664R.Then, it was subsequently de-registered, then placed at the laid-up corner.</p>

              <p>Accerlation:This bus really likes to speed a lot<br> <br> History:</p>
              <p>To me, it was kind of a baby series to me, when i was born, and
              really likes to speed a lot.When it had it's brothers(you know
              them), I really had my chance to get upon N113CRBs coz i already
              know that they are Old-and power buses. Upon knowing that N113CRBs
              are going to small metals, was so heart-broken.I had only 29 to get
              N113CRBs around me.The bus worked in BRBP for feeders, but i did
              not know how's it, then BNDEP 293, it was it's heyday with it's
              brothers, SBS76H, SBS3659G, SBS3663T, SBS3664R.Then, it was
              subsequently de-registered, then placed at the laid-up corner.</p>
