            <div class='col-md body'>For Yew Tee, CCK, cx have sv190. Jurong West Ave 1 residents have sv174 (although a bit long) support extending the svc to Clementi to Boon LAy instead. As you have already mentioned, SMRT &amp; SBST seldom cross each other's territorial boundary, so it's a bit "difficult" for SBST to introduce any new svc to anywhere.</div>

We just need drivers to do last parade duty checks on all oil levels and mechanics will only need to concentrate on vehicles that need to be serviced.<br><br>As for scheduled maintenance, a quarterly check and small maintenance tasks can be done in half a day for a bus, and if it is a non-critical fault, it is common for the vehicle to resume duty (talking bout civilian not military) until spares arrive then they will take another half day to finish up the maintenance work.<br><br>I'm a vehicle mechanic myself so I noe wat needs to be done everyday when you have 400 vehicles under your charge. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regarding CT services, note the word <strong>(tentatively)</strong> after the date 21 Jan 2005:<br><img src="http://www.starhub.net.sg/~tamago/imgextlk/823.jpg"></div>

These 3 services will bring you to Chinatown in about half an hour's time as they travel along the expressways.<br><br>As a launch promotion, SBST is giving a 1-for-1 free ride in the month of Jan'05.
