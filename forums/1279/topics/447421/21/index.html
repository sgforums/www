              Fleet standards is still terrible if you know how to open your eyes and see.
              After dragging  about 8 years, with countless complains, then they decided to clean off most of the insects, change the seat covers, and some refurbishments which are not thoroughly done. 8 long years before doing some bit of improvements, that's really an improvement.
              Many old buses are still in poor conditions, new buses like the OC 500 are deteriorating, dirty interior, vibrating bodies, cranky suspensions, etc.

              <p>The fleet standards?</p>
              <p>HAHA</p>
              <p>I'll be objective.</p>
              <p>SBST moves a lot faster than SMRT despite the huge fleet size when it comes to refurbishing and upgrades and what-nots.</p>
              <p>And I duly appreciate that and I didn't complain about SBST requesting for fee hikes.</p>
              <p>SMRT? They claimed that they have been "more efficient". And then they asked for fee hike.</p>
              <p>At the very least, if no refurbishment or new buses, can't they just clean the bus interior? </p>
              <p>If you still think SMRT fleet has "improved", I suggest that you climb out of the well and take SBST buses.</p>
              <p>Even the old MKIII puts many SMRT's newer buses to shame. For one thing, at least the MKIIIs don't stink as much!</p>
              <p>When the 0405s had their stinky seats changed, I thought the problem would go away.</p>
              <p>It didn't.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because nobody cleaned the interior!</p>
              <p>Who cares about "new buses", or "better buses" when the buses are dirty?</p>
              <p>PS: Non-bus fans also have no qualms about SBST's fee hike. Because the change in fleet has been really visible. </p>
              <p>I dont deny that SMRT's fleet has improved. But look at the visibility side. Did SBST have to advertise on any of their buses to get their point through? Nope. They simply rolled the K230UB and Citaro out quietly 10 by 10. And people noticed the change and appreciate that.</p>

              <p>ahaha i get what u mean. what im saying is exterior should be more expected to be maintained properly because it is less troublesome and a rather simple job compared to maintaining the interior. Of course, the interior have to at least meet certain standards. </p>
              <p>To me, SBST is doing both interior and exterior rather well.. SMRT is a total disappointment =X</p>

              climb out of the well and take SBST buses.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even the old MKIII puts many SMRT's newer buses to shame. For
              one thing, at least the MKIIIs don't stink as much!</span></strong></p>
              <p>When the 0405s had their stinky seats changed, I thought the
              problem would go away.</p>
              <p>It didn't.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because nobody cleaned the interior!</p>
              <p>Who cares about "new buses", or "better buses" when the buses
              are dirty?</p>
              <p>PS: Non-bus fans also have no qualms about SBST's fee hike.
              Because the change in fleet has been really visible. </p>
              <p>I dont deny that SMRT's fleet has improved. But look at the
              visibility side. Did SBST have to advertise on any of their buses
              to get their point through? Nope. They simply rolled the K230UB and
              Citaro out quietly 10 by 10. And people noticed the change and
              appreciate that.</p>

              <p>Ok, I agree with that, SBST moves in a way SMRT doesn't, Due to their fleet differences, This I'll keep quiet.</p>
              <p>More efficient? How 'efficient' you want it to be? Can I ask you?</p>
              <p>Fine. The depot staff might not be bothered in cleaning up the buses, Fine, I'll accept that. But to me they don't deploy thrashy buses like they did 1-2 years ago.</p>
              <p>Don't worry, I do take SBST buses all along, Since I live in Boon Lay.</p>
