              <p>I rather have the 100 B5Ls to be Mercedes-Benz Citaro 3 for
              SBST, unless there is a 3 axles version of the B5L. 100 Scania

              <p>The fleet I hoped for SBST is talking mostly about double-decks, unless if I replaced it with Volvo 7700 (single-deck version of B5L), then you can consider Citaro 3, but I still won't accept more Citaros other than those ordered in 2010.</p>
              <p>As for B9TLs, I think it is too much to purchase so many of such buses. Why not I suggest Alexander Dennis Enviro400 (a complete bus) instead?</p>

              <p>Puller type articulated buses are siginficantly more dangerous (although cheaper to produce and maintain) than pusher types as its easier to jackknife while at speed, or slowing down without traction. The trailer can skid and swing to either side due to its lower weight and that's what you see in youtube videos. By putting the weight at the rear on pusher artics, it reduces the possiblity of jackknifing.</p>
              <p>The newer articulated buses from most major manufacturers (MAN, Volvo, Mercedes Benz, Scania, etc) are all pusher type and ABS brakes helps too to prevent jackknifing.</p>

              <p>OK, look. I realise that pushers are in somes ways better, but let's remember there's a ton of active hydraulics to keep the thing from collapsing like an accordion. Get me a video of puller trailers mucking about. I'm sure this can be dealt with by applying weight to the trailer, e.g. by sticking all the non-traction heavy equipment there, like air-conditioning units, which are very heavy.</p>
              <p>Also, you're ignoring the biggest reason why all artics are now pushers - you can't have a puller low-floor. The engine in a puller is between axle A and B, which has to be low floor.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I'm sure pullers would still be built.</p>

              <p>The 2nd bus company, TIBS needs to be more unique in purchasing their buses rather than surveying on SBS over the bus models. If TIBS were to buy DDs, then it will merely copy the way SBS did. TIBS was just a competiting bus company and had to stick to their own intentions before the purchase of a new bus models as TIBS cannot just copy most of the idea from SBS in terms of its fleet.<br><br>If you notice in the past, TIBS was the first bus company to be equipped with EDS on its buses and had grown further in purchasing the O405 buses with clearer EDS. The feasbility must be taken into consideration before implementation.<br><br>Bendies are a hallmark to TIBS after a few years of planning. TIBS began final plans for bendies in 1994, after the trial of the O405s and the 1st bendy came in 1996.</p>

              <p>OK, look. I realise that pushers are in somes ways better, but
              let's remember there's a ton of active hydraulics to keep the thing
              from collapsing like an accordion. Get me a video of puller
              trailers mucking about. I'm sure this can be dealt with by applying
              weight to the trailer, e.g. by sticking all the non-traction heavy
              equipment there, like air-conditioning units, which are very
              heavy.</p>
              <p>Also, you're ignoring the biggest reason why all artics are now
              pushers - you can't have a puller low-floor. The engine in a puller
              is between axle A and B, which has to be low floor.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I'm sure pullers would still be built.</p>

              <p>It's possible to have fully low floor mid-engined puller articulated buses, Van Hool produces their AG300 and AGG300 while keeping their low floor design. As mentioned, ABS brakes have improved safety on such puller types.</p>
              <p>As for pusher, their tendancy to jackknife tends to occur when the vehicle is moving off, and the middle axle has no grip at all (e.g. snow). This will result the in vehicle ending up in a jackknifed position, but its still safe as its not at speed.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the safest articulated bus would probably be one that provides traction on the two rear axles.</p>

              <p>Bus companies should look into praticability in operations, not trying to be different for the sake of it. It is really a short sighted decision, which in turn looms into big problems for SMRT now.</p>
              <p>KMB, CityBus, CMB are all different bus companies trying to operate different but why do all of them use double deckers? It's a simple logic for all 3 companies, highly populated areas have problems have land and road constraints. Thus they never use bendies in such kind of roads, which Singapore faces the same problem too.</p>

              <p>Erm, i'm not trying to be rude but its not hard to google right? The model and brand have all be stated there. Van Hool keeps the engine in the center between the first and second axle, and its vertically installed so it takes up just a column of space.</p>
              <p>You can stuff hub motors on diesel-hybrid buses too, that's exactly what is being done on the Citaro G Hybrid and HESS's articulated hybrid buses. Hub motors on the 4 rear wheels and powered by batteries and a serial hybrid drivetrain. The smaller diesel engine is placed at the rear and does not disrupt passenger flow.</p>
              <p>Last of all, low floor buses are mainly designed for passenger accessiblity, not seats. This means more doors for passenger flow. However, as they were designed for LHD markets, the engine is placed on the left and an additional 3rd door can be placed on the right. The same chassis however is also used for our citaros and a22, so we're using the low floor chassis without gaining the full advantages of it. Effectively speaking, we're just using it as a low entry chassis with steps moved further to the rear.</p>
