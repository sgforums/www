              <p><br> Don't believe, never mind. Unless SMRT decides to run only 30
              services in future, else they have to switch to 12m buses to
              improve their overall operations.</p>
              <p>I rather SMRT don't waste more money buying bendies but
              instead buy single and double deckers. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p><br> Who want to find problems and enjoy doing it??? No wonder you guys
              like to troll the forum and give so many problems.</p>
              <p>I don't think SMRT will be so stupid as in your thinking. Their
              operations are already downgrading fast and their depot operations
              are made worse by the insuffcient parking spaces caused by bendies.
              In order to expand their fleet in future, it is best to get rid of
              the bendies and park more buses and also allow more buses to move
              freely within the bus interchanges and bus stops.</p>
              <p>Our bus network and bus routes are expanding and by having more
              buses on the roads, LTA needs to look long term in avoiding bus
              jams and long bus queues which bendy buses will worsen these
              problems in future.Thus the need to stop such purchase of these
              buses. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>What I was trying to say is that he claims that bendies are banned on the roads (which means the bendies should have disappeared long ago), yet they are still spotted on the roads, which means his claims are fabricated.</p>
              <p>I think SMRT can have a choice to have a mixed fleet, with more rigids and DDs than bendies. Look at service 172, it is one of the services that cannot use DDs but it can use bendies (if I'm not wrong), a few bendies (not more than 10~15) will do. Those services (106, 169, 178, 190, etc.) that are DD accessible can use DDs, depending on their demands. </p>

              <p>No bro, you are partially right in saying so. It depends on the driver's way of driving to a large extent.

              <p>i think LTA/MOT should be more flexible  enforcing the 10 mins peak frequency..... they really need to look at the situation? for example those feeders leaving interchange in the am peak...for some feeders not much ppl taking from interchange. most ppl are going to work from home.. downroute trips should be planned instead... and for PM peak for feeders, should introduce those short working trips for some services..</p>
              <p>and like sv94, PM peak departure from Eunos is 14-17 mins, but there are many downroute that start from airport road which improve the frequency to 5-10 mins.. really see no point in making the pm peak departure from Eunos to below 10 mins.. buses should be added to improve the downroute instead..</p>
