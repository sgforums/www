              <p>So what would you propose to make people less lazy and more considerate? Would you tell the auntie whos holding 3 bags of groceries, the senior who have difficulties walking straight, or the primary school kids who might fall off the stairs to move upstairs? These are the people who take feeder services often, and these factors are not directly within the bus co's control. Selecting different types of vehicles however, are within their control.</p>
              <p>As for bendy buses, theres much more incentive for people to move to the rear, as theres no steps to climb, and theres also a exit door. Remember that the purpose of bendy buses are to move high passenger volume over short distances. Of course no one ask them to throw it on longer distance trunk services like 190 where people take for a long distance. I would then agree with you that would be a waste of road space, and yet not effectively using the vehicle.</p>
              <p>How much parking space do you need to run a fleet of bendies for feeder services? What needs to be done is to reduce bendy fleet size, not eliminate them totally.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Problem is, would people want to move to the rear??? Even a normal single decker bus, people won't want to move beyond the door, then how about a half filled bendy bus that waste the road space of 2 buses???</p>
              <p>As mentioned above in your post for the people who needed the seats more, would they even want to walk beyond the back trailer??? If these people need more seats than us, why do even the younger and more able bodied people don't give up their seats to them by moving up? Does it kill to exercise a bit when these group of people are more mobile? Nowadays people walk a bit complain this and that already, not like people last time. And not all old people can't climb the stairs. Those who are still strong and healthy would rather climb the stairs to have a seat or to avoid the crowd. And for children/students, many of them would prefer to climb up and sit around with their friends rather than standing. As long as they are not rowdy and treat the bus as a playground, why would they fall down?</p>
              <p>Regarding to parking space, just look at the parking space needed for big interchanges like Woodlands and Boon Lay as comparison??? The bendy lots that take up the space can at least park more numbers of 12m buses.</p>

              <p>SBS Transit buying more DDs I can accept, but I think they should buy Scania K310UDs instead of sticking onto the same model (even if it is a different bodywork).</p>
              <p>SBS Transit can choose to buy Volvo B9Ls (like what Myhabit said), which is a low-floor bus.</p>
              <p>SMRT buying more Citaros it is not selfish at all. Look at the number of Citaros SMRT have compared to SBS Transit. I'd already mentioned that repeatedly many times, the capacity is not important. Have you ever heard someone the capacity is licensed yet the bus did not carry that much people (like nobody seen an OC carrying 90 people.)? I don't like to be insulted (you are calling me that I'm biased).</p>

              <p>Can you even understand what he is saying??? What the heck do giving up seats got to do with the type of buses the operators should buy???</p>
              <p>You are the one who was also in your lala land that DDs are suitable for us. Traffic congestion is happening everyday, not only in the 2000s. Even if the infrastruture is not suitable to accomodate bendies, why shouldn't we choose those buses like the 14.5m Scania K310UBs?</p>

              <p>So? SMRT bus fleet is much lesser, of course the ratio of certain models is smaller. That's normal. Lesser of that model doesn't mean they need to purchase more of it. If that is the case, the ratio of Mercedes Benz buses is only 10% of the whole SBST fleet. Thus they should get more Citaros instead to increase the ratio of Mercedes Benz buses in the SBST fleet to decrease the ratio of Scania buses instead. </p>
              <p>And I rather have more Enviro 500 for dds instead. Too much Scanias in SBST fleet. Anyway, don't think there is a full low floor Scania K series, so K310UD is out.</p>
              <p>You want more Scanias then write to SMRT to get 14.5m Scania K310UB single deckers to replace all the bendies. This I will fully support. </p>
