              <p><br> Thus it makes more economical and operative sense for SMRTB to buy
              double deckers instead of more of those bendy buses. The new
              interchanges are getting smaller but bus companies are going to
              expand their fleet, makes no sense for getting bendy buses to add
              more woes in parking spaces in interchanges and bus depots.
              Moreover there aren't many routes with height restriction nowadays.
              Even so, bus operators will prefer to deploy more single deckers to
              improve the freqencies instead. The only advantage is faster
              alighting with the additional door, but with the poor maintanance
              of SMRTB, many EZlink card readers don't work at the 3 door and
              people love to cramp around the front trailer area which instead
              defeats the purpose yet waste more road space. Lastly, newest QC
              standards demands better frequncies for all feeder services. Thus
              it means more buses for the feeder service. It has already make no
              sense to use bendy buses in future. Thus I hope SMRTB will wise up
              this time to switch to using double deckers from now on, to
              optimise their economical and operative sense in operating their
              bus business. Or else just like someone mentioned earlier on, if
              they continue to neglect their bus business, then might as well
              give it up.</p>

              <p>To add on to your point (which I fully agree with), the advantage of lesser board/alighting time at bus stops is only in theory. In practice, it is often not so given how lazy most bus passengers are to walk all the way.</p>
              <p>I mean, look man, the distance is even longer than walking to the end of a 12m DD. And given how people love to cramp at the front of DDs and not move in, what makes us think that pax on Bendies will move in? </p>
              <p>In fact, i've noticed that for the Bendies on my side (i'm not sure about the rest), the SLs take much longer at the bus stops because they had to continually check if all alighting pax have gotten off, and if pax has moved in, then check again if all 3 sets of doors have closed properly. So the alighting time part is only in theory lah.</p>

              <p>Yeah. Most of SMRTB's woes lie with TIBS's acquisitions.</p>
              <p>TIBS had a hodge-podge fleet with a huge bendy fleet. Quite a
                  nightmare as far as mainteinance and day-to-day operations is
                  concerned. There too, have been insider stories of how TIBS had
                  been bleeding and the use of accounting tools to transfer losses,
                  but of course that's not verified, but I wouldn't be surprised at
                  that.</p>
              <p>SMRT could on the other hand, have taken a decisive step in
                  eliminating these little pockets of here-there-everywhere types.
                  They didn't. And understandably too, given how replacing them would
                  be extremely expensive and hit profit figures. It took many years
                  before SMRT made the OC500 acquisition, during which time, the DAF,
                  Hino, Dennis, Merc, Nissan, Scania (just look at how many types
                  already!) languished.</p>
              <p>So whose fault? I am inclined to blame the government although I
                  would think that hindsight is always 6/6 and the government in
                  fairness, has recognised the need to incentivise upcoming bus
                  purchases, although it still remains perplexing that the $1.1b
                  would be a "one-off" exercise.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yeah, i do have to say that SMRT has been quite concerned (when i mean quite, it is actually VERY concerned) with their increase in profits margins yearly under the previous Ms Saw.</p>
              <p>And I don't think SMRT saw it as a liability that time when they took over since the Bendies were only like a few years old back then? Still very much roadworthy in turnover value. Probably that's why they didn't bother cutting off their Bendies and going after DDs instead.</p>
              <p>But in the near future, sooner or later the Govt would advise them to use DDs. It's not just with regards to the length of bus stops and the road space, even at Interchanges and Depots, they still take up much more space. I mean, if you give the same plot of land to SBST &amp; SMRT, SBST would be able to fit more buses since all their buses are standard 12m (except 997A), regardless SD or DD. SMRT has like some buses at 12m, the other Bendies at near 18m, how to squeeze all of them in? <br>The extra 6m per Bendy in parking can add up to another equal plot of land already lor if they have like hundreds of Bendies in the same depot.</p>
              <p>Even when drawing parking lots at Interchanges also mafan. When you can fit in like 6 12m buses nose-to-tail, you can only fit in 4 18m Bendies in return. For Interchanges such as Yishun &amp; Woodlands, if they were to use DDs, lots more buses can park in those places. Won't even have the parking crunch at the SMRT depots already.</p>

              <p><br>I heard that back in the 1990s, when SBS trial the bus and if the trial is successful, they will convert all their single deckers to 14.5m buses, but it will be better if there is a 3rd door behind.</p>
              <p>Moreover SBS had thought of bringing in the bi-articulated buses if the trial for SBS998Y back in 1996 is successful.</p>

              <p>And to a certain extent, Bendies are in a way less safe than DDs. <br>I mean sure, DDs has higher likelihood of tipping over at turns, but the 60kmh limit sorts of limits that possibility.<br>For Bendies, I've found that in some buses, the rear trailer is already starting to lose traction even before 40kmh under full acceleration. They are still quite safe now, but that's because their rear tyres are gripping well for now on the straights. <br>If your Bendy is travelling at full acceleration along roads with ups and downs, alot of turns and in the wet, it is absolutely terrifying. And when Bendies start to speed with degraded tyres (since SMRT likes to cut costs, you never know), err, you know what might happen. Just look at how many Youtube vids are there of Bendies breaking traction. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"><br></p>
