              <p>Bus companies should look into praticability in operations, not
              trying to be different for the sake of it. It is really a short
              sighted decision, which in turn looms into big problems for
              SMRT now.</p>
              <p>KMB, CityBus, CMB are all different bus companies trying to
              operate different but why do all of them use double deckers? It's a
              simple logic for all 3 companies, highly populated areas have
              problems have land and road constraints. Thus they never use
              bendies in such kind of roads, which Singapore faces the same
              problem too.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Bendies are the generally the better choice when there is high passenger movement and high passenger load. In fact, they just gotten more relevent after the fare system was redesigned.</p>
              <p>Look more deeply into the differences between SG and HK before making the comparision. Singapore operates mostly on distance based fares, regardless of how many transfers thats been made. Commuters benefit as there's always a bus to their house by transferring.</p>
              <p><strong>However</strong>, the same distance based fares also causes a rather unexpected problem. Feeders and even some trunk services are now being heavily utilised as commuters just need to pay 1 or 2cents to save some walking. This becomes a big problem as there's now have large amount of people just taking a bus for a few stops and getting off. Putting a DD on such feeder service would simply cause everyone to stay on the lower deck. (who would climb up and down the stairs just for a less than 5 minutes ride?) This is where bendies excel.</p>
              <p>HK on the other hand does not use distance based fares. Commuters pay a fixed fare which differs by service and there is generally very limited transfer rebates. Even if there is 5 different services serving between two points, fares can range from $3.20 (50cents sg) to $10 and above ($2 and above). Obviously people will always take the cheaper option. You might ask, so whats the more expensive services for? These services typically crosses the harbour and goes for a much longer distance, and usually direct to a town center or a place that people wants to go. This is very well the reason why KMB CTB NWFB uses DD, and its because services are very direct and there's minimal people who take longer distance services for just a few stops.</p>
              <p><strong>They simply do not have a need to move large amounts of people for just a few stops unlike what the distance based fares has caused to our bus network!</strong></p>

              No relevance as HK's MTR feeder have to choice but to use feeders with their fleet lineup. 
              
              Literally, I believe they went for more ADD to standardise the fleet. 
              
              That said, many feeders like 291 has a lot of short distance commuters to say N2. But equally lots that take into N3. 
              
              It's all just abt moving up once your travelling bus stop is more than 5. 
              
              Anyway, once you've a sizeable feeder svs, the mealbreak parking needs how?
              
              Look at WRL, see the mess.

              <p>MTR bus accounts for only 3% of all passenger journey made on franchised buses daily in HK. They also have the largest ratio of single decks in their fleet, at about 20%.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, MTR bus only provides coverage mainly on areas not linked up by the Light Rail, and most MTR bus services are free-of-charge when transferring to and from east, west rail and light rail lines.</p>
              <p>This creates a rather huge demand on the feeder services, and therefore they do face problems similar to sbst. Buses are often packed during peak hours and one of their solution is to run feeder services which are very direct, some with just 2 to 3 stops and still operated with a dd.</p>

              <p>Bendies are the generally the better choice when there is high passenger movement and high passenger load. In fact, they just gotten more relevent after the fare system was redesigned.</p>
              <p>Look more deeply into the differences between SG and HK before making the comparision. Singapore operates mostly on distance based fares, regardless of how many transfers thats been made. Commuters benefit as there's always a bus to their house by transferring.</p>
              <p><strong>However</strong>, the same distance based fares also causes a rather unexpected problem. Feeders and even some trunk services are now being heavily utilised as commuters just need to pay 1 or 2cents to save some walking. This becomes a big problem as there's now have large amount of people just taking a bus for a few stops and getting off. Putting a DD on such feeder service would simply cause everyone to stay on the lower deck. (who would climb up and down the stairs just for a less than 5 minutes ride?) This is where bendies excel.</p>
              <p>HK on the other hand does not use distance based fares. Commuters pay a fixed fare which differs by service and there is generally very limited transfer rebates. Even if there is 5 different services serving between two points, fares can range from $3.20 (50cents sg) to $10 and above ($2 and above). Obviously people will always take the cheaper option. You might ask, so whats the more expensive services for? These services typically crosses the harbour and goes for a much longer distance, and usually direct to a town center or a place that people wants to go. This is very well the reason why KMB CTB NWFB uses DD, and its because services are very direct and there's minimal people who take longer distance services for just a few stops.</p>
              <p><strong>They simply do not have a need to move large amounts of people for just a few stops unlike what the distance based fares has caused to our bus network!</strong></p>

              <p>It depends to individual mindset to move up or not. If your trip is less than 2 stops, yes, it is better to stay in the lower deck. If it is more, then might as well go up. Treat it as an exercise, not being lazy and inconsiderate.</p>
              <p>It is the same case for bendy buses as well. If my trip is less than 5 mins, why should I bother to move all the way to the back??? Thus this causes half filled bendies hogging the roads, delaying other buses schedules, causing long queues and jams along bus stops, bus interchanges. Parking is a nightmare for depots. Our limited land space isn't suitable for these kind of buses, it's a fact.</p>

              <p>So what would you propose to make people less lazy and more considerate? Would you tell the auntie whos holding 3 bags of groceries, the senior who have difficulties walking straight, or the primary school kids who might fall off the stairs to move upstairs? These are the people who take feeder services often, and these factors are not directly within the bus co's control. Selecting different types of vehicles however, are within their control.</p>
              <p>As for bendy buses, theres much more incentive for people to move to the rear, as theres no steps to climb, and theres also a exit door. Remember that the purpose of bendy buses are to move high passenger volume over short distances. Of course no one ask them to throw it on longer distance trunk services like 190 where people take for a long distance. I would then agree with you that would be a waste of road space, and yet not effectively using the vehicle.</p>
              <p>How much parking space do you need to run a fleet of bendies for feeder services? What needs to be done is to reduce bendy fleet size, not eliminate them totally.</p>
