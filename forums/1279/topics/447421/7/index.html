              <p>I'm wondering if both bus operators are going to expand their current depots to accomodate the extra buses. One way to optimise land use is to build multi-storey depot to replace existing ones. Better still, build on top of the train depots (eg NEL Buangkok depot). I think the Changi and Bishan train depots are wasting lots of land space. Can re-construct partially to accomodate multi-storey facilities instead.</p>
              <p>With the shrinking new bus interchanges (av only abt 2 parking lots per sv), how is LTA going to accomodate extra buses during peak periods? Make bus captains rest shorter?? And how to accomodate somemore new bus svcs to improve connectivity?</p>

              <p><strong>Govt's move to fund bus purchases sparks public concern</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The government's move to spend S$1.1 billion over the
               next 10 years to fund the purchase of 550 SBS Transit and SMRT buses 
              has sparked concerns among some Singaporeans.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>A few have written 
              to the government's feedback portal REACH, questioning why the 
              government is using public funds to help profit-driven companies.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SBS Transit and SMRT are public-listed private enterprises.<br><br>Analysts
               said the government's move to help the two public transport operators 
              grow their bus fleet does not mean a free lunch for them. They said 
              commuters would stand to benefit from higher service standards, which 
              are likely to be imposed on SBS Transit and SMRT.<br><br>Observers said 
              the government's move is not unique. In affluent cities in Europe and 
              Australia, private operators receive public-funded buses in order to 
              achieve a more efficient transport network.<br><br>Assistant Professor 
              Paul Barter from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy said: "In 
              Singapore, if the government is going to be helping a private sector 
              operator in this way, we would not do it in an open-ended way. <br><br>"We
               will need to set higher service standards. If we are giving money for 
              the buses, we expect higher service in return. It would not just be a 
              gift. There would be expectation of improved service."<br><br>Analysts said although the two operators are making profits overall, they have been weighed down by bus operations.<br><br>Latest data showed SBS Transit incurring an operating loss of S$6 million due mainly to increased fuel and staff costs.<br><br>Meanwhile, SMRT said it incurred a higher operating loss of S$1.7 million due to the same reasons.<br><br>So the assistance will come in handy to help boost capacity and meet the anticipated growth in demand.<br><br>Analyst
               John Rachmat from the Royal Bank of Scotland said: "The situation is 
              such that the bus operations are not generating enough profits for the 
              operators.<br><br>"In fact, in many cases, (they) are incurring losses. 
              So if this continues, there will be no new investments in buses in 
              Singapore and as a result, the public will suffer from more 
              overcrowding."<br><br>With the government's funding for additional 
              buses, "hopefully, what we will see is a lot more frequent bus services,
               a lot lesser overcrowding and more profits for the operators because 
              that will be the reason for them to deliver the better services," said 
              Mr Rachmat.<br><br>"In a way, they will earn more profits but in exchange for that, the public will see a lot better bus service in Singapore." <br><br>Observers believe the S$1.1 billion fund will not only go towards helping operators grow their fleet. <br><br>Given the big sum of money, there are indications it could also help operators get the manpower they need to run the buses. <br><br>They could increase salaries to make the job more attractive, particularly to Singaporeans.<br><br>Minister
               of State for Transport Josephine Teo said with the government chipping 
              in to buy new buses, public transport operators must improve their 
              service standards.<br><br>Mrs Teo on Wednesday defended the government's
               move to co-fund new buses at a post-Budget dialogue organised by 
              feedback unit REACH. <br><br>"What Singaporeans want is quicker solutions," she said. <br><br>"They
               don't want to wait so long. So it's with Singaporean needs in mind that
               we assessed that the better way to do it, the faster way to do it, the 
              more efficient way of doing it, is to partner the existing public 
              transport operators to deliver the increased capacity."<br><br>Charles 
              Chong, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for 
              Transport, said: "With the grant, I think this eliminates some of their 
              excuses...that they can't get drivers (because) they can't pay them 
              enough."<br><br>"This grant should not be used to bump up profits for 
              shareholders -- it is meant really to help serve the public better, 
              because you are using public funds for this; the expenditure should 
              benefit the public," he added.<br><br>Mr Chong said operators are expected to bump up bus frequencies and serve more areas.<br><br>Analysts
               said they believe the operators will see operating costs going up in 
              the short run. But the higher costs are unlikely to be transferred to 
              commuters as higher fares. <br><br>Details on the S$1.1 billion fund are expected in the upcoming Budget debate.<br><br>- CNA/wk/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>So? SMRT bus fleet is much lesser, of course the ratio of
              certain models is smaller. That's normal. Lesser of that model
              doesn't mean they need to purchase more of it. If that is the case,
              the ratio of Mercedes Benz buses is only 10% of the whole SBST
              fleet. Thus they should get more Citaros instead to increase the
              ratio of Mercedes Benz buses in the SBST fleet to decrease the
              ratio of Scania buses instead. </p>
              <p>And I rather have more Enviro 500 for dds instead. Too much
              Scanias in SBST fleet. Anyway, don't think there is a full low
              floor Scania K series, so K310UD is out.</p>
              <p>You want more Scanias then write to SMRT to get 14.5m Scania
              K310UB single deckers to replace all the bendies. This I will fully
              support. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Even if the fleet is lesser, but the buses will be pharsed out no matter what. Citaros for SMRT to my choice is a good option, and if you really want SBST to buy more Citaros, go ahead and people will hate you if SBST bought a total on 1,100 Citaros.</p>
              <p>And haven't you learn this word: No buses can be made 100% low floor due to the engine? So what's the heck you disagree with me asking SBST to buy Scania K310UDs? Aren't the Wrights that were introduced a few months ago not low floor?</p>
              <p>I of course want more Scanias, but what I want is SBST to have at least 1 K310UB. I still won't accept no bendies in SMRT fleet.</p>

              <p>I think Citaros are not suitable for SMRT because they don't maintain them properly, and the in board annoucements are really a nuisance. At least SBST ones are quieter and they might improve the air con system once the warranty of the buses are up, just like adding outlets in the KUBs. I have no worries for SBST improving their fleet as they always do refurnishments and improvements as the buses ages.</p>
              <p>If SBST has already gone forward to get full low floor buses, why should they go backwards to buy low entry buses again? If they suddenly have switched to full low floor for the batch of Wright B9TLs, that means there will be something happening in the future, else why have to waste more money for changes for the new fleet? They are projecting something in future, thus they begin to buy full low floor buses, like Citaros and full low floor Wright B9TLs, which will save them the troubles for more changes in future. I feel that the purchase of full low floor buses will be mandatory in 3 to 5 years time.</p>
              <p>I think there are enough Scanias in SBST fleet. Relying too much in one brand is no good. Just look at how much SBST had spent for the past years to modify the KUBs to make them better, because of so much problem in them when they were first introduced.</p>
              <p>14.5m buses don't work well for SBST for now. Even SBS997A failed the trial in the 1990s. If you want a Scania K310UB 14.5m bus, then tell SMRT to get one fleet to trial. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
