              I'll prefer that these areas go back to the pre 1995 era, where they are controlled by SBS. Since the handover, there are not much improvements and it became worse since SMRT take over. 
              Best is SMRT to go back to the pre 1995 era, serving the North area only. They can divert their resources to provide morer bus services for Sembawang and the upcoming Simpang. 
              Yishun may probably allow partial SBST controlled. I do not see much significant service improvements since the late 1990s.

              I understand your plight.
              Maybe later these no life clowns will create another clone account like vicamour.a, vicamour sucks or whatever.
              Just let him be. He is nothing but a scum to this community.

              Go look and compare before you make your judgement. Years back, I had already highlighted that SMRT's planning and maintance is so terrible. Till now, they still give that heck care attitude and their operations are still as horrible as before. If not LTA to step in for some regulations for the scheduling, I think SMRTB will be even worse than a few years back. 
              Go open your eyes and mind and see what this totally poorly managed company which has failed after years of arrogant and irresponsible attitude which results its problems it gives to the commuters right now for all its operations (cab, bus, rail).
              
              And stop making a damn fool of yourself. Go get a life!
