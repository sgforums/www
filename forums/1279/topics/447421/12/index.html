              I don't think the govt will be so dumb to do this. The public will scorn at the government for wastage.
              
              Most likely the ownership of these buses will be transfered to the bus companies after the 10 years and extended for another 7 to 9 years of lifespans. Thus bus companies will continue to use these buses for replacements of older buses that are going to be srapped at the same point of time when these buses are being extended. It saves the bus companies to buy more new buses then as well.

              You will never know what stand they take in future.
              Just a few years back, they say should rely on trains and less buses. Now they say buses are equally as important. Their words flip here and there as they like. The recent train breakdown should have wake up their damn ideas that only trains are important. If they still insist on just relying on trains alone, our public transport system will collaspe sooner or later.
              
              Somemore althought these are assets of the govt, it is still the responsibilities of the bus companies to maintain them. Govt should only fund the money and that's all. After the 10 years, ownership will be transfered over to the bus companies. Thus it should be the up to the bus compaines decisions how to deal with these fleet. But it is way better to waste them by scrapping them. There will certainly be outrage from the public if otherwise.

                  That's why the new of these 800 new buses. If it is presumely to be all ADDs, this can help bus companies to save the cost of buying them and maintaining them for up to 10 years. After that, when their lifespan extends, the bus companies will only have to maintain them for 7 to 9 years which cuts a lot of costs for maintaining buses similar to those which bus companies wholly foots the bill of buying and using them for their whole of lifespan. 
                  
                  
                  This also helps the bus companies to use more/switch to ADDs at lesser costs while able to cope with the increasing demands. This is also a good opportunity for SMRTB to use ADDs and scrap the use of bendy buses for good.
                  
                  
                  Since this is a govt funded project, most likely MAN buses will be used. Hope that we can see MAN ADDs for SBST and SMRT soon.

              I think the plan is scrapped according to the latest news, which is good news as well.
              If it aren't broken, why fix it? I'll rather LTA don't meddle the affairs of bus routings, let the bus companies do it themselves.

              <p><br>wonder how they break down into these figures and how many out of 500 and 300 would be paid for by SBST and SMRT themselves. hopefully the govt will channel the resources more evenly based on current fleet sizes and needs and not the 'relative-closeness' of the company to Temasek/GIC..</p>
