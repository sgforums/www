              <p>For SBS SD acquisition, I fully support mass-buying Volvo chassis, preferably with Volgren, Gemilang or Soon Chow bodywork. I find CGDE bodywork too... obscure?</p>
              <p>Also, I agree on the 'moar DD', but I don't like the Wrights. Wrights to me look awful. In terms of looks, the Volgren body for the VSO was the best, closely followed by the DM bodywork for the Trident 3s.</p>
              <p>We should have full MRT duplication limited-stop/trunk lines. They don't have to be too intense, but they need to be there - e.g. every 15 min at its most frequent. The advantage here is that when the MRT breaks down, we just have to say, 'Pump more buses into routes x, y, z!' and then announce, 'Please proceed to the bus stops/interchange and take bus x, y or z,' rather than kalang kabut like in November.</p>
              <p>As for BCs, they're hiring - I've seen a lot of DDs advertising recruitment. They should get more Malaysian Chinese.</p>

              <p>Yeah. Most of SMRTB's woes lie with TIBS's acquisitions.</p>
              <p>TIBS had a hodge-podge fleet with a huge bendy fleet. Quite a nightmare as far as mainteinance and day-to-day operations is concerned. There too, have been insider stories of how TIBS had been bleeding and the use of accounting tools to transfer losses, but of course that's not verified, but I wouldn't be surprised at that.</p>
              <p>SMRT could on the other hand, have taken a decisive step in eliminating these little pockets of here-there-everywhere types. They didn't. And understandably too, given how replacing them would be extremely expensive and hit profit figures. It took many years before SMRT made the OC500 acquisition, during which time, the DAF, Hino, Dennis, Merc, Nissan, Scania (just look at how many types already!) languished.</p>
              <p>So whose fault? I am inclined to blame the government although I would think that hindsight is always 6/6 and the government in fairness, has recognised the need to incentivise upcoming bus purchases, although it still remains perplexing that the $1.1b would be a "one-off" exercise.</p>

              <p><br>The unloading of passengers off double deckers are slower than the bendies, in which bendies have 2 exit doors. Of course, both have their pros and cons and people will debate which is better and which. Given that Trans Island/SMRT Buses built their operations around bendy buses over the years, i'd see them probably sticking to bendies in the future.</p>

              Thus it makes more economical and operative sense for SMRTB to buy double deckers instead of more of those bendy buses. The new interchanges are getting smaller but bus companies are going to expand their fleet, makes no sense for getting bendy buses to add more woes in parking spaces in interchanges and bus depots.
              
              Moreover there aren't many routes with height restriction nowadays. Even so, bus operators will prefer to deploy more single deckers to improve the freqencies instead. 
              
              The only advantage is faster alighting with the additional door, but with the poor maintanance of SMRTB, many EZlink card readers don't work at the 3 door and people love to cramp around the front trailer area which instead defeats the purpose yet waste more road space.
              
              Lastly, newest QC standards demands better frequncies for all feeder services. Thus it means more buses for the feeder service. It has already make no sense to use bendy buses in future. Thus I hope SMRTB will wise up this time to switch to using double deckers from now on, to optimise their economical and operative sense in operating their bus business. Or else just like someone mentioned earlier on, if they continue to neglect their bus business, then might as well give it up.

This is when the SBST's VO3x (Batch 1) and Volvo MK4 (Euro 1 DM/Strider), as well as SMRT's 0405/Scania/DAFs will reach their lifespan of 19 years and they are bound for retirement then.</p>

              I will feedback to SMRT sooner, to stop buying bendies as the MAN anyhow procure artic order, should have bought 200 Wrightbus.
              
              The feedback is -
              
              "As such during the Budget 2012 statement, SMRT Corporation thought they are buying 100 MAN NG363F (A24) as it undergoes bodywork installation by ST Kinetics in order to replace the box Hispano bendies. They should have bought 100 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (Volvo B9TL) 3-axle, 100 Scania OmniCity double deck and 200 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 (with new styling for 2012 and beyond). They cannot be able to have and buy bendies anymore due to safety criticisms and all that, bus interchanges will turn smaller, removal of bendy bus lots and take up more space. Put DD on 61, 67, 77, 106, 169, 172, 176, 180, 184, 187, 188, 189, 190, 300, 307, 800, 804, 806, 811, 812, 851, 852, 853, 856, 859, 902, 920, 922, 960, 963 and 966.
              
              Lifespans for all rigids should be able to extend to 19 years, those bendies should go off early by at least 2015 to prevent fires and all that road layout problems. And anyway, for the future bus orders - 800, please buy 50 more Citaros to add in for 2012, 150 more MAN NL323F (Gemiliang) to add in for 2013 and please buy new range of order: Alexander Dennis Enviro300 for replacing Dennis Lance 245 (all) and DAF SB220 (all). Hino HS3KRK and Mercedes-Benz O405 Volgren should be replaced by MAN Lion City and some Mercedes-Benz O405 CAC, Scania L113CRL should be replaced by Scania OmniCity Single Deck and Volvo B7RLE/MCV Evolution.
              
              Fleet management is lousy and screwed. It also end up wrong bus like CRL on heavy loaded 963, it should not have cameoed on 963 and must use MAN NL323F. CRL must go to 77 and 189 as it is low demand services.
              
              And there is a new depot, what are the general use of Geylang Bus Park? To park 106, 961 and all that? Is it refuelling point for service 61 but not 969?"

              I'm the mega SMRT loy...... all feedbacks are well done to SMRT. What's next? Fool around with SBST with no SOP for feedbacking?
              
              The feedback is due to poor design of buses. Wish that we should resolve the problems faster......
