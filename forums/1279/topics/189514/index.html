            <div class='col-md body'>I remember tat Hispano DAFs were only seen on svcs 950, 951 and 952 for a start. These buses then went into other svcs during a NAC to PAC conversion in 1995 for most of the Tibs svcs. Remember tat it started off wif sv160 in Oct 1995, followed by 182, 852, 925, 927 etc...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anybody gotta other comments n ideas may post here too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
