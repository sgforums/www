              <p>28 is not winding. The route is made by purpose or how do you expect this part of Tampines Estate to connect to SAFRA, Bedok and  even Tampines CC. </p>
              <p>3 is winding in Punggol, Pasir Ris and Tampines. </p>
              <p>But its ok la... people get trunk service. For instance those at st 21 in Pasir Ris get direct service to TPE stop as well as Tampines. Not bad.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Besides lengthy trunk buses...</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I am pretty surpised that no one actually complained that the NightRider services operated by TIBS/SMRT are very lengthy ways for late night travellers to get home. This is in contrast to the Nite Owl services run by its rival SBS Transit, which went through a reorganization on 22 Dec 2006 to reduce the travel time between the CBD and residential areas?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><strong>- Nite Owl 1N: </strong>Uses CTE to provide a faster connection between the city and Ang Mo Kio/Yishun, as opposed to the route taken by former Nite Owl 162M (via Thomson Rd).<br><strong>- Nite Owl 2N: </strong>Uses ECP to provide a faster connection between the city and Bedok Reservoir/Tampines, as opposed to the route taken by former Nite Owl 65M (via MacPherson Est &amp; Ubi)<br><strong>- Nite Owl 3N: </strong>Uses Bt Timah Rd to provide a faster connection between the city and Bukit Batok/Choa Chu Kang. Former Nite Owl 181M also used Stevens Rd, Whitley Rd &amp; BKE/PIE (following Service 190) before becoming Nite Owl 3N.<br><strong>- Nite Owl 4N: </strong>Uses ECP to provide a faster connection between the city and Marine Parade/Bedok/Simei/Pasir Ris, as opposed to the route taken by former Nite Owl 16M (via Stadium &amp; Kallang Airport Est)<br><strong>- Nite Owl 5N: </strong>Uses Bt Timah Rd to provide a faster connection between the city and Clementi/Jurong East/Jurong West, as opposed to the route taken by former Nite Owl 174M (via Bt Timah Rd). Granted, the Farrer Rd/Holland Rd leg of Nite Owl 5N can be truncated if demand doesn't warrant.<br><strong>- Nite Owl 6N: </strong>Uses CTE to provide a faster connection between the city and Hougang/Sengkang/Punggol. Former Nite Owl 89M also used the CTE.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">All these in contrast to the NRs, which uses lengthy ways to get to the end:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><strong>- NightRider NR1: </strong>Winds around Toa Payoh &amp; Bishan before proceeding to Ang Mo Kio/Yishun. Can be cutback to Bishan in the future if LTA were to integrate night buses of both operators.<br><strong>- NightRiders NR2/NR3: </strong>These two NRs are probably the faster ones around, using a similar route to Service 190 (Stevens Rd, BKE/PIE) to proceed to Bukit Panjang and Woodlands respectively.<br><strong>- NightRider NR5: </strong>Winds around Bukit Merah &amp; Queenstown before proceeding to Clementi/Jurong East/Jurong West. Can be cutback to Queenstown in the future if LTA were to integrate night buses of both operators.<br><strong>- NightRider NR6: </strong>Winds around Boon Keng/Potong Pasir before proceeding to Serangoon/Hougang/Sengkang. Can be integrated with Nite Owl 6N in the future if the Boon Keng/Potong Pasir sectors do not have sufficient demand.<br><strong>- NightRider NR7: </strong>Winds around Geylang before proceeding to Bedok Reservoir/Bedok/Simei/Tampines/Pasir Ris. Can be integrated with Nite Owls 2N and 4N in the future.<br><strong style="line-height: 19.696px;">- NightRider NR8: </strong><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Despite not using the expressway, I would say NR8 is a less winding NR compared to the other NRs mentioned above (except NR2/NR3). It could be kept or merged with Nite Owl 3N.</span></p>

              <p>As mentioned before, the lengthiness of Services 14, 51 &amp; 67
              are all thanks to route integrations here and there from the
              past.</p>
              <p>Now, we could bring back the "merged away" services then in
              their old form if splitting were to occur.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service
              14</span></strong></p>
              <p>Initially a route between Bedok and Bukit Merah after 20 Jan
              1991, it was rerouted and diverted to Clementi after an integration
              with the old Service 92 on 23 May 1993, which resulted in its
              lengthiness.</p>
              <p>To undo the lengthiness, we could bring back the old Service 92,
              but will a route running between Clementi and PLAB in the modern
              age be considered long winding? Yes it would, and no one will
              probably take the bus from Clementi all the way to PLAB anyway.
              Thus, the proposed "old 92" will probably end at Marina Centre
              instead in the modern age.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service
              51</span></strong></p>
              <p>Initially a route between Eunos and Labrador since initial
              introduction, it was extended in the east to Hougang after an
              integration with the old Service 54 on 12 Mar 1987, and later
              extended in the west to Jurong East after an integration with the
              old Service 192.</p>
              <p>To undo the lengthiness, we could bring back both the old
              Services 54 and 192. Since South Canal Rd Ter and Jurong Int were
              both closed for good, a proposal of the old Service 192 will be
              between Jurong East and New Bridge Rd. The question now lies in
              whether the old Service 54 should be brought back as well as a
              route between Hougang Central and Eunos, or just keep Service 51 as
              Hougang Central to Labrador.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service
              61</span></strong></p>
              <p>Also mentioned before, the route length of Service 61 was
              originally lengthy on its own without integrating with any bus
              services. The easiest way to split will be like what carbikebus
              mentioned, New Bridge Rd Ter once again. Since the terminal is
              relocating soon, it's probably a good opportunity to implement the
              split.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service
              67</span></strong></p>
              <p>The western leg between Choa Chu Kang and Little India is
              probably the trickier part, as that is an original segment of
              Service 67. However, the eastern part in Geylang, Eunos and Bedok,
              as mentioned before, are attributed to an integration with the old
              Service 4 on 23 May 1993. Current Service 21 also became lengthier
              as a result, taking over the St. Michael's leg of the old Service
              4.</p>
              <p>To undo the lengthiness, will you want to impact both Services
              21 and 67, or just Service 67? Allowing Service 67 go back to its
              old way of taking the direct PIE route to Little India/Boon Keng is
              probably a good tactic in competing with the upcoming DTL 3 in any
              way and make it less winding. A win-win situation I believe. This
              is in contrast to proposals by others to cut it back to Bedok,
              which does not exactly solve the problem.</p>
              <p>If the old Service 4 between Tampines Int and St. Michael's Ter
              were to be reinstated or slightly altered and then implemented,
              will it be long-winded?</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs7557R, just keep 14, 51, 61, 67 as they are currently now. No need to return to the past. When introduce new bus services from now onwards, no need plan long routes. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>98 is very winding. It goes one big round around Jurong
              East/West Avenue 1, before coming to Taman Jurong, and then after
              that still have to go around Jurong industrial estate to Jurong
              Port.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>98's passenger market is basically split into two:<br>- between Jurong East and Lakeside MRT<br>- between Lakeside MRT and Jurong Port</p>
              <p>The workers of Jurong Port generally takes 98 from Lakeside MRT rather than Jurong East, so they won't need to "go one big round around Jurong East/West Ave 1". It's just two more stations along the EWL after Jurong East, so the impact is really minimal.</p>
              <p>Commuters who take 98 from Jurong East are generally not heading to Jurong Port, but the residential blocks along Jurong East/West Ave 1. For the residential blocks along Jurong East Ave 1 (east of Jurong Town Hall Rd), 98 is a faster option in comparison to 333, which has to detour around Toh Guan Rd first. For the residential blocks east of Jurong Town Hall Rd, 334 is certainly a faster option, but the time difference in comparison to that of between 98 and 333 is less significant, so I believe they choose between 98 and 334 based on which arrives first in the interchange.</p>
