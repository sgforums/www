              Whoever who wants to use data to analyse and like chickenlittle2 keep on defending SLBP... I see how you're going to defend SLBP's horrible acts...
              
              SLBP is like SMRT's SPH, only think of money... Dunno how to solve the problem... Today I'm going to expose chickenlittle2's defence which is all baseless... Cos SLBP dunno what's going on... anyhow operate the buses...
              
              Dun say abt exams first...Slowly going to shame whoever that has been defending SLBP... 
              
              1) 179A not making money: Sometimes whenever feedback is sent over 179A is not operated for PM peak, the subsequent few days SLBP come with pattern... "SLBP will handle it"... In reality SLBP know nuts about demand management...
              
              Sometimes when the email is sent, SLBP next day chut pattern... Sometimes schedule the 179A to be bunching up [2x] dispatched together from 27281... and they'll time it to be right behind 179 [Dun think people dunno... about tabulating runtime]...
              
              Some days, the 179A all starts from 27231...
              
              I thought to begin with, 179A is 50:50 dispatch from both 27281 and 27231? 
              
              And when I mentioned about South Spine.. Next day all 179A starts from 27231... 
              
              Let me say this la.. chickenlittle2 can deny for all he wants.. but already exposed... When I feedback to people at SBST over 179A in Aug 2010 and soon the downroute of 179A was made.. soon SLBP act smart thinking how come Braddell suddenly make downroute... and soon most of the 179A start from 27231 thinking it's a new demand?
              
              The problem at South Spine was there for years and it only took my suggestion for the matter to be resolved? What on earth SLBP has been doing on the past few years? 
              
              Only know how to manipulate things... decent things dun want to follow and do... 
              
              2) Downroute: How come 96B got downroute operated as stipulated, SLBP keep on refusing to operate 179A properly... 
              
              3) Exam Sat slot: There was once 179A was operated on Sat.. But SLBP went on to chut pattern... BNL Timekeeper tell people 179A not operated on the 2nd slot from Boon Lay.. only downroute from NTU...
              
              Tell people the poster printed wrongly... Big liar!
              
              Nonsense! I checked with people at Braddell and verified SLBP chut pattern... End up company dispatched the bus to waste by SLBP... No wonder chickenlittle2 keep on saying 179A not making money.. cos anyhow operate...
              
              Not even complying to company's rule... Woah... 
              
              4) Today's mess: 179A SLBP simply refused to operate properly... Freq was at 7 - 8 mins per bus... 
              
              End up next time, thanks to the slow clearance.. people began queuing for 179... Next thing which I'm not surprised, people along Pioneer Rd Nth found it hard to board the bus.. Even at 0830, the boarding mess and underops was still there... Exam was supposed to start at 0900...
              
              Yeah now 179 very profitable.. but people late for exam... And I've followed up this matter to LTA... 
              
              BusAnalyser can say 179 more dispatch... But does he saw what happened at Boon Lay? End up the bottleneck was at Boon Lay cos nearly everyone alighted at Boon Lay today for some MRT trips... 
              
              and like I've said.. SLBP dunno how to operate 179... 179A runtime is so much shorter, can turnaround faster with deploying lesser buses...
              
              But only think of "profits"... squeezing people... bus tiao at Pioneer Rd Nth as BC try to get as many people to board [upper deck still got some seat though]... lambat here, lambat there..
              
              people late for exam...
              
              As mentioned, have already highlighted this matter to LTA... See what chickenlittle2 still want to talk big about profit and loss...

              and chicklenlittle2 talk big on profit... but dunno how to plan things...
              
              No bus company in the world except SBST's SLBP would operate semi express buses if the headways + runtime is slower than the normal bus.. only SLBP is expert in this... chickenlittle2 should be proud his SLBP is number 1 in this... 
              
              and people from NTU x-fer to 157, 174, 198 dun want to take care... Encourage everyone to alight at Pioneer, then SBST pax make them with longer travelling time... 
              
              Then MRT breakdown at Joo Koon how? SLBP print notice on 179 bus say Pioneer no train service...
              
              later people think SBST want to make more money only with the leg to Boon Lay... Later it's still one big mess at Pioneer when MRT is disrupted... LOL...
              
              That's why proven... SLBP people there dun obey rules, dunno what's going on [people's feedback also anyhow pong]...
              
              The more chickenlittle2 defend SLBP... the more people rat out SLBP is contravening HQ's order and worst breaching QoS this and that...

              <p>9 minutes wait is an acceptable wait time for other services, and I believe the majority of the travelling public are OK with a wait of &lt; 10 mins. what makes 179A or you so special that a 9 minute wait for the bus is unacceptable?! will a 9 minute wait kill you?</p>
              <p>if you were late for your exam due to that 9 minute wait, surely you should have planned your time/journey better to reach early or add more buffer time into your journey?</p>

              <p>Was at pioneer around 8.15 and waited for 4 Joo Koon bound trains before a 179 arrived (downroute from St 71) to pick everyone up. By the time the bus left pioneer it was already full of standees. Not all of the pax along pioneer nth rd managed to board.</p>
              <p>When I got off at LWN lib it was already 8.40am, and the only bus behind was a 179A. Something happen at boon lay int? Where did all the 179 go?</p>

              <p><br>- If you really think that ppl in SBS is brainless and dont knw how to make things work (more importantly earning profits for the company) why not join the company and make things work. Since you claim that you know how to operate the service to make it profit, i'm very sure SBS is more than happy to hire someone who can help save the company from going into the red. <br><br>- If you really think SBS play punk with the QoS, let me set you a challenge. The next time PTC announce the QoS results to the public why not u go challenge the results ? Since you claim that they always fail the QoS.</p>

              <p>I think other forumates are sick and tired of your rants about 179 / 179A. If you really think u can make a difference, go join SBS or LTA and really make a difference in ppl's daily life. NOT sitting behind your com and keep claming you know this so-and-so person or that so-and-so person from this or that organisation. seriously NOBODY CARES !!  </p>

              <p>Whoever who wants to use data to analyse and like chickenlittle2
              keep on defending <span>SLBP</span>… I see how you’re
              going to defend <span>SLBP</span>’s horrible acts…</p>
              <p><span>SLBP</span> is like <span>SMRT</span>’s
              <span>SPH</span>, only think of money… Dunno how to solve
              the problem… Today I’m going to expose chickenlittle2’s defence
              which is all baseless… Cos <span>SLBP</span> dunno what’s
              going on… anyhow operate the buses…</p>
              <p>Dun say abt exams first…Slowly going to shame whoever that has
              been defending <span>SLBP</span>…</p>
              <p>1) 179A not making money: Sometimes whenever feedback is sent
              over 179A is not operated for PM peak, the subsequent few days
              <span>SLBP</span> come with pattern… “SLBP will handle
              it”... In reality <span>SLBP</span> know nuts about demand
              management…</p>
              <p>Sometimes when the email is sent, <span>SLBP</span> next day chut pattern… Sometimes schedule the 179A to be bunching
              up [2x] dispatched together from 27281… and they’ll time it to be
              right behind 179 [Dun think people dunno… about tabulating
              runtime]...</p>
              <p>Some days, the 179A all starts from 27231…</p>
              <p>I thought to begin with, 179A is 50:50 dispatch from both 27281
              and 27231?</p>
              <p>And when I mentioned about South Spine.. Next day all 179A
              starts from 27231…</p>
              <p>Let me say this la.. chickenlittle2 can deny for all he wants..
              but already exposed… When I feedback to people at <span>SBST</span> over 179A in Aug 2010 and soon the downroute of 179A
              was made.. soon <span>SLBP</span> act smart thinking how
              come Braddell suddenly make downroute… and soon most of the 179A
              start from 27231 thinking it’s a new demand?</p>
              <p>The problem at South Spine was there for years and it only took
              my suggestion for the matter to be resolved? What on earth
              <span>SLBP</span> has been doing on the past few
              years?</p>
              <p>Only know how to manipulate things… decent things dun want to
              follow and do…</p>
              <p>2) Downroute: How come 96B got downroute operated as stipulated,
              <span>SLBP</span> keep on refusing to operate 179A
              properly…</p>
              <p>3) Exam Sat slot: There was once 179A was operated on Sat.. But
              <span>SLBP</span> went on to chut pattern… <span>BNL</span> Timekeeper tell people 179A not operated on the 2nd
              slot from Boon Lay.. only downroute from <span>NTU</span>…</p>
              <p>Tell people the poster printed wrongly… Big liar!</p>
              <p>Nonsense! I checked with people at Braddell and verified
              <span>SLBP</span> chut pattern… End up company dispatched
              the bus to waste by <span>SLBP</span>… No wonder
              chickenlittle2 keep on saying 179A not making money.. cos anyhow
              operate…</p>
              <p>Not even complying to company’s rule… Woah…</p>
              <p>4) Today’s mess: 179A <span>SLBP</span> simply refused
              to operate properly… Freq was at 7 – 8 mins per bus…</p>
              <p>End up next time, thanks to the slow clearance.. people began
              queuing for 179… Next thing which I’m not surprised, people along
              Pioneer Rd Nth found it hard to board the bus.. Even at 0830, the
              boarding mess and underops was still there… Exam was supposed to
              start at 0900…</p>
              <p>Yeah now 179 very profitable.. but people late for exam… And
              I’ve followed up this matter to <span>LTA</span>…</p>
              <p>BusAnalyser can say 179 more dispatch… But does he saw what
              happened at Boon Lay? End up the bottleneck was at Boon Lay cos
              nearly everyone alighted at Boon Lay today for some <span>MRT</span> trips…</p>
              <p>and like I’ve said.. <span>SLBP</span> dunno how to
              operate 179… 179A runtime is so much shorter, can turnaround faster
              with deploying lesser buses…</p>
              <p>But only think of “profits”... squeezing people… bus tiao at
              Pioneer Rd Nth as BC try to get as many people to board [upper deck
              still got some seat though]... lambat here, lambat there..</p>
              <p>people late for exam…</p>
              <p>As mentioned, have already highlighted this matter to
              <span>LTA</span>… See what chickenlittle2 still want to
              talk big about profit and loss…</p>

              <p>I agree with you. 179 is one of the best operated services with 28 full fleet DDs for a short route. Frequency during peak time for 179/179A combined can be 2-4 mins during peak. All those going to Boon Lay have a bus at least every 4mins if not sooner. Yet he wants to complain. </p>
