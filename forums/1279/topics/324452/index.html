              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yesterday i decided to try a Scania K230Ub ride on svc 3. the one where i suggested extension to Punggol nw town from PSR eons ago.</p>
              <p>I had loaded into my brain a demand pattern for svc 3:(changed with respect to a Scania k230Ub has 30 seating)</p>
              <p>-tampines &gt; Punggol (evening peak)<br>correct as of 2005 (oops)<br>-high load at tampines int -(svc294 route) all drop off. few board<br>. -tampines ave 2 &gt; Loyang Ave - less than 10 pax on board<br>-Pasir ris dr 1 - pasir ris dr 12 (svc 357 route) moderate with 5 standees. Boarding from st 41 onwards, reach peak at Pasir ris MRT. all alight. Alot of people board for other side of town loop. Hit 10 standees, then gradually drop.<br>-only 10 pax on baord till Punggol new town<br>-In Punggol new town, all alight except 5 or so who will board in Punggol to go NEL.</p>
              <p>all wrong. lol</p>
              <p>This is what happened<br>As expected, many people board at int. then at ave 4, MRT station more board. bus full.<br>Within svc 294 route, pax baord and alight i was suprised. I thhought only pax will alight msotly. but a smooth exchange occurs keeping the bus at 75 percent full throughtout.<br>By the time we turn out to Tampz ave 2, bus was 80 percent full. it appears people now take across from 294 route to 357 route. maybe due to svc 17 high loads now?<br>By the time we reached Loyang, bus full.<br>Throught the svc 357 east loop, a furiuos exchnage of commuters on bus again leaving bus full at all times.<br>At the town centre, true a lot of people alight but many stayed on board. then a whole crazy load of people rush for the bus. the bus became 110 percent full.<br>We call at the next 4 stops barely allowing alighting and BC open door to allow ppl to try squeeze in. Finally we reach the drop off zones on 357 West loop, more or less many people do alight but i found it suprised to see people baord the bus tward punggol.<br>By the time we reach PSR Drive 12, bus was fully seated with 35 standees. i stun. I overheard one pax on the phone<br>" I am on my way to Punggol Sit NEl go Clarke Quay!". Wise choice. later i found the NEL very empty toward town.<br>when we reach Punggol new town, the pax loads start to drop till almost reach int only 5 on baord matching my profile,<br><br>So only start of trip and end of trip few stops my profile match. ouch. Must refresh.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yes service 3 really good now.<br><br>last time when it just started, i guess people still didnt know abt the route and all.<br><br>294 then at most only 3-5 standees at tampines mrt station ave 2-bound. i think have to see if 3 or 21 arrives first coz people go ave 7(tpjc &amp; b4 TPE flyover take either 3 or 21).<br><br>likewise for ave 2 bus stops, must see if 3/9/12/17/34 which one come first?<br><br>pasir ris that one needless to say. even if got 3A just waitingggg a distance before the bus stop during PM peak(&amp; BC resting on passengers' seat), a bunch of people would be queueing at the front of bus stop already.<br><br>just my $0.02. i stay opposite the tampines mrt stn bus stop for 21 years riaos.</p></div>

              <p>Yes, Svc 3's load demand has improved these days, lots of elderly takes the bus especially from the neighbourhood areas to Pasir Ris or Tampines interchange. I think if 3 would to become a WAB svc, they would have to put more KUBs or new SD buses in the near future.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I live at Pasir Ris St 21 and I take Service 3 almost everyday. Service 3's evening peak loading is just scary, especially in the direction towards Punggol (from Tampines to Pasir Ris). A lot of people take it from Tampines to Pasir Ris St 21 because it's direct and convenient (including me). In fact, I think Service 3's demand from Tampines to Pasir Ris is higher than that of Service 81, whose loading seems to have dropped quite a bit. 2 of Service 81's DDs should go to Service 3 (I know it's not possible haha).</p></div>
