            <div class='col-md body'>Each day my  bus (SBST 165) may spend up to 5 minutes at busstop outside AMK MRT Station (Along AMK Ave3).<br><br>It was noticed that SBST 268 jammed up at the busstop. Other buses may jam too, bust SBSt 268 definitely is one.<br><br>Shouldn't LTA consider staggered bus services calling at the busstops outside AMK MRT Station?<br><br>That may save both commuters and travelling times, any opinions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The stop should be there, it is some of the important bus stops in AMK.<br><br>For 165 / 74 / 132 / 25 / 88 / 76 ( perhaps maybe more ), People from the Northeast region may take them to change to MRT at AMK, alternatively from NEL.<br><br>74 / 165 also important for people transit from MRT to buses heading to the Bukit Timah area, perhaps NP, SIM, HCJC, NJC, NYGH, CHS, SP and maybe more.<br><br>268 is required to stop there, it is badly needed during morning peak hours.<br><br>Firstly, A lot of people working in AMK Ind. Park 2, they will need 268 to serve them between the Ind. Park and AMK MRT, although 73, 165, 88, 132, 25, 76 and 74 served there. The internal parts of AMK Ind Park 2 is only served by 268. Besides 268, other buses that served AMK Ind. Park ( as mentioned earlier ) also got fully packed sometimes.<br><br>Secondly, People staying in AMK Ave 4 can have an alternative way to get to AMK MRT, besides 76 and 269.<br><br>If the bus stops there are reduced, the commuters might be having some inconvenience in transferring between MRT and bus. The AMK MRT bus stop is not the only bus stop in AMK that buses spent 5 minutes to let passengers for boarding and alighting, there one opposite AMK Mac Centre ( along AMK Ave 3 ) is also another one. About less than 50 metres before that bus stop, there is also another bus stop ( on the same direction ) that serves 86, 162, 853, 138 and 169. Sometimes, that place is also congested during morning peak hours.<br><br>One suggested way to solve the problem is probably building a underpass for AMK Ave 3 under AMK Ave 8, to allow more traffic to flow, at least easier for 25, 73 and 261 to get to the third lane to turn right into AMK Ave 8 from Ave 3.<br><br>Once the new AMK Bus Interchange is completed, disallow 25, 73 and 261 to call at that particular stop, since the new BI is just an underpass away from the MRT station. This is to divert the passengers away from the congested bus stop during peak hours ( morning especially ).<br><br>Special bus stop for 268 could be set up at AMK Ave 3 ( towards Hougang ), just before the junction of AMK Ave 8. Once again, the passengers are diverted. ( Similar idea to the suggested 261, 73 and 25 routes ). At the new bus stop, passengers ( from 268 ) still can get to the MRT station by using the underpass. Nevertheless, the passengers from Upper Thomson, Marymount, AMK west side can still transfer between 268 and other buses that serves AMK Ave 3 at the bus stop before AMK Mac Centre or the bus stop at Blk 580 AMK Ave 3.<br><br><strong>This is <span style="color: blue;">not to fulfil personal desire.</span> This is for the benefit for commuters between Hougang, Serangoon North, AMK Ind. Park 2, AMK town as well as the commuters of the buses that called along AMK MRT ( Ave 3 ) bus stop, as well as allow faster traffic flow along the particular stretch of AMK Ave 3 during peak hours.</strong></div>
