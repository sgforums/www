            <div class='col-md body'>many McDonald's outlets have started to offer payment by ez-link card through the eye-drop shaped readers. for such transactions, the GTMs display them as "Non-transit Transaction" while AVMs display them as "QBME".<br><br>and i managed to preview the functions of ez-link machine (standalone ones) with a LCD screen, a card reader, a receipt dispenser &amp; (probably) a notes slot. the known menu hireachy is as follows:<br><br>&gt; Loyalty &amp; Rewards<br>&gt; &gt; My Points<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; ezlink card<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand phone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; web nickname<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; other swipe card<br>&gt; &gt; Redeem Points<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; ezlink card<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand phone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; web nickname<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; other swipe card<br>&gt; &gt; Update Membership<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; ezlink card<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand phone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; web nickname<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; other swipe card<br>&gt; &gt; New Membership<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Website Pre-registration<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enter your NICK NAME used registering on the Website<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; In Store registration<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Host/Hostess Swipe Your Card<br><br>&gt; ez-link Functions<br>&gt; &gt; Cash Balance (works but no transaction history available)<br>&gt; &gt; Cash Top up (service will be available soon)<br><br>no info about registration is available on the website at <a href="http://www.mcd.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcd.com.sg</a>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>im not quite keen about this using of ezlink cards for normal retail transactions, esp at places like macs, and esp if the cards are linked to giro. wow. how r parents going to control their child's spending? the spending is going to be invisible to the child, and hence less impactful than peeking into the wallet and pulling out some he can feel and seeing the actual amount in his wallet dwindling. i myself was a victim of my own atm card when i was younger.</div>

But many parents GIRO-link their children's ez-link cards, so that when value drops below $1, money is topped up for the kids.
