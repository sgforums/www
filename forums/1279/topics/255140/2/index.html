That makes you happy.<br><br>Stop whining and just complain to the bus company. Await the outcome of the disciplinary action, if any. That's REAL action.</div></blockquote>not always. i've seen near 1/3 of the BCs are rude. if you call BCs wait for someone to come who needs to take this bus either urgently or other reasons, they don't care, just scold you and wait. Some even like, like someone said, a group of girls take bus then wait wait wait for the other group come then the bus close drive off. 1/3 of BCs are rude, the others are quite friendly. but i agree, complain to bus company is best. last time i see someone running for the bus then reach the entrance door of the bus the BC act never see drive off then this person go take down the bus rego and most likely complained to the bus company. this is the best solution for now towards inconsiderate BCs.</div>

Would we want our country to be looked down upon by the world like people saying "Oh, this is just another normal country, people complain, run for buses and miss them, and hygiene is bad". And the whole point of me saying this is that Singapore, with its very affordable resource management, should improve in both bus cleanliness and having drivers who dont act very bitchy.</div>
