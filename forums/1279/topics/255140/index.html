However I would like to point out that such action is part of our safety measure to ensure that passengers do not hurt themselves during the attempt to board the bus while the bus is about to move off.<br><br>We apologise about the misunderstanding between you and the driver. Contrary to what was mentioned, the bus driver replied that she was merely trying to warn you to stay away from the bus, due to safety concerns.<br><br>We sincerely hope that you flag the bus in advance so that the driver will be prepared to stop and open the door.

I just want people to listen and know. That's usually what a rant is for. I don't expect you guys to do anything since we citizens can't really make a difference anyway. And no I won't be any happier, because I'm still pissed off.<br><br>I believe the bus company receive many complaints everyday. They are not going to give a damn to this small incident, like I've said, where only 1 small little me is offended. </div></blockquote>You can do what LazerLordz proposed: a calm yet strong letter.<br><br>Re: Complaint on Bus 700 (Exact location and bus timing)<br><br>Dear sir/madam,<br><br>XXX bus company has had a fine and long history in Singapore all these years. I have been most impressed with your company, especially the upgrade of better quality buses and ever friendly bus captains.<br><br>However, a recent incident has left me less than satisfied. (Explain your red light incident nicely here) I had tapped on the door politely a few times but the bus captain just looked at me blankly and ignored me. While I understand that buses cannot pick up passengers just about anywhere except at bus stops, I cannot comprehend the inflexible behaviour here. It was the red light and there were no oncoming motorcycles from the bus's left. The bus captain would have seen it from her left sided mirror. Safety is a non-issue here and it was still the red light at that moment. Would your company have any explanation as to why she could not open the door to allow me up?<br><br>I have often seen buses leaving bus bays for 1 to 3 meters, only to stop again. Then I would see a grateful passenger huffing and puffing his or her way up the bus. Unfortunately, I was bestowed no such kind act that afternoon. Instead, it was a show of nonchalance. Why has the company's employee demonstrated such an indifferent and inflexible behaviour towards a passenger? I certainly hope it's not because your esteemed organisation has monopolised that route.<br><br>I would like a proper explanation on this matter. If not, I shall ensure that this letter goes to The Straits Times or The New Paper and your complaints department shall reply me in the national press.<br><br>Yours sincerely</div>
