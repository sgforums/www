            <div class='col-md body'>thank you for the info. here's the story.<br><br>Jan 30, 2005<br><span class="large"><strong>Bus Spotting </strong></span><br><br><span class="small">They chase buses the way some people stalk idols. LifeStyle flags down Singapore's bus spotters<br>By Lin Ziyu</span><br><br>ASK teacher Poon Ngai Seng about buses and he has all the answers, and more.<br><br>The longest bus route in Singapore? Service number 51, he tells you without hesitation.<br><br>He goes on to inform you that the trip lasts 100 to 145 minutes, depending on traffic conditions, and covers 38km plying between Hougang Central and Jurong East.<br><br>He is not alone in knowing such trivia. He is among an estimated 100-plus enthusiasts in Singapore who are known as bus spotters.<br><br>They look out for things like the vehicle's model and design, even the advertisements buses carry. And they get a thrill trying out all the latest routes.<br><br>Mostly male and ranging from teenagers to working professionals, these fans usually first touch base via online forum groups such as Singapore Buses@sgForums and SG Buses@sgWiki.<br><br>And even if some might own cars, they prefer to take the bus to get around.<br><br>Mr Poon, 30, has belonged to a Yahoo group of about 12 fanatics, called Bus Enthusiasts, for more than three years now.<br><br>They organise bus-spotting trips - Orchard Road is one hotspot for its heavy bus traffic - about once a month on weekends or whenever there is a special bus event.<br><br>For example, they are planning an outing to try out the new services to Chinatown from Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and Clementi, launched on Jan 21.<br><br>SBS Transit operates about 2,500 buses while SMRT runs 838.<br><br>Mr Poon's interest in buses started from young. He recalls fondly: 'Every evening, my father would take me to the then Kampong Chai Chee bus terminal to look at buses before dinner.'<br><br>Needless to say, Dad was also a bus fan.<br><br>Mr Poon loves the sound of the vehicles' engine while two other members of his group - Mr Joseph Lim and Mr Gan Soon Hup - go for the design of buses.<br><br>Sometimes, their passion gets them suspicious looks from bus drivers.<br><br>Mr Gan, 25, who is studying electrical and electronic engineering at Nanyang Technological University, says: 'Some will stop and ask us why we are taking photos. They are afraid we are terrorists planning to bomb the bus.'<br><br>Still, that has not stopped Mr Poon from amassing more than 1,000 photos of advertisements plastered on buses.<br><br>A favourite, he says, is one promoting Hong Kong actor Stephen Chow's latest movie Kungfu Hustle.<br><br>Mr Lim, 29, a project manager, has built up a collection of over 10,000 digital shots which he shares with fellow enthusiasts.<br><br>But they are no mere placid observers of buses and will get into the thick of action if need be to trail that elusive bus.<br><br>Mr Lim once gave chase in his car to snap a rare shot of a bus whose particular model did not usually ply that route.<br><br>Further down the road, Mr Gan dreams of starting a bus museum, similar to the Sheffield Bus Museum in Britain, because he feels it is a shame to scrap old buses.<br><br>They used to be exported to China, Vietnam and Hong Kong but because of a recent fall in demand, they are now sold for scrap.<br><br>But a more realistic next stop is a bus-spotting trip to Hong Kong - where there are many bus enthusiasts - which Mr Poon is planning in June.<br><br>If that sounds to detractors like a further waste of time and money, Mr Lim begs to differ.<br><br>'Compared to others with a passion for cars or planes, we're always regarded as a strange group of people. But I just hope that people will accept the hobby and not look at us as weirdos.'<br><br>Â© Straits Times Interactive</div>
