              <p>My Chemistry teacher told our whole class about this incident in my Chemistry remedial just now.According to him,the incident happened today.This is what he told us.<br><br>My friend is in 4E3.I can't say his name here because if i say,there would be trouble.So i shall just call him by short form here which is 'TH'.There are 2 bus fans in this class.<br><br>The incident begins here:<br><br>Apparently,TH was on the bus on his way to school in the morning as usual today.But my teacher didn't tell us the svc number of the bus he was in to protect the BC.He had brought a cup with him into the bus and he had been drinking inside the bus.Then when he finished drinking,he just kept the cup at the side of the seat and left it there.When he was alighting,the BC had noticed that he didn't have his cup with him.So the BC quickly got out of his cabin and found the cup at the seat where TH was sitting.<br><br>So he immediately took the cup and ran after TH to give the cup to him and to ask him to throw the cup away in a rubbish bin.Apparently,TH wasn't happy about being asked to throw the cup away in a bin and a confrontation broke out.<br><br>Suddenly,TH just punched the BC in the nose.I don't know what happened after this because this is all that my teacher told us.My teacher didn't tell us if the BC recieved any injuries or not.He told us that many newspaper reporters were going to come to our school and maybe that our school would appear in the newspaper soon regarding this matter.But our teacher told us that our principal had recieved a report regarding the incident and all the teachers in our school were called to an immediate emergency meeting regarding this matter.<br><br>Our teacher also warned us not to tell anything to the newspaper reporters if they asked us anything about this matter.He asked us to direct them to our principal instead.<br><br>This matter is still under serious investigation.Wonder what is going to happen.Pity the BC involved in this incident.Hope that he didn't have any injuries.</p>

              <p>TH is wrong. It is obvious. For misbehaviour, he had lost respect for himself and the public has look down on him. It is better if he can write a <strong>letter of apology</strong> to apologize for his misbehaviour.</p>
              <p>If everyone is like him, litter on the bus, the bus will be a rubbish cute. If everyone is so violent, singapore become a barbaric nation.  </p>
              <p>Tell your friend not to worry so much. A letter of apology would have be able to solve the problem. Just say in the letter, some excuse "My pet just died, my GF left, I am late for school or exam... And should be able to get pass. Meet up the bus captain and say apology face to face."</p>
              <p>Obviously don't do it again. This just make him look childish, stupid and have not grown up.</p>
