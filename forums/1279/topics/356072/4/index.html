              <p>I would say that the stream of the person study in doesn't really matter, his character is what matters most. His actions are stupid enough to screw himself up.</p>
              <p>Even myself encounter such thing before, my classmates brought up food and drinks onboard SBS605G, sv315. I didn't stop them, because you know, hooligans are hooligans, no point getting yourself into trouble. They dropped a bottle of sweet drink and pours on the floor, they didn't pick it up immediately and let it flow, just like that. I can't stand what they're doing, alighted immediately at S'goon Gardens and transfer sv317 to S'goon Ctrl instead.</p>
              <p>Somehow, the panel in front, offside of the bus dropped off. The bus was driven by a S-Shift driver later then taken off service accordingly. The bus was missing for a few days, back on service with restickered body, adjusted rego plate and repainted rims (This is the current SBS605G we have now).</p>

              <p><br>I agree, even if the school's reputation is at stake here.</p>
              <p>somehow or rather we should use this incident to teach those gangster-wannabe-kids out there a lesson. and since the boy is already 16, he can be charged under the law and liable for a jail term.</p>
              <p>under the penal code, whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending thereby to dishonour that person, otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment, or with fine, or with both. and in addition to that, he has also defamed the BC, thus it's 2 charges in total.</p>
              <p>therefore, if such cases are being let off lightly, more youngsters will behave like your friend and would you want to see hooligans becoming the future "leaders" and causing the downfall of the society and economy?</p>
              <p>maybe a jail term is too harsh, but then public caning or expulsion from school may be too light a punishment for this guy to be let off.</p>

              <p>We always believe that express student (supposed to be smarter) is able to use their brain and think before acting. And obviously TH is a <strong>moron. </strong></p>
              <p>Normal and Norm tech (sad to say, less intellect) so we tends to let them go. And be more tolerant to them.</p>
              <p>Acting like a Hooligan, make people despise. Tell you friend TH to have some common sense, stop being a moron. He is an express student and ask him to use his brain more. So childish!</p>
              <p>And I would advise you to stay away from him. You might get cheated eventually, by these bad guys and drag you into misery.</p>
