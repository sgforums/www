              <p>My Chemistry teacher told our whole class about this incident in
              my Chemistry remedial just now.According to him,the incident
              happened today.This is what he told us.<br> <br> My friend is in 4E3.I can't say his name here because if i
              say,there would be trouble.So i shall just call him by short form
              here which is 'TH'.There are 2 bus fans in this class.<br> <br> The incident begins here:<br> <br> Apparently,TH was on the bus on his way to school in the morning as
              usual today.But my teacher didn't tell us the svc number of the bus
              he was in to protect the BC.He had brought a cup with him into the
              bus and he had been drinking inside the bus.Then when
              he finished drinking,he just kept the cup at the side of the
              seat and left it there.When he was alighting,the BC had noticed
              that he didn't have his cup with him.So the BC quickly got out of
              his cabin and found the cup at the seat where TH was
              sitting.<br> <br> So he immediately took the cup and ran after TH to give the
              cup to him and to ask him to throw the cup away in a rubbish
              bin.Apparently,TH wasn't happy about being asked to throw the cup
              away in a bin and a confrontation broke out.<br> <br> Suddenly,TH just punched the BC in the nose.I don't know what
              happened after this because this is all that my teacher told us.My
              teacher didn't tell us if the BC recieved any injuries or not.He
              told us that many newspaper reporters were going to come to our
              school and maybe that our school would appear in the newspaper soon
              regarding this matter.But our teacher told us that our principal
              had recieved a report regarding the incident and all the teachers
              in our school were called to an immediate emergency meeting
              regarding this matter.<br> <br> Our teacher also warned us not to tell anything to the newspaper
              reporters if they asked us anything about this matter.He asked us
              to direct them to our principal instead.<br> <br> This matter is still under serious investigation.Wonder what is
              going to happen.Pity the BC involved in this incident.Hope that he
              didn't have any injuries.</p>
