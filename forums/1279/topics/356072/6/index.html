              <p>speaking of tht, i might go a little off-topic.</p>
              <p>Today i took my BC friend sv 174 on SBS9050Y. There's one fella who is quite well-known by many sv 174 BC. He's known to shout on the bus, talking to himself &amp; whacking ppl on the bus. Guess wad, he boarded up the bus at Bukit Batok. Tht fella throwed a $1 into the coin box and waiting for the ticket to come out. My BC friend asked him whether where he want to go. He asked tht fella like 3 times and he shout back at my BC friend "BUKIT TIMAH!!!". So there he go, gettting a ticket and cursing &amp; swearing to himself. For the whole journey, he keep talking to himself &amp; post wierd actions on the bus. He not only did not alighted at Bukit Timah, but alighted at Orchard Rd. Many ppl on the bus was so scared at him tht alot of them alighted at the 2nd stop after he boarded the bus &amp; those tht boarded the bus after tht fella also get down the bus before reaching the 3rd stop. I nearly even get off the bus when the bus reached Dunearn Rd. My BC friend wanna throw him off the bus cauze for his irritating actions &amp; did not paid fully the bus fare. But he resisted cauze he sure kena public complain. The worst thing is tht when he asked the fella whether where he want to go for 3 times, he kena letter complained when my BC friend reached NBR terminal.</p>

              <p>SBST should speed up the installation of CCTV, and on all buses. A lot of these cases can be investigated more easily with video footage, and serve as an effective deterrent against violent behaviour or/and defense against frivolous complaints. (the infamous JB bus robbery comes to mind)</p>
