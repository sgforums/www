              <p>THE two schoolboys got up from their seats as the bus was approaching their stop.</p>
              <p>But they left something behind on the floor - a disposable cup.</p>
              <p>That did not sit well with the bus driver, Mr R Balakrishnan. After pulling over at the bus stop, he stepped out of his cabin and told the boys to dispose of the cup properly.</p>

              <p>It ended with one of the boys allegedly punching him in the face before they fled.</p>
              <p>The incident happened on SBS Transit bus service 38 at about 2.45pm on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>A commuter who witnessed it related his account on Stomp, The Straits Times interactive website, on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Stomper, who calls himself Danny, also posted a picture of the boys, from Changkat Changi Secondary, after they got off the bus.</p>
              <p>Both were in their school uniforms. One of them, who was wearing long trousers, appeared to be taunting the bus driver. His friend was wearing shorts.</p>
              <p>In an e-mail reply to The New Paper, Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's vice-president of corporate communications , confirmed the incident.</p>
              <p>She said that when the boys had boarded the bus at Simei MRT station, Mr Balakrishnan noticed that one of them had a disposable cup.</p>
              <p>Along Bedok South Road, when the students were about to alight, he noticed that they no longer had the cup.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said: 'He politely requested that the boy pick it up and dispose of it in the litter bin at the bus stop.'</p>
              <p>The boy picked up the cup and told Mr Balakrishnan that he should take the cup home instead, Ms Tan added.</p>
              <p>Mr Balakrishnan returned to his cabin and opened the exit door for the boys.</p>
              <p>But as he was alighting, the boy with the cup threw it on the steps of the bus.</p>
              <p>When Mr Balakrishnan saw that, he picked up the cup and got off the bus to ask the boy why he had done that, Ms Tan said.</p>
              <p>But the boy punched him in the face before running off with his friend.</p>
              <p>Mr Balakrishnan chased them but soon gave up as there were still passengers in the bus.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said: 'The boy continued to taunt Mr Balakrishnan and kept asking him to give chase.'</p>
              <p>The boy wearing the trousers was believed to be the attacker.</p>
              <p><strong>Not seriously injured</strong></p>
              <p>When contacted, Changkat Changi Secondary principal Yeow Lee Lin said the two students would be dealt with.</p>
              <p>Mrs Yeow said: 'We have identified the students concerned and are also working closely with their parents to provide counselling and guidance to them.</p>
              <p>'The students have expressed regret over what has happened. We have also used this incident as an opportunity to educate the rest of the school.'</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said: 'We are thankful that our bus captain was not seriously injured. We are in contact with the school and the Ministry of Education.'</p>
              <p>SBS Transit said no police report was made.</p>
