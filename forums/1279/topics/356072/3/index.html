              <p>My Chemistry teacher told our whole class about this incident in
                  my Chemistry remedial just now.According to him,the incident
                  happened today.This is what he told us.<br> <br> My friend is in 4E3.I can't say his name here because if i
                  say,there would be trouble.So i shall just call him by short form
                  here which is 'TH'.There are 2 bus fans in this class.<br> <br> The incident begins here:<br> <br> Apparently,TH was on the bus on his way to school in the morning as
                  usual today.But my teacher didn't tell us the svc number of the bus
                  he was in to protect the BC.He had brought a cup with him into the
                  bus and he had been drinking inside the bus.Then when
                  he finished drinking,he just kept the cup at the side of the
                  seat and left it there.When he was alighting,the BC had noticed
                  that he didn't have his cup with him.So the BC quickly got out of
                  his cabin and found the cup at the seat where TH was
                  sitting.<br> <br> So he immediately took the cup and ran after TH to give the
                  cup to him and to ask him to throw the cup away in a rubbish
                  bin.Apparently,TH wasn't happy about being asked to throw the cup
                  away in a bin and a confrontation broke out.<br> <br> Suddenly,TH just punched the BC in the nose.I don't know what
                  happened after this because this is all that my teacher told us.My
                  teacher didn't tell us if the BC recieved any injuries or not.He
                  told us that many newspaper reporters were going to come to our
                  school and maybe that our school would appear in the newspaper soon
                  regarding this matter.But our teacher told us that our principal
                  had recieved a report regarding the incident and all the teachers
                  in our school were called to an immediate emergency meeting
                  regarding this matter.<br> <br> Our teacher also warned us not to tell anything to the newspaper
                  reporters if they asked us anything about this matter.He asked us
                  to direct them to our principal instead.<br> <br> This matter is still under serious investigation.Wonder what is
                  going to happen.Pity the BC involved in this incident.Hope that he
                  didn't have any injuries.</p>

              <p>sad to say, your friend is at fault. in the first place, are passengers even allowed to drink onboard buses? i believe this BC is already nice enough to not pursue the matter. besides, did your friend ever thought about the consequences when he beat up the BC? from a third person point of view, the BC seemed calm and not wanting to pursue the matter. now, its a bit too late for your friend to regret his action since the matter is known to your school and to the press but just hope that he will get a lenient punishment after this (though in most schools, if they are strict, caning, probation, if serious enough, expulsion).</p>

              <p>they should just impose a fine on the TS's friend for drinking on the bus. Once the students start having to pay hefty fines out of their pockets, they will start learning.</p>
