              for the same chassis. I wonder why SBST chose the lowest HP.

              SBST had made a tender for a demonstrator with 260hp and above, but at that point, the distributor for MAN could only supply a 18.240 on a more immediate basis for demonstration purposes, and actually this chassis was originally destined for another country.

              <p><br>SBST does keep track of the profitability of each service. They collect data from the ezlink cards. it was more tidious previously. and this is the job of the FINANCE department (like duh).</p>
              <p>Why S191 was converted to peak hour only service in the early 1990s was that being a full day service wasnt profitable. It has since reverted back to a Day service after much uproar by the Portsdown residents.</p>
              <p>Why S507 was withdrawn in 2004 was that the pax load wasnt enough to cover the BC's daily pay.</p>
              <p>And the figures you get from the HQ is the part "Total Revenue" including bus and train operations, advertising and others. They will never reveal the minute breakdown of each services'  revenue/profitability to the shareholders, let alone the public.</p>

              <p>Seriously , what is wrong with you all fighting about bumpers and potholes and whether WAB bus can be deployed on a particular road . WAB buses are the future of singapore , so whether got pothole or not IT WILL have to be fixed sooner or later , so you will see K230 , perharps MAN &amp; B7BRLE deployed on almost all services in a few years time , whichever service its still a bus . so what if 157 cant take in k230 now , sooner or later it will have to when merc retire , SBST will have to solve the problem and LTA has to make the roads WAB bus friendly ?</p>

              <p><br>No. No. No.</p>
              <p>To tell the truth, I've been taking the DM3500s on 52 that cameo frequently. Now even got perm. They vibrate like nobody's business. Even the BC who drove 2702X last week when I hopped on it claimed that the bus was very lousy and was like a massaging machine. Why so? Everytime the bus comes to rest the engine vibrates.</p>
              <p>Please stop all these non-sensical claims to glorify SLBP. Enough is enough. We all have had experience. Please don't disclaim other's evidence and proclaim yours as superior. Everyone is equal here.</p>
              <p>Accept the facts. Don't deny everything.</p>

              <p>read properly. AMDEP could not find a suitable service due to
                  its bumper. 26, 124, 145 were the obvious failures.
                  it appears AMK, Toa Payoh End-ons, YCK, Bishan, St
                  Mikes didnt pass so they had to put it on those services.
                  understand? they gave priority to alot of services but they failed.
                  They gave 232 and 238 the highest demand BR service that uses Toa
                  Payoh sawtooth berths. i dunno why they didnt give 157 maybe
                  cos SLBP didnt want to give K230s to 157. you want more old
                  buses in the city den in the heartlands? you want those B9TL to be
                  put nearer to the heartlands like 243 den 51? must make
                  sense. already got this bumper problem. why not give
                  MAN demo a better try at AMDEP</p>

              <p>this one duscussion go nowhere. cause the bumper level is much higher than scania K230UB. furthermore the configuration of the engine parts and dash of a MAn bus is simialir to a merc. the folks who maintain mercs will have an easier time figuring out this new creature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the MAN shd go AMKDEP or SLBP where there are mercs ard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as a correction, shouldn't the Dsicovery bay hong Kong MANs be MAN 18.270.  pls note 18.270 is a 2008 updated model and NL273 is an older model using diff specs of engines altogether.</p>
