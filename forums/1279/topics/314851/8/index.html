              <p>i also anlaysed the specs leow. heres what i gathered with

              <p>review: voith 854.5?? (use this?)<br> <br> gearbox = Voith 854.5 (ignoringthe Diwa branding since pretty much
                  every voith gearbox is the Diwa brand anyways)</p>
              <p>anyhow 854.5. says in the specs is some new revolutionary
                  gearbox designs n concepts. very intresting two way fluid thrust
                  for accleration. think most gearbox is a one way thrust of
                  fluids.</p>
              <p>the reatarding pcoess sounds new..dunno what "kick back" shall
                  be, is it the same process as when enviro 500 (dennis trident
                  osos\)with voiths do when idle...suddenly engine rev a bits?.
                  Conerting kinetic energy to heat energy...uhhhhh...expect hot rear

              <p>very new gearbox i figure. must be new 2008 model kind .. means

              <p>review: 18.240 chassis review</p>
              <p>we scoot over to have a looky at some MAN 18.240 specs. we chose
                  to view 18.240HOCL-NL figuring its prob that thing.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">4 rear shock absorbers for bus. wah comfy ride. i normally hear
                  of two shcok absorber pads. this one got 4.</span></p>
              <p>the engines  figures have been analysed.. indeed a 6.8
                  litre engine. max output is 240HP (i figure u folks wd know that
                  number is reflected in the model code by now) . 18 tonne veh. close
                  counterpart to b7RLE. from the figures i think ze MAN might lose a
                  bit in acc to B7RLE Mk III EURO IV.. Coupled with the new new (2008
                  model gearbox worh)  Voith gearbox, i dunno how good the acc
                  power wd be frankly.</p>
              <p>one thing for sure, the bumper level from road level is a bit
                  higher than k230UB. i think is lower than B7RLE tho.</p>
              <p>veh width seems tad thin. cd be quite a sqeeze inside.</p>
              <p>SBS9816 drew my attention to the in-bus diagnostics of the bus
                  agai new generation chim gadgets figure out whats wrong with he
                  bus. interestingly enough there is one that figures out if the
                  brake pads r worn.\</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what makes a good MAN bbus?:</p>
              <p>have turbo whsitle, have voith whsitle. have hub reduction and
                  the typcial MAn air pressure release sounds.<br> look like Lion's City</p>
              <p>bus comes with tubro so good will have turbo whsitle.<br> bus already said to be with Voith may expect voith whistle<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"> bus has hub reduction yes. but new revolutionary hub reduction
                  reducing sound technology. wah rau. softer hubs.</span><br> Air pressure release uh? i dunno if this kind of new MAn engine
                  makes thhat sound.<br> heeey check out the front of the Gemilang Lion's City bodywork (see
                  tamago pix). its a close resemblance to a pure bred MAN Lion's City
                  bus as can be found in germany. very chio front. very enthusing (u
                  can imagine me drooling at tamago pic).. pity the side windows are
                  not full length glass. if not will super reemble a MAn lion's City
                  bus.</p>
              <p>=&gt; we have here a goooood MAN bus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>recommedation: (a preview?)<br> go sit causeway link MAN 18.310 coach on CW2. that one the engine
                  sound very sui with hubs, voith n turbo whsitles.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> i guess our dear
                  MAN 18.240 wd pretty much sound like that cuasway link one</span><br> <br> NL243 is not 18.240 is not lion's city:</p>
              <p>j<span style="color: #ff0000;">ust to inform: NL243 is not equal to 18.240. take a close look
                  at the engine numbers u will know. Also note that lion's City (the
                  full integrated product line from MAn themselves) do not have 240HP
                  chassis lines so its not a Lion's City .</span></p>
              <p>Note: The transperth folks have their TP3001 the MAN NG313 (CNG
                  fuel WAB  bendybus) which is rather close to a MAN Lion's City
                  GL bus. So that case ca sort of say iz like Lion's City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> conclusions:</p>
              <p>all in all epxectations are expectations, u'd have to ride the
                  bus itself to see for urself. For me i expect a comfortabble and
                  engine that is pleasing to ears ride. <span style="color: #333333;">hopefully same engine
                  ptiching as the CW2 MAns lor.</span></p>

              <p>Practically most , if not all, buses with air suspension has 4 shocks at the rear. That includes Scania N113CRB, MB O405 and B10Ms etc. Rear axles normally support 10tonnes and above. 2 airbags cant support that load. Normally theres 4 airbags and theres 1 shock for each airbag.</p>
              <p>Those axles used on MAN 18.240 HOCL-NL are hypoid axles. They offer single drive through. So far, i know that they are by no means, a hub reduction axle. Do correct me if im wrong here.</p>
              <p>HAR?? Really arh? Omg. Altho those 18.310 sounds nice inside, outside its perturbly loud! I took one before. Inside it sounds completely awesome with the turbo and all that. However, outside, when the bus moves off, its unbearably loud for my ears. Hopefully the new MAN sounds much softer.</p>
              <p>NL243 can be 18.240/280 or even 310. The xx.xxx is just a chassis and engine HP code. However, NL243 =/= HOCL-NL series. NL243 are fully low floor. HOCL-NL are just low entry. They have steps after the rear exit.<br>.</p>

              <p>you raise a good point. the spces for the MAN 18.240 states its
              a high floor bus chassis. not low entry WAB bus. however given LTA
              regulations, one must assume its a modified 18.240 chassis which
              can take wheelchair passengers?</p>

              <p>No. The code HOCL-NL means its a low entry chassis. If a chassis has to be modified, it can turn a safe bus into a dangerous one, unless its factory modified by MAN.</p>

When you two posts, also never think of the consequences and now still need the mods to edit those post for you two? Since you two have spent so much time arguing, now should spent some more time to edit it yourself.</p>

              <p>Practically most , if not all, buses with air suspension has 4
              shocks at the rear. That includes Scania N113CRB, MB O405 and B10Ms
              etc. Rear axles normally support 10tonnes and above. 2 airbags cant
              support that load. Normally theres 4 airbags and theres 1 shock for
              each airbag.</p>
              <p>Those axles used on MAN 18.240 HOCL-NL are hypoid axles. They
              offer single drive through. So far, i know that they are by no
              means, a hub reduction axle. Do correct me if im wrong here.</p>
              <p>HAR?? Really arh? Omg. Altho those 18.310 sounds nice inside,
              outside its perturbly loud! I took one before. Inside it sounds
              completely awesome with the turbo and all that. However, outside,
              when the bus moves off, its unbearably loud for my ears. Hopefully
              the new MAN sounds much softer.</p>
              <p>NL243 can be 18.240/280 or even 310. The xx.xxx is just a
              chassis and engine HP code. However, NL243 =/= HOCL-NL series.
              NL243 are fully low floor. HOCL-NL are just low entry. They have
              steps after the rear exit.<br> .</p>

              <p>No. The code HOCL-NL means its a low entry chassis. If a chassis
                  has to be modified, it can turn a safe bus into a dangerous one,

              <p>I see</p>
              <p>i guess when one section of the specs sheet place put 18.240 as low entry i thought the step is at front like the MAN SL252s in KL . (errr are those RapidKl svc 338 MANs Sl252 btw right?).

Like merc O405NH? If like that, i deduce the MAN Nlxx3 series are an offering by MAn to compete with the zero step all the way offerings of merc O405NH chassis type.</p>
              <p>--high floor MANs crazy angled front step----</p>
              <p>incidentally i have seen blueprint figures of a MAN SL202 in some european bus operations textbook. the 45 degree angled step fron entry at front door is the step i refer to. i like that step cause its a unique feature on some MAN high floor  citybuses. the KL MAns have that step too which i thought is cool. <br><br>of coz most people will find that step stupid as it is angled and u have to turn your body into that angle in order to proceed on into the bus middle sections or rear. if i recall correctly the angled step is part of a 2 step entry for he KL MAns. So u imagine u ahve to tap ur card loew then see the funny angle step, twist ur body go up the step then u se...another step..but this time its aligned with the vreath of the bus body and up u go on this one.</p>
              <p>in the book , the Sl202 is a one angled-step entry bus.</p>
              <p> i do wonder if the MAn lion;s city high floor version still has that design feature. heee</p>
              <p>anyhow mr scanialuver, u shd call urself MAnluver also. cuz u know much bout MAn bus</p>

              <p>i confused leow. i see got 18.240HOCl-NL, the end NL means zero step all the way for this HOCl chassis? or foes the code HOCl mean the bus has the steps to rear..</p>

              <p>I think last time got heard before, the NL is low floor bus... Regarding full low floor I dunno liao le...</p>
              <p>In HK those DD MAN are 24.310 HOCL-N/R, in which 'N/R' (or NR?!) should denote double deck...</p>
              <p>Of course with 'HOCL' constant, we do know that its a rear engined chassis.</p>
              <p>From what i know, the last '2' in 'NL262' would mean the series number. That would be equal to the system seen in Scania, wherein 'K93UB', 'K94UB' and so on...</p>
              <p>Eg: HK's Citybus MAN NL262, fleet number 1562, registered 2000/4/5, converted to airport bus in 2006 include adding in luggage racks and rearrangement of seats. Looking at the rear, there are quite some really high seats, so for this its a low entry bus I suppose, hard to be a full low floor due to the height difference! But it does not carry a XX.XXX desgination. Chassis is NL262R, engine D2866LUH22, gearbox Voith DIWA 851.3</p>

              i find that the new buses nowadays have lost their distinctive character. Different bus models yet engine sounds similar to each other. Different models (eg the new scania and MAN demonstrator) but with similar bodywork design.
              
              I still prefer the days when different models got different engine sound and different bodywork design.

              to compete with the zero step all the way offerings of merc O405NH
              chassis type.</p>
              <p>--high floor MANs crazy angled front step----</p>
              <p>incidentally i have seen blueprint figures of a MAN SL202 in
              some european bus operations textbook. the 45 degree angled step
              fron entry at front door is the step i refer to. i like that step
              cause its a unique feature on some MAN high floor  citybuses.
              the KL MAns have that step too which i thought is cool.<br> <br> of coz most people will find that step stupid as it is angled and u
              have to turn your body into that angle in order to proceed on into
              the bus middle sections or rear. if i recall correctly the angled
              step is part of a 2 step entry for he KL MAns. So u imagine u ahve
              to tap ur card loew then see the funny angle step, twist ur body go
              up the step then u se...another step..but this time its aligned
              with the vreath of the bus body and up u go on this one.</p>
              <p>in the book , the Sl202 is a one angled-step entry bus.</p>
              <p> i do wonder if the MAn lion;s city high floor version
              still has that design feature. heee</p>
              <p>anyhow mr scanialuver, u shd call urself MAnluver also. cuz u
              know much bout MAn bus</p>

              <p>If the code is 18.240 HOCL, it is a high floor bus, but there are many types of high floor bus codes . Got HOCL-SL (high-floor city bus) and HOCL-S<strong>Ü</strong>( high floor intercity bus). IMO, theres no such things as chassis modified to make it low floor. Maybe you refering to design modifications? Normally its called deprivations. For example, you take a design of the chassis of a 18.240 HOCL, you can actually make calculations and modify the chassis thru CAD (Computer Aided Drafting). Very seldom people would take the actual chassis and cut it into pieces than join it again to form a low floor one. That would be rediculous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Its better to modify the bus on the sketch board before making the final product.</p>
              <p>Hmm i not a pro of MAN buses to tell you. Haha. I like to study bus chassis and engines, hence i got some info about them. Haha.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>i find that the new buses nowadays have lost their distinctive
              character. Different bus models yet engine sounds similar to each
              other. Different models (eg the new scania and <span>MAN</span> demonstrator) but with similar bodywork design.</p>
              <p>I still prefer the days when different models got different
              engine sound and different bodywork design.</p>

              <p>just ignore side profile. concentrate on front of the man bus....</p>
              <p>engine wise the MAN will have a distinct sound that most of us wun have heard before.</p>
