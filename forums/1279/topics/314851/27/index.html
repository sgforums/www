              <p>Went for a ride on 8031J today. First impressions of the bus by looking at the interior, very KUB like but the floor and colour of handrailsgives it a much more comfortable feel. Took a back seat and strangely air con not blowing. Den i realised have to turn the small knob. Air con is good, but not as powerful as the ones on KUB. Acceleration in my opinion is better than KUB (maybe BC step harder), no jerking when braking too. The gap behind the back seat gets quite warm as the ride continued. Bus only hit 4th gear once if i can remember well enough. All in all quite a good ride.</p>
              <p>I don't know if it's me but when it accelarates in 1st and 2nd gear, it sounds like Vo3x accelaration. Also I heard a faint whistle once or twice when the bus was slowing down.</p>

Took a back seat and strangely air con not blowing. Den i realised have to turn the small knob. Air con is good, but not as powerful as the ones on KUB. Acceleration in my opinion is better than KUB (maybe BC step harder), no jerking when braking too. The gap behind the back seat gets quite warm as the ride continued. Bus only hit 4th gear once if i can remember well enough. All in all quite a good ride.</p>
              <p>I don't know if it's me but when it accelarates in 1st and 2nd gear, it sounds like Vo3x accelaration. Also I heard a faint whistle once or twice when the bus was slowing down.</p>

              <p>I think the front numbers refer to the mximum gross weight and the numbers after the decimal refers to the maximum power of the engine. Eg. 16.240 will be have a maximum gross weight of 16 tonnes and the power of the engine is 240 hp</p>
