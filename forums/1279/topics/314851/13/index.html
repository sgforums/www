              <p>BNDEP only has SBS2888T. The 2 SBS bendys are being sold, no longer in Singapore. (Don't forget that SBS999U originates from ARBP serving servicve 195)</p>
              <p>SLBP in fact got the most number of unique buses which I believe. It has SBS8030L, SBS8033D, as well as all the CNGs and the MK4 Soon Chows.</p>

              <p>Yes. So its safe to say that all the depots have had their share of demos. Its not a matter of biased or anything, IMO. It just so happens that currently Soon Lee has the most because they are quite recent additions whereas the other demos/unique buses have been withdrawn.</p>

              <p>The MAN 18.240 will perform nowhere near as well as the Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE - the specifications say it all.  I can tell you that MAN 18.280s in Australia perform nowhere near as well off the mark as even the lower 185kW Euro 3 diesel variant of the OC 500 LE.</p>
              <p>The OC 500 LE's engine has almost double the displacement of the 18.240's (6.87L vs. 11.97L) and has significantly more power and torque (177kW/925Nm vs. 220kW/1250Nm) - both available at lower engine speeds.  The Voith transmission on the 18.240, while smoother than the ZF in the OC 500, does not match well with the MAN's small engine as its ratios are more spread out, probably causing the engine to labour at low engine speeds.</p>

              <p>Edit: Now you've confirmed what I thought held true, that voith tends to prove a better choice for buses that are better-endowed with power and torque since voith tends to spread the gears more evenly, while ZF tends to be more biased on the initial picking-up. Looking at the voith and ZF B9TLs and the voith and ZF MKIVs gave me this conclusion. There's great disparity in picking-up speed in the latter while there's hardly any difference in the former. But I have to admit that ZF does hold an advantage in slopes (while picking-up), as well as giving the engine less stress compared to voith.</p>

              <p>In fact the ZF 6-speed automatic transmission provides a good combination of brisk acceleration with industry-leading cruising economy and speed.  No other automatic transmission for a bus offers twin-overdrive ratios with a 0.59:1 top ratio.  It's the large number of intermediate ratios that help the ZF transmission perform well with a wide range of engine variants under most conditions.</p>

              Actually it's more like it'll damage the transmission if the bus is not stationary when D is engaged after N.
