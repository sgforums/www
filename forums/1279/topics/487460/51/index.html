              <p>I think i still see 9533X on 89/89e recently..same for the DM3500s. So the only possibilities are 1) a fleet add, or 2) one of the Tridents is out..</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Regarding 8010, which time slots was it spotted on svc 854 btw? cos so far my observations of afternoon slots I have seen at least 20-25 svc 854 buses pass thru to and fro. Have also spotted 2 days ago, two O405G Volgren bendy buses deployed back to back on 854 from Wldep but have yet to spot 8010 cover the route to date. </span></p>
              <p>While svc 851 has been quite irregular over the last week, notice their bus arrival timings also tend to jump, often missing the estimated time by 5-8 minutes.</p>

              <p>Isn't it more accurate to double-check after you observe again for the upcoming 2 weeks after the June Sch Hols end? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br>SMRT has their own version of the School Holiday schedule uh.

              <p>Because the same time that those bus fans have more time to spot during school hols = the same time the permers start to run around with the Sch Hol schedule. </p>
