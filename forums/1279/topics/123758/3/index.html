Basically technically, from bus-chassi point of view, this is no doubt ranks among the better buses ever to exist in Singapore !<br><br>As for 'worse' i can think of many like the Volvo B10M, B7F, Leyland Atlantean etc. The N113CRB certainly can't be inferior to any of these.

            <div class='col-md body'>If i were to look in the same way as you do, i might agree with you totally !<br>BUT that's not the case.<br><br>When i say a particular bus is good etc., i'm mainly looking @ the technical qualities &amp; specifications of the bus-chassis. I don't really care much about the bus body used (unless it's an integrally constructed bus with original body which is clearly NOT the case here) or the state of maintenance given to the bus in overall.<br>I do not get 'distracted' by these issues, since the present overall (less than desirable ?) state of the bus is due MORE to shortcomings in these areas rather than due to any design or quality shortcomings in the bus-chassis itself !<br><br>To solve your negative impressions of this model here, the people doing maintenance work on them have to wake up &amp; be motivated enough to give the necessary care to ensure that original standards &amp; conditions are maintained as much as practically viable &amp; i DO believe much more should be done in this respect !!<br><br>The Scania N113CRB, because of it's full engine encapsulation, i find it perfectly logical to deploy in densely populated residential areas instead of in town areas since the city is a noisy area anyway but for residential environment, LESS noise is always welcome !! The N113CRB i do believe has THE lowest external engine noise levels for a public service 12m long bus in Singapore today. So these are better deployed outside of town instead !<br><br>As i observe, the Volvo B10M is a 'make-do' citybus NOT a purpose built one like the N113CRB or M-B O 405 etc. Examination of the specifications &amp; design intents of the models would show that quite clearly. Mk.2 you refer to B10M ?? that model &amp; version is hardly a comfortable PSV, by my standards of evaluation ! More suited to be used like a truck to carry goods instead !! Not surprising to note therefore (if it's true) that the B10M is no longer in production &amp; that there's no intention to market any mid-engined bus anymore for city-bus use !<br><br>Air-con coldness ? The earlier Fuji units used seem so-so only while the later Fujis, Sutrak, Carrier, Konvecta even Coachair units all i find emit colder &amp; fresher air. But air-con &amp; bus-chassi are seperate subjects in my method of evaluation so i don't allow lousy air-con to impair my impressions of the bus-chassis.<br><br>To conclude, you're of course welcome to judge in your way if you prefer that.<br><br>But i have to say very clearly my impressions are derived from a very different method of assessment, which goes beyond the 'superficial' &amp; obvious (much of which i'm also aware of even before you mentioned it) to focus primarily on product competence per se. So i'm simply looking<br>from a different perspective, with different priorities !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Airbus330Captain:</div><div class="quote_body">Please tell me you are kidding with me !

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... whether the bus can go 80km/h or 35km/h all depends on the BCs itself... If you give a trident to a BC but he got plenty of time to spare, the end result is the same.. you will see tridents travelling at an average speed of no more than 50km/h.. Like what other members had said before.. whether a bus can speed all depends on the BCs....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The O 305 in Singapore likely naturally aspirated version @ 240 BHP.<br>But i do know that M-B also offered turbocharged versions i.e. OM 407 hA<br>@ 280 BHP which i suspect might be in some O 305 G or O 305 GG (double-articulated models in the M-B O-Bahn system in Germany or Australia etc.) &amp; the intended max. speed is 100 km/h.<br>The O 305 in Singapore 10 years ago that did 80 km/h was most likely revved to the limit but the engine remained very smooth running (like BMW 6-cylinder car petrol engine !) although of course loud !! No tachometer then to check engine speed.<br><br>But what i liked about the O 305 was that least whatever you hear from the engine is 'real' engine sound, unlike those Volvo Olympians or so-called Super Olympians where they much of the noise from the 'engine' tends to NOT come from the engine itself (which is itself quite quiet) BUT from the stupid radiator air intake fan they put in front or on 1 side !! The higher the engine is revved the fan motor spins faster making so much more noise than the engine itself some distance behind !! Dennis Tridents here don't seem to have such stupid noisy fans yet they still somehow still get cooled &amp; i've not seen any cases of overheating etc. ! Same as for O 305, of course.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">It is not turbocharged, but had an ultra-high acceleration diff.
