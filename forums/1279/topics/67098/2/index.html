            <div class='col-md body'>Same for services 182, 192 and 193. All 3 of them serve the Jurong/Tuas Industrial Estate, but they are trunk services instead of Jurong Industrial Services (ie. 246, 249, 25x)<br></div>

As far as Service 68 and 964 are concerned, I really think they should be feeder services rather than trunk. So, a service which route plies within a town might not be classified as a feeder. The main point to differentiate a trunk and a feeder is the fare; trunk fare-stage or feeder fare. Exception of JIS and Express Services.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

Exception of JIS and Express Services.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div></blockquote>In my opinion, services 261 and 285 are feeder to serve the housing estate neighbourhoods only, but since there are industrial areas nearby, to bring convenience to the workers there, the 2 services are "extended" to serve the industrial areas, this explains for a feeder service in a industrial area.<br><br>In services 68 and 964 case, there are already feeder or intra-town services plying along their route (ie. services 293 and 913 respectively), and the purpose of the 2 services is to serve the industrial areas and not the housing estate neighbourhoods, unlike services 261 and 285. The services, however, have to ply thru the neighbourhoods as there are no alternative routes, and the current route is the most direct route.<br></div>
