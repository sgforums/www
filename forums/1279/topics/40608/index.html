Yes, very modern, perhaps the nicest terminal around, but there are only 1 or  2 passengers alighting from Service 13, and the freq is very long.<br><br>I think the first sep SBST should do is do relocate one of the bus stops near there, either Bedok CAmp or Opp Kew Green, to right in front of the terminal, so that passengers transferring from Service 10 or 13 can change at the terminal to increase passenger traffic</div>

Firstly, many of the services are already quite long, or have high passenger traffic. Next, Upp East Coast is mainly Private estate, except for Temasek Sec, and only have 2 lanes. Hence, demand there is actually quite low, and services like 10 and 13 should be able to serve that sector adequately. Also, too many buses running on empty there would greatly increase noise and air pollution along that area and the residents would not like it. It is also a waste of resources.</div>

Tuas may seem deserted most of the times, but it serves as a resting place for the drivers and aging Leylands, and the factories near there do provide a lot of passenger traffic at certain times( at least when I took once, the DD was jammed to the door) It doesn't make sense to extend 182 to cover so much ground in Tuas</div>

It makes most sense to build an interchange at siglap RD. but VS would most certainly complain. If the buses go onto est coast park via Marine Parade Flyover, there is a bird sanctuary there and is too congested.<br><br>I think that building an interchange may be out of question, but I'm thinking of this: Ask LTA to be more hi- tech. Maybe they can consider something likeMarina Center Ter, and set aside half of the current road width for a place for buses to park, and a sound dividing wall to ensure VS won't complain, but there are reasons for why this may be rejected in the first place and deciding to torture those hapless drivers.</div>
