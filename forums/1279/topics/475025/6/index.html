              some buses have to go up to four storeys high and down again,

              <p>Exactly! KJDEP is really essential and needs to stay. It could even give some of its buses to WEDEP and take other buses from the overcrowded WLDEP/WLBP. These ex-WLDEP buses could even drive from KJDEP to Woodlands Int to do trunk services like 925, just like how buses used KJDEP (926 will not be affected, unless it goes under WLDEP), before WLDEP took over these duties... </p>

              <p>Well, you know, the Marina South area is still awaiting demolition of the ECP before it can be developed. There is still land available here.

              <p>1. Some of the vacant land is for joint-venture with Malaysia.</p>
              <p>2. I dont think people in general enjoy driving up and down ramps for several stories as you seem to suggest. Maybe you do. I dislike it.</p>
              <p>3. Geological constraints involved in digging Marina South area. The details are beyond me. But the cost and danger of digging underground there is not small.</p>

              <p>maybe u can go be the designer or engineer.... if i am the developer, pls tell me how am i going to build a 60 storey building on a underground bus park which stretch across few buildings?  so u r suggesting that the govt build  the underground bus park first.. so the developers willcome in later. and just anyhow build the building and not taking into the foundation etc??</p>
              <p>btw,  looking at the cost of that Marina Coastel Expressway, so it is anybody guess how much the underground bus park will cost in Marina area...</p>
              <p>also, actually the Floating Platform also wasted..... should use to park buses.. lol..</p>
              <p>Padang also wasted.. should convert it to bus park as well.... lol</p>
