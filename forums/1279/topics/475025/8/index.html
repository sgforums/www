              <p>Interesting question! They might have to upgarde WLDEP to do maintanance works on the outside of the depot (surrounding area)... WLDEP seriously quite cui, since it got so many buses, all the deployments all messed up... <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Ever wondered how's Wenya Ave looks like?</p>
              <p>ok... I went for a jog this evening. this is what i can describe here (though i got take photos)</p>
              <p>1)When u go straight, u will see a left T-junction (---|), which is also wenya ave. that short road is only 60 metres &amp; it makes the P-loop (P)</p>
              <p>2) the next junction is a T- junction. turn left is Wenya St. Wenya St is about 150 metres before making a inverted P-loop (q). on the left side of the loop is a building (no name). At this end of the loop, it's facing diagonally the junction of jurong west st 22/25 &amp; ave 3. [when facing that junction, that loop is at a north-east direction]. Take 185 twrds buona vista &amp; u can see the loop</p>
              <p>3)turn right from wenya ave is a gravel/soiled road, where tipper trucks go in &amp; out to a deep forested area that is now being cleared. hmm, wenya depot? haha. that land is still under clearing though</p>
              <p>but i never see any proposed plan (usually a board in white background, typical board to state a project)</p>

              <p>Wenya... is actually a messed up place. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It was supposed to be a HDB area but somehow, the government changed its mind and decided to halt HDB developments there and re-zone it to be an Industrial area, without considering the HDB developments already at Wenya. As a result, there are now many complications that has to be settled to combine the HDB developments with the new industrial developments.</span></p>
              <p><a title='The "new"(at 2012) plan for Wenya' href="http://ttsgroup.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Wenya-TIA-Report-May-2012.pdf">The "new"(at 2012) plan for Wenya</a> was to construct 2 new Minor Arterial (Category 3) roads - Wenya Avenue and Wenya Drive - and 2 new 21.4m-wide roads.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The new roads already there were constructed last year under "Proposed construction of roads, drains and sewers at wenya (phase 1)" - consisting of the 2 new 21.4m-wide roads and a section(until the inner 21.4m-wide road) of Wenya Avenue.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Road plan for Wenya shown in the <a title="2013 URA Master Plan" href="http://www.ura.gov.sg/MS/DMP2013/regional-highlights/~/media/dmp2013/additional-plans/W-Region-final.ashx">2013 URA Master Plan</a> is a different one. It seems that the Road plan for Wenya has not yet been finalised; there will be more changes to the Road plan for Wenya and construction of the new road network would probably continue only when everything is settled and things are finalised.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For instance, in the 2012 plan, the new Wenya Drive was to be constructed next to the existing compound of Westwood Secondary School. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, Westwood Secondary School needs to expand its compound to accomodate an Indoor Sports Hall and additional blocks.</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Similar to Jurong West Primary School, the existing compound of Westwood Secondary School does not have sufficient space to construct new buildings. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is a need to expand the compound; a portion of the land adjacent to Westwood Secondary School is required. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This affects the road plan of Wenya.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>According to the 2013 Mater Plans, there seems to be some demand to include Civic &amp; Community Institutions and Places of Worship in Wenya, which explains why the road network is a different one. The expansion of Westwood Secondary School's compound is going to change the road plan again.</p>
              <p>This may explain why the construction of the bus depot has not yet started, as the new Wenya Drive might be part of <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Phase 2 </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">construction of roads, drains and sewers at Wenya and there has to at least be an extension of Wenya Road to the future junction before the constuction of the bus depot could begin.</span></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, since azharjj mentioned that , as of yesterday, there were "tipper trucks going in &amp; out to a deep forested area that is now being cleared", I suppose Phase 2 (or part of it) has already begun and construction of the new Wenya Bus Depot should start soon - at around June this year - when Phase 2 (or the part of it needed to facilitate construction of the bus depot) is completed.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, at Jurong East, construction of the new <a title="Big Box building" href="http://ttinternational.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20130226_075327_T09_5E2001CD2580CFF748257B1D00352DD2.2.pdf">Big Box building</a> started in March last year and right now, the "shape" is already there. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Based on this, I guess the new Wenya Bus Depot would require around 1.5 years to construct, since it should be "smaller" than Big Box and would require less time to construct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If start at around June this year, Wenya Bus Depot should be ready by the end of 2015. #justsaying</span></p>

                  existing compound of Westwood Secondary
                  School. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However,
                  Westwood Secondary School needs to expand its compound to
                  accomodate an Indoor Sports Hall and additional blocks.</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Similar to Jurong West
                  Primary School, the existing compound of Westwood Secondary School
                  does not have sufficient space to construct new
                  buildings. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is a
                  need to expand the compound; a portion of the land adjacent to
                  Westwood Secondary School is required. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This affects the road plan of
                  Wenya.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>According to the 2013 Mater Plans, there seems to be some demand
                  to include Civic &amp; Community Institutions and Places of Worship
                  in Wenya, which explains why the road network is a different one.
                  The expansion of Westwood Secondary School's compound is going to
                  change the road plan again.</p>
              <p>This may explain why the construction of the bus depot has not
                  yet started, as the new Wenya Drive might be part
                  of <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Phase
                  2 </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">construction of
                  roads, drains and sewers at Wenya and there has to at least be an
                  extension of Wenya Road to the future junction before the
                  constuction of the bus depot could begin.</span></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, since azharjj mentioned that , as of yesterday,
                  there were "tipper trucks going in &amp; out to a deep forested
                  area that is now being cleared", I suppose Phase 2 (or part of it)
                  has already begun and construction of the new Wenya Bus Depot
                  should start soon - at around June this year - when Phase 2 (or the
                  part of it needed to facilitate construction of the bus depot) is
                  completed.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, at Jurong East, construction of the new <a title="Big Box building" href="http://ttinternational.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20130226_075327_T09_5E2001CD2580CFF748257B1D00352DD2.2.pdf" rel="nofollow"> Big Box building</a> started in March last year and right now, the
                  "shape" is already there. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Based on this, I guess the new Wenya Bus
                  Depot would require around 1.5 years to construct, since it should
                  be "smaller" than Big Box and would require less time to
                  construct.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If start at around June this
                  year, Wenya Bus Depot should be ready by the end of 2015.

              <p>*off-topic*</p>
              <p>I was a Westwoodian from 2009-2012. I took my O levels in 2012 and graduated from Westwood Secondary School in 2013.</p>
              <p>WWSS's upgrading was a very controversial matter last year - because the<span style="color: #0000ff;"> principal wanted to use the contractor MOE engaged</span> for the new Indoor Sports Hall <span style="color: #0000ff;">to build an additional block: a large amount of money is required</span>(probably because it has to buy land, since unlike ISH, it is not by MOE) <span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">and</span></span><span style="color: #ffffff;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">donation drives</span><span style="color: #ffffff;"> (pledge cards issued to students in Term 1, Walkathon ["paid version" of X-country] in Term 2 and a musical performance at Republic Polytechnic in November) </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">were conducted</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">, which </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">many viewed</span><span style="color: #ffffff;"> them (the donation drives) as </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">the school (as) "sucking money" off students and teachers</span></span><span style="color: #ffffff;">. (</span><em style="color: #ffffff;">personally, I wonder if the principal had actually thought about asking for money from Dr Amy Khor [who knows WWSS very well. very good relationship with WWSS.] and the members [who probably make large amounts of money every month] in the SAC, before asking for money from my juniors and teachers</em><span style="color: #ffffff;">)</span></span></p>
              <p>Anyway, whether or not got additional block, or just Indoor Sports Hall, <span style="color: #0000ff;">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">more feasible way to build is to expand Westwood Secondary School's compound and use a bit of the land adjacent to it</span>. <span style="color: #ffffff;">The other way (less feasible) is to temporarily close the back gate, demolish the tennis court, the basket ball court, the sheltered walkway and the fire engine access, and build the Indoor Sports Hall in that vacated space (with new shetered access, tennis court and basketball court under/within the ISH) - similar to what is happening now at West Grove Primary School - but that means there would only be 1 gate (the front gate) for Westwoodians and teachers to enter the school compound during the construction period, which I do not think MOE would allow. Otherwise, there is no way Westwood Secondary School could have new buildings. So, </span>I think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the only way for Westwood Secondary School to have new building is to expand its compound northwards</span>.</p>
              <p>Okay. I am sorry for being seriously off-topic, although this is related to Wenya, where the new bus depot would be located. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>

              into trouble with the authorities.)</span></em></p>

              <p><br>Can't they find other letters than W and B for their depots. Bulim Depot will be BLDEP. Then you have BNDEP and BBDEP.</p>
