              <p>In my opinion, I feel that there is going to be a very big change in the bus networks in the west by mid-2015, and the upcoming Wenya bus depot is part of it, along with the upcoming Joo Koon Bus Interchange that is currently under construction. </p>
              <p>I predict that there will be a totally new bus network at Tuas and Joo Koon (Pioneer) area when the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens. When this happens, it will also affect the Jurong West Extension area as currently, there are bus routes originating from Boon Lay Bus Interchange and going through the Gek Poh(ave 4) and Pioneer SMC areas, before going into the Joo Koon area. Besides, LTA may take this opportunity to begin their move to shift the public bus system into "contracts" mode, by making the totally new bus network at <span style="line-height: 1.231;">("indigenous </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">of") </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Joo Koon Bus Interchange a/into "package"/"packages" and opening it/them for "competitive bidding", since Joo Koon Bus Interchange is a totally new bus interchange and the new bus network </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">("indigenous </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">of") the Joo Koon Bus Interchange </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">is totally new.</span></p>
              <p>Since SBS Transit's Soon Lee Bus Depot is nearby, I believe SBS Transit will "win the tender to" operate the new bus network at <span style="line-height: 1.231;">("indigenous </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">of")</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> Joo Koon Bus Interchange. </span></p>
              <p>I predict that with the new SMRT bus depot coming up at Wenya, along with the BSEP which until now is still not introduced in Jurong and may be introduced in 2014 and 2015, as well as the influence from the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange, and also the addition of Pioneer MRT Station in 2009 which nothing much has been done,  the bus network at Boon Lay Bus Interchange may be re-designed, re-drawn and re-created, and also be up for "competitive bidding". In this case, I believe that SMRT will "win the tender to" operate the new bus network at ("indigenous of") Boon Lay Bus Interchange. </p>
              <p>When the news came out in April that LTA is constructing a bus depot in Wenya for SMRT, I sense that this is a hint that SMRT will takeover the bus network <span style="line-height: 1.231;">("indigenous </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">of") </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Boon Lay Bus Interchange. I'm sure I am not the only one who has this feeling but somehow, I did not see that being mentioned in this forum. So, I decided to write it and thus, I wrote this post.</span></p>

              <p>I don't believe and i also don't want SMRT to take over boon lay.</p>
              <p>SBST is doing well here and the residents in the whole of Jurong are comfortable with that.</p>
              <p>Why change hand and create unncessary for themselves and us, the residents?</p>
              <p>You might have also read too much into a single bus depot in an area that was earmarked to be an industrial estate long time ago.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the location of Wenya bus depot is strategic because of SMRT operation in Bt Bukit, CCK, Bt Panjang (the north west region).</p>

              <p>You might have also read too much into a single bus depot in an
              area that was earmarked to be an industrial estate long time
              ago.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the location of Wenya bus depot is strategic
              because of SMRT operation in Bt Bukit, CCK, Bt Panjang (the north
              west region).</p>
              <p>Along with the upcoming Tengah housing estate.</p>

              <p>I think the fleet of 179 buses deployed is enough to take the load. It's just the scheduling that needs improvement by SLBP. Otherwise, no point handing other Boon Lay Services (like 30 and 154) to Wenya Depot, under SMRT. For example, if 30 goes under SMRT and uses WEDEP, it cannot use buses from BNDEP, since it under SBS Transit. SMRT BCs from AMDEP have to drive to Bedok Int/Boon Lay Int, which is a quite long distance away... If Boon Lay go under SMRT, then it also have to burden the BCs to do all the 31 services serving Boon Lay... Even if SMRT takes majority of Boon Lay services, surely SBS Transit can still keep some services and use SLBP?</p>

              <p>Wow, that's quite a compliment! Thanks! Anyway, NUS Services under SBS Transit (BBDEP/HGDEP) are doing quite well. 95 and 96 can really get quite filled up due to helping to connect to MRT Stations well (like <strong>Kent Ridge, Buona Vista</strong> for 95, <strong>Clementi</strong> for 96, and <strong>King Albert Park (future), Botanic Gardens and Hougang </strong>for 151). So SBS Transit can leave 95, 96 and 151 alone, no need to go under SMRT like what user <strong>SMB388S </strong>said...</p>
