            <div class='col-md body'>Haha... I love buses before I learn how to write or how to talk! (Dunno why) When I was 3 or 4 years ago I always like to draw rectangles with people inside and wheels underneath. During kindergarten, my future ambition is to become a bus driver!!! LOL...<br><br>I was born and grew up in Hong Kong, and I must say HK is a paradise for bus-lovers. The designs, varieties, and qualities of double decker buses in HK are among the best in the world. (I'm very lucky to have an uncle working in Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB), the HK's equivalent to Singapore's SBS. My uncle keeps the KMB monthly magazines and all the KMB posters/calendars/souvenirs for me. Thanks to him, I still keep in touch with the bus news in HK even though I'm in Singapore now.) Later I moved to Singapore, but my passion for buses never stops. Whenever I'm free, I'll take buses all around Singapore. Now, I'm forced to take buses everyday, as I live in Bedok and I have to go to NUS everyday. (Btw, my course of study has nothing to do with buses anymore. Haha.) I always check the SBS and SMRT websites for news, and occasionally I will admire my collection of bus models in my living room... (Part of my proud collection includes a KMB bus commemorating the return of HK to China in 1997, an articulated bus from Germany, and a set of 2 SBS buses commemorating the change of livery... The SBS one is the most expensive, but thankfully it was bought by my mum for my birthday...)<br><br>Sorry for talking so much. I'm so crazy about buses and (you guess what?) I just discovered this forum TODAY!!!! This explains my excitement and my tendency to keep typing and typing and typing and typing... Haha...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great! I was once from HK too, but moved here at a very young age. I too have a NWFB Dennis Trident ALX500 bodied model, commemerating year 2000. One more is the MCW three door (erm, model number when I get home, now at school) double deck bus.<br>Everytime I go to HK, I would visit the bus model shop (86M) at Shatin Town Centre. Dunno whether times have changed, if it had shifted.<br>Now I am into aviation and aircraft models, more or less, buses are still my favourite!</div>
