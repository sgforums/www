            <div class='col-md body'>I started to like bus i think when i was in p4 or 5. That time still got the MB0305 era (the only significant model i remember) plying Bukit Batok (was living there).  Ah yes, i forgot to add, i cant really remember the year, maybe someone can help me? lol.<br><br>And i liked the bus when i see the design....of the wheel rims. That time i little, then i imagined that each wheel rim design has its own "facial expression". Like the Volvo MKII or IV that wheel rim style, i think of it as serious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Then the MB0405's wheel rim style is carefree.... Then the Hino and Nissans wheel rims have that big "father" style, very experienced, very matured. Something like that.<br><br>Then later i started to like the body. Then finally the whole bus. Then ultimately what im here today! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Since then I have started noticing svc 189, and till now! SMRT took over, some stunts with DAFs, Hinos, and Citaro bodied 0405G, the TIB988H, which attempted many stunts inside BB Interchange, parking at the inside area, at the last bus bay. To think how to turn in is already a wonder.<br>Soon 988H went to CCK, and peaceful with 0405 again, until one morning this year, TIB1031L came with news, Habits on 189!<br>I really wondered how they turn this time, the bay is at the middle, so...<br>So they changed the bus bay now.<br>Now TIB1162S and TIB1224Y are perm on 189, what's next?<br>Compiled fleet list of 189, plus buses which tried for a period, not counting 'cameos', or temp buses as I call them.<br>TIB425R<br>TIB426M<br>TIB475X<br>TIB516L (perm now)<br>TIB517J (perm now)<br>TIB519D (perm now)<br>TIB520Z (perm now, ex 989)<br>TIB544E (perm now)<br>TIB592R (perm now)<br>TIB597C (perm now, lengendary fastest bus according to BCs in BB Interchange)<br>TIB605M (perm now)<br>TIB633G (perm now)<br>TIB634D<br>TIB966X (ex-perm, now should be with svc 77)<br>TIB988H<br>TIB1162S (perm now)<br>TIB1224Y (perm now)<br><br>Some memorable temp buses<br>Some DAFs which drove very very fast, multiple regos.<br>TIB905Y, got smell...<br>TIB947B, drove 60km/h past Ginza Plaza, then 'kenna' bump, boom!<br>TIB1031L, of course, my first bendy ride of 189 since 6 years, and first Habit on svc 189 for same period of time, according to BC.<br><br>Just some of my observation of svc 189 since started taking in 1997, 9 years past.</div></blockquote>What the..popcorns.... longer then me    (-_-)'''</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I started taking buses when i was still baby. My mother told me before that she everytime carry me take CSS 8 to Upp Cross St. I can still remember i started playing toy bus at about 2 - 3 years old(Only had 1 bus back then and it is in a terrible condition now)(Terrible condition = wheel drop off, DD became SD but it can still be fixed for the wheel part). When i was 4 years old, i remember taking the Volvo B57(Or was it something else?) on then 385 and that was when i started collecting tix. Later, i no longer took CSS 8 and took 2 and 51 to Chinatown rather frequently and the journey is about 1 hour or more hence sometimes my family decides to take taxi. When 168 was introduced, it was the 1st time i went to Woodlands. Finally, on 21 January 2005, Chinatown Direct came into the picture. Hence i have 2 direct choices to Chinatown (51 and CT1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and on seeing that CT18 duplicates exactly with the route that taxi takes, i decided to try CT18 on the 2nd day of service and it took only 17 mins on my 1st ride (just a few minutes slower than taxi YET much faster than 51 or 2). At that time as there was a "free ride home" promo, hence the original $1 a trip became $1 for 2 trips, only 10cent more for me as compared to 51 but for my parents, $1.80 for 2 trips is CHEAPER than 51 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> as 2 trips on 51 would cost $2.20 or around that. However, that promo ended soon. Right after CNY, another promo (Lucky Hongbao) came and it was cutting some coupon from Sin Min or Lianhe Wanbao and give the driver(paid trip) in order to receive a Red Packet that has a coupon or something like that. The next promotion after the CNY promotion was the Mid Autumn Festival Promo (1 cent tix). That promo i missed out almost totally except i got 1 X 1 cent tix. At the same time, there was another promotion with Chinese Garden (Service 154). I took many many trips on 154 but don't have the coupon until i encountered one Mercs and got 4 of them. This year, Lucky Hongbao Promo was back again and this time round only need to fill in a form and give the driver(paid trip). This time round i got 10 blue dogs(Exchanged away), Organics Shampoo, some polished diva thing (gave other ppl) but sadly dint get red dog <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> . The next promotion was Chinatown Dumpling Promotion. This time round i also took a lot of CT18 but then i dint see any promos on any CT18 perms but luckily spotted some at Kreta Ayer Square (After 3PM near a box)(Before 3PM dun haf) but this time round i only wanted to collect tix <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Now Mid autumn is nearing but no promotion yet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anyway, some of the regos of buses that did/perm on 385 before:</span><br>SBS 796 M (Cameo)<br>SBS 1711 B (Perm)<br>SBS 1734 K (Perm)<br>SBS 1754 C (Perm)<br>SBS 1764 Z (Perm)<br>SBS 1768 M (Perm)<br>SBS 1795 J (Perm)<br>SBS 1799 Z (Perm)<br>SBS 1810 Z (Perm)<br>SBS 1811 X (Perm)<br>SBS 1812 T (Perm)<br>SBS 1823 L (Perm)<br>SBS 1828 Z (Perm)<br>SBS 1890 S (Perm)<br>SBS 1989 S (Cameo)<br>SBS 3790 J (Perm) (NAC Mercs))<br>SBS 3793 B (Perm) (NAC Mercs)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering whether bus spotting or having the passion of buses is inborn? Looks like it is since many of us like buses since we are young. But for me, it is rather mysterious because both of my parents rarely take buses and if you ask my parents to travel from a place to another place by buses only, they wouldn't know. They just said, take bus 25, 74, 76, 132, 165 to AMK and take MRT lor.</div>
