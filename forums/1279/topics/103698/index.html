As some of you might have mentioned in other threads, 115 is more likely to recover the lost link between ave 3 and hg food centre when 151 and 51 were amended when hg south interchange closed down. Something to add about the current Kovan City, I think there might be 1 or 2 new services being introduced there.

For me, I would rather take 87/151/51 and walk, or 62. Not only it is faster, it is also cheaper (no student fares or concessions please). So it doesn't really matter if 113 is a trunk, feeder or townlink service. Same with 112, nobody will take it from the interchange to hg north. I will rather take other services like 72, 74, 325, 147, 101 etc. Anyway, 112 and 113 are like feeders to me <strong>if I were to take them from Kovan City</strong>. I still pay feeder fares and still enjoy most parts of the former feeders routes. This being said, I would not take them from the interchange if I were to go to parts of hg beyond Kovan City or vice versa.<br><br>These are only my humble opinions. You might disgree with me.</div>
