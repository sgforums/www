            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by bendy2003:<br><strong>As for 112 and 113 being townlinks, I fully agree. But if I were to see it from another point of view, it doesn't really matter whether both of them are townlinks, especially 113. Who will take 113 from the area in hg central to ave 1? For me, I would rather take 87/151/51 and walk, or 62. Not only it is faster, it is also cheaper (no student fares or concessions please). So it doesn't really matter if 113 is a trunk, feeder or townlink service. Same with 112, nobody will take it from the interchange to hg north. I will rather take other services like 72, 74, 325, 147, 101 etc. Anyway, 112 and 113 are like feeders to me [b]if I were to take them from Kovan City</strong>. I still pay feeder fares and still enjoy most parts of the former feeders routes. This being said, I would not take them from the interchange if I were to go to parts of hg beyond Kovan City or vice versa.<br><br>These are only my humble opinions. You might disgree with me.[/b]</blockquote>Can you remember the year WDL Ckpt Int was decommissioned? Tibs did not merge any feeder route into trunk like SBST did recently. They gave 911, 912 &amp; 913 <strong>intra-town</strong> status instead. 112 &amp; 113 are trunk routes but they are fulfilling an intra-town function instead. It is cheaper to travel from one end of Woodlands to the other than Hougang.<br><br>The reason why I think the closure of HGS Int was a mistake is due to what some of you guys pointed out that HGN Int has parking woes. A side note, 115 can be enhanced. It should recover the connections lost when 323 was pulled.</div>

My main point is that they love to eat into the pockets of the minority, but what can we do? With minority, I'm referring to those who will take from one end to the other end of the town using these intra-town services. The majority, I think will not do so. There are too many alternatives already.</div>
