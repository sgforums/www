            <div class='col-md body'>I do not agree with what the teenager did.  If he had to pay up, he had to pay up, no qualms about that.<br><br>While one should applaud the bus driver in doing his duty in ensuring that that the minority fare-evaders duly pay the rightful fares as this would certainly be unfair to the majority who have been honest in doing so, one should not blindly support the bus drivers without realising that the way the bus driver handled the situation is left much to be desired.  Two wrongs do not make one right.  The situation could have been handled more tactfully by the bus driver so as to minimise the inconvenience caused to the passengers.<br><br>This makes me wonder about 2 issues.<br><br>Has management laid out specific guidelines and steps to take in such situations so as not to inconvenience or has adopted a laissez-faire approach to what the bus drivers can take?  I have heard stories of a bus driver holding on to someone's IC (which is totally illegal).  Perhaps the management should lay out specific guidelines and what action is to be taken in a given timeframe.  This process may end up seeming robotic but I believe necessary to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.<br><br>The second issue...are Singaporeans really a 'Me' society and lack of empathy?</div>
