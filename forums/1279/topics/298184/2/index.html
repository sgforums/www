If you don't, shut your bloody mouth up and listen to the facts.<br><br>You are probably the stupid teenager who was involved in this saga. Reason why? You have the audacity to insult bus drivers who are doing their jobs. Let me reiterate this whole sentence for you, who has no EQ and IQ. <strong><span style="color: red;">It's the passengers' fault for delaying the 20 minutes. NOBODY bothered to pay up on the teenager's behalf and yet they can complain about 20 minutes when they are standing there doing nothing. So whose fault is that?</span></strong><br><br>The bus driver has every right to hold up a passenger who does not pay enough and if the passenger does not want to pay up (like this case of the stupid teenager), he will call for assistance and someone from the OCC will come to take the passenger away. It is definitely the passengers responsibility to ensure that they bring enough money for the trip and not the EQ/IQ of the bus driver to check on the fare being paid. I will stress this again: If this bus driver doesn't draw the boundary now, what will happen to the future bus journeys? Every passenger brings coins that are insufficient for the trip?<br><br>If you are not the bloody teenager in this scene, you were probably the male hooligan in the white shirt (as shown in the movie posted on YouTube). That male hooligan has got the guts to shout at the bus driver to move but has no guts to even fork out 20 cents to help the teenager pay. And I'm sure the other passengers were guilty of this as well. If they had the EQ/IQ, they would definitely help the teenager pay so that the bus driver has nothing more to say and definitely has to move.<br><br>So think before you say. This whole saga definitely illustrated something: Bus drivers had more EQ and IQ than the trouble-causing teenager as well as the other passengers on board. And they definitely had more EQ and IQ than you, who has nothing else to do other than insult bus drivers for not having enough intelligence. Sounds like you are the one instead.<br><br>Oh, and, before you continue saying they have broken english (which yet they can perform better then you), please correct your own english if not others (definitely not me as I don't want to pursue this matter anymore now that I've set the margins clear) will flame you upside down north south east west.</div>

But doesn't necessary mean all who take public transport are not well to do. Some may just feel that owning cars forms as a liability to their finance.

In contrast, how many times have you and I seen bus drivers with swollen cheeks, bleeding mouths, and cut fingers?<br><br>I also have no qualms about you getting beaten up or totally owned, because you apparently have no civics &amp; moral education, plus your IQ is just a mere 1.
