              <p>I agree to the idea of removing 1 PIW area and add in 3 more seats there. Furthermore not many wheelchair-bound passengers tend to take bus. And another thing is that most of the WAB buses are deployed on the non-WAB routes where drivers don't even let wheelchair passengers board though there are the WAB features. So what's the point?</p>
              <p>Perhaps luggage racks should also be introduced on those Scania K230UBs which are deployed on the bus services that goes to Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Btw is it possible for SBST to add in a granny seat to all the Batch 1 K230UBs??</p>

              <p>Just a question. I have noticed the new Euro V seating arrangement and the 3 new seats which were one of the two KUB Wheelchair bay in the Euro IV. Why didn't SBST make it like SMRT Buses? Whereby the seats were forward facing and in two rows. It can become 4 seats without compromising much on the standing area.</p>

              <p><br>I agree to the idea of removing 1 PIW area and add in 3 more seats there. Furthermore not many wheelchair-bound passengers tend to take bus. And another thing is that most of the WAB buses are deployed on the non-WAB routes where drivers don't even let wheelchair passengers board though there are the WAB features. So what's the point?</p>

              <p><br>Having 1 PIW space still makes sense. HK's buses also have 1 PIW slot too, but we can't argue with SBST's intention about 2 PIW friends travelling together. Pros and cons now.</p>
              <p>Better not to install luggage rack. In the past they had the luggage racks on the MRT but it took up standing space and also people do get jumpy when worrying if their luggage get stolen from the rack.</p>
              <p>It's technically possible to add the granny seats  (probably two granny seats side by side like the current Euro V. But then they need to add replace the plastic module covering the wheel etc.</p>

              <p>Then they will need to plan and decide how many buses to take in. If not the depot will be packed.</p>
              <p>Or they can take in many and give out a few.</p>
              <p>Actually to SLBP it doesn't really matter much since they have much lesser units of WA merc compared to BR/AM.</p>
