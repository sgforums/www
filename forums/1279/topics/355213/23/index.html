              <p><br> Did i even ask for your wall of text?No need to give me.Keep it to
              yourself.U think i will be so scared ah once u give me 'your so
              scary wall of text'?No effect at all lah it only made things even
              more worst.<br> <br> And since when did i even brought up things from the past about u?U
              are always accusing and finding trouble with me unneccessarily.I
              didnt even talk anything about u then u busybody itchy backside
              nothing to do ah?Come here flame me for no apparent reason
              again.<br> Why do u always like to flame me when i didnt even utter a single
              word about u?What is wrong with u?I seriously am getting fed up
              with u.U made things way too off topic by posting all this which u
              claim to be 'things from the past' when i didnt even talk a single
              thing about u.<br> <br> What do u want now?U always only seem intent on flamming me as like
              i said,even when i didnt say a single thing about u.Didnt u find
              other people to flame rather then always me?<br> <br> I have already stopped having communicatons with u after that past
              arguement and was wanting to avoid u all the way.Because i didnt
              want to find anymore trouble with u and i just wanted to stop all
              the nonsense there.But there u come again when i have stopped my
              nonsense and u are provoking me again ridiculously.What do u really
              want actually????????????<br> <br> I guess that even if i post further,nothing is going to be able to
              make u understand and it is very clear that u have not forgotten
              the past and that u just want to take your revenge on me.As for
              me,i have forgotten everything about that past and am wishing not
              to talk to u ever again.I dont want to waste my time against u.Its
              up to u whether u really want to stop the nonsense here once and
              for all or not.I have nothing against u.But u dont seem to be
              thinking that way.If u wish to stop all your nonsense and flamming
              here,i would be more than happy.<br> <br> I even asked if u wanted peace or not in the feedback and
              administrations topic over the arguement.But u didnt even reply to
              me at all which clearly states that u didnt have any intention of
              making peace and that u didnt want to stop that nonsense there.True
              enough,u have came here and uneccessarily finded trouble with me
              for no apparent reason again.I just wish to stop all this nonsense
              here but i definitely think that u wish to continue this further if
              not u wouldnt have came here and flammed me.<br> <br> So far,i have talked to u REALLY NICELY based on the advice the
              other bus fans here gave me because i know that if i reply to u
              harshly,u would blow your top off unneccessarily again.Even by
              replying so nicely to u like this,i wonder if u would appreciate
              this and stop all the nonsense here once and for all instead of
              flamming me further again.I really dont wish to continue this
              further and just want to stop this here.I really mean it.It's all
              up to u now.</p>

              <p><br>I told you right. Even if someone flames you, there's no need to flame back. What's the point of destroying a thread by spewing fire all over the place? Anger and your attitude. In fact you even called someone a "dog" over msn, Where is the respect? You just say facts nicely, maybe you are really at wrong, just say sorry, i didnt know the info isn't confirmed and was by someone. Can you even post nicely?</p>

              <p><br>I told you right. Even if someone flames you, there's no need to flame back. What's the point of destroying a thread by spewing fire all over the place? Anger and your attitude. In fact you even called someone a "dog" over msn, Where is the respect? You just say facts nicely, maybe you are really at wrong, just say sorry, i didnt know the info isn't confirmed and was by someone. Can you even post nicely?</p>
              <p>I don't know what else to say. i tried to help you understand. i give up. honestly.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't call someone a dog unless that person has really gone over my limit and in truth,in this forum that person had really went over my limit many many times.<br><br>And there is no point advising me only.Of course i understand your advice.But u must try to advice the rest also who flammed me non-stop.If not there is really no point if u just advised one person and leave it there.U must advise the rest also.Then only everyone would understand everything and the forum would be a more pleasant place to use.</p>

              <p>let's stop this.</p>
              <p>can all the bus fans, just for once, stop having any flame wars.</p>
              <p>i dont see this happening in the train forums. why must it happen in the bus forum?</p>
              <p>please lah merczrox, i told you already, not to add more wall of text, but you still carry on. think again, if you have not posted the wall, it would stop already. everything would stop.</p>
              <p>but why must start again? am sick and tired of looking through tons of pages of flame wars. think la. are you guys really self centered?</p>
              <p>stop this irritating waste of bandwidth flamewar. there's a malay saying, if you fight, later in the end you will get married together. jengjengjeng.. hahahaha</p>
              <p>so yeah, continue with the topic la.</p>
              <p>merczrox, one more time, just stop all this nonsense. i told you to stop posting right.. but why arent you heeding my advice? wanna be the next tintinspartan is it? if not, then just dont care.</p>
