              post which says that 'MK3s start to get deregistered in Nov lah'
              why dont u use that eyes of yours to see the first part of that
              same post in which i said 'SOMEONE'?I am merely stating what that
              person said because that MIGHT be true but not 100% true.I am just
              posting exactly what that person said and u all are stubborn that i
              am wrong.Actually u all could also flame that impatient person who
              is whining about HGDEP not getting Euro 5s.Why not flame him
              instead?Always only the innocent people get hacked for no reason
              whereas the people who always asks stupid and nonsensical questions
              like this dont't get flammed.Why not u all go to the previous pages
              and find the guy who said this instead of hacking me one by
              one?Already one person is being stupid by flamming me and u all
              join in.So u all have proven that u have no eyes but merely only
              know how to follow what others do.No point talking to numbskulls

              like this.Ridiculous.U all simply got nth to do ah?U all seem so
              free to flame people around for no apparent reason.When a person
              gets flammed,the rest just joins in as if it is a free-for-all
              without even finding out what happened first or the person who is
              getting flammed is really in the wrong or not.Next time please find
              out what happened first instead of just flamming and flamming and
              flamming.I dont want to continue this again but the way u all act
              seems like this will go on forever.Small arguement between me and

              what?Allways its people like u who blows small matters like this

              <p><br>Do you need to even type all this? And to begin with, there is no official deregs confirmed for november for MK IIIs at the moment.Not even the extensions Maybe you could have said it as the MK IIIs likely departing in Nov this year or something. Because there's no need to blow your top over when the buses are going off because i dont see the need to.</p>

              <p>do i sound like i don't know that you're referring to that someone? do you believe that the mk3s will really deregister in november this year? unless that person who said this has information that is released by SBST that mk3s will really be deregistering in november, otherwise the information is not credible.</p>

              else said.And since u quoted my post,see that post u of mine u
              quoted.Since u are very smart to highlight and bold the part in my

              why dont u use that eyes of yours to see the first part of that
              same post in which i said 'SOMEONE'?I am merely stating what that
              person said because that MIGHT be true but not 100% true.I am just
              posting exactly what that person said and u all are stubborn that i
              am wrong.Actually u all could also flame that impatient person who
              is whining about HGDEP not getting Euro 5s.Why not flame him
              instead?Always only the innocent people get hacked for no reason
              whereas the people who always asks stupid and nonsensical questions
              like this dont't get flammed.Why not u all go to the previous pages

              gets flammed,the rest just joins in as if it is a free-for-all
              without even finding out what happened first or the person who is
              getting flammed is really in the wrong or not.Next time please find
              out what happened first instead of just flamming and flamming and
              flamming.I dont want to continue this again but the way u all act

              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't see how the comments on the MkIII retirement age is childish and boorish. I have been observing the going-ons on this thread for quite some time
              and I am disturbed with what you wrote. That PATRONISING attitude of
              yours... Granted I am new to SG-f and a bus enthusiast, but the way you
              DEMEAN OTHERS by saying just simply quoting posts for the sake of quoting is out of place. Why are the comments about retirement age of buses so childish and boorish? Why does the comments

              <p>Granted the comments here were less than satisfactory, but there is no
              need for such a blatant disregard of other forum members own opinions.
              Are you such a control freak that wants others to think the way you do?! The comments make me believe that you are trying to give the impression "get out of my elite uncaring face". Are you proud to say that you flame others like that? Your comments irk
              me and I do believe it irks others as well. Such highly snobbish

              <p>SBS8033D's windows seems to be similar to SMB1H, both prototype windows are blue-green tinted while the production models for both seems to be dark tinted. Is it usually the prototype buses get different tint of windows then the darker tints of the production version?</p>

              <p>fight fight!</p>
              <p>i love bus forums.</p>
              <p>simply because of its content in a topic.</p>
              <p>small things also wanna make it big. no lifers.</p>
              <p>wanna settle, settle one on one la, do it privately.</p>
              <p>must show whole world that you fighting is it.</p>
              <p>furthermore, show whole world, from one on one, become ten on ten.</p>
              <p>damn good la all this bus fans. instead of resolving, always like to make it big.</p>
              <p>i dont know what the hell is going on, but seeing flame wars ah, giving the impressions that bus fans are soooooooooooooooo self centered. only think about yrself, your stand and such. dont want listen to people's opinion.</p>
              <p>only know how to shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot... everytime come this forum, always got misunderstanding. and its always the same old few people(you know who you are, i dont want to name).</p>
              <p>c'mon la people, cannot give and take meh. merczrox is stating whatever he saw, he didnt make any judgements what. informations can be wrong, we can learn from each other, through a better, friendlier way. not by posting thousands of pages of flame wars in each thread. waste bandwidth space only.</p>
              <p>c'mon, continue the fight if you are jerks. we only need just ONE person to give in, and everything will be settled.</p>
              <p>damn, wanna shoot me now? shoot lor. think you so pro, so what?</p>

              <p>SBS8033D's windows seems to be similar to SMB1H, both prototype windows are blue-green tinted while the production models for both seems to be dark tinted. Is it usually the prototype buses get different tint of windows then the darker tints of the production version?</p>

              <p>Hey guys, let's just get back to disccusion. The question in my post i quoted is technically relevant, it's better to discuss on that.</p>
              <p>To Merczrox - The MK IIIs <strong>have no confirmed schedule of layup/dereg/redeployments</strong> as of yet despite your source saying it's going off in Nov 09. Despite you saying that someone told you, you should at least put it's probably rumor or unconfirmed. Because at this point of time, you and your source say the MK IIIs are leaving in Nov 09 and you didnt show us any official sources from SBST/LTA/ whoever is in charge of the lay ups. We will also treat it as a rumor. Stop arguing back and shaming yourself with unkind words and attitude.</p>

              <p>I don't see how the comments on the MkIII retirement age is childish and boorish. I have been observing the going-ons on this thread for quite some time and I am disturbed with what you wrote. That PATRONISING attitude of yours... Granted I am new to SG-f and a bus enthusiast, but the way you DEMEAN OTHERS by saying just simply quoting posts for the sake of quoting is out of place. Why are the comments about retirement age of buses so childish and boorish? Why does the comments not matter to this thread? Is such a LOGICAL DEBATE SO STUPID???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Are you trying to say you are superior to others? You are insulting other people's intelligence when you say,</p>

              <p>SO YOU ARE DAMN INTELLIGENT LAH! IS IT?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Granted the comments here were less than satisfactory, but there is no need for such a blatant disregard of other forum members own opinions. Are you such a control freak that wants others to think the way you do?! The comments make me believe that you are trying to give the impression "get out of my elite uncaring face". Are you proud to say that you flame others like that? Your comments irk me and I do believe it irks others as well. Such highly snobbish attitude is unbecoming of a bus enthusiast.</p>
