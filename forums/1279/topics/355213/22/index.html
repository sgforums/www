              <p>SBS8033D's windows seems to be similar to SMB1H, both prototype windows are blue-green tinted while the production models for both seems to be dark tinted. Is it usually the prototype buses get different tint of windows then the darker tints of the production version?</p>

              <p>Wait.Why are all of u jumping over whether the MK3s would be
                  deregistered in Nov or not.U all already know that i maybe wrong
                  and that i was just saying it for an example and that i may
                  not be correct about whether the MK3s would be deregistered in Nov
                  or not.Then why are u all still stubborn in believing that i
                  guaranteed and confirmed and really meant what i said in my post
                  when obviously i was not?I was just telling a simple thing and u
                  all grabbed that slightest oppurtunity to flame me at one go
                  without thinking.I know that i maybe wrong in saying that but is
                  this the way u all treat or handle people in such a harsh way by
                  teaming up together and gang-banging the person non-stop without
                  even sympathising him?Can't u all rephrase that whole thing u all
                  say in a much nicer way?Wouldnt that be more pleasant?<br> <br> And the MK3s are just a bus only for goodness sake.Why
                  are we fighting and arguing with each other just for a stupid
                  bus?Isn't this ridiculous?So what if it is gonna be scrapped in Nov
                  or going to be extended?Am i going to hang myself it is extended?Or
                  am i going to sit down in a corner and cry to death if a bus is
                  scrapped?Are we going to lose or gain anything when a bus is
                  scrapped or extended?SBST want to scrap the bus scrap lah.We
                  arguing for what?Are we losing anything?No right?Are we gaining
                  anything?Also no right?Scrap then scrap lah extend then extend
                  lah.So what if it is scrapped and it ends up in the scrapyard being
                  bashed to a tin can?Is SBST going to bring the bus back just for us
                  if we sit here and debate like this?U all jump over the moon as if
                  u all will be dead or what if the MK3s are really gone in nov.So
                  what if it is gone?Am i going to sit down like a old man and going
                  to cry about it for the rest of my life?Gone then gone lah.U think
                  i give a damn about it?It's just a stupid pathetic bus for goodness
                  sake not like as if it is gold or something so precious or
                  whatsoever.So i think we should stop acting like this over a
                  pathetic bus.We are really not going to gain or lose anything by
                  continuing like this.Bear this in mind.</p>

              <p>I don't see how the comments on the MkIII retirement age is childish and boorish. I have been observing the going-ons on this thread for quite some time and I am disturbed with what you wrote. That PATRONISING attitude of yours... Granted I am new to SG-f and a bus enthusiast, but the way you DEMEAN OTHERS by saying just simply quoting posts for the sake of quoting is out of place. Why are the comments about retirement age of buses so childish and boorish? Why does the comments not matter to this thread? Is such a LOGICAL DEBATE SO STUPID???</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>SO YOU ARE DAMN INTELLIGENT LAH! IS IT?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Granted the comments here were less than satisfactory, but there is no need for such a blatant disregard of other forum members own opinions. Are you such a control freak that wants others to think the way you do?! The comments make me believe that you are trying to give the impression "get out of my elite uncaring face". Are you proud to say that you flame others like that? Your comments irk me and I do believe it irks others as well. Such highly snobbish attitude is unbecoming of a bus enthusiast.</p>

              <p><br>Did i even ask for your wall of text?No need to give me.Keep it to yourself.U think i will be so scared ah once u give me 'your so scary wall of text'?No effect at all lah it only made things even more worst.<br><br>And since when did i even brought up things from the past about u?U are always accusing and finding trouble with me unneccessarily.I didnt even talk anything about u then u busybody itchy backside nothing to do ah?Come here flame me for no apparent reason again.<br>Why do u always like to flame me when i didnt even utter a single word about u?What is wrong with u?I seriously am getting fed up with u.U made things way too off topic by posting all this which u claim to be 'things from the past' when i didnt even talk a single thing about u.<br><br>What do u want now?U always only seem intent on flamming me as like i said,even when i didnt say a single thing about u.Didnt u find other people to flame rather then always me?<br><br>I have already stopped having communicatons with u after that past arguement and was wanting to avoid u all the way.Because i didnt want to find anymore trouble with u and i just wanted to stop all the nonsense there.But there u come again when i have stopped my nonsense and u are provoking me again ridiculously.What do u really want actually????????????<br><br>I guess that even if i post further,nothing is going to be able to make u understand and it is very clear that u have not forgotten the past and that u just want to take your revenge on me.As for me,i have forgotten everything about that past and am wishing not to talk to u ever again.I dont want to waste my time against u.Its up to u whether u really want to stop the nonsense here once and for all or not.I have nothing against u.But u dont seem to be thinking that way.If u wish to stop all your nonsense and flamming here,i would be more than happy.<br><br>I even asked if u wanted peace or not in the feedback and administrations topic over the arguement.But u didnt even reply to me at all which clearly states that u didnt have any intention of making peace and that u didnt want to stop that nonsense there.True enough,u have came here and uneccessarily finded trouble with me for no apparent reason again.I just wish to stop all this nonsense here but i definitely think that u wish to continue this further if not u wouldnt have came here and flammed me.<br><br>So far,i have talked to u REALLY NICELY based on the advice the other bus fans here gave me because i know that if i reply to u harshly,u would blow your top off unneccessarily again.Even by replying so nicely to u like this,i wonder if u would appreciate this and stop all the nonsense here once and for all instead of flamming me further again.I really dont wish to continue this further and just want to stop this here.I really mean it.It's all up to u now.</p>
