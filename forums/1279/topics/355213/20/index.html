              instead?Always only the innocent people get hacked for no reason
              whereas the people who always asks stupid and nonsensical questions
              like this dont't get flammed.Why not u all go to the previous pages
              and find the guy who said this instead of hacking me one by
              one?Already one person is being stupid by flamming me and u all
              join in.So u all have proven that u have no eyes but merely only
              know how to follow what others do.No point talking to numbskulls
              like u all.<br> <br> Just posted what another guy posted and i get UNNECESSARILY flammed
              like this.Ridiculous.U all simply got nth to do ah?U all seem so
              free to flame people around for no apparent reason.When a person
              gets flammed,the rest just joins in as if it is a free-for-all
              without even finding out what happened first or the person who is
              getting flammed is really in the wrong or not.Next time please find
              out what happened first instead of just flamming and flamming and
              flamming.I dont want to continue this again but the way u all act
              seems like this will go on forever.Small arguement between me and
              service_238 u busybody kay poh kiah come and interfere for
              what?Allways its people like u who blows small matters like this
              into a big problem.Next time if u see a small arguement between 2
              people,just shut your bud up and dont be a kay poh.If not for
              u,this small arguement wouldn't have been blown to this large
              extent.<br> <br> I know by posting all this,the rest of them as always again
              wouldn't find out what is correct and if i am really in the wrong
              and would just flame me.Next time,please find out what is correct
              and if the person who is being flamed is really in the wrong or not
              instead of being a bloody greedy idiot who always flames people.I
              just wish to stop here and don't blow this matter further
              again.</p>
