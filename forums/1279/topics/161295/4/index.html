            <div class='col-md body'>I'm also inclined to think that a centralised bus terminal will be constructed in conjunction with the upcoming People Mover System. With the PMS calling at more stations within a single terminal building, it will be a suitable alternative rather than have buses calling at each terminal building. The centralised bus terminal can also be connected with the LCC terminal (via a shuttle bus of course).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For your info, a New bus Bay had been built before the plane flyover (1st stop after T2). From the look of it, it seems that passengers going towards LCT will have to use that particular bus stop and walk in (estimated about 2-5mins).
