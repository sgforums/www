              <p>According to URA's 2013 Draft Master Plan, the site around Choa Chu Kang MRT station - presently consist of the existing <strong>Choa Chu Kang</strong> Bus Interchange and that empty plot of land opposite it - is a Reserve Site: "the specific use has yet to be determined" and "Interim uses that are compatible with the uses in the locality may be allowed subject to evaluation by the competent authority."

              <p>Similar to the one at Woodlands, I understand the atmosphere inside Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange can be very hot, at night. Hence, for now, a cheap solution is to install fans in the bus interchange.</p>

              <li>2. <strong>Operations</strong> will be <strong>relocated</strong> to the temporary facility.</li>
              <li>3. The <strong>current</strong> Choa Chu Kang <strong>Bus Interchange</strong> will be <strong>demolished</strong> and rebuilt - along with the new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong Region Line</span>.</li>
              <li>4.<strong> Another Sengkang Bus Interchange will be constucted</strong> at the site where the current Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange is - MRT station at basement/ground level, Bus Interchange at ground level, LRT above, integrated with a Shopping centre.</li>
              <li>5. When the <strong>new</strong> Choa Chu Kang <strong>Bus Interchange opens, by 2025</strong>, <strong>operations</strong> will <strong>move back</strong> to its present location.</li>

              Interchange</strong> will be <strong>demolished</strong> and

              <li>4. <strong>Another Sengkang Bus Interchange will be
              constucted</strong> at the site where the current Choa Chu Kang Bus
              Interchange is - MRT station at basement/ground level, Bus
              Interchange at ground level, LRT above, integrated with a Shopping
              centre.</li>
              <li>5. When the <strong>new</strong> Choa Chu Kang <strong>Bus
              Interchange opens, by 2025</strong>, <strong>operations</strong> will <strong>move back</strong> to its present location.</li>

              <p>Sengkang at CCK?<br><br>Wow, that means the original interchange from the 90s will still be the same... Might be the interchange which didn't rebuild for more than 20 years...</p>

                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Here's how I imagine it.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the new CCK alighting berths would be between the the station's exit C and Choa Chu Kang Loop,</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the new CCK boarding berths would be at the North-East side of the MRT station,</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">while the new CCK bus parking bay can stretch all the way to Choa Chu Kang Drive. </span></li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">South of the new bus interchange can be for the </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">commercial part of the development - at the same level.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is 20 metres of land avaible for the commercial part to be directly connected to the MRT station (exit A area).</span></li>
                  <li><span style="color: #888888; line-height: 1.231;">{</span><em style="color: #888888; line-height: 1.231;">there is still 20 metres of land in between the possible new bus interchange and Lot one, which is 2/3 of Lot one's 32 metres of space that is next to the MRT station.</em><span style="color: #888888; line-height: 1.231;">}</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">there can be commercial areas built above and below the bus interchange.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">similar to Jurong Point Extension.</span></li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Alright.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em>Although commuters can walk shorter distances from the new alighting berths to the MRT faregates,</em></span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is true that commuters would have to walk (slightly) longer distances from the MRT faregates to the new boarding berths.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Besides, as I look at the CCK MRT tracks on Google Maps street view, I do not think it is practical (safe) to have buses turning at a spot so near to the MRT pillars. </span></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>so, I think it is better that the empty land be used for temporary bus interchange, while the existing land (total area is <strong>1.58 hectres</strong>)(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not including</span> the HDB block and the HDB carpark) is re-developed.</p>
                  <p>while re-developing, provisions can be made for JRL station, or the JRL station can be built simultaneously with the re-development.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Assuming that the JRL station is underground, this would make the new CCK bus interchange similar to Toa Payoh Bus Interchange and Sengkang Bus Interchange.</li>
                  <li>this could be another Clementi Mall and Clementi Bus Interchange, only with larger bus parking bay to accommodate articulated buses.</li>
