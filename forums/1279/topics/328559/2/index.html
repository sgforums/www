              <p>I terminated my NOW card within a month of activation.</p>
              <p>At first I didn't want to use their ezlink function, but then guys don't separate their cards from their wallets, so putting the card in caused error going thru the mrt gates.</p>
              <p>so I went to activate it. costed 13 bucks for the ezlink function. spent 1 week waiting for the giro link function to activate. everything set liao, suddenly one day while travelling, go in MRT okay, come out say card error.</p>
              <p>Station control say Card faulty. Call UOB ask them now what? they say send me the replacement card. I ask if need to redo the activation, pay the 13 bucks etc.. they say no need. promised me everything will be settled.</p>
              <p>within a week receive a replacement card. it's a brand new card. checking it with transitlink office say it's not giro link nothing.. and ask me to pay 13 bucks for the activation of ez link function again.</p>
              <p>I call back UOB complain, they say check and call back. when they call back say I have to redo the whole process again. I asked what about the fking promise? they just reemphasize need to redo everything again. I straight away tell them I want to terminate it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>few reasons.</p>
              <p>1. I don't want to spend another 13 bucks to settle for a obvious card fault and not to my error.</p>
              <p>2. I don't want to waste my time repeating the activation process and get a chance at getting another card fault.</p>
              <p>3. empty promises by UOB.</p>
              <p>4. I don't want to be forced to charge 200 bucks each month to the stupid card just to get the card fees waived. (first year free. subsequent min $2400 a year if not charge $18 bucks service charge.)</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The Octopus card does not have "many functions" per-se. It is a card with one chip, just like any other contactless card. In fact, the Octopus card and the Ezlink card uses the same Sony FeliCa chip.</p>
              <p>What gives the Octopus card greater usage rates is its abiility to rope in other merchants and various payment points to adopt the card reader, something which can also be done with the EzLink card. If Singapore starts introducing EzLink card readers in all commercial stores, vending machines, IU units etc, the result would be exactly the same.</p>
              <p>It is a no-brainer really, on why Singapore still dosent have a single cashless-card system. We just can't make up our minds and settle on one system, and the high credit-card usage is obviously not going to go away either. Hopefully this will be a step in the right direction to finally marry most of these functions together...</p>
