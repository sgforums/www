              <p>Give way to buses scheme is disingenuous:<br><br><br>1)How should cyclists react: give way or continue?<br>2)What if it is a taxi/ car etc exiting the bus lane: should other motorists give way?<br>3)How would foreigners (rental car drivers)/ Malaysian motorist keep track n abide by of our laws WRT road markings n bus lanes (BL): full day BL, normal BL, dotted line BL, single n double zig-zag n straight lines etc etc.<br>4)Is LTA reinventing the wheel, doesn't the current bus lane system work well; is LTA trying some ingenious way to save $$ by NOT having to paint usual bus lanes on the road???<br>5)Ambulance/ bicycle vs bus: in case of an accident, what are the rules of engagement then. Who should have given way? If LTA uses 'zebra crossing' logic,  (<a href="http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/traffic_management/mandatory_give_way.html">http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/traffic_management/mandatory_give_way.html </a> ) then EVERYONE has to give way to the bus.<br><br>Dunno what the LTA ppl were thinking, maybe just bored so wan to try sth new...<br>Blah:  <a href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=2170">http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=2170</a></p>

              <p>Personal views as follows:</p>
              <p>1) If I am the cyclist, I would give way to the bus. But if I am driving the bus, I would let the cyclist go first.</p>
              <p>2) Should not. They are not the 'intended beneficiaries'. Imagine people 'rushing for time', speed into the bus bay then expect others to give way and speed out...</p>
              <p>3) It is indeed difficult. I will also have problem remembering. Or just keep to the second lane then...</p>
              <p>4) The bus bay scheme is to speed up time leaving the bus bay.</p>
              <p>5) Emergency vehicles will always have the right of way.</p>
              <p>After this mandatory scheme of giving way have been implemented, indeed there are some dangerous situations, like buses which obey the rule and take the right, but cars just don't give way.</p>
              <p>There are many times when I took a bus that leaves bus stops along lower BB East Ave 3 (services 77, 106, 189, Exp 506, 963) stops which has those schemes) and cars approach so quickly that they could not stop in time but the bus is already in the box and going out, they brake hard to a stop. Sometimes the bus cuts out into the lane but you can see from the car and its driver, they are not going to stop, whatever it takes! In the latter situation the bus captain would not care about the smaller fella, while the car is rushing to god-knows-where.</p>

              station people there with video cameras</p>

              <p>Even as a public transport user I find the red line bus lanes in Orchard a pain in the @$$. Especially the Bideford Road area.

              <p>Agree - some bus lane markings have been senselessly drawn by LTA.
              I hate situations whereby turning out from a lane; I bump into the bus lane (esp in heavy traffic conditions!) and you see vehicles trying to avoid bus lane, cutting lanes here and there and worsening the jam and increase chances of accident. 
              Same applies to left turning - from 2nd lane I got to drive all the way to the end part and then quickly cut across to the leftmost lane  to make a left turn. One fine example is the area at Boundary Rd (from AMK towards Paya Lebar direction) - before junction of Yio Chu Kang Rd. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>I agree with you.</p>
              <p>There are too many grey areas to look into. If a bus stops at a busstop with lots of passengers waiting to alight or board the bus, do we have to stop to give way?</p>
              <p>It is also way too dangerous to stop a car midway along the road when there maybe other cars zooming behind at 70km/h.<br><br>watch this: <a href="http://202.157.174.100/20090806-ss-speedingadvert2/player.html">http://202.157.174.100/20090806-ss-speedingadvert2/player.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, some goondus will suddenly change lane to the right to avoid the bus lane and its ruling, leading to more accidents.</p>
