And normally this roads do not have congestion problems<br><br>When the bus(A) is at the bus bay/ bus stop (2), and a oncoming bus(B) needs to load at bus stop (1), the driver will overtake bus(A) and stop infront of it.<br><br>Actually i suggest LTA to try this out at Yishun Ave 2, sometimes the queues of buses for loading could extend till 6 to 7 buses, especially during morning peak where everyone tries their best to squeeze into a 969. The road however is never congested at that time.</div>

It is important to put this issue in perspective.<br><br>Most major cities such as Tokyo, London and Hong Kong, do not have bus bays (also called bus lay-bys) along main roads because they take up considerable space.<br><br>Similarly, in Singapore, only one third of the bus stops have bus bays as providing them requires additional land that is not always available. Bus bays are usually put in when there is enough road reserve.<br><br>With increasing vehicle usage, the trade off between widening roads and retaining bus bays will have to be studied in land-scarce Singapore. The pilot project in Jalan Eunos seeks to do this.<br><br>LTA is widening the road at Jalan Eunos because traffic growth there has led to increased congestion. In doing so, the existing bus bays will have to be removed. This presents LTA with the opportunity to conduct a one-year trial to study the impact of linear bus stops Â— and weigh the improvement in bus travel speed against the impact on other traffic.<br><br>In this case, by adding a lane to each side of the road, all road users will be better off.

It is important to put this issue in perspective.<br><br>Most major cities such as Tokyo, London and Hong Kong, do not have bus bays (also called bus lay-bys) along main roads because they take up considerable space.<br><br>Similarly, in Singapore, only one third of the bus stops have bus bays as providing them requires additional land that is not always available. Bus bays are usually put in when there is enough road reserve.<br><br>With increasing vehicle usage, the trade off between widening roads and retaining bus bays will have to be studied in land-scarce Singapore. The pilot project in Jalan Eunos seeks to do this.<br><br>LTA is widening the road at Jalan Eunos because traffic growth there has led to increased congestion. In doing so, the existing bus bays will have to be removed.

            <div class='col-md body'>with the axeing of bus bays, i believe vehicles will still continue park illegally near bus-stops to wait or pick-up passengers.<br>currently, these vehicles are able to park at the edge of bus bays to minimise convenience to buses. with the axeing of bus bays, these vehicles would simply stop just in front or behind the bus-stops and buses need to squeeze into the 2nd lane and filter back to avoid these parked vehicles hence worsening the congestion!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They should use 24-hr bus zones without any dotted lines. Let cars do left turns from non-bus lanes via a priority traffic signaling scheme.<br><br>I especially love these on the Harbour Bridge in Sydney. It's wonderful to ride a  bus travelling at 80kmh while seeing cars stuck at 0 - 5 kmh. Wonderful!</div>
