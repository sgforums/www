Or, you can do it manually by typing in '''. For example, SBS912U is AMDEP, so type ''', then SBS911Y, and another ''', so SBS913S is not in bold.</div>

Too many people have access into the edition. There is a lot of transfer &amp; rejection nowadays. Even the staff have problem keeping track. Based on these, how accurate can you expect the wikipedia to be?<br><br>On top of that, bus holding list is still considered as classified.
