            <div class='col-md body'>How does Kranji Depot have enough buses to deploy for 985 when 985W is implemented? 985 should be controlled by Ang Mo Kio as well. If not then ask Woodlands to transfer some UD OAC/CAC buses to Kranji and deploy these Nissan Diesels on services like 61 , 67 , 172, 176 ,188 , 189 , 307 , 941 , 945 and 947. I dont understand why must tey use buses like Merc and Hinos on 307 &amp; BB feeders , they are so erratic and has the WORST frequency. Btw when tey deploy these Nissans on the above svcs , there is going to be more than enough buses for 985/985W and 188. Perhaps 985 or 985W and/or 188 sould also try using such buses. PLS DEPLOY THESE NISSANS ON 307 , 941 , 945 , 947 , 188 and 189 , there is no reason for BB feeders and 307 to use Merc and Hinos.

I dont understand why must tey use buses like Merc and Hinos on 307 &amp; BB feeders , they are so erratic and has the WORST frequency. Btw when tey deploy these Nissans on the above svcs , there is going to be more than enough buses for 985/985W and 188. Perhaps 985 or 985W and/or 188 sould also try using such buses. PLS DEPLOY THESE NISSANS ON 307 , 941 , 945 , 947 , 188 and 189 , there is no reason for BB feeders and 307 to use Merc and Hinos. These buses should go &amp; deploy on 188 ,985 and 985W and get all the non Nissans back on 980.<br><br>What do u guys think abt this?</div></blockquote>SMRT has the right to do what it likes. You not happy u can always dont take the buses or Nissans. No one is pointing a knife at you to board their buses.<br><br>I dont understand.. be it Hino or Mercedes or Volvo, they are still buses right? 5 Volvos replaces 5 Nissans doesnt change anything.. Frequency and fares still the same.<br><br>what for whine here and there? and, you dont live in the bus, you only seat in it for a short while</div>

It dont affect me terribly. You just complain for the sake of complaining. 985 and 985W share the same buses. They have alternate trips.<br><br>Where got not enough? There are 985A to support for morning peak and Bendy in the morning peak.<br><br>I went over to the Swiss Cottage stop and there were not that many 985 riders. All depended more on 187,188 and 945. They have a fair share of pax demand there. The frequency there is bearable for you always have alternatives coming at you every 5-8mins or less.<br><br>those 2 stops not that affected and the deployment as well. They are doing fine with their 16 buses and random cameos.<br><br>having 985 and 985W doesnt affect the people at the other end as well.<br><br>I noted the timing written on the schedule and it seems that the frequency is the same as before when 985W wasnt even there.<br><br>you just hate NISSANS. thats the bottomline and you are jealous and claim that BB feeder have low demands. That is all your opinion and not facts anyway.</div>
