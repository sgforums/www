              Enough of the shitaro and your nonsense. 
              
              Some of us here like the Citaro buses and even my foreign friends are asking, what's wrong with you and a few others. If you don't like this bus, just keep it to yourself. 
              
              Personally, I prefer this bus over Scania K230UB and MAN A22. It is a great bus whether you hate it or not. Most of my BC friends love driving them (In good condition of course). 
              
              Everytime I look at the post here and I see 'Shitaro', I feel pissed. 
              
              Respect others if you want to be respected. So stop this 'Shitaro' nonsense once and for all.

              <p>Charles, you definitely are a snowflake. Wasn't that the whole reason why you gave up being the chief moderator of the forum you started from scratch?</p>
              <p>Anyway, i'd take the KUB over all the others. Rapid Penang chose them, and it makes me jealous. Ironic because Singapore is so much more liveable than any Malaysian city.</p>
              <p>A pity 2888 was the only one of its kind. Dysons in Melbourne had an almost-full fleet of that model.</p>
              <p>Wonder if you have been travelling to JB (via 160/170 from Kranji) or you prefer 950 from WDL.</p>
