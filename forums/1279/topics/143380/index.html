            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Shuttle Bus (SSB) was set up in 1975 because of the "Park and Ride" Scheme introduced by the government. SSB operates the City Shuttle Service (CSS) which plied from the fringe carparks to the CBD zones. In 1976, CSS services were extended to the public housing estates. Today, SSB provides regular bus services to and from the housing estates through the CBD and later merged with former TIBS in 1985 which is now SMRT now. From the nine Services started initially left to one surviving today. Are they not making profits or low-ridership for the services for some Sv it does not look so and withdraw it But they are the one to introduce concessionary fares for senior citizens and still the lowest fare for public bus.<br><br><strong>The only service now still standing and surviving on</strong><br>Sv 608 Bukit Merah Int to Bedok Int<br><br><strong>Service withdrawn(as in year of 2001 and beyond)</strong><br>Sv 602 Shenton Way Ter to Holland Dr(loop)<br>Sv 603 St Michael Ter to Upp Cross St(loop)<br>Sv 605 Sing Ming Ter to Bukit Merah Int<br>Sv 607 St Michael Ter to New Bridge Rd(loop)<br><br>Service withdrawn(as in year before 2001)<br>CSS Sv 1 Marine Terrace Ter to Queensway Ter<br>CSS Sv 6 Bt Merah Int to Circuit Rd(loop)<br>CSS Sv 9 Geylang Lor 1 Ter to  Bt Merah Int</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AFAIK, CSS was a joint venture between SSB (now part of SMRT group) and NTUC COmfort. They used Merc O309 minibuses painted in different livery. SSB's buses were painted orange, while NTUC Comfort's ones were blue, as some old photos suggest. The Comfort routes were withdrawn before I became aware of my surroundings. I only remember the time when CSS services were renumbered. By then, Tibs had been in control of SSB for a long time.<br><br>It was a mistake to withdraw 604 as it provided a quick link between Chinatown and Mountbatten/National Stadium area. With new developments like Suntec City coming up in subsequent years, the need for a cheap and direct connection with other parts of the CBD became necessary. Chinatown now has C2 to Suntec City, but it doesn't come cheap, though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to hate taking CSS buses. I remember the old Hino AK with the front entrance and rear exit. I was only 4 or 5 years old at that time. The windows were placed so high up I couldn't see the outside while sitting. I also hate the Comfort MB O309 minibus. I used to take CSS1 with my dad from Orchard Rd to my grandma's house in Marine Parade. They were always crammed full of people. There were only a few seats and the bus was hot and smelly, not to mention bouncy too. But I kinda liked the bouncy part.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Thier aircon smells like the furry seat but the air-con is quite strong and cold. It is shiok to sleep inside the bus. I remembered taking Sv 605 of Nissian NAC modified into AC one.
