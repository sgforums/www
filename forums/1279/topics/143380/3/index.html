Sometimes during non-peak periods which I take it the seats were almost fully occupied! The bus freqeuncy is about 6-8mins which is very fast and every bus that comes will sure have people in the bus and not don't have at all one which is rare. They take Sv 608 to work and home as it is cheaper than SBST and SMRT even though they raised their fares with effect from August. Keep CSS alive!</div>

Now it is the time for them to raise after SBST and SMRT did that. But the increase was just only 1 cent increase for ez-link but 10 cents increase for cash!</div>

I dare say its demand is definitely higher than even some normal trunk services we have currently. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
