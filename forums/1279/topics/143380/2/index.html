But it is very cheap last time. Just 35 cents. If I am going to downtown, I will definitely take 605 because it is cheap, not crowded (even on peak hours) and short route too (Via Whitely road and steaven road).<br><br>I really REALLY miss the old days... and I really wish that CSS won't withdraw 608. Sometimes I goes to Marine Parade, I would take 608 to joyride and remise the good old days.</div>

So sad. I think they still can preserve it as it is cheap fares and many old people sit it which stay in the Bukit Merah that area. Now CSS the bus fleet is now all on Nissian UD only so sad.</div>

But those places not a lot of people take but Sv 607 still got a lot of people take don't know why they withdraw it during special occasion like the 1st and 15th of lunar month  and etc which those aunties and uncle go to the temple in Becoolen Street from Whampoa that area and Chinatown as it is cheap even though as there are Sv 139 and  131 go there from Whampoa but not Chinatown except for 186. So frustrated with them!</div>
