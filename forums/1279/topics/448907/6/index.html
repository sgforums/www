Introduced on 24th Feb 2002.<br><br>34 was withdrawn due to the under-utilization of the service when the Changi Airport MRT Line opened. 506 was shortened to Bedok.<br><br>989 also did the same thing, but just that the service was shortened later on 27th July 2003, when it was merged with 185 to form the current Service 985.

              <p>singapore should has both system MRT and BRT system. LRT system
              is a flop waste too much money. LTA make all bus lane full day even
              in the weekends and public holiday. LTA can use camera to help out
              in enforcement. Also have full day bus lane at road link to bus
              interchanges. if people think bandies bus is too long on the road
              maybe SMRT and SBS just buy 800 normal SD buses and run on the
              road. As long as the timing is on time no complain.

              <p>BRT has caused a whole lot of problems in other countries already. I can't see the government adding a BRT system when it already has a bus problem to deal with. Money must be thought about as well, you know. And numerous people have complained time and again of bus lanes, not even whole day, that they give people problems filtering, etc. And for the "buying 800 normal SD buses" crap, don't you see the fact that the operators are having recruitment problems? Buying more and more buses with no one to drive? What's the point? And without bendies then how is it supp to keep up? <strong>And it's bendies, not bandies. You don't band things do you..?</strong></p>
