              <p>this is nothing to do with peak or non peak hour it about transport managment by the both transport compaies. Timing is important whether it is peak or not. by the way 24,57 and 149 was or is sbs service number. and service 24 and 149 had Private bus operater operated as schame B bus service before. there was no 57 for airport service. LTA remove the all schame B bus serivce after MRT started to operate. this was a big mistake by LTA. As LTA don't like MRT to lost money. </p>

              <p>My opinion is that not all services here in SG need to be punctual and stick exactly on schedule. If the bus arrives only every 15mins, then yes it would be important for it to stay on schedule as missing it would mean to wait for 14mins.</p>
              <p>However if you talk about services that run frequently, lets say 10mins and below, being punctual might not be of so great importance anymore. What matters for such services is to ensure buses stick to its frequency to ensure theres no sudden spike in passenger loads that can cause bunching. If one of the bus is particularly full (due to whatever reasons), then the bus before should to made to slow down slightly and the bus after should be made to speed up slightly to even out the loading on full bus. This can all be already achieved on sbsts avms with the beeping. Because afterall, the average waiting time for a bus would be 5 mins if frequency is maintained.</p>

              <p>singapore should has both system MRT and BRT system. LRT system is a flop waste too much money. LTA make all bus lane full day even in the weekends and public holiday. LTA can use camera to help out in enforcement. Also have full day bus lane at road link to bus interchanges. if people think bandies bus is too long on the road maybe SMRT and SBS just buy 800 normal SD buses and run on the road. As long as the timing is on time no complain.   </p>
