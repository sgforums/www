              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: More initiatives are in the pipeline to shorten travel times on buses.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Transport Minister 
              Lui Tuck Yew said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is looking at 
              expanding the scheme which makes it mandatory for motorists to give way 
              to buses exiting bus bays.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>There could also be more bus lanes and bus hubs to drive up bus speeds.<br><br>Such measures are necessary, given that 800 more buses will go on the roads in the next five years.<br><br>Mr Lui's comments came as he observed operations at a new bus hub on Monday morning.<br><br>The LTA has completed upgrading works for three bus stops selected for expansion as bus hubs, four months ahead of schedule.<br><br>Bus hubs are bus stops which have extended bays to allow more buses to pull in at the same time.<br><br>They can accommodate up to three single- or double-deck buses in the bay for simultaneous boarding and alighting. <br><br>This
               reduces the average time each bus needs to dwell at the bus stops, 
              shortening waiting and boarding times for commuters and improving 
              overall journey times.<br><br>The bus hubs also help to relieve traffic congestion near bus stops.<br><br>Four
               more bus hubs -- at Marine Parade Road, Upper Serangoon Road, Yishun 
              Avenue 2 and Victoria Street -- will be ready by the end of the year.<br><br>The remaining 28 will be completed by the end of next year.<br><br>Minister Lui visited the latest bus hub, at Bedok Reservoir Road along Block 121, on Monday.<br><br>He
               said: "For the first and second buses, obviously there aren't really 
              time savings. The greatest time savings will come with the fourth and 
              fifth buses.<br><br>"Rather than wait another round which may [take] up to a minute, [the extended bays] can actually help to speed up the flow.<br><br>"Having
               said that, this cannot be the only measure to improve bus services. You
               need to do more with regard to [the] mandatory Give Way [to Buses 
              Scheme] where possible, to extend the use of bus lanes -- and LTA is 
              looking into that."<br><br>Currently, there are 202 bus stops where the Give Way to Buses Scheme is in place.<br><br>To
               help commuters better manage their travel time, real-time bus arrival 
              information panels will be installed progressively at the bus hubs, from
               the first quarter of next year.<br><br>Mr Lui said plans to develop an 
              application to provide more comprehensive information to commuters, such
               as whether there are available seats on buses, have entered the next 
              phase. <br><br>He added LTA will be getting volunteers to test out the system soon.<br><br>"We want to make sure it is properly tested and sufficiently robust, rather than put something out in a hurry," Mr Lui said.<br><br>"When
               it is ready to be put out, I think it ought to be at a stage where it 
              is going to be of great use and of value to commuters."<br><br>- CNA/wm/wk/ir</span></span></p>

              I think the LTA and our transport MP are still sleeping. Don't they know the Mandatory Give Way to Buses scheme is ineffective? Base on my observation, about 95% of motorists do not give way! And I believe most bus captains are reluctant to drive out if there's a vehicle approaching from behind as they are afraid they might not stop to give way. Even if a vehicle is prepared to give way, they might be worried the vehicle behind them may bang into them! That's my experience and worry as a motorist myself too.
                      
              But simply stating that the LTA and bus operators will jointly pump in additional 800 buses is a little inflexible and counter-productive. There's no incentive for them to improve productivity. I feel that if the operators are going to buy some higher capacity buses such as double-deckers, then they should be allowed to buy fewer than 800 buses. This would help to improve productivity, save some manpower and even operating costs.

              Ya. And nowadays, the "cat and mouse" game is no longer effective as motorists are getting much smarter than before. If an LTA officer is spotted along the road, how many would dare to intrude Bus Lanes and not give way to buses exiting? 
              
              And now another common phenomenon; more and more motorists stopping and parking boldly at bus-stops, esp near MRT stns and bus-stops in front of coffeeshops and cafes. Buses are forced to stop outside the bus-stop and pax got to alight and walk through. Worse still, how a wheelchair pax going to board and alight?
