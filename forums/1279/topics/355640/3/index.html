              <p>LOL! You mean Sv. 42 toilet and lunch break is at Eunos? That means every time the BC has do drive the Darts to Eunos for breaks? Very inefficient and cost prohibitive... Oh oh~, like that SBST might as well extend 42 to start plying from Eunos Int, with a left turn at Kembangan to resume normal 42 journey, then coming back to Eunos go down Changi Road and do the same like 60/93 liaoz...</p>

              <p><br>For now, I will just shoot you with regard to Sv 115.</p>
              <p>Firstly, what are the other svc available?</p>
              <p>Secondly, the purpose of Sv 115 is to service people living in Ave 3 to Kovan (Station / Market / Heartland Mall). You should go take Sv 115 in the morning and see how many people is taking the service.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, do you expect old people to walk from ave 3 to ave 1 jus to take sv113 for 2 or 3 stops to kovan? With around 10min walk from home to bus stop, they might as well use additional 10min to walk to Kovan rather than wasting time for Sv 113?</p>
              <p>Forthly, find out what are the actual target markets of the particular svc CAREFULLY before you start to say the service can be withdrawn. Service not being withdrawn got its reasons.</p>

              <p>42 quite ok imo. freq quite comparable to certain other trunk
              svcs in singapore with its two-bus kind of thing.</p>
              <p>400 got excuse. nobody take. now they tear down marina there,
              everyone at marina bay station bus stop take 402 to go to the
              pier.</p>
              <p>401 they should just withdraw luhh. got other svcs like 40 or
              16/196/197.</p>
              <p>191 not that high demand. portsdown area even now with 1 bus the
              demand quite low. i realised portsdown not rly that much of an
              industrial sort of thing.</p>
              <p>115 can withdraw imo. theres other svcs like 81 available. the
              only thing is hougang ave 3, maybe wait till distance-based through
              fare is implemented lor. den the pax can go up hg ave 3 to xfer to
              81. nothing wrong also.</p>

              <p>There's this thing in Singapore called the E-Timetable and ETA plates. Regulars of Sv42 rather wait for a bus to bring them home rather than to walk up that steep slope. If you are a girl and will you dare to walk alone at night?</p>
              <p>If you said 401 should be withdrawn, please take a look on a saturday on it's FIRST car at 2pm. The queue is far far longer than 60. Nevertheless for trips after that. It's the only service that brings you in depth of East Coast Park. Do you think everyone knows how to walk in there? If weekdays, no choice.</p>
              <p>You should see demand of service 115 during the "after marketing hours" where all the ah ma finished marketing. Although there's 113, the demand of 115 still healthy at certain times during the day.</p>
              <p>Other service like 68 can't run away from the fate of withdrawal even though they have healthy load with long frequency. They are regulars who will wait for the bus to bring them out rather than walk out to Tampines Ave 1.</p>

              <p>i shall address your points</p>
              <p>i never said 42 should be withdrawn. 42 demand is there. frequency also can make it.</p>
              <p>since u said 115 demand is healthy at certain times of the day, is it possible to convert 115 to a peak service? I know 115 was also on the verge of withdrawal, but why not make it a peak service and get a win-win situation.</p>
              <p>i agree that ETA plates are there for a reason. It's a good thing that SBST decided to put them up in fact. I believe SMRT doesnt have such a system, correct me if im wrong.</p>
