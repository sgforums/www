But its kind of hard work pushing open the door of a box....cos of the very strong magnets behind. Perhaps that's why they have working door openers, as they have to depend on these "mk1" door-stay close devices.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
