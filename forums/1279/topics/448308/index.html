              Come on, SBS494J. I am speaking the truth.
              
              The new management SH Cogent begins its tenant on 1 March 2012.
              
              So, they restart the free shuttle bus on that day. 
              
              I even took the bus.
              
              Giant hypermarket, some food stores outside(wanton noodles) &amp; some learning school IS STILL OPEN.
              
              The reason why the free shuttle bus restart is because of these stalls &amp; shops that are still open.
              
              If you, don't believe me SBS494J, why not you go to Turf City or any of the boarding stop to see it for youself.
              
              They still use the big comfort bus.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Give you benefit of doubt. Please show supporting evidences to prove that they've resumed the shuttle services. I'm sure i'm not the only one interested to know. Getting people to wait at the bus stops aint going to help much</p></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              You will not find any information that they resumed the shuttle services on any website. because the new management SH Cogent still not yet have a website.
                          
              I think the best way is to call Giant Turf City at 6462 2102 to find out from them. Or go Turf City personally to see.
                          
              I even took the last shuttle bus at Clementi MRT Station at 9:45 PM to Turf City Giant today 2 March 2012.
                      
              The driver who is a China man joked with me whether am I going to Toa Payoh for free.
                          
              I told him "No" I am not going to Toa Payoh, I am going to go to Turf City Giant to buy some things.
                          
              He told me to make it fast because the last bus to go back to Clementi is at 10:30 PM &amp; Turf City Giant closes at 11:00 PM.
                          
              I of course manage to take the last bus to go back to Clementi.
                          
              While on the trip back to Clementi, the driver told me that so far no one knows that the shuttle bus have been resume. Only those who works in Turf City knows that the shuttle bus have restart. 
                      
              The new management have no choice but to restart the shuttle bus because Giant hypermarket, some food stores outside(wanton noodles, duck rice, malay food.......), some car dealers &amp; some learning school IS STILL OPEN.
                          
              He even told me that after 2 days of restart of the free  shuttle bus service, he only saw those who work in Turf City took the bus. I am the only shopper that took the bus.

              <p>Thanks boy20.</p>
              <p>When Clementi Mall was under construction for past 7 yrs, I used to do all my grocery at Turf City as I hated to walk 3 bus stops NTUC supermart. </p>
              <p>Now that the Mall is up and running, I no longer do that. Those were the memories.</p>
