              <p>Command lols... :D</p>
              <p>I only know that in Japan, bus drivers thank passengers when they alight; they have a small mike strapped on, and when the bus starts off from stop they will say 'Starting off' in Japanese, 'Stopping' when slowing down.</p>
              <p>On the top of the panel behind the driver's seat there would normally be a sign saying 'Braking' or 'Hard Braking' (depends on slang) and it would light up when the brakes are applied, an interesting equipment besides the speakers installed and the systematic 'thank you' which the drivers say.</p>

              <p><br>BSRG Standby x1. Usually S52 or S410. Didn't really mind him saying "Good Afternoon" or "Thank you, Bye!" but the only think I found it irritating was that when people (those having concessions) paid cash he made sure he scrutinized their cards properly... even people in uniform also...</p>
              <p>Average spending time at Ngee Ann Poly bus stop for normal 52 buses is just at most a couple of minutes, guess what, he took 4 minutes instead. And he just refused to make up for time lost, just slowly drive... got very fed up then. End up he reached JEI late by 5 minutes.</p>
              <p>He's the best BC I've seen in terms of politeness but the worse BC I've seen in terms of time management skills.</p>
