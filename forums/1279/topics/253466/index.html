            <div class='col-md body'>I think the reason why some ppl dun move in, is bcos they are getting off soon. Like if you are going to alight in two more stops, and you are already standing at the exit door, then next stop got many ppl come in, will you move to the very back or stay near the exit??<br><br>I would stay near the exit, cos i will have i hard time squeezing from the back to the exit in the next stop. All i can do is try to "siam" abit for them to let those ppl go behind, but i have to stay there bcos i am going to alight. And dunno if you guys got this experience, when u are at the back, and u need to squeeze through those who are not alighting, they will give you bad looks, like "push wat push, what's the hurry?" look. They are not alighting but i am, and if i dont squeeze through, wait bus driver uncle close door i gonna miss my stop.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yusry:</div><div class="quote_body">I think if they want people to move to the rear, they need to put a door at the rear.</div></blockquote>yes, if they have another door(exit) at the back, what i said above wouldnt be a problem anymore.

Bus still empty then. I sat somewhere between front &amp; rear door. But as the bus passed ACJC and ACS(I), all those students boarded. When I alighted at Dover MRT, I nearly coudn't get out. Luckily I did, but has to squeeze, of course. This shows that: Move to rear, cannot get out. Sit/stand between front and rear door, bus becomes packed, also cannot get out.</div>
