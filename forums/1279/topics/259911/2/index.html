The Police share the view that bus drivers should not be intimidated or have their safety compromised in the course of their work. Neither would acts of hooliganism be condoned.<br><br>While bus drivers are not considered public servants under the law and incidents of assault may be considered voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code, the Police will proceed to seek the necessary powers to lawfully investigate and prosecute the offenders.<br><br>In the 14 and 18 cases reported in 2006 and in 2007 (to date) respectively, police investigations were initiated into all these cases except in instances when the driver did not wish to pursue the matter.<br><br>The public should continue to report such incidents. When alerted, the Police will respond immediately and take firm action against the assailants to ensure that they do not get away scot-free.</div>

Some SBST drivers are very courteous . Got one time took SBS185B . When slowing down , the bus engine stalled , causing a total blackout ( happened at night) . The BC managed to restart the engine soon after . I went forward to talk with the BC what had happened . He kindly explained to me that it was the engine's fuel flow being disrupted . We chatted with each other , since we are stucked in a jam as well . He also showed me his time table sheet and said that he was going to be late due to the jam .<br><br>Then there was this BC on 970 , driving a Scania Strider bus , think it was TIB565U (before the crash) . I told him that the bell at the emergency exit had spoilt . But he replied me in a rather rude or hastened essence . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>But not all SMRT SL are like that . Some SL i know are friendly as well .</div>
