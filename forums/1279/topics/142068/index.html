But I guess we all should try our best to observe the law and not abuse freedom.<br><br>The MK4 SC on Svc 154.  Well, would a simple PM have solved the problem?  I doubt not, as evident from the stubborness of the perpetrator who refuses to admit his or her wrong.  If you call the use of others people property without their knowledge sharing, then your values must be really twisted.<br><br>Well...if you think the peeps in chit chat or whatever are friendlier, by all means, go there.  You don't have to force yourself to come here and all that, yeah.  it's your call.<br><br>If you want to exchange things, I don't think this forums would be the most appropriate place.  Why don't you do it at some place called marketplace or barter trade or illegal trade instead?  Or why don't do it on ebay?<br><br></div></blockquote>ok. ok.. calm down ok? i deleted all the posts.. but still, i realise the ppl in tis forum not really that united. and this forum, unlike chit chat or bar etc (more like everyone's , public forum) this forum is more closed up as it has regulars with few "outsiders".<br>no offence.. peace................</div>
