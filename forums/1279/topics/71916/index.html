I was schooling in Bt Panjang but lived in Woodlands.Eventually, I became interested in buses when I saw a lot of changes as the years go by.I wish SBS Transit was SBS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My late grandma likes travelling around. So according to her, she always brought me around Singapore since I was a baby.<br><br>The earliest memories I have of taking buses would be around the age of 4 or so. That's when my grandma and I got lost in Marine Parade terminal. As usual, my grandma would just take whatever bus that comes by until we reach a familiar place and we'd go back home from there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My passion for buses started when i was in kindergarten. I believe even just before i entered kindergarten, the passion for buses was just at its infancy stage. Obviously, my support was towards Tibs as i've been living in Woodlands all my life. To me, buses are very unique. I cherish every ride as a learning experience. Over the years, a lot of changes, both big and small have taken place in the world of transportation. I remember when the govt announced the transfer of 15 of SBS services to Tibs in 1994. That was one of the best memories i had. They publicised in the newspapers and television. It was a sad thing for SBS though.... Moving on, although i still support Tibs, that dosen't mean i dislike or boycott SBS services. I do follow their activities from time to time. In fact, i was taken aback when they introduced 168. I was like: Huh?! What the hell is an SBS bus doing in a Tibs infested area? I thought they a had rule or something against that... Anyway, i always pray and hope for the best in buses future although i am aware the govt is embarking on making rail the backbone of the transport industry in Singapore....<br><br>Cheerz. Have a nice day.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Khairul</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's an inborn thing for me. I never knew how it developed but I really loved to look at buses since  I was a kid. Even the MatchBox toy vehicles that I have, I would play more of the buses than cars. Then I would pretend to draw bus terminals/interchanges on vanguard paper so that I can play my toy buses with. In the past, people would laugh at me for liking buses and I would really believe that I am an oddball but upon finding this forum, I realise that I have found people who have similar interest as me and that's buses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, my interest started way back when i was very young, about 4 or 5 years old. I actually memorised the engine sound of different types of buses and could identify a bus just by listening to the engine. I found out more about buses as i grew up and started drawing buses on those old fashioned computer papers with the dotted lines? U all noe rite? I drew bendies on them when they were introduced in 1996. Then, i also remember my childhood, taking sv134 from my house in bishan st 22 to the whampoa area to pray to my buddhist god, and boy, were those Atlanteans and 0305s my darlings. I could still remember taking a BaCo bodied atlantean and knocking my head very hard on the front of the top deck, due to the semi-auto gearbox, which jerks the bus. And now, i am more passionate about buses than last time, thus joining this forum. Thats all thanks. Love buses forever!!!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I did more research. Finally, I found this forum- mid last year. I read all the stuff u all wrote and it developed my liking in buses even more.
