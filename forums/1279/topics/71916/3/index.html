            <div class='col-md body'>What inspired me to like buses? hmm... let's hit back to Year 1990. That was the year I started to like buses. The first bus that I started to like was Leyland Atlantean AN68 with Alexander R-Type Bodywork. I really liked the feeling, being rocking on the bus. However, I didn't really like the back seats because of the heat spread around the engine compartment. Hence, I always told myself not to seat at that particular place of the bus. As time went by, I started to draw pictures of buses with advertisement. I would always like to follow the advertisement on the Atlanteans, Leyland Olympian 2 Axle, and the MB O.305. There were times that I drew them in full body livery. However, they did really look ugly, as I dun really know how to draw them well. Until Primary 4, when TIBS got the first O.405G came in, I was pretty thrilled by it, as I wanted to seat at the rear of the bus. I took one of them on Sv 82, when it was under the in-charge of TIBS. Just because of that trip, I drew it up, with a full-body livery.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Till one day in 2003, I was surfing the internet and I found a group of bus enthusiasts, liking the same habit. That was the time I started to mix around with them, and found new ways of knowing different buses, and ways to spot buses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well for me, I like buses since i was very young. The likes of mercedes 0305 , leyland alanteans and leyland victories were around. I disliked the leyland buses except for the LO 2 axles and love the mercedes O305 bus. That bus is real fast and smooth unlike the counterpart. I remembered skipping a lot of buses just to wait for a particular bus type. Those were the days.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm I like to travel on buses not so much of the bus models, but because the buses can drive to so many more places that the trains cannot go to......it helps that I like to "sight-see" too, so when I have the free time (normally at night), I would try to go one round around the island, and then try to catch the very last bus home from wherever I may be. Nice thing is that buses dont stop too much in the night, so I can travel a further distance with the same amount of time. Cooler at night too!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Only thing I dont like too much is the noise from TV Mobile......but wat to do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> So now I really prefer the SMRT buses as opposed to SBST. Quieter and faster too.</div>
