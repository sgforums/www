When svs. 192 and 254 were introduced, the terminal was still there. The old route of sv. 254 pass by it. I remember seeing the terminal when I followed my dad to his workplace sometimes. There was just a shelter with 1 or 2 buses parked by the roadside (like Punggol). When the amendment of sv 175 took effect on 7 July 90 (not 1 July, sorry bout that) sv. 192 was also amended to cover the loss of sv 175 between Upp Jurong Rd and Tuas via:-<br><br>Upp Jurong Rd, Jln Ahmad Ibrahim, Tuas West Rd, Pioneer Rd and Tuas Rd (loop). After checking the latest bus guide, I found that there are no buses which pass by the former site of the terminal today. Perhaps the shelter might still be there.<br><br></div>
