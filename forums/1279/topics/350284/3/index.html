              <p>Is there problems with acquiring spare parts for the B9TL? I mean they are like the oddball in the fleet, only 200 of them, and do not share components with the rest of SBST's Volvo fleet. The steering wheel, dashboard, handbrake, seats(forward, backward, and sideways facing), LCD(or is it LED) display on stairs, are all different. I am sure there are more components too.

              <p>The rattling on the B9TL is also a problem. Why is that so? Is it due to the engine or bodywork? And the funny thing is that it usually is on the upper saloon(mostly on 72's B9TL). I think the buses are still in good shape though(well they are pretty new...).</p>

              <p>When you have taken a B9TL in Hong Kong, whether if its a Enviro 500, Wright or Euro 4 (going 5?) one, you would most probably go 'pants in the seats'. There seem to be still a gap in the ones here and there of course... Their B9TL there do not suck at all, they are even faster than a single deck bus here, go down hill while accelerating, brake from 60 to 0 in three bus lengths, challenge Kennedy Town turns at 40-55 km/h, some of the specialties...</p>

              <p><br>not to mention, hong kong's batch 2/3 olympians with the TD-D10A engine and Voith transmission, accelerate much faster than our singaporean counterparts. 'nuff said for the TD102KF batch 1's with the ZF transmission, they outperform singapore's batch 1's in terms of acceleration too. the engine speed does not decrease when going uphill, the bus does not sound like it's "out of breath" unlike ours. and best still, they don't scream nearly that much.

              <p>Mechanical fault on SBS7378R on 198 today
              (06/03/2009) at 7:24am.</p>

              bus captain flashed hazard lights and tried to close
              the door but couldn't. As a result, he pulled to a corner to let
              the passengers alight to wait for the next bus. There weren't much
              people affected except for some school children. Luckily, I wasn't
              in that bus.</p>
              <p>But wtf man... I posted my comment on 198's B9TL yesterday

              <p>Is there problems with acquiring spare parts for the B9TL? I
              mean they are like the oddball in the fleet, only 200 of them, and
              do not share components with the rest of SBST's Volvo fleet. The
              steering wheel, dashboard, handbrake, seats(forward, backward, and
              sideways facing), LCD(or is it LED) display on stairs, are all
              different. I am sure there are more components too. Added it is the
              only DD by SBST that is wheelchair-capable.</p>

              <p>I'll be surprised if they had a problem with parts. SBST bought the more B9TLs than any other operators, and it's a product still for active sales.</p>
