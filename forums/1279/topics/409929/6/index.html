              <p>how terrible.. look at the empty shuttle buses bll-ing.. wasting resources n spaces..<br>really they need 78 bendies?? so many near empty buses.. and the winding route!!</p>
              <p>today i waited near 15mins for 190 at Pearl Ctr.. the info system says 3mins &gt; Arr &gt; 5mins &gt; Arr &gt; 9mins &gt; and finally appear... <br><br>i think with this exercise, its clear bendies are a space liability with the long.. need to go long winding route, need to park at ulu roads etc..<br><br>and why cant they rope in SBST and their double deckers..?</p>

You all have a control room to monitor your buses position , surely you can tell whether the bus is able to reach the bus stop on time or not  right .

Comeon SBST , pple waited 50mins for your bus only to realise that they can't board it ? Our weather is very hot ok . You all have a control room to monitor your buses position , surely you can tell whether the bus is able to reach the bus stop on time or not  right . Do you need to wait 1 hour to justify sending another bus to alleviate the situations ?</p>

              <p>Well my location is suntec that day and if i were to use mrt , i would have to walk to chinese garden take mrt then drop at je and walk to take the free shuttle service before alighting at clementi then walk to take thr mrt again .</p>
              <p>To answer your suggestion , i actually complained before but their corporate media just answer its because of traffic jams full stop .</p>

              <p>Thank you for your reply but sv502 has indeed encounter snarls along its route.<br>it has departed on time at its Terminal frequently or else...<br>i do not know where you stay but you can take sv97 to Marina/Suntec Area.<br>this bus service is fast and definitely have seating space if you board at JE int.  </p>

              <p>with the distance fare, can easily take sv198 to transfer to Sv97, or take feeder bus to Jurong east to take Sv97, or just take Sv99 to Clementi to take the MRT.. no point waiting for the sv502 which are being stucked in orchard road and at suntec area over the weekend.</p>

              <p>  Ok , thanks for the ideas that you all give . I will consider taking 97 to suntec . I am taking 502 because the bus stop is nearest to my house . To take a feeder bus to je interchange sometimes can end up taking a much longer time just to wait for the feeder bus . I have encountered waiting 30mins just for a feeder bus to je interchange so many time that nowadays i rather walk to outside the interchange if i need to take the bus from there as many time i will arrive faster then the time spent waiting for the feeder bus and to reach there . .</p>
              <p>Jasonhsu92 , its easy for you to say , why don't you try doing that during that weekend and see what you have to say . As compared to waiting for 502 to go to your destination direct ?</p>
              <p>  When we talk abt changing bus usually we forget about the time you have to spent to wait for the bus which can take from immediate arrival to a lengthy 45 mins or even 1 hr when the traffic sucks . Thats why i always try to avoid having to change buses .</p>

              <p>If you are waiting 30mins for feeder to JE int, i would suggest you transfer buses...<br>If you take 198 from when u stay[i do not know exact location], 30mins later, you would have prob be on sv97 smewhere near NUH/NUS[estimated]{excluding waiting time for sv97}</p>
