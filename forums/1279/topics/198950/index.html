            <div class='col-md body'>SBS9131Y (SLBP 179) on service 157 broke down opposite Church of St Mary the Angels on the afternoon of 29 July. BC was drumming his fingers on the steering wheel and all destos were removed. Raining heavily at that time. I am not sure about the deployment of this bus so apologies if info not correct.
