Service 966 NEEDS to clear the Woodlands - Jalan Toa Payoh stretch between 20 - 30 minutes or the bus would be behind schedule.<br><br>I believe the estimation given by TIBS are the maximum when there is heavy vehicular flow.

It's likely the buses are going slightly faster than 60km/h.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While we are on the topic of speed limiters, let me explain <strong>HOW THESE GADGETS WORK AND WHY YOU CAN STILL GOVE ABOVE THE SPEED LIMIT EVEN WHEN THESE GADGETS ARE WORKING IN PERFECT CONDITION</strong>.<br><br>Sorry for the caps, I'm just super irritated by somebody.<br><br>As explained to The_Bus_Guide on our Hougang Central outing, speed limiters simply cut off fuel supply when it reaches a set limit, in this case 60km/h. There is no physical/mechanical limiter that, die die, disallows a vehicle to go above 60km/h.<br><br>When the fuel is cut off, there are still remaining fuel in the engine and the bus can continue accelerating. Eventually, the the bus will slow down to approximately 60km/h and the fuel supply will be returned. And if I'm not wrong, the 60km/h is measured by the RPM of the engine and not by the actual rotation of the driving axle.<br><br>In the case of automatic vehicles, the engine is not "physically" connected to the driving axle, but instead does through a torque converter, which is a chamber of oils linking the engine axle and the wheel axle. This means, the wheel axle (before gear box, connected to torque converter) can still be RPMing higher than the engine, so when engine "slows down to 60km/h", the bus still moves at "70km/h" or so - even higher if the bus is moving downhill.<br><br>This means, fuel can still be supplied to the engine even if the bus is moving higher than 60km/h (as long engine is running at below "60km/h"). This accounts for the reason why buses and other limited vehicles can still go higher than 60km/h even when the speed limiter is set at 60km/h. I would say this would result in a discrepancy of about 5 - 10km/h. So buses could be travelling at a max of 70km/h or so.<br><br>Hope this clears the topic on speed limiters. Please note that this information is from what I have gathered so far and not from a horses' mouth (eg. Siemens or other speed limiter equipment manufacters).<br><br>Others with more technical/engineering knowledge, please feel free to contribute. I'm just a computer science undergrad who happens to be interested in mechanical engineering.</div>
