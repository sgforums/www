(Not sure if it is because terminating SBST 111 at BV will render SBST to violate the PTC ruling of having all HDB residents accesss of services to Orchard Road).  And we have SBST 195 that loop at Commonwealth Drive rather terminate at BV, SBST had heart even for a small estate like Commonwealth Drive.<br><br>If BV and GM can have terminals which are just meters apart, why couldn't we have a terminal at Yew Tee? The extension of 75, 77 or 970 to Yew Tee, may give YT residents at least a trunk service to Orchard Road or CHinatown.<br><br>The size of Yew Tee is probably very much bigger than the size of Dover, GM, Holland and Commonwealth, however their transportation services are terribly bad.<br><br>By lumping YT as a neighbourhood of CCK, it is making YT residents a disservice.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">[b]A trunk service should be provided for every 3,000 Dwelling Units (DUs) if there is no MRT serving the town. If the MRT serves the town, a trunk service should be provided for every 3,500 DUs.</span></span></strong><br><br>Not sure if TIBS had violated such rules for YT residents.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>well......TIBS certainly had violated the rule big time for Nee Soon East residents at 112,500 residents ( ie abt 4K per stop )by having one pathetic feeder on some days!!</div>
