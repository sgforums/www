            <div class='col-md body'>(Topic title inspired by something too adult to post here - underaged people around, you see...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>Well, I was inspired by the bendy 177 thread to create this one: post your sightings of buses with really weird EDSes, be it weirdo destinations, wrong numbers, or downright funkiness.<br><br>For me, apart from the "Volgren Bendy with 22 in Kranji Depot" sighting...<br><br>Â�Â�- I was boarding this route 969 bus at Tampines Interchange a few years ago, and the EDS initially read "969 PULAU TEKONG"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . The Pulau Tekong wording seemed to be overlaid with the correct route details underneath. One passenger informed the driver, who tried (but failed) to correct it. Another passenger told the driver of the error later, and this time, he corrected it (I was at the back of a long queue, which is why I witnessed it all). A fellow passenger in front of me remarked something about displaying Jarkata or something  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>- I once encountered this route 965 bus at Yishun displaying, if I remember correctly, "965 Yio Chu Kang"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  . I was one of the passengers who boarded it, and one of the passengers asked about that. It seemed that the driver quickly corrected it later.<br><br>- This evening I saw a Volgren Bendy on route 913, and the LED had some kind of... "flickering" or "static" effect  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br><br>- SBS Transit buses for a change - this was back when SBS 2779A (the Volvo MK IV with the EDS) was a perm bus on route 80. I spotted that bus while I was waiting for another bus outside City Hall station, but it's EDS was like not displaying any good information. Instead, it was like kind of "dancing" and "flickering". Much of the EDS was lighted, and it could flicker and "dance" every now and then. I immediately knew that was a route 80 bus, as only route 80 at that time used that bus regularly. When the bus came to that stop, I told the driver that the EDS is spoilt, and he acknowledged the problem and says he knew about it.<br><br>- Now for the way back machine - back when the then-TIBS' old DAF buses (which has a different kind of EDS to the one we know and see today - there was "indiviualised" panels) started to run on routes other than 950, 951, and 952, the EDS could look "incomplete" much of the time. I still remember sharing my first trip on this bus here before on route 852, and one of the things I observed was that the EDS displayed mostly nonsense except the panels where the numbers go - that did display "852" properly.<br><br>So do you have any other encounters of weirdo EDSes? SBS Transit and SMRT buses are welcome, and especially post photos - someone posted a now-lost photo of an SMRT bus displaying "222"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .</div>
