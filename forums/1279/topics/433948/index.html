              <p>I feel the GLBP should be used, SEDEP should give WLDEP some control of it, GLBP can be used to park svcs like 67,106,171 and 980. 67 for downroutes, 106 and 171 for starters in MCT, 980 for convienent reasons. 167 I can close 1 eye but overall I feel SMRT are being inflexible with this, the GLBP can use also don't want to use. 859 full day starters and splits and 167 full day starts and splits along with 980 (WLDEP) can park at SEDEP for convience's sake, and the GL ones can do it at GLDEP.</p>

              <p>unless SMRT decides to expand GLBP's size , then i would consider SMRT using that bus park. coz currently i dont think they can hold so many buses in that limited space, furthermore there are SBST svcs like 175 11 that stopover there too . there are busplus buses + SMRT taxis + bus stop + carpark too .</p>
              <p>(its either that or they should rearrange GLBP . its currently messy there.)</p>

              <p>Ok. Even if GLBP is small, I believe it is not that small to the extent of not having some buses getting parked overnight?</p>
              <p>67 (downroute blocks) 106 (Shenton way starts) and 980 (full day start/split) Should fit in just nice, or did I mis-calculate? </p>
              <p>If I indeed miscalculate 67 has lots of downroute duty blocks, then 106 Shenton way starts and 980 full day and splits getting park there should fit in though.</p>

              <p>Why suggest closing ayer rajah bus depot? It's a bus depot anyway, what's more important is the accessibility to expressways and nearby bus terminals/ interchanges.Ayer Rajah bus depot is in close proximity to many terminals and interchanges in that region. What different would it make if it was relocated to Commonwealth or Bukit Merah?</p>
              <p>BTW, what is BN depot? Bedok North depot?</p>

                  Ayer Rajah Bus Park should move to the nearby One North industrial park. The area is still one of the best areas for downroutes for West district services. Also it can be a mainstream depot to venture into new engine technologies like hybrid, biodiesel, CNG, etc, since the number of such companies are flourishing in the area.
                  Another SBST bus park needed for JIS service, probably in Tuas.
              Braddell bus park probably can do a major revamp and multistorey bus park, bus maintenance area and mini bus assembly plant, together with a small skyscraper as the CDGE HQ.

              What I mean is setting another new premises around One North, not the old ARBP area.

              That is why I emphasize that the new depot should be around One North area and not in a new place far away from current ARBP.
