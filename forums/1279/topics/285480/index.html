            <div class='col-md body'>well in the mid eighties SBS launched several safety campaigns aimed at the general riding public. ii think it is time the campaign be revised n relaunched.<br><br>SBS once has a safety campaign aimed at school children. today 2007, i see school children<br><br>a) run around the bendybus rear play grab the schoolbag<br>and as the school child alight, his friends grabs his bag. to my relieft nothing seriuos happened. what could have happen is the bus door plug close on he boy n the bus drag the boy.<br><br>b) school teen from west side school stands on double deck step and chats with friend seated.. this went on for 2 stops before i told the joker to sit down.<br><br>what could have happen is the driver brake suddenly n u see this guy in uniform fly down the bus n break a few bones or more.<br><br>c) school teen uses hand grips as pull up assists. nice. hope he has his balance. otherwise one big brake n he flies to the front n faces windscreen smash thru n hurt himself or worse.<br><br>it just comes to highlight the fact that the campaign has to be brough back.<br><br>and the once famous  bus Safety handbook must be handed out to every schooling child.<br><br>talks must be held in schools and btraffic inspectors should patrol bus stops overflowing with school children to mind their care.<br><br>the talks once incorporated issues on use of concession pass. perhaps with the topics emerging here about using the conc pass n some bad events with driver n conc pass user, the topic on concession pass usage must be raised.<br><br>we remind all concessionpass users that the use of the concession pass is a privillage stated by regulation way back. this privillage can be revoked if mis use of concession pass is found.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Besides targeting at school kids, safety campaign also target at bus operations<br><br>this post will cover bus driver<br><br>the bus driver must always make sure his passengers r safe. if accident occur due to bad driving then it is he to blame n not the bus or anyone else for causing harm to passenger. a bus is an object that move. anything that move is liable to mishap.<br><br>as such our bus driver r called bus captain s he is the sole controller of the bus.<br><br>the bus driver is expected to master smooth driving of a bus. much training goes into his driving skills to see that he does not jerk n jerk the bus. there is a famous test carried out on bus called the glass of water test. if the water spill out of the glass, u fail in ur drive test.<br><br>still today i experience hard baking . this is probably no fault to the driver on those new generation disc brake buses like B9 or K230Ub where brakes are so afe, they literally make the bus stop real fast. as times progress brake technology progress so brakes get real effective.  however it i no excuse for drivers who rive old gen bues to break excessively when stopping. when stopping or slowing down always have a good distance of road to slow down before coming to complete stop and apply brake softly.<br><br>in todays world, the bus driver has only to take care of driving, issue bus ticket, update the IDFC if got a card type flashing pax and then ely on the auto gearbox to move the bus. certainly much easier job to do. but he still has to be mindful of alightting passengers<br><br>there is a bus driver on 196 that drives b9 that closes the door on passengrs who are still alighting.<br><br>drivers master the skill to peer into mirrors to check passenger if he has alighted from the bus or not. the same for outside the bus when driving off from a bus stop he bus driver can also check using a wide angle mirror to see the left nearside of the bus for people . if they r near the bus he has to take care when driving off. this same mirror also can catch people running for the bus. n if so the driver can choose to open door n wait for runner to run to bus.<br><br>whilst driving, driver has to be mindful of the situation on the bus. if a molst case occurs act accordingly n proceed for police station. if soemone suddenly ill or have heart problem n fall on bus. driver must handle the situation.<br><br>one recent case is the ex SBS driver who fell off his seat after suffering a heart problem on bus 156. the driver reacted right but sadly the ex bus driver died on way to hospital.<br><br>in all a bus driver has to mind the passenger's safety . a huge responsibility if u think about it when he drives a bus load of 130 over people if it is superbus.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

I guess for the elderly, the young ones should let them have the seats especially if they are sitting down on the green ones. For children, u know that buses accelerate and declerate, thus the motion will not be stable. Hence, to increase stability, grab the metal poles. It is all in a matter of initative. Adults can't always be there to constantly remind them to grab the poles. Sigh!!</div>
