              <p>From newspaper reports it seems to be around $1500 for 7 hour 20 min X 6 days work week. Normally bus drivers have overtime everyday so they should be getting much more than $1500...</p>
              <p>The timer starts from when they collect the bus from the depot or interchange and ends when they end their shift according to timesheet... Split breaks are not counted. Only mealbreak which are paid for.</p>

              Somewhere last year and beginning of this year, I spoke to some of the Malaysians who were recruited by SMRT and they told me their initial basic pay was around S$1100 to S$1200. After probation and upon confirmation their basic salary would be increased. As for the Chinese from China SMRT driver, their starting basic salary was around S$1000 to S$1100 and upon confirmation it would be increased too. Malaysians and Chinese drivers work permits were valid for 2 years. I also recalled talking to one of the senior staff of SMRT, a Malaysian driver, he had commented that most of the OT would usually go to the Chinese from China drivers. I also noticed there were many Chinese females bus driver from China that were recruited by SMRT last year. 
              
              I think most younger Singaporeans with tertiary education will not be interested in being a bus driver eventhough SMRT offer them an initial basic salary of S$1500 during their probationary period.

              <p>ha normally drivers are assigned to any service at first. as their record builds up they can transfer to a service they wish to drive and can request to be permanent on certain shifts. in the service itself all drivers rotate slots with each other every thursday or friday (unless the driver request to be permanent on a certain slot is approved) so i think it should be fair to all drivers driving the same service.</p>

              Now a Singaporean new driver with the SMRT will have a starting basic salary of $1600. SMRT is adjusting all their drivers basic salary too, Singaporeans and Non-Singaporeans.
