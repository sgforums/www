                      hehe.. i wasnt aware about it.. although the ST article still states that 901 will continue plying from old Woodlands Int on 4 feb 1996. Perhaps its a last minute change after suggestions were made by the residents abt 901 and thus a new svc 904 would serve the Woodlands - Woodladns Chekpt Ter and svc 901 would start from Woodlands reg Int.

                      Hmm, then I dun really remember whether 856 was KJ/AM controlled or full AMDEP contolled. From what I observe in the past, only scania, ELBO, merc and bendies from AMDEP were deployed on 856. No DAFs. The Woodlands services were from KJDEP.
