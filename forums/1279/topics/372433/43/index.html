              <p>400 401 403 were all along trunk services. Even with the
              implementation of the Parks branding for 408 and 409, these three
              services, though designated as part of the Parks Services, charged
              a different fare from the two services 408 and 409 (the fare was
              all along the same as the other trunk routes), operated different
              hours (everyday compared to weekends only) and carried the normal
              desto compared to the 408 409's special green coloured desto.</p>

              <p>Ah, yes. I definitely remember the 'pit-stop' at Woodlands Depot. Last time, Woodlands Depot was where they assembled buses and you could see the new buses being built from the refuelling point. After taking fuel, the bus will make one big loop before going out and you can see the buses parked inside. Those were the good ol' days indeed. It would be unthinkable if such things were to happen today.</p>
