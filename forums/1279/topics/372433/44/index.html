              <p><br>Back then, 40x was literally known and designated as "Special Services" at an initial stage when those services, 404, 405, 406 to various Tourist Attractions in Jurong were introduced together with 450 to PLC. <br><br>Even though 400, 401 and 403 fell under the Parks Services, they still charged in fare stages. 408 and 409 charged flat fares</p>

              <p><br>So it actually survived the 12 years statutory lifespan? I thought it was shipped back to UK afer a few years in SBS?</p>
              <p>And the registry of vehicles then in the 1980s, did allow SBS to acquire 2nd hand buses into their fleet (with the exception of those during the 1973 integration)? Since the Scania BR112DH is a second hand bus from a UK bus co. and LTA now don't allow public bus operator here to buy 2nd hand buses.</p>

              <p>I have one enquiry about a SBS Hino RK176 demonstrator. Is it really true that SBS brought one in as a demostrator in the 1980s? Was it being used on the old SBS service 164?</p>

              <p>Yes I know. 1242U and 1244P first debuted on service 962 in January 2004, subsequently the two buses along with 1246J went to 859. 1243S and 1247G went to 856 and 1245L went to 900.</p>

              <p>SBS 7000E was technically 'on loan' from Scania and it demonstrated for a few British bus operators before being modified and shipped to Singapore in March 1982. It was based at Jurong Depot initially and was known to work on route 30.</p>
              <p>I have personally rode the bus in 1988 when it had a stint on route 187. After that, it was reported that the bus spent its remaining career on route 31, presumably having been transferred to Bedok North Depot. There were no reports of SBS 7000E being exported so it is presumed that the bus met its end in a breaker's yard here.</p>

              <p>Ok, thanks for the information.</p>
              <p>I have one enquiry about a SBS Hino RK176 demonstrator. Is it
                      really true that SBS brought one in as a demostrator in the 1980s?
                      Was it being used on the old SBS service 164?</p>

              <p>Yes, according to an eyewitness account, it is true. However, it's not in the 80s but rather in the late 70s and the bus concerned was a front-engined Hino AK176MA; not a rear-engined RK. SBS 6702U was new in 1977 and was already removed by 1981.</p>

              <p><br>THE HISTORY OF SBS TRANSIT EXPRESS SERVICES</p>
              <p>Express Services was non-existent before 1994. That was when SBS introduced Express 16E, which is a short route of service 16 between Bukit Merah &amp; Changi Airport. Unlike other 'E' code service (which is currently used for Fast Forward Services in SBS Transit), it operated daily at 6 - 9am and 5 - 8pm.</p>
              <p>16E - Bukit Merah - Changi Airport</p>
              <p>Same route as service 16 (at that time), but skips all the bus stops from Nicoll Highway to Airport Boulevard. To Bukit Merah, it skips the bus stops from Marine Parade Road to Stamford Road.</p>
              <p>However, just 3 years later in 1997, it was renumbered 36 and converted to trunk service, although the timing is still the same. In 1998, due to duplicating 16, it was converted into a trunk service and routings are totally changed. Timings are also adjusted too.</p>
              <p>In mid-1997, three Express services is introduced by SBS. They are:</p>
              <p>501 - Hougang Central - Outram Road/Shenton Way<br>502 - Hougang Central - Boon Lay<br>503 - Tampines - Orchard/Suntec City</p>
              <p>Service 501 &amp; 502's routing look somehow similar, via Upp Serangoon Rd, Hougang Ave 8,Yio Chu Kang Rd, Boundary Rd, Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 &amp; CTE.</p>
              <p>After CTE, 501 go down to Outram then to Shenton Way and go back to Hougang Central via Rochor Road (express). 502, however, going to its original route to Boon Lay from Orchard.</p>
              <p>503's routing is just typical using the current 518's route.</p>
              <p>In 1998, three more services is introduced by SBS. They are:</p>
              <p>506 - Bedok - Jurong East<br>507 - Boon Lay - Shenton Way<br>508 - Sengkang - Shenton Way</p>
              <p>506's routing was using its old routing from Jurong East - Bedok North Ave 3, plying Bedok North St 1 and the interchange. 507's route is availble on the website <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2004aug_16-1.aspx">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2004aug_16-1.aspx</a>. 508's route, however was duplicating part of current 501's route until Hougang Ave 8. It plies Hougang Ave 4, Yio Chu Kang Rd, Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 &amp; CTE. It also used 501's route to Shenton Way &amp; Outram Road except Marina Centre.</p>
              <p>However, SBS enhanced two express services to serve passengers better:</p>
              <p>501 - To ply Marina Centre after Fullerton Rd via Temasek Blvd &amp; Ave and Raffles Ave, Stamford Rd &amp; Penang Rd before continuing its route to Hougang Ctrl via CTE. It's also converted to loop service.<br>501X - Alternative to 501 except that it did not ply Outram Rd &amp; Shenton Way.<br>503 - Renumbered 505 and extended to Telok Blangah area, skipping Marina Ctr portion. It's also extended to Pasir Ris and converted to loop service.</p>
              <p>In 2000, almost all Express services in SBS is enhanced.</p>
              <p>501, 501X &amp; 502 - Extended to Sengkang via Hougang Ave 10, Sengkang East Ave, Rivervale Dr &amp; Compassvale Dr.<br>505 - Renumbered 518 and shortened back to Marina Ctr.<br>506 - Extended to Changi Airport.<br>508 - Renumbered 511 and shortened to Hougang Ctrl via Hougang Ave 8 &amp; Upp Serangoon Rd.<br>512 - Introduced to replace 502. The route from Hougang to CTE is duplicating 511. Loop at Orchard via Moulmein Rd, Newton Rd, Scotts Rd, Orchard Rd &amp; back to CTE towards Hougang.</p>
              <p>In 2002, Express 506 was shortened back to Bedok Interchange.</p>
              <p>In 2003, during the NEL Rationaliasation, 501, 511 &amp; 512 was withdrawn and 502 was shortened to loop at Marina Ctr.</p>
              <p>In 2004, due to poor demand, Express 507 was withdrawn.</p>
              <p>In 2005, Express 502 &amp; 518 was enhanced:</p>
              <p>Service 502 was extended to ply Pioneer Rd North, Jurong West Ave 5, St 75 &amp; 64. It no longer plies Commonwealth Ave West, Clementi Ave 2, Holland Rd &amp; Tanglin Rd. Service 502A &amp; 502B were introduced to complement Service 502.</p>
              <p>Service 518 was enhanced to cover more of Pasir Ris Dr 3, 12 &amp; 1. 518A &amp; 518B were introduced to complement 518.</p>
              <p>The short trips of 502 &amp; 518 were looping short trips. Service 502A ply the route of 502 except the stops from Jurong West Ave 1 to Boon Lay Way. 502B ply between Jurong West Ave 1 to Marina Ctr. 518A ply the route of 518 except the Tampines &amp; Bedok North area. 518B plied between Tampines area &amp; Marina Centre.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Express 506 was extended to Upp East Coast Terminal via Bedok North Ave 3, New Upp Changi Rd, Bedok South Ave 3 &amp; Upp East Coast Rd.</p>
              <p>In 2009, Express 502 was extended to ply Soon Lee Bus Park via 185's route from Pioneer Rd North.</p>
              <p>In 2010, 502B &amp; 518B were withdrawn. 502 was extended to MBS area and skipping Raffles Ave, Stamford and part of Orchard area. 502A was also amended to terminate at Marina Stn Rd instead of looping back. 518 will also call at three new stops along Marina Bay area and 518A was also amended to terminate at Bayfront Ave.</p>
