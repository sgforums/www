              <p><br>From what I could know, when 800 was introduced in 1984, someone says the route is:</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 5, 2, 7, Sembawang Rd &amp; Yishun Ave 5.</p>
              <p> In 1987, they said that the route is:</p>
              <p>Yishun Int, Yishun Ctrl, Yishun Ave 9, Yishun Ring Rd, Yishun Ave 7, Sembawang Rd, Yishun Ave 5, 2, Yishun Ring Rd, Yishun Ave 9, Yishun Ctrl, Yishun Ave 2, Yishun Int.</p>
              <p>In 1988 it was then amended to the current route looping at St 71.</p>
              <p>I believe someone here can give the evidence.</p>
