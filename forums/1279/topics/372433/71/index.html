              <p>one notably fact was w/ reduction of buses within CBD and bus routing duplication islandwide, long haul bus routes were created.</p>
              <p>Not to mention the opening of bus interchanges to suit w/ MRT commencemnt i.e. Eunos &amp; Boon Lay for 154.</p>
              <p>I dun remember ultra long haul bus routes other than Svs like 10 or 30 that appeared pre MRT era. Made no sense as no pt having long haul rts when the priority then was to bring ppl from Town to CBD or Jurong.</p>
              <p>The Tpt minister got e facts wrong.</p>

              <p>Some might be thinking of how 201 &amp; 202 appeared.</p>
              <p>Well these could well been x-fer type of routes that SBS inherited (for 201). Back then and I think till to this day, is macham a x-fer pt. So it made sense to get ppl to x-fer to say to Clementi Rd w/ an empty bus.</p>
              <p>202 I think was commencement of SP's Dover Campus in 1978.</p>

              <p><br>The compass MRT line wasn't a real simple withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Some routes were merged, deleted (amended to serve elsewhere like Sv 13) to suit w/ new town devt n MRT commencement.</p>
              <p>83 &amp; 147 merged to better serve Hougang, reduce resources at Punggol Rd. 201 became 151.</p>
              <p>137 &amp; 163/ 173 &amp; 205's case pretty similiar, cut away CBD leg.</p>
              <p>149 I think is split into 2, w/ 16 &amp; 31 taking over. Pretty logical in some sense back then.</p>
              <p>206 was total withdrawn.</p>
              <p>104 became Sv 54 and Sv 156.</p>
              <p>Sv 72 &amp; 158 rationalised together. I believe has to do w/ S'goon New Town devt if I could still remember &amp; reduce duplication w/ 152.</p>
              <p>4 merged w/ 21.</p>
              <p>As for feeders, wat I believe is because as buses became bigger (12m), reduction of feeder routes became inevitable</p>

              <p><br>Service 149 and 390 both withdrawn on the same day with extended service 16 taking over at Changi Airport. Service 31 extended to Toa Payoh in return. A very bad move for connections between Changi Airport to Orchard Road then.</p>
              <p>Service 137 withdrawal was a bad move for connections to Singapore Zoo. Eventually service 138 was introduced few years later from Singapore Zoo to Yio Chu Kang (later amended to Ang Mo Kio).</p>
              <p>Service 175 re-introduced from Lim Chu Kang to Upp Bt Timah covered the linkage along Lim Chu Kang Road. In return service 172 was amended to Boon Lay covering Jalan Bahar linkage.</p>
              <p>Service 151 re-introduced to ply Kent Ridge to Hougang, covering the withdrawn service 201 and also duplicates service 154 between Clementi Road to MacPherson Road until today.</p>
              <p>Withdrawal of service 134 and cutback of service 163 was a good move. In the past there were alot of duplicate services with other services like 166 and 851 along Thomson Road and Kg Java Road stretch.</p>

              <p>Well, w/ 16 extended to Airport no pt for 390 to stay. In any case, w/ our population and traffic volume then it's not an issue.</p>
              <p>206 to me is total withdrawn. Cos ends up those MINDEF camps from Lim Chu Kang to Jurong became so near yet so far. But I guess the routes would not even survive today.</p>
              <p>201 became 151 and routed to Hougang. Back then 154 was a heavily utilised service.</p>

              <p><br>Isn't clause 2 the semi express leg I was referring to? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I've alrdy said, in such cases you cannot just say it's duplication. What other faster roads can e buses use? Ply Sixth Ave, Holland Rd, Farrer Rd, Bt Timah Rd?</p>
              <p>As for DTL rationalisation, if it's like this then I believe the Little India - Beauty World leg would overwhelmed.</p>
              <p>As for 170 &amp; 171. I think 170 would be left behind to leave the bus svs as it is. As for 171 it'll depend on the Orchard NSL impact.</p>

              <p>But later on I believe as there was more and more ppl from Airport &amp; ppl at Marine Parade wanted a faster connection to Orchard, 16 &amp; 16E was rationalised into 16 &amp; 36.</p>
