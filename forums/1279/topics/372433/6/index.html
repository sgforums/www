              <p><br>SBS9083C is a BRBP bus, you mean SBS9082E?</p>
              <p>The perm 502 Merczs were also spread around BBDEP services.</p>
              <p>Last 3 days before IMF ended, SBS3733A and SBS3735U did cameo on 198. But I am not sure about the rest.</p>
              <p>SBS1960Z MIAed on 99 (But it was not x-fered as I could see it doing 99 before IMF ends). In fact, I could see all of 97 permers did 99/198.</p>
              <p>SBS2698A, SBS2762Y should be serving for IMF shuttle as they got the DBS bank ad.</p>
              <p>To conclude, BBDEP got 97/179 permers and SP buses. SBS9024Z and SBS9031C cameoed on 198. SBS9080K and SBS9098K did 99.</p>

              <p><br>basically i think is BBDEP/ARBP swap their MK4 DM3500s to SLBP for 502. In return BB/AR get PA mercs from 502. </p>
