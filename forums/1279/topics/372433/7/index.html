              <p><br>I remember seeing LO3x and Mercs on 502 before the route amendment. 9120D was perm on 502, and served awhile more after the route amendment before 502 was reduced to full SD fleet. 9120D went arbp as SP and then perm 10.

              <p>507 had no DDs? Yeah, the Striders went over to slbp for a short while and returned to bbdep after the PA Mercs perm 502 and 507. Some of those 264x Striders went to slbp and back to bbdep. Remember seeing a pic of 1897Z on 157 when slbp was new.</p>

              <p><br>Bus guides were not accurate sometimes especially for some SBST services with either PAC or FAC status, so is the SBST website. SBST deployments might have adhoc changes at times.</p>

              <p>Service 859 as far as I can remember got swopped between WLDEP and AMDEP like almost 5 times already since its introduction in 1999. Started off with OAC Scania fleets then to Lance fleets under AMDEP after which got upgraded to Habits, then back to WLDEP with 0405Gs. And currently now with Scania and bendy fleets.</p>
