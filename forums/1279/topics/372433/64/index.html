              <p>You started disputing tat 1637 - 1695 are MKII and not LA. You even insisted you're right all the way.</p>
              <p>so now I said 24XX are O305, surely you going to believe they cant' be double decks.</p>
              <p>Then let me tell u as I've posted in prev page, SBS did practice running numbers for registration before streamlining SD and DD's rego order.</p>
              <p>as for strange, I think there's clones in tis forum alrdy.</p>

              <p>Come on, no need to quarrel.</p>
              <p>The MK3s have done Sentosa services before for services A, B, C, and E which respectively from World Trade Centre terminal, Tiong Bahru MRT and Orchard Road. Forgot another place it plies.</p>
              <p>But a short while later SBS Leisure brought in the PSV Soon Chow Volvo B10M MK4s, together with PSV Soon Chow Scania L113 for AirBus services. That's when MK4s replaced the MK3s for Sentosa services. The affected MK3s were then repainted back to SBS livery and put into revenue services for SBS services, till now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MAybe someone here can talk about the Sentosa bus services under SBS Leisure and the bus deployments. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>2) If I remember correctly 169 had mainly Nissan Diesel U31F and Hino HT228KA fleets.</p>
              <p>3) Service 169 started to have bendies in year 2000 which appears only as a trial on weekday peak hours. Only in Mar 2001 service 169 was introduced with perm bendy fleets.</p>

In its meantime, commuters would alight from one bus stop facing directly or just opposite the WTC to head the venue for its exhibition. These services were NEVER terminate at the roadside around the WTC though, but these existing buses came from Alexandra Rd / Tanjong Pagar Rd (near Anson Rd)<br><br>SBS had negotiated with the PSA to built a new bus terminal at WTC in 1983. A possible site - at Seah Im Rd / Telok Blangah Rd was drawn out by PSA, and its proposal of the new bus terminal at WTC is to improve the bus services at WTC, though there is a growing demand of bus services that served WTC. Before the terminus was made to fully fledged its existing bus services terminating at the two terminus, the agony comes to waiting for a bus scheduling to pass by the WTC and its terminus was the main purpose to better serve the commuters who are heading to WTC.<br><br>The WTC bus terminus was completed at the end of 1984, with existing SBS Services CBD 1, 84, 93, 100 &amp; 163, and TIBS 167 &amp; 180 serving the new WTC terminus. It commenced its operations on 13th Jan 1985, replacing the Tg Pagar Rd and Aleaandra Rd Terminus.<br><br>(The terminus was being upgraded in par with the new North East Line connectivity, and was renamed as "Harbour Front Interchange".<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SERVICES AT WTC BUS TERMINUS<br><br>CBD 1 - World Trade Ctr to Orchard Rd (Loop) - Service was extended from Marina Centre to World Trade Centre.<br>84 - World Trade Ctr to Upp Serangoon<br>93 - World Trade Ctr to Paya Lebar Airport (Loop)<br>100 - World Trade Ctr to Serangoon Gaden<br>163 - World Trade Ctr to Jln Kayu<br>167 - World Trade Ctr to Admiralty Rd West<br>180 - World Trade Ctr to Admiralty Rd (Marsiling Est)<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>CURRENT SERVICES AT HARBOURFRONT INTERCHANGE<br><br>65 - HarbourFront to Tampines<br>80 - HarbourFront to Sengkang<br>93 - HarbourFront to Eunos<br>188 - HarbourFront to Choa Chu Kang<br>855 - HarbourFront to Yishun<br>963 - HarbourFront to Woodlands Reg Int<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SERVICES EVER TERMINATED AT WTC TERMINAL / HARBOURFRONT INTERCHANGE<br><br>84 - Hougang Ctrl to WTC (Service withdrawn)<br>85 - Sengkang to WTC (Harbourfront) (Service withdrawn due to NEL Rationalisation)<br>521 - Bt Panjang to WTC (Service renumbered to 963, with the extension of Woodlands Reg Int)<br>865 - Sengkang to WTC (Service renumbered to 85, when 865 became SBS)<br>NR1 - Harbourfront To Yishun (Service extended to RWS)<br>NR6 - Harbourfront To Sengkang (Service extended to RWS)<br><br>In addition, Express Services 188E and 963E also serves the HarbourFront Int and 2 special Parks Services, 408 to Labrador Pk (12 Mar) and 409 to Mount Faber (14 Nov) were introduced both in 2005.</p></div>

              <p>The MRT rationalisation was not really for e MRT.</p>
              <p>Cos for 4 reasons.</p>
              <p>Before I go on, they stopped at 1993 cos too many complains abt
              e changes.</p>
              <p>1) Resettlement: No pt for places like Punggol to have both 82
              &amp; 83. Hence, SBS could get deploy better resources onto the
              amended 147 to Hougang which was developing.</p>
              <p>2) Feeder Svs: Though lesser buses needed to CBD due to MRT and
              remove bus - bus duplication, buses were alrdy needed to cover the
              new towns. Singapore experienced boom in New Town devt in
              1980s.</p>
              <p>3) Corridor w/o MRT: Like Sv 163, instead of going to CBD, serve
              Toa Payoh instead. Or like 201, extend to Hougang to let ppl at Bt
              Timah got bus svs to Hougang Ave 3.</p>
              <p>4) Buses still needs to be there: Eg like 105 ended up plying
              MRT route instead of Holland Rd. The buses still needs to be
              there.</p>

              <p><br>All these rationalisation exercises were conducted by TransitLink. It was never being called as the "MRT Rationalisation" but actually called the "Bus-MRT Integration Exercise"<br><br>However, with the major changes taken place within the 3 years from 1990 to 1993, the PTC, also monitors the bus services changes that had affected hundreds of commuters that frequent the bus services.<br><br>As mentioned, 142 &amp; 147 is also another complaint sent by Potong Pasir Residents in fear that 147 no longer plies at the Potong Pasir estate due to the direct link cut off to the CBD.</p>

              <p><br>1) Service 5 only plies Pending Rd (Os Bt Panjang CC). It continues its route from Bt Panjang Rd onwards by turning left to reach Blk 113 bus stop.<br><br>2) It plies Bt Panjang Rd and continuing its route from BKE onwards.</p>
