              <p><strong>The Chai Chee Bus Terminal shifting</strong><br> <br> As announced by the HDB, the Chai Chee Bsu Terminal was acquired
              for the new developments under the proposal by HDB. As such,
              majority of the services are being called at Bedok Interchange, as
              the concourse had been expanded to acconodate more parking space
              for end-on berths.<br> <br> There were 2 phases of the shifting carried out. One was on 8 Sep
              1985 and the ohter was on 15 Sep 1985. Two bus stops along New Upp
              Changi Rd (8402-A &amp; 8402-Z) were erected outside the terminus
              for boarding/alighting activities, to utilise the services that
              serves Bedok Interchange.<br> <br> <strong>Overview of the changes:</strong><br> PHASE 1 (8 Sep 1985)<br> 13 - Bedok to Ghim Moh via New Upp Changi Rd<br> 20 - Bedok to Ghim Moh via Frankel Ave<br> 40 - Bedok to MacPherson (Loop)<br> 158 - Bedok to Toa Payoh<br> 221 - Bedok to Bedok North Ave 3 (Loop)<br> 227 - Bedok to Bedok North Depot (Loop)<br> 401 - Bedok to East Coast Park Svc Rd<br> <br> All of its trunk services were shifted to Bedok Int, inclusive of
              Speacial Service 401. As for its feeders, 221 introduced a 2 plate
              system while 227 was amended to serve Bedok North Ave 1 &amp; Bedok
              North Rd, at the same time its looping position will be at Bedok
              North Depot instead of Bedok Interchage.<br> <br> PHASE 2 (15 Sep 1985)<br> 33 - Amended to serve New Upp Changi Rd, Geylang Rd(I)/Sims Ave(O),
              Dunman Rd/Old Airport Rd, extension to Bedok Interchange.<br> 41 - Extension of service to Bukit Merah<br> 44 - Service withdrawal.<br> 219 - New feeder service from Bedok - Bedok South Rd (Loop)<br> 220 - Extension of service to Bedok<br> 221C - Service withdrawal.<br> 222 - Service withdrawal.<br> 223 - Service withdrawal.<br> 224 - New feeder service from Bedok - Chai Chee Rd (Loop)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> 222 is now serving Chai Chee Road, Chai Chee St and Chai Chee Drive residents as a feeder while 229 was amended to serve Bedok South while passing through Chai Chee Road. 222 now also serves the Bedok North residents.</p>

              <p><br>Service 852's history of operations as follows:-</p>
              <p>1998 and before: Full KJDEP, DAFs were deployed when service 852 became a PAC service. No Scanias were deployed on service 852 then.</p>
              <p>Oct 1998: WLDEP was opened and service 852 became dual KJDEP/WLDEP controlled. Scanias were introduced on service 852.</p>
              <p>Dec 1999: WLDEP gave service 852's duties to AMDEP and thus became dual KJDEP/AMDEP controlled. That was where Lances were introduced on service 852 too. AMDEP Scanias were also made perm on service 852.</p>
              <p>June 2000: Became full AMDEP controlled when Bt Batok came under Tibs. DAFs were withdrawn from service 852's fleet. That was also when Scanias were withdrawn from service 852's fleet when AMDEP Scanias were xferred to WLDEP.</p>
              <p>Jan 2001: Some depot swops took place between services 167, 851, 852, 859, 980. Also with the introduction on service 857. Service 852 went back dual KJDEP/AMDEP controlled. DAFs made a comeback to service 852.</p>
              <p>Jan 2004: Went back to full AMDEP controlled again. TIB436J TIB437G TIB479K TIB490B were xferred from KJDEP to AMDEP and became perm service 852 under AMDEP. From then DAFs were permanently withdrawn from service 852's fleet.</p>
              <p>March 2008: Became full WLDEP controlled. Several ex-CSS spare Nissans from WLDEP were thrown over to service 852, together with a few CAC Scania ELBOs. Scanias made a comeback to service 852 whereas Lances were withdrawn.</p>
              <p>June 2008: Lances were back to service 852 under WLDEP during the massive swop of buses between depots.</p>

              <p><br>In the past WLDEP controlled some Yishun bus services, reason was because AMDEP got to focus more on NE areas like 82, 103, 163, 864, 865, 866 etc. Whereas KJDEP focused on Woodlands and Bt Panjang services. WLDEP was just like a neutral empire to both sides having majority services under dual WLDEP controlled.</p>
              <p>It was because of the merger with SMRT and also the Tibs/SBS swop, major depot deployments took place in 1999/2000 as follows:-</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun came back under majority AMDEP with services 853, 854, 855 etc and feeders/townlinks all under full AMDEP.<br></li>
              <li>Woodlands came under majority WLDEP with services 178, 187, 700, 960, 961 etc and feeders/townlinks all under full WLDEP.<br></li>
              <li>KJDEP was then to focus on those CCK/Bt Batok terrorities which Tibs just took over from SBS. Some Bt Panjang services were handed over to WLDEP too.<br></li>
              <li>During this swop service 167 was made full WLDEP whereas service 980 full AMDEP during this swop. Service 851 was made full WLDEP.<br></li>
              <li>In Jan 2001 service 851 was made full AMDEP, whereas services 167 and 980 were made partial AMDEP/WLDEP each.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Also to note that service 852 was one of the odd-ball Yishun services to be under full KJDEP in the past with other Yishun services under full AMDEP.</p>

              <p><br>Even after 178's mercz has been depleted in the first Q of 09, was it a common thing after that? remembered 178 receiving mercz cameos like quite common though after oct 09, before that not really common.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Can expect to see more than a quarter of mercz going around on 178 like nobody's business though today, even though no perms are deployed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, how many fleets did 851,853,854,855 receive when they were in WLDEP?</p>

The sole Elbo on 103 835R didn't last very long and was then redeployed to 851. Then Lances came in new to 103, of which only 910G was equiped with EDS. Other Lances using plastic destos were mainly the 92x series ones. The longest surviving O405s on Tibs 103 were 780P - 784D. 784D had some Jalan Kayu prata ad iirc.</p>
              <p>But what I noticed was that amdep deployed new models on Jalan Kayu services then. 865 was full OAC O405s.</p>
