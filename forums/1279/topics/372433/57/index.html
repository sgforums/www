              <p>Service 81 did not ply Stamford Rd and Prinsep St, instead it ply bi-directional along Victoria St and Middle Rd. Before the route amendment, it did ply Waterloo St together with service 147 and 163.

              <p>========<strong> SHENTON WAY BUS SERVICES HISTORY</strong> =========<br><br><em><strong>ITS HISTORY OF PRINCE EDWARD RD TERMINAL AND SHENTON WAY TERMINAL AND ITS BUS SERVICES</strong></em><br>Back to the 1950s and 1960s, the Singapore Traction Company was the only bus company that monopolizes the city area such as Shenton Way, Tanjong Pagar and New Bridge Rd. It restricts other chinese bus companies from entering the city area, as the roads in the city area was specially used for STC buses.<br><br>(STC was owned and incorporated in United Kingdom, as Singapore was a British colony)<br><br>If you look back to the Singapore Street Dirctory in the 1960s (those back pages), you would only see STC bus services plying around the city area while the 10 Chinese bus companies, would operate services in the repsective rural districts and new towns.<br><br>Shenton Way Bus Terminal was only a roadside terminal located at Shenton Way with boarding bus stops that were frequently over-crowding. There wasn't a proper bus parking bays and its buses were simply parked on the road side leading to congestion.<br><br>When the re-organisation of the bus service started on 11th Apr 1971, its bus services were then extended to Prince Edward Rd. It was not known exactly, if the STC services were ever terminate at the Prince Edward Rd before its re-organisation. The terminal was located just a walk away from Singapore Polytechnic and Shenton Way.<br><br>The Prince Edward Rd Terminal survived for only 16 years. A new terminal, Shenton Way Bus Terminal (working name was Palmer Rd Terminal, but was renamed), was the first bus terminal to be built under Benjamin Sheares Bridge. With this construction as a first of a kind, this had known to free up more space for urban <br>redevelopment.<br><br>Shenton Way Bus Terminal began its operations on 28th June 1987, with SBS Services 60, 70, 82, 130, 131, 172, 175, 186, 193 and TIBS Service 161 were made to terminate at the new terminal. Back then, boarding was allowed at Palmer Rd, with 4 new berths erected. THe alighting point was at Marina House, Shenton Way.<br><br>(On 5th July 1987, Service 188 was abolished and the terminus at Ulu Pandan ceased to operate)<br><br>On 26th Apr 2010, Shenton Way Bus Terminal would have to re-locate again, this time round, it is visible to the public (i.e. the current location of Shenton Way Bus <br>Terminal). With the amendments of Service 106 and 133 extended to Shenton Way, the terminal was relocated to accomodate with the 3 additional bus services at Shenton Way, with the other being, the newly introduced 133M from Shenton Way to Marina Center. It was also, on the same day, the roads that served the Marina Bay Sands - Bayfront Ave - was opened to vehicluar traffic and new bus stops were erected for public buses to call there.<br><br>(The Scania K310UD, SBS7888K, was the only demo bus that first operates as a trial basis on 133M (subsequently to 133) and terminates at the new Shenton Way Bus Terminal. It first made its appearence on 133M on 17 May 2010.)<br><br>=============================================================<br><strong>MEMORANDUM</strong><br>The following list of the bus services are as follows, from the STC, 1971 reorganisaion, 1974 Bus Rationalisation and other amendments up to the 1970s. As some service has been mentioned earlier by its episode, I will just list it down as a historical refernece.

              <p>======== <strong>SHENTON WAY BUS SERVICES HISTORY</strong> =========<br><br><em><strong>ITS HISTORY OF PRINCE EDWARD RD TERMINAL AND SHENTON WAY TERMINAL AND ITS BUS SERVICES</strong></em><br>Back to the 1950s and 1960s, the Singapore Traction Company was the only bus company that monopolizes the city area such as Shenton Way, Tanjong Pagar and New Bridge Rd. It restricts other chinese bus companies from entering the city area, as the roads in the city area was specially used for STC buses.<br><br>(STC was owned and incorporated in United Kingdom, as Singapore was a British colony)<br><br>If you look back to the Singapore Street Dirctory in the 1960s (those back pages), you would only see STC bus services plying around the city area while the 10 Chinese bus companies, would operate services in the repsective rural districts and new towns.<br><br>Shenton Way Bus Terminal was only a roadside terminal located at Shenton Way with boarding bus stops that were frequently over-crowding. There wasn't a proper bus parking bays and its buses were simply parked on the road side leading to congestion.<br><br>When the re-organisation of the bus service started on 11th Apr 1971, its bus services were then extended to Prince Edward Rd. It was not known exactly, if the STC services were ever terminate at the Prince Edward Rd before its re-organisation. The terminal was located just a walk away from Singapore Polytechnic and Shenton Way.<br><br>The Prince Edward Rd Terminal survived for only 16 years. A new terminal, Shenton Way Bus Terminal (working name was Palmer Rd Terminal, but was renamed), was the first bus terminal to be built under Benjamin Sheares Bridge. With this construction as a first of a kind, this had known to free up more space for urban<br>redevelopment.<br><br>Shenton Way Bus Terminal began its operations on 28th June 1987, with SBS Services 60, 70, 82, 130, 131, 172, 175, 186, 193 and TIBS Service 161 were made to terminate at the new terminal. Back then, boarding was allowed at Palmer Rd, with 4 new berths erected. THe alighting point was at Marina House, Shenton Way.<br><br>(On 5th July 1987, Service 188 was abolished and the terminus at Ulu Pandan ceased to operate)<br><br>On 26th Apr 2010, Shenton Way Bus Terminal would have to re-locate again, this time round, it is visible to the public (i.e. the current location of Shenton Way Bus<br>Terminal). With the amendments of Service 106 and 133 extended to Shenton Way, the terminal was relocated to accomodate with the 3 additional bus services at Shenton Way, with the other being, the newly introduced 133M from Shenton Way to Marina Center. It was also, on the same day, the roads that served the Marina Bay Sands - Bayfront Ave - was opened to vehicluar traffic and new bus stops were erected for public buses to call there.<br><br>(The Scania K310UD, SBS7888K, was the only demo bus that first operates as a trial basis on 133M (subsequently to 133) and terminates at the new Shenton Way Bus Terminal. It first made its appearence on 133M on 17 May 2010.)<br><br>=============================================================<br><strong>MEMORANDUM</strong><br>The following list of the bus services are as follows, from the STC, 1971 reorganisaion, 1974 Bus Rationalisation and other amendments up to the 1970s.

              <p>You forgot about some services. 182 was extended from New Bridge Road to Shenton Way to serve Marsiling. In 1996, amended to Woodlands Reg Int and withdrawn later.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, it's introduced in 1998 from Jurong East to Tuas, when Tuas Ter opened. Shortened to Boon Lay in 2001. For more information, see the last third post on page 55 which I posted. (if I'm not wrong)</p>

              <p><br>Service 980 during the beginning days of WLDEP operations in 1998-1999 was worst off with majority Nissan UD fleets (the above mentiones were perms only during this period), after which 980 became full AMDEP controlled due to the SBS/Tibs swop.</p>
              <p>In Jan 2001, service 980 came back under partial WLDEP again, this time round with full Scania fleets (565U 658K 665P 666L 672T 673R). There were Nissan UDs from WLDEP too but not very common then.</p>
