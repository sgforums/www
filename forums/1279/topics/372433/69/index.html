              <p>Yeap 123 was initially a St. Michael's to New Bridge Road loop service but during the 1993 rationalisation 124 (which plies Thomson Rd and Stevens Rd before amendment) took over its sectors from St Michael's to Scotts Road and 123 was shortened to plies between New Bridge Road and Tomlinson Road.<br><br>However a couple of months later after the first amendment, it was amended again, intergrating with 14's sector from Bukit Merah and Orchard Road and at the same time, extended to loop at Bukit Purmei Avenue instead of terminating/looping at New Bridge Road.</p>

              <p><br>123 &amp; 124 amendment came because 186 was extended to St Mikes via Whitley Rd and PIE. 124 was also extended to BMR.</p>

              <p>165 &amp; 196 did go to Boon Lay before. If you want evidence, you can ask everyone else. I even thought 10 also goes to Boon Lay before.<br><br>As for the 105 thing, I make a wrong typo, because I actually was wanting to write as there was an amendment to 104 in 1992. Actuallly, 104 starts off as a Serangoon - Upp Cross St. In 1992 it was then amended to New Bridge Road, also it swapped route with 105 to ply Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 &amp; Bishan Road instead of Lor Chuan.</p>

              <p><br>Both services 104 and 134 were withdrawn and new services 54 and 156 were introduced on the same day.</p>
              <p>Service 54 basically covered service 134's route from Bishan to Upp Thomson Rd and also service 104's route from Scotts Road to New Bridge Rd (except the Clemenceau Rd and Upp Cross St part, 54 passes by Liang Court instead).</p>
              <p>Service 156 was introduced as a Serangoon to Clementi route and it covers the withdrawn service 104's route from Serangoon to Thomson Rd PIE sector, after which it serves as a new link to Clementi via Bt Timah, Sixth Ave and Ulu Pandan. It also covers service 74's route (which was amended to Buona Vista) along Clementi Ave 2. In Aug 2001 service 156 was extended to Sengkang interchange.</p>
