              <p><br>Yup, I remember Volvo MK2 DMs did service 390 in 1989. They were meant to replace the ageing Albion Vikings. I believe that 390 was under HGDEP that time. After that 390 moved on to BNDEP and switched to Scania N113CRB fleets.</p>

              <p><br>First Volvo B10M MK2 on 174 should be SBS1696L. It was featured as a promotional shoot for the advertisement of SBS bus charter services.</p>

              <p>Correction for the 390 part, it is Volvo MK2 DMs, not MK4s. MK4 DMs came in only in 1998. 390 was already withdrawn by 1993.</p>
