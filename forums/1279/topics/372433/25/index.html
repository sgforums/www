              the last few of its Mercedes-Bnez O305 buses was de-registered in Jan 2002.. whereby 7111 and 7112 was the last to leave SBS. But btw, the new LO3x buses were placed on service 7 on the 3rd quarter of 1993.<br><br>When VO2x came in to service 74 perm, most of its MB O305 buses were taken off from service and running around as a SP bus on 153, 154, 165 and 385, at a very short while as well before it lay up and de-registrered. However the MB O305s that serves HG feeders 321, 322, 326, 327 and 328 were replaced by VO2x.

              <p>HUMBLE DAYS OF CITY SHUTTLE SERVICES<br> <br> Why CSS was borned on the 16 May 1975?<br> This is one of the good question. CSS was introduced both by SSB
              &amp; NTUC Comfort, which alleviates the road traffic congestions
              along the CBD area, which is better known as the Park And Ride
              Scheme.<br> <br> With the scheme, commuters can park their cars at the 16 designated
              CSS fringe car parks (which I'll mentioned at the later parts) and
              take the CSS services from that fringe car parks. But only a big
              failure was --- the Fringe Car Parks is a wasteless facility
              because not many park their cars since the car parks has many
              parking lots that no one bothers to use them.<br></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It's been a while for me to contribute the history of bus services. hmm, let's see what I'll should contribute, maybe I'll go for the Yishun bus services<br><br>I'll go briefly on how Yishun New town was developed. Initially, that part of the Sembawang Rd (around Nee Soon/Chong Pang Village) stretch stands 2 new blocks (Blks 101, 102 and the 4 precedding blocks 103-106) around the small satellite town which was known as Nee Soon new town. Even its road name was known as Nee Soon Ave 5, Nee Soon ring Rd before Nee Soon new town was renamed as Yishun new Town because this town was expected to expand its developemnt on other parts and fully developed by the end of 1989, other blocks in the 7xx series (blks 701, 702, etc) were still under construction, although villages/kampongs were cleared due to the redevelopemnt of the residential area. With the renaming of the New Town, the roads were also being renamed as Yishun Ring Rd, Yishun Ave 5, etc<br><br>Now let's go on to its bus services.<br><br>It's very obvious that none of its bus services catering at the pre-development of Yishun New Town. However, noticably some of the bus services that ply along Sembawang Rd like 160, 161, 164, 167 &amp; 169, although those service served along the block of HDB flats that are situated adjacently to Sembawang Rd.<br><br>Those 5 services were then handed over to TIBS in 1983, and as early as 1984, because Yishun fall under the Northern boundaries of Singapore, the services as well were fully operated by TIBS, with the rapid developemnt of the Yishun New Town. There were only 4 services from TIBS at the start, 2 were feeders and the ohter 2, were trunk services.<br><br>Feeders:<br>800 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun St 71 (Loop)<br>801 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun Ave 7 (Loop)<br><br>Trunks:<br>850 - Yishun Central to Bt Merah (via Thomson Rd and enters Marina Centre on Suns &amp; PHs))<br>851 - Ysihun Central to Bt Merah<br><br>Both Yishun Ave 5 and Yishun Central terminus was only a small temporary bus terminal for feeders and trunk services respectively, awaiting for its bus interchange to be completed in 1987, which generally coupled conveniently to the new Yishun MRT station and the proposed shopping Centre at the Yishun Town Centre (presently known as Northpoint).<br><br>Before the interchange opened to the public in 1987, here was the newly introduced services that operated from Yishun Ave 5 and Yishun Central Terminus in additional to 800,801,850, 851.<br><br>Feeders From Yishun Ave 5<br>802 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun Ave 3 (Loop) [ introduced in 1986]<br>803 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun St 61 (Loop) [introduced in 1987]<br><br>Tunk from Yishun Central<br>852 - Yishun to Jurong [introduced in 1986]<br>853 - Yishun to Marine Parade/Lor 1 Geylang [introduced in 1987]<br>854 - Yishun to Bedok [introduced in 1987]<br><br>When the interchange opened, all of its Yishun serivces were amended to call at the new Yishun Bus Interchange.<br><br>Yishun services introduced/amended /withdrawn after 1987 to present date (Minor amendmnets are not included)<br>39 - Tampines to Yishun (SBST service, introduced in 2003)<br>85 - Punggol to Yishun (SBST service, introduced in 2005)<br>171 - Yishun to Marina Centre [SBS service extended to Yishun from Sembawang (Mandai Rd) terminus in 1987 and amended to Marina Centre from Queen St, amended to Bt Panjang in 1993, skips Mandai Lake Rd in 1994, handed to TIBS in 1995, and services 171 and 927 exchanges its route along Mandai Rd and Woodlands Rd in 1999, which means that 171 will ply BKE and Bt Panjang Rd while 927 ply Mandai Rd and Woodlands Rd]<br>520 - Express service from Yishun to Chinatown [introduced in 1997, withdrawn due to the NEL]<br>801 - Yishun to Yishun Ave 5 [amended to Yishun Ave 5 when int opened.

              <p>Let's move on to the next episode of the history of bus srvices in the 3 towns -- Choa Chu Kang, Bt Batok and Pasir Ris, but let me start off for the Choa Chu Kang first. Hmm, maybe I should add on Lim Chu kang as well. The Bt Batok &amp; Pasir Ris bus service history are on separate posts.<br><br>==== CHOA CHU KANG / LIM CHU KANG BUS SERVICES HISTORY ====<br><br>In the pre-1971 re-organisation, Choa Chu Kang bus services were operated by Green Bus Co Ltd, serving the rural districts of Choa Chu Kang and also Lim Chu Kang areas, coupled with RAF Tengah along Choa Chu Kang Rd.<br><br>Green Bus 2 from Lim Chu kang to Queen St via Bt Timah Rd/Duneran Rd<br>this service will divert to Choa Chu kang Rd (End), around kampoung bereh/CCK village on certain timings.<br><br>Green Bus 8 from RAF Tengah to Union Jack Club, North Bridge Rd<br>this service operated only on fridays, sats and suns.

It was noticed that 177 was amended to start its trip from Upp Bt Timah Rd and loops at Choa Chu kang Rd End.<br><br>In 1978, service 206 was amended to call at Jurong Interchange, as part of the Jurong Bus Service Rationalisation.<br><br>However, in the early 1980s, with the amendment of 177, service 179 was withdrawn and part of its route were covered by 177. Service 177 was withdrawn in 1985.<br><br>Now, let's move on to the present generations of Choa Chu Kang. The part of Teck Whye Lane was starting to develop in rapid succession in the 1980s, with the mass clearing of squatters/ villages to make way for the HDB development. the 32 blocks of 1-story SIT flat were also being cleared to make way as well.<br><br>The only terminus in Choa Chu Kang was situated at Choa Chu Kang Dr, with 3 services terminating there, mainly 75, 179 and 185, before the actial location at Choa Chu Kang Ave 4, which is also located to the Choa Chu Kang branch line of the MRT on 10 Mar 1990.<br><br>75 - Choa Chu Kang to Marina Centre [service extended from Clementi and extended to Marina Centre]<br>179 - Choa Chu Kang to New Bridge Rd [service extended from Bt Batok]<br>185 - Choa Chu Kang to Shenton Way [new service]<br><br>With the interchange opening, 2 new feeder services were introduced, services 300 and 301, and TIBS SS7 was introduced later in 1990, to cater residents of Choa Chu Kang to Woodlands new Town, when the Woodlands MRT extension is planned and began its construction as early as 1992/93.<br><br>Services in Choa Chu Kang in 1990:<br>75 - Choa Chu Kang to Marina Centre<br>179 - Choa Chu Kang to New Bridge Rd (withdrawn)<br>185 - Choa Chu Kang to Shenton Way (was shortened to Jln Anak Bukit in 1992)<br>190 - Choa Chu Kang to New Bridge Rd<br>300 - Choa Chu Kang to Choa Chu Kang Ave 3 (Loop)<br>301 - Choa Chu Kang to Teck Whye Lane (Loop)<br>SS7 - Choa Chu Kang to Woodlands.<br><br>Service that are withdrawn/amended/introduced after 1990, <strong>LCK services are  included as well</strong> [amendments shown in bracket]:<br>67 - Choa Chu Kang to Tampines [Introdced on 26 May 1991, merged with service 4 and it serves Bedok North Ave 3, New Upp Changi Rd, Lavender St]<br>75 - Choa Chu Kang to Marna Centre [service shortened to Bt Panjang in 1993, with the introduction of new Service 179 from Choa Chu Kang to Fajar Rd]<br><strong>172 </strong>- Choa Chu Kang to Boon Lay [service shortened to Upp Bt Timah Rd and was amended to call at Boon Lay on 26 May 1991.

              <p>==== HISTORY OF PASIR RIS SERVICES ====<br><br>The history of Pasir Ris service can be traced back as early as 1984, when its lone service, 403, which plys from Pasir Ris Rd (Pasir Ris Beach paek) to Elias Rd and loops back. This service only operates only on Suns &amp; PHs on selected timings only.<br><br>Not many have noticed that Pasir Ris (in the past there was Kampong Pasir Ris which is off Loyang Rd) was once a fishing village, which coupled together with Loyang area, facing the sea and the famous Pasir Ris Bach Chalet Resort and the pasir ris park. But until in the late 1980s, several HDB flats were completed in Pasir Ris mainly block 1xx and the NTUC Pasir Ris Resort (now Downtown East) was also erected just around pasir Ris Close/Pasir Ris Dr 3.<br><br>The only service, whcih was the first service to terminate at Pasir Ris terminal at Pasir Ris Dr 6 was service 12, which was extended from Somapah Terminal because that terminal was closed permanently in 1989 and at the same time shortened to New Bridge Rd. Another service 19, which loops at Pasir Ris Dr 6 from Bedok, was also being amended to terminate at Pasir Ris Ter until when the new Pasir Ris Int opened, then service 12 and 19 was amended to terminate at the new Pasir Ris Int.<br><br>when Service 4 was being merged with Service 19, the service became Pasir Ris to St. Michael's ter in 1989.

On other occasion, the service would directly continue via Pasir Ris Dr 3.<br><br>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PASIR RIS SERVICES AFTER 1990:<br>NOTE: Other amendments that were taken place externally are not shown here.<br>4 - Service shortened to Tampines in 1992.<br>5 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah in 2007.<br>6 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Loyang Cres (Loop) service in 1993.
