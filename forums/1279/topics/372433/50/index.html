              <p>When 168 was intro, it was the first SBST service to enter TIBS (now SMRT) territory in 2001. It was followed by 161 a year later. Svc 39 in 2003 &amp; lastly Svc 85 in 2006.</p>
              <p>For Service 161 &amp; 168, it simply started off with B10M Mark IV (DM, strider &amp; DM3500 if i am right). It was until 2003, i dont know if there was a DD test trial for Woodlands int but maybe there was if not u wont see DD on these 2 svc tdy lol.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SBST Service 116.</span><br><br>Well simply this Service was intro in Mid-2006 from Hougang to IMH via Hougang Ave 4 express.

              <p>Let's now talk about the Hougang services first then to Punggol ones.<br><br>In 1978, the first few HDB blocks were completed at Tampines Way (the current Hougang Ave 3 stretch). With the completion of the estate, a new service 86 was introduced from Tampines Way to shenton way. It was the first pioneered service that uses the first batch of Layland Atlantean DDs with BACO and Metsec body.<br><br>Before Hougang New Town was developed, there were two terminals situated at Upp Serangoon Rd. They were situated at 10.5km of Upp Seragoon Rd and the another at the end of Upp Serangoon Rd. (Do not confuse Upp Serangoon Rd as Serangoon New Town as Upp Serangoon Rd runs through Hougang)<br><br>The Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at 10.5km has:<br>85 - To Sims Ave (loop)<br>111 - To C'waelth Ave (via Orchard Blvd)<br>112 - To C'wealth Ave (via Tiong Barhu Rd)<br><br>The Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at road end has:<br>136 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>156 - To Toa Payoh<br><br>In the early 1980s, the Hougang New Town began construction and its developing until the 1990s, together with the first gen of HDB blocks at Tampines Way. With this new satellite town developing, another new bus interchange was planned at Hougang St 21. In 1983, existing services from Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at 10.5km (except 112 which was withdrawn) began to termiante at the new Hougang Bus Interchange at Hougang St 21. Other services like 97 to Jurong East Central Ter were introduced as well as feeder services like 321, 323 and 329 that plies within the neighbourhood Hougang areas.<br><br>However, the Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at road end, still continues to operate, with 3 services, 84, 136 and 153. Service 156 was known to have been withdrawn in the early 1980s.<br><br>- Services in Hougang Bus Int in 1985 -<br><br>85 - To Sims Ave<br>97 - To Jurong East Ter<br>111 - To Buona Vista<br>321 - To Upp Paya Lebar Rd (Loop)<br>[322 - To Hougang Ave 2 (Loop)] - introduced at late 1985<br>323 - To Hougang Ave 5/7 (Loop)<br>[327 - To Hougang Ave 7 (Loop)] - introduced at late 1985<br>329 - To Defu Ave 1 (Loop)<br><br>In fact, in addition to the existing feeders, more feeders were planned, they were 326 and 328. 326 plys to Hougang Ave 6 and 328 plys to Hougang Ave 8. But there's only a minor change to 2 feeders, 323 and 329. Service 323 was actually an integration of existing 323 and 329, it plys via Hougang Ave 5 and 7 (old 323 route) and Defu Ave 1 (old 329 route), instead of Tampines Rd.<br><br>Service 54 was introduced as Hougang to Eunos service (a loop service) in 1986. Its routrings were:<br><br>Hougang Int, Hougang St 21, Hougang Ave 1, Tampiens Rd, Hougang Ave3, Eunos Link, Jln Eunos, Changi Rd, Jln Turi (Loop), Sims Ave, Jln Eunos, Eunos Link, Hougang Ave 3, Tampines Rd, Hougang Ave 1, Hougang St 21 and Hougang Int<br><br>And Service 54 was withdrawn in 1987. On the other hand, Service 51 was integrated with Service 54 for Hougang to Jln Eunos stretch, thus Service 51 extends to Hougang Int.<br><br>Other significant changes<br><br>The first Aircon Service in Hougang was Service 118, which was introduced to loop at Orchard Rd. This service was duplicated with existing 111 and was withdrawn after 2 years of service<br>62 was extended to Hougang Int (St 21) with the introduction of 63 that will termiante at Rumah Tinggi ter.<br>74 was extended to Upp Serangoon Rd End Ter in late 1988.<br>97 was being amended to Jurong East Int when the interchange kicks off operation in 1986.<br>111 was extended to Ghim Moh in the early 1990s.<br>132 was extended to Hougang Int (St 21) in the late 1980s.<br>147 was extended to Upp Serangoon Rd Ter in the early 1990s, with the merger of Service 83.<br>151 was introduced as Hougang to Kent Ridge Ter service<br>153 was amended to serve Bt Merah Ctrl in 1992 instead of Henderson Rd<br>322 was amended to ply along Hougang St 61 in 1986.<br><br>A new interchange was planned at Hougang Central. As the existing bus interchange in Hougang St 21 does not have enough boarding space to accomodate more services, the latter had to be terminated at the new interchange instead. Upp Serangoon Rd End Ter was acquired for future developments and services that terminate at the terminal had no choice but have to re-amended all its routings.<br><br>By end 1994, the Hougang Central Interchange was completed. All the exising Upp Serangoon Rd End Ter  services terminate at the new int. The existing interchange in Hougang St 21 was renamed as Hougang South Int, so as not to confuse between the 2 interchanges bearing the same estate.<br><br>Service 97, 111 and 165 was also being amended to Hougang Ctrl.<br><br>- Services at Hougang Ctrl Int -<br>74 - To Buona Vista<br>84 - To WTC<br>97 - To Jurong East<br>111 - To Ghim Moh<br>136 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>147 - To Clementi<br>153 - To Bt Merah<br>165 - To Clementi<br>325 - To Hougang St 51 (Loop)<br><br>- Services at Hougang South Int -<br>51 - To Jurong East<br>62 - To New Bridge Rd<br>132 - To Bt Merah<br>151 - To Kent Ridge<br>321 - To Upp Paya Lebar Rd (Loop)<br>322 - To Hougang St 61 (Loop)<br>323 - To Defu Ave 1 (Loop)<br>326 - To Hougang Ave 6 (Loop)<br>327 - To Hougang Ave 7 (Loop)<br>328 - To Hougang Ave 8 (Loop)<br><br>- Changes after 1994 -<br>27 - Extends to Hougang Ctrl Int on end 2002 running via Buangkok.<br>51 - Amended to ply Pandan Gdns in 2002 and extends to Hougang Ctrl int on 15 feb 2004 when the Hougang South int closed.<br>62 - Re-routed to form Punggol to Lor 1 Geylang loop svc under NEL Rationalisation<br>80 - New Service between Tampines to Hougang Ctrl.
