Its just a plain feeder that serves from Woodlands Bus Int to Woodlands St 32 (Loop). However, this service has only one directional route, which was Woodlands Ave 1 and Woodlands Ave 3 (there wasn't Woodlands St 41 back then). Don't forget that 903 was the former 372.<br><br>M1 and M2 was the first client bus service to receive the Darts.<br><br>As for the old Nissan Civilian (SBS8000Z - SBS8003R), it first served on Service 403 but at the end, it was frequently used on different Shuttle Services, such as the Orchid Country Club Shuttle.<br><br>=============================================================<br>SBS7382C said:<br>"CRBs did 21 before also....btw 59 is the old 59 or is it the current 59?"<br>=============================================================<br>The old 59, NAC generation<br><br>=============================================================<br>Gus.chong said:<br>Maybe Ulu Pandan and Jurong are near to each other... and 188 was amended to Jurong West St 91 like 175 and withdrawn in 1991.<br>=============================================================<br>Both 175 and 188 were withdrawn on 20th Jan 1991, with the amendments of sv 99 to Jurong West Ave 5 &amp; St 72.<br><br>=============================================================<br>TIB657M said:<br>"Don't have 366 lahx.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>===== GHIM MOH BUS TERMINAL HISTORY =====<br><br>Wayback in 1977, the Ghim Moh Bus Terminal is situated along Ghim Moh Rd, as a roadside terminal. It is also the last few roadside terminal to be existed in SBS, the another is at Sims Place Bus Terminal.<br><br>There were only 2 services serving at the terminal for a start, Service 13 from Kg Chai Chee and Service 20 also from Kg Chai Chee. Service 13 uses Changi Rd, Geylang Rd, Crawford St, North Bridge Rd &amp; Orchard Rd while Service 20 uses Siglap Rd, Fidelio St, Aida St, Bras Basah Rd and Shenton Way. When Chai Chee Ter closed in 1985, they were both amended to Bedok Int together.<br><br>In Feb 1982, the terminus was a controversy as a "dangerous site", as the two-way minor roads converge near a sharp bend. As this terminal can accomodate a max capacity of 4 buses and as observed by ST readers, there were 8 or more buses waiting abreast on AM Peak and PM Peak hours. It was known that the Ghim Moh Ter was a temporary measure and they were hoping that an alternative site would be explored by the authorities, the PWD and the SBS.<br><br>Secondly, it was also pointed out that the buses also reverse inside the car park outside Blk 9 and near the Refuse Chute Centre, where there are rubbish collectors pushing heavy refuse carriers and pedestrians crossing the road.<br><br>It was never a success for an offer on an alternative site for Ghim Moh Bus Terminal. A bus bay in front of Blk 9 was chosen as a boarding berth. Earlier plans including the abolishment of Ghim Moh Terminal was not a good idea and terminal should remain so that direct services could continue to serve the Ghim Moh Estate. Hedges were planted to prevent jaywalkers from entering the turning bay.<br><br>(The main reason is there are no ample land space for this terminal to be relocated as an alternative site)<br><br><br>Service 13 was amended to Yio Chu Kang<br>Service 20 was withdrawn in Dec 1990 as part of the MRT Rationalisaiton.<br>Service 92 renumbered from Setvice M1, and was amended to terminate at Ghim Moh Ter<br>Service 100 was extended to Ghim Moh from WTC<br>Sercice 111 was amended to Ghim Moh instead of Buona Vista Ter. It was then extended to Hougang Ctrl in Dec 1994. This service was then shortened to loop at Marina Centre on 27th July 2003.<br><br>============================================================<br><br>===== BUONA VISTA BUS TERMINAL HISTORY =====<br><br>The new Buona Vista Bus Terminal was erected in 1983/84 (also known as North Buona Vista Bus Terminal, as it is situated at North Buona Vista Rd), to accomodate the services that previously terminates at Commonwealth Ave roadside Terminal. SBS has already in the midst of phasing out its roadside terminal to avoid any accident or unneccessary road conditions, where alternative site were still undergoing exploration. As for Ghim Moh Terminal &amp; Sims Place Terminal, it cannot be abolished as there are still resdients who needs the direct services from their homes.<br><br>(Do not mix up with Commonwealth Ave Terminal as Commonwealth Dr Terminal)<br><br>Buona Vista Bus Terminal is just a bus bay, with the alighting and boarding activities situated at a pair of bus stop along Holland Dr and Commonwealth Ave as a secondary boarding points (buses would exit the terminal via North Buona Vista Rd before turning left to Commonwaelth Ave). Passengers would alight at Blk 46 as the last stop and boards at Blk 10A. As for some services like 32 and 145, its boarding point is at Commonwealth Ave, Blk 43.<br><br>===== BUONA VISTA SERVICES (THEN &amp; NOW) =====<br><br>As Buona Vista Bus Services are at close approximate to the Commonwealth Ave Terminal, all of its services were then terminated at Buona Vista Bus Terminal.<br><br>BACK THEN...<br>2 - Buona Vista to Changi Village<br>12 - Buona Vista to Somapah<br>57 - Buona Vista to Changi Airport<br>90 - Buona Vista to Paya Lebar Airport<br>103 - Buona Vista to Jln Kayu<br>106 - Buona Vista to Serangoon Gardens<br>111 - Buona Vista to Hougang<br>112 - Buona Vista to Shenton Way<br>148 - Buona Vista to Toa Payoh<br>189 - Buona Vista to Empress Place<br>212 - Buona Vista to S'pore Polytechnic (Dover Rd)<br>C - Buona Vista to National Stadium (only operates during football matches)<br><br>NOW WE HAVE...<br>32 - Buona vista to Bedok<br>48 - Buona Vista to Upp East Coast<br>74 - Buona Vista to Hougang Ctrl<br>74e - Buona Vista to Hougang Ctrl (FFW Service)<br>91 - Buona Vista to Ayer Rajah Cers (Loop)<br>145 - Buona vista to Toa payoh<br>185 - Buona Vista to Soon Lee Depot<br>191 - Buona Vista to Portsdown Rd (Loop)<br>200 - Buona Vista to Kent Ridge Ter (Loop)<br><br>As time pass, there were several major changes in the Buona Vista Services. Some were amended and withdrawn within the past 25 years.<br><br>ITS AMENDMENTS...<br>2 - Cutback to New Bridge Rd due to MRT Rationalisation.<br>12 - Extended to Pasir Ris and at the same time terminate at New Bridge Rd.<br>48 - New Service from Buona Vista to Upp East Coast<br>57 - Service withdrawal<br>74 - Merged with 202 and amended to Buona Vista Ter.<br>90 - Service withdrawal<br>91 - Introduced as Buona Vista to Ayer Rajah Cres (Loop)<br>95 - Introduced as Buona Vista to Lower Kent Ridge Rd (Loop).

              <p><br>By right if 980 were to end up like 178 it would have gotten back a full lance fleet with random cameos at will though. But now WLDEP will chip in duties on weekends to make up the lost fleets from AMDEP. So don't be surprised if you see TIB 793C,794A coming on 980 though.</p>
              <p>980 kena OC but only from AMDEP. And we will leave it at that.</p>

              <p><br>Yes.. As for UDs normally serve on 178 (sometimes or less often it appears on 187 and 852). Since UDs are axed out from 75, 920, 961, it can only serve 178, 187 and 852. Nothing else.</p>

              <p>============================================================<br><strong>ST MICHAEL'S BUS SERVICE HISTORY</strong><br>============================================================<br>St Michael's Ter was once known as Whampoa Rd Terminal.<br><br>Its beginnings...<br>Back to the 1960s, STC was the only company that controls the bus services served in Toa Payoh/Kim Keat/ St Michael's Estates. There were only 2 services, STC 10A and STC 14A, back then. Although its HDB flats are sprunging up and parts of Toa Payoh/St Michael's was still a shanty town, it is not densely populated though, but its bus services were just its humble beginnings.<br><br>STC 10A - Jln Aman to Neil Rd<br>STC 14A - Jln Aman to Shenton Way<br><br>If you realise that it terminates at Jln Aman, this was its first bus terminus at St Michael's Estate. It was located at the now-demolished Blk 18/19/24 and at the mid-point of Jln Tenetram, facing Blk 22.<br>============================================================<br>1971 Re-organisation...<br>On 11th Apr 1971, which is a big day of the re-organisation, a new set of bus services were catered to St Michael's Estate, to have more choices for passengers travelling from the estate to other urban areas. There was only one ABC <br>service - 122 - which serves from St Michael's Est to C'welath Ave/North Buona Vista Rd. The rest was from STC.<br><br>Services by STC:<br>120 - St Michael's Est - Prince Edward Rd - via Connaught Dr/Coller Quay<br>120A - St Michael's Est - Stamford Rd (Loop) - it was known that it extended to Prince Edward Rd to join 120<br>121 - St Michael's Est - Prince Edward Rd - via Bras Basah Rd/North Bridge Rd/South Bridge Rd<br>123 - St Michael's Est - South canal Rd<br>124 - St Michael's Est - Kampong Bahru Rd/Keppel Rd<br>125 - St Michael's Est - Alexandra Rd/Pasir panjang Rd.<br>126 - St Michael's Est - New Bridge Rd (Loop) - it was introduced later that year</p>
              <p>Service by ABC:<br>122 - St Micahel's Est - C'wealth Ave/North Buona Vista Rd.<br>============================================================<br>The day STC had fallen out...<br>When STC loses its bus operating licence on 1st Dec 1971, its bus services were handed over to ABC, ABS and UBC, the 3 amalgamted Chinese bus companies. (Do note that STC was still around at that time, but it can only handle shareholders of STC and host Annual General Meeting for STC)<br><br>120/120A - ABS<br>121 - ABC<br>123 - Yellow<br>124 - ABC<br>125 - UBC<br>126 - UBC<br><br>All of its services became part of SBS on 1st November 1973.<br>============================================================<br>1974 Bus Rationalisation...<br>Although St Michael's Est was not adversely affected within its estate, there were several minor changes made outside of St Michael's Est. This move would reduce duplication of its services and wasteless diversions.<br><br>1) 121 was withdrawn.<br>2) 120/120A was renumbered to 120<br>3) 120 to by pass Stamford Rd, Waterloo St, Bras Basah Rd<br>4) 125 to reside its terminus from Havelock Rd to Jln Bt Merah (near Lower Delta Rd)<br>============================================================<br>CITY SHUTTLE SERVICES HAS GONE TO St MICHAELS ESTATE<br>CSS No 3 and CSS No 7 by SSB had been extended to serve the Wahmpoa Rd (St Michael's Estate), to bring residents to the CBD and Orchard Rd, due to the feebacks collected by commuters of CSS that it should be extended to call at popular HDB estate.<br><br>(The SBS terminus at Jln Aman is still around at that time)<br>============================================================<br>Overall in the late 70's...<br>120 - St Micahel's Est - Prince Edward Rd<br>122 - St Michael's Est - C'wealth Ave<br>123 - St Michael's Est - New Bridge Rd<br>124 - St Michael's Est - Telok Blangah Rise<br>125 - St Michael's Est - Jln Bt Merah<br>126 - St Michael's Est - New Bridge Rd<br><br>If you do notice, St Michael's Bus Service, fell under the Service 12x category.<br>============================================================<br>Whampoa Rd Terminal (aka St Michael's Terminal)<br>Somewhere around 1984/85, its bus services will have to move out once the terminal at Whampoa Rd has been completed. The former terminal at Jln Aman was a roadside terminal and SBS was in a midst of phasing out roadside terminal as it would cause an accident and raised safety concerns.<br><br>All of its bus service in Whampoa Rd Terminal will have to ply the loop route along Whampoa Rd, Jln Bahagia and Jln Tenteram.<br><br>Soon after, SBS Services joined in the 2 CSS services that terminates at Whampoa Rd.<br>============================================================<br>Services that used to or currently terminating at St Michael's Ter (Current Services are marked in Bold)<br>4 - Tampines to St Michael's [Originally from Bedok to St Michael's.

              <p><br>Yes.. As for UDs normally serve on 178 (sometimes or less often it appears on 187 and 852). Since UDs are axed out from 75, 920, 961, it can only serve 178, 187 and 852. Nothing else.</p>
