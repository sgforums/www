              <p><br>Macpherson Terminal is currently the carpark outside the FC at Blk 79A/79. back then Circuit Link was non-existant so all services have to enter/exit the estate thru Merpati/Matter Rd.</p>
              <p>Potong Pasir Terminal is along Ave 3 where Blk 138 is.</p>
              <p>South Canal Terminal is at South Canal Rd in between Nth/South Canal Rds outside OCBC Ctr. Noticed South Canal Rd from 2 lanes suddenly widen out to 4?</p>
              <p>Upp Serangoon Terminal is located near the current Serangoon Sec.</p>

              <p><br>Think so. Remembered service 157 used to have Volvo MK3s when converted to PAC in 1993, together with the Leyland Alanteans. When handed over to JRBP (now SLBP), the Merc WAs replaced the Volvo MK3s and the LO2x replaced the LAs on service 157.</p>
              <p>Service 174 was once full BBDEP too and it was the 1st SBS service to be introduced with NAC Volvo MK2 WAs when new in 1998. Handed over to full JRBP in 1993 and NAC 0405s replaced the MK2s.</p>

              <p>I used to drive service 174 and 190. Some of the buses which I had my hands on was SBS1696, 1704 and SBS487.</p>
              <p>When I started driving 174, all the buses were parked at bbdep. Service 174 was later assigned to jurong bus park, followed by service 157. And bbdep took 187 and 198. I was not a bus driver yet when service 174 was plying NTU and New Bridge Road.</p>
              <p>Yes, you are right. Volvo B10M MkII were used on service 157. The old Atlantean were terrible, heard from other bus drivers that they often overheat, and the acceleration is terrible.</p>
              <p>I do not know about now, but during that time jurong bus park beside AYE and the one at Penjuru were under the same group management at bbdep. So sometimes I also get to drive service 66.</p>

              <p>When 188 was intoduced, it was under JRBP group, instead of BBDEP since BBDEP controls all of CCK services. It was mainly made up of LO2xs and Merczs. I saw SBS7120S, some LO2xs and some Merczs. SBS453C was also one of permers. After handover to TIBS, 188 became FAC, whereas SBS7120S went back to serve 335, not sure about the other redeployment of buses. </p>
              <p> Is it not enough space for BBDEP to control 188?</p>

              <p>During that time all the buses serving 188 were parked in jrbp, just like buses serving service 77 which were parked at arbp instead of bbdep.</p>
              <p>bbdep used to be very crowded when it was still operating the CCK, Bt Batok and Bt Panjang routes.</p>

              <p>Punggol Road End Terminal ceased operations during the NEL rationalisation in 2003. As for Delta Terminal, it ceased operations in the mid 1980s. Somapah Terminal ceased operations in 1989.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, when SBS was formed in 1973, I think it had been there for the routes in the Northern regions, probably for services in Woodlands, like 169, 178, 180, 181, 182, 372. Not sure about 160, 161, 164, 167 and 171.</p>
              <p>Talking about 164, is there a SBS Hino demonstrator in service 164 before???</p>
              <p>And what are the official dates of TIBS taking over 160, 161, 164, 167, 169, 178, 180, 181, 182 and 372 in the 1980s???</p>

              <p>171 initally uses Mercedes Benz OF1417s with Hawke bodies in the 1980s and early 1990s. Probably there was a few "cameos" of OF 1417s with NZB bodies for a short period of time. Then the Mercedes Benz O405 non air con and air con buses took over the OF1417s in the mid 1990s. They are usually parked in the extreme corner of the parking lots of Yishun Interchange,now where the bendy buses are parked now. Remembered seeing the O405s doing a full steering lock to the left and how extreme the front wheels turned as they reversed out.</p>
              <p>Even 171 in the Nee Soon terminal days, I doubt there are double deckers on the service. But 169 have double deckers during SBS days.</p>
