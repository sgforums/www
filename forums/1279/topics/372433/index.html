              <p><strong>Depots of the 1970s and 1980s.</strong> <br><br>Here i will trace the orgins of Bt batok depot.</p>
              <p>In the 1970s after they have formed the three bus companies UBC (Northern region region), ABS ( Eastern region) , ABC (including Hock lee) Western region, bus depots used were mianly from these 3 chiense bus co.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also to note the depot were from the past bus company themselves who were united into the 3 companies</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for example hock :Lee's Alexandra depot was big so ABC used it to "depot the buses".</p>
              <p>in 1978 SBS was formed and the three ABC ABS and UBC united into the SBS.</p>
              <p>Alexandra Depot survived on. SBS then named bus fleets according to depots. 1xxx in particular was assigned to Alexandra Depot premises buses. most were Albions. <br><br>In 1983 or so Alexandra depot closed down and a new depot was ready. This was Bt batok Depot. its extra prkaing space counterpart AYBP was ready in 1989.</p>
              <p>"For historical reasons, svc 14 is with AYBP:" _Service_238</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let me explain 14 was then under ABC. While during ABC time , the 14 is called 190. ABC uses the Hock lee depot . This is ALDEP. ALDEP. much later was absolved into BBDEP. however in 1989 when AYBP was opened, svc 14 still served Bt merah &lt;&gt; Somapah Int. (maybe moved to some other Bedok place). being of less running times, the 14 was shifted to AYBP.  As such till today 14 stays under AYBP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One cna similairly figure out the orgins of other bus services and depots. <br>Some key facts to consider<br>- ABC UBC ABS service? if service was formed in 1969 consider UBC northern ABC eastern ABS western.</p>
              <p>- Bus fleets from the chiense companies majority of them stayed within their regions. i do not say that a few were scattered around</p>
              <p>- Depot Bus rego system</p>
              <p>_ new depots that tok over from the ex chiense bus companies depots in 1980s or late 70s.</p>
              <p>Hypotehsis: Svc 145 will never be never be with AYBP.<br>Proof: Svc 145 is a evolved from of a orginal gen svc 145. then 145 (Circa 1969)  was under UBC. it is noteowrthy much later after UBC days were over, that most TPY svcs were under TPDEP then. This happens to be todays BRAM. having been ex UBC it was good and easy to keep the bus under a "UBC depot like TPY". by 1970s.</p>
              <p>As such 145 survived thru the years under TPDEP or BRAM.  Till today 145 retains its UBC roots under BRAM. 145 was never a ABC svc.</p>
              <p>just a possibly new way of looking at depot deployment history.</p>

              <p>yes your theory is likely correct. JRDEP the Penjurur bus park hereby temp  known as PJRBP took care of Clementi. when it was a wee brand new town. Svc 78 and 176 recived new new OF1417s under PJRBP. of coruse PJRBP was just a bus aprk, if bus b.d go JRDEP pls.</p>
              <p>again BBDEP was nearest to jurong East hecne a good control then.</p>
              <p>the PJRDEP pradox also incldues the fact that West Coast rd was the only road leading straight to the depot from Clementi Rd/ pasir panjang ter. hence 33 also PJRBP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by the 1990s things pretty much are the same with BBDEp controlling bits of Jurong East</p>
              <p>Boon lay was being built and jRDEp handles it.</p>
              <p>kent ridge still under PJRBP</p>

                  (Circa 1969)  was under UBC. it is noteowrthy much later after
                  UBC days were over, that most TPY svcs were under TPDEP then. This
                  happens to be todays BRAM. having been ex UBC it was good and easy
                  to keep the bus under a "UBC depot like TPY". by 1970s.</p>
                  <p>As such 145 survived thru the years under TPDEP or BRAM. 
                  Till today 145 retains its UBC roots under BRAM. 145 was never a
                  ABC svc.</p>
                  <p>just a possibly new way of looking at depot deployment

                  but then before UBC took over the operation of Service 145 at the end of 1971, this service was previously fall under the group of STC (until it closed down its operations at the end of the same particluar year).<br><br>Several of those ex-STC services were distributed to the 3 chinese bus companies, mainly ABC, ABS &amp; UBC. Only a few routes of STC were handed over to ABC.

              <p><br>Think so. Remembered service 157 used to have Volvo MK3s when converted to PAC in 1993, together with the Leyland Alanteans. When handed over to JRBP (now SLBP), the Merc WAs replaced the Volvo MK3s and the LO2x replaced the LAs on service 157.</p>
              <p>Service 174 was once full BBDEP too and it was the 1st SBS service to be introduced with NAC Volvo MK2 WAs when new in 1998. Handed over to full JRBP in 1993 and NAC 0405s replaced the MK2s.</p>

              <p>9819Y perm brbp 143 from bndep 31, 9012H moved over to slbp 143 to replace 9017U which then came over to amdep as SP. In this round, amdep got extra one bus.</p>
              <p>9000S was replaced by 9830M from brbp 31 which received 9120D from arbp 10.</p>
              <p>9000S went over to slbp slightly earlier than 9012H. That was when brbp started to add B10TLs to 143 in that period of time.</p>

              <p>It was in 1990 when Clementi routes came under BB. Albion Vikings and subsequently Volvo B57s and MK2s were deployed on Clementi short haul services.</p>
              <p>I also remembered service 105 under BB group when newly introduced in 1988 - with Albion Viking, Volvo B57 followed by Volvo MK2s. Then came under AM group in 1990 with Merc OF1417 Hawke. LAs was also introduced on service 105 until in 1992 the route was diverted to Lorong Chuan, service 105's fleets became a NAC MB0405 fleet.</p>
