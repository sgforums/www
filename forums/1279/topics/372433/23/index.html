              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Service 163 now and then</strong></span></p>
              <p>I used to stay in Teachers' Estate along Upp Thomon Road since 1993, remembered the bus services that passed by my house was SBS service 163 and other Tibs services. There was no bus services that had aircon buses at that time other than service 825. At that time I always loved to travel on service 163 than other Tibs buses as the fleet was more modern even though it is a full fleet of NAC MB0405 buses. Have even looked forward to service 163 converting to PAC too. My sis also depended on this service to school.</p>
              <p>In Apr 1994 SBST introduced a FAC service 138 from YCK to Zoo, had also enjoyed the ride too as it was the 1st bus service with aircon fleets to pass thru my place at that time. Later that year service 163 was <strong>converted to PAC</strong>. Remembered my 1st aircon 163 ride from Toa Payoh back to my home, rego was SBS114G.</p>
              <p>Service 163 went thru another upgrade in Jul 1995 when it <strong>became FAC</strong>. SBS82P was one of the perms. That was the last time ever a NAC bus to operate on service 163. Not long after in Dec 1995, service 163 was handed over to Tibs, <strong>OAC Scania Striders</strong> were introduced. In Nov 1998 service 163 got the 1st batch of <strong>new Dennis Lance fleets</strong>.</p>
              <p>In Dec 1999 service 163 was handed back to SBS with mainly CAC MB0405s. SBS576G and SBS3832Y were one of the few perms.</p>
              <p>Dec 2002 marked another history for service 163 when the route was <strong>extended to Sengkang</strong>. I was plased to have a direct service to Sengkang from my place. Service 163 came under full HGDEP control, as such the fleet had a minor upgrade from MB0405 fleet to <strong>Volvo MK3/MK4 fleet</strong>. That was also the 1st time when Volvo MK4s passed thru my house, I went for a few joyrides on the MK4 Striders and DM3500s.</p>
              <p>In 2005 <strong>SBS1688K</strong> became service 163 permer after service 84 (Punggol estate temporary service) was withdrawn. This is the 2nd SBST demonstrator to be deployed to service 163 after SBS3572Y which was once perm service 163 during the early Marina Centre days.</p>
              <p>I shifted from Teachers' Estate to Seletar Hills Estate in Mar 2008 when the place underwent EnBloc. At my new location I can still depend on service 163 from Fernvale to other locations like Thomson Plaza and Toa Payoh.</p>
              <p>In May 2008 service 163 underwent fleet upgrade to new Euro 4 <strong>K230UB fleets</strong>. Ever since then I had always enjoyed riding on the new buses from my place. Things turn better when more new Euro 5s had been added in this year, making service 163 now having 2/3 K230UB fleet.</p>
              <p>Till then have also been looking forward to service 163 having a full K230UB fleet (less SBS1688K) and also becoming a WAB service, maybe in near future?</p>

              <p><br>I'm certain that 192 never made an appearance in Princess Elizabeth. Its route covered South Canal, Pasir Panjang and eventually to Jurong. 193 came to end at Princess Elizabeth after having its route cut short from Bukit Panjang Circus around 1981. An interesting point for sv. 193 was that it had once served two 'royalties', its route displayed Princess Elizabeth at one end and Prince Edward on the other. This happened after services at Anson Rd terminal was shifted to new facilities at Prince Edward Rd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>173 was the 'pioneer' service for Princess Elizabeth and, as pointed out by 8533C, could've started operations in the pre-SBS era of the early 1970s.</p>

              <p><br>i second your thoughts. However, one has tot ake note that 192 may had been operated from Ewart. or at least a certain 192A in 1972 or so.</p>

              <p>my ten cents worth on the debutant AIr-Con bus fleets.</p>
              <p>- Leyland Victory</p>
              <p>&gt; Converted by Soon Chow folks with the aim of reducing the engine noise and metal rattle for the bus. Also provide nice comfort to paxs with Air-con. at SBS, theorghout the 1980s, it was always reducing metal noise and engine roars. I guess they wanted their final 'victory" with this conversion of the leyland victories which were indeed loud and fatige to drivers.</p>
              <p>They were presented on svcs 76  3 and some say 118.</p>
              <p>- Mercedes Benz O303<br>When SABS was a venture into airport express type services to hotles from then paya lebar airport in 1970s. in 1981 changi airport open. by 1982 SABS was failing to meet the airport express as demand drops a lot. taxis and buses (CAS services) were cheaper altho no AC&gt; <br>As a result the poor SABS fleet wwas sold to SBS.</p>
              <p>at which pt SBS introduce sv 168</p>
              <p>the buses were withdrawn in 1993 i guess. id id see one on 196 then.</p>
              <p>- Volvo B10M Vanhool demonstrator</p>
              <p>a nice gift. the bus was deployed on 118.</p>
              <p>- Nissan Diesel U31</p>
              <p>probably happy with SBS2452 demonstration, SBS bought some 30 or so of these AC buses. they were place on 118. and later 3</p>
              <p>Renault PR 100.2</p>
              <p>at first glance i thought the bus was some soon chow merc with AC unti and a nice modern looking front. i held that thought until the 1996 bus handbook by danny chan scolded me for being a dumb guy - i mean they say it is a renault. (hahaha). i only seen it in person but never rode it. my pranets did mange to spot it (sayangs  SBS30 on sv 3 ticket)</p>
              <p>the bus did sv 3 for a few months and left.</p>

              <p>Let me contribute the history of Woodlands Bus Services.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that you all know that Woodlands Bus Services were started by SBS in the early 1980s.<br><br>In the humble days of Woodlands Bus Services pre-dominantly in the 1970s, only service 169, 180, 182 and 208 plys from a small bus terminal in Admiralty Rd. Service 169 goes from Admiralty Rd and Marsiling Dr and continues its route to Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 via Admiralty Rd West. Services 180, 182 and 208 plys from Admiralty Rd and pass through Woodlands Town Centre.<br><br>Service 178 and 181 was believed to have been extended to Admiralty Rd terminal for a very short while in 1980 after it was being amended to call at Woodlands Bus Interhcange.<br><br>The Woodlands Bus Interchange was opened on 29 Nov 1981. Services 169, 178, 181, 204 and 208 were called at the new Interchange. Service 204 was the first service that called from the Woodlands Interchange (it was neither introduced from Admiralty Rd, and the service goes to the Sg Kadut Industral Estate, when the industrial estate is developed to resettle several existing factories from nearby rural areas).

              <p><br>heh 183   i recall seeing the service serving Upper Ayaer rajah rd. Where it goes not very sure. current assumption is Jurong ind est then AYE and then telok Bl;anagh rd vefore Chiantown.</p>
              <p>200 - yes indeed. the service ended all the way up at Bt Pnajang Village. Poor service was cut short many times. At one time it even served to Holland rd and queesnway junction.</p>
              <p>200 descended from the Chinese Bus Company Easy Bus which operated a set of bus routes in the South Bouna Vista rd, portsodwn rd  and Clementi rd area.</p>
              <p>209 orignsated from the Jurong Ind services. grouped with the odler 202 203 204 etc, this service served to town via the Holland rd sector.</p>
              <p>Much later poor 209 was cut short as during the late 1970s and 180s, SBS made many mnay route rationlaisation to develop a btter bus netowrk. sv 209 was cut short to terminate at Ulu pandan HDB car park terminal. it was finally made to terminate at Clementi int when the int open.</p>
              <p>i have fond memeories of watching the OF1417s on 209 going by alg Clementi Ave 5 while visiting my auties provision shop next to some orange docotr clinic at blk 34?</p>
              <p>209 was later withdrawn. MRT? i guess so.</p>

              <p>How many air con Hinos HT238Ks and Nissan UDs were there in TIBS fleet in the late 1980s??? When they were derigistered, mid 1990s??? Since when and how long did the air con Nissans did on 852???</p>
              <p>When SBS was on the operations in Woodlands, was it Ang Mo Kio, Woodlands or Ayer Rajah depot controlled or a combination of them???</p>
              <p>Not to forget some of the SBS NZB bodied Mercedes Benz OF1417s were painted into TIBS colors to serve SS7 because TIBS had a shortage of buses back then. Think it happened in 1989 to 1990.</p>
              <p>Maybe next to go is to Hougang South/Central and Punngol bus services history. :)</p>

              <p>I remembered for West St 91, 175 was made to loop there with amendment to serve up to Bt Batok only. Poor 173 as well, no more to CBD.</p>
              <p>Gotta look in this light, Jurong was quite big, so it's natural for O305 to be deployed on high demand svs being e king of double deck capacity tat time.</p>

              <p>Questions about Volvo B57s:</p>
              <p>3. Was there a B57 being converted to a full air con bus before??? If so, which bus (rego) was it??? Which depot did the modifications and it was based in which depot??? Which service it ran before???</p>

              <p>good question indeed. as stated in BUSWAY, about 10 units of B57 were converted to driver AC cabin only,. glass plexiglass panels were built round the driver area and a very lau kok air-con unit much like odl sch offices using was built. no full conversion of bus. weird in the sense that the driver gets the AC but not the paxs!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also to note i have spotted b57 with seat furbishment (to mark 2 style seats). these were the first few noticable interior refubishments of SBS. (whole seat changing). compelte with black rubber seat  grip of the 1990 mark 2 styles. and blue cushions...</p>

              <p>From RK 2010:<br>"How did Bukit Merah services, Clementi services and Kent Ridge services came about?"<br><br>============================================================<br><br>In the past, Bukit Merah Services terminates at two different terminals. One at Gagak Selari Barat (now known as Jln Bukit Merah) and the another at Redhill Close. Kent Ridge services terminate at Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd) ans South Buona Vista Rd (sv 200). Clementi Services were introduced in 1978 after certain parts of Clementi New Town were developed.<br><br>Below shows the list of the services after the 1971 re-organatisation<br><br>- Services from Gagak Selari Barat (Jln Bukit Merah) -<br>63 - To MacPherson Est<br>65 - To MacPherson Est<br>90 - To Paya Lebar Airport<br>92 - To Paya Lebar Airport<br>93A - To Paya Lebar Airport (was later introduced)<br>153 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>195 - Loops at this terminal from Crawford<br>196 - To Jurong Shipyard<br><br>- Services from Redhill Close -<br>41 - To Telok Kurau<br>41A - To Joo Chiat Rd<br><br>- Services from Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd) -<br>33 - To Changi Rd (near Siglap Rd)<br>145 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>146 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>192A - To South Canal<br>201 - To Jln Jurong Kechil<br><br>- Services from South Buona Vista Rd -<br>200 - To Up Bt Timah Rd (10 ms)<br><br>During the 1974 rationalisation, certain alternate routes were withdrawn to aviod duplication of existing service that ply on the same route.<br><br>90 - To by pass Paya Lebar Rd<br>92 - Amended to ply at the Jln Bukit Merah Terminus (near Rumah Bomba Circus)<br>93A - Service withdrawal<br>192A - Renumbered to 192<br>196 - Amended to Prince Edward Rd<br>200 - Amended to Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd)<br>201 - Amended to Toh Tuck Rd with integration of former 207.<br><br>Now let's emphasise about the late 1970s till the 1980s of the Bt maerh, Kent Ridge &amp; Clementi Services<br><br>Bukit Merah Services were quite sketchy in the past, compared to the 1971 re-organisation. They were terminating in different parts of Jln Bukit Merah like Service 50 from Kaki Bukit Malay Settlement (Jln Eunos) to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd) and Service 65 from MacPherson to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd). Those services were clustered in different locations making it inconvenient for other passengers, which began a critical point to re-organise its Bt Merah services into one interchange, so the need of a centralised bus service hub is needed for Bukit Merah. The Bukit Merah Interchange was completed and commence operations in 1980.<br><br>Kent Ridge Services were termianted in a new location at Clementi Rd, previous location was at Pasir Panjang Rd, which is known as the Kent Ridge Ter on which the name 'Kent Ridge' was taken from the NUS Kent Ridge Campus as well as the proposed Kent Ridge Hospital (now known as NUH).<br><br>Clementi Services has a terminal at Clementi Ave 3 (Os Blk 437), which temporary houses the Clementi Services including feeder 284 as the new interchange is still under construction. It was a roadside terminal as well. The bus interchange was completed in 1984.<br><br>More feeders were added for the Bukit Merah and Clementi areas. This allows residents from both estates to have direct and convenient links to the town centres of Bukit Mearh  &amp; Clementi rather than taking its regular trunk services to get around and a walking distance just to get to the town centres. Off peak wastage could be a possible reason as to why certain services are taking a long time to arrive at the bus stops.<br><br>- List of services in Bt Merah [brackets denote previous termination point] -<br>14 - To Somapah [previously from Mei Chin Rd]<br>16 - To Marine Terrace [previously from Telok Blangah Heights]<br>41 - To Bedok [previously from Redhill Close, was amended later in 1985]<br>44 - To Chai Chee Ter [previously from Redhill Close, was later withdrawn]<br>50 - To Jln Eunos [previously from Jln Bukit Merah (Henderson Rd)]<br>125 - To St Michael's Est [previously from Telok Blangah Way]<br>132 - To Ang Mo Kio [previously loops at Tomlinson Rd from Ang Mo Kio]<br>139 - To Toa Payoh [previously from Jln Bukit Merah (Henderson Rd)]<br>153 - To Toa Payoh [previously from Jln Bukit Merah (Henderson Rd)]<br>184 - To Jurong [previously from Telok Blangah Way]<br>271 - To Telok Blangah Cres (Loop)<br>272 - To Telok Blangah Way (Loop)<br>273 - To Telok Blangah Heights (Loop)<br>274 - To Depot Rd (Loop)<br>275 - To Bt Purmei Ave (Loop)<br>850 (TIBS) - To Yishun<br>851 (TIBS) - To Yishun<br>CSS 8 - To Bedok [Re-routed to HDB new town instead of plying around the city area]<br><br>- List of services in Kent Ridge Ter -<br>33 - To Chai Chee [was extended to Bedok in mid-1984 when Chai Chee Ter closed]<br>145 - To Toa Payoh<br>200 - To Jln Anak Bukit (Loop)<br>201 - To Jln Anak Bukit (Loop)<br>216 - To C'wealth Ave (Loop)<br><br>- List of services in Clementi in the late 1970s -<br>74 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>176 - To Crawford St<br>185 - To C'wealth Ave<br>186 - To Anson Rd<br>191 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>209 - To Crawford St<br>284 - To Clementi Ave 4 (Loop)<br><br>- List of services in Clementi in 1985 -<br>74 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>75 - To Empress Place (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>76 - To Jurong East Ave 1 (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>92 - To Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) [extended from Alexandra Rd]<br>95 - To Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) [extended from Ulu Pandan Ter]<br>96 - To Kent Ridge Cres (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>146 - To Toa Payoh [extended from Pasir Panjang Rd]<br>186 - To Shenton Way [extended from Anson Rd]<br>205 - To Jalan Anak Bukit (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>209 - To Crawford St<br>282 - To Clementi Ave 5 (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>284 - To Clementi Ave 4 (Loop)<br>285 - To Pandan Loop (Loop) [newly introduced<br>287 - To Clementi Ave 2 (Loop) [newly introudced]<br><br>Here are the Bukit Merah, Clementi &amp; kent Ridge services that were introduced/amended/withdrawn from the 1980s to present.<br><br>In Bukit Merah<br>5 - Service introduced as Bukit Merah to Pasir Ris on 11 Mar 2007<br>14 - Service extends to Changi Village Ter when Somapah ter closed and later on cutback to Bedok.

              <p>Thanks for all the info about Jurong East bus services history.</p>
              <p>So there were no bus services before 1981 in Jurong East???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, maybe we can talk about Eunos, the old Malay Settlement Village, since it's Hari Raya.</p>

              <p><br>no man . no services in Jurong east simply because Jurong East did not exist yet then.</p>

              <p>Should be late 1970s. The earliest if not wrong was a SBS - Blue Arrow service in the late 1970s</p>
              <p>But I suspect e road network over there tat time was not developed until the 1980s w/ Toh Tuck Ave</p>

              <p><strong>ALS and CSS</strong></p>
              <p>the ALs scheme was introduce in 1975 to try to 'lower down car population and reduce no of cars in town -&gt; reduce congestion"</p>
              <p>As part of a revoltuionary idea, the primitive  park and ride idea was introduced.</p>
              <p>car drivers can opt for the scheme whereby they drive to a "fringe carpark". Fringe carpark are so called because they are at the fringe of CBD and not within CBD. With ALS in place (aka ERP of today), those who opt for the scheme need not pay the ALS fee entering town).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>instead take the CSS bus. so CSS buses services served from the many fringe carparks. from Dempsey to Serangoon to newton circus car park to national Stadium. and boy were they cheap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All fringe car aprks were numbered by letters. The A B C D E F G went to national stadium carparks, and the rest of letters up to N went to other car parks.  maps were produced to show these car parks and CSS services were referred to by car park letters. the legacy of these letters lives on as the National Stadium Car parks still have these Letters.</p>
              <p>Bus stop shelters (well designed) were built at many fringe carparks to house the car drivers who wait for CSS bus after parking their cars. today these shelters still exist at geylang Lor 1, Delta car park and Some at national Stadium.</p>
              <p>the CSS services were offered by NTUC Comfort (blue livery) routes 1 4 and 6 etc   and SSB (orange 2 5 7 8 9 etc ).</p>
              <p>a new rego series was created</p>
              <p>CSS 1 --100 for NTUC to use</p>
              <p>CSS 100 to er whatever for SSB to use</p>
              <p>by 1977 CSS 1 -38 were in use by NTUC all Merc O309 mini bus and SSB also use minibus CSS101 to dunno what no.</p>
              <p>sadly by 1977 it is discovered ridership is low despite the limited stops idea on CSS services  and the CSS has to be deviated from its true purpose as a part of the park and ride scheme . as such routes were amended to serve insetad to the new towns of the day. bt merah, marine parade, bouna Vista  etc.  at this point as people found the fares on CSS to eb cheaper, they switched to CSS services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>at first standees were not allowed on the minibuses. but haiyah so crowded. i kanna sqaushed many times on NTUC1 from my hosue to rochard ebfore. obvisuoly the rule was relaxed.</p>
              <p>by 1981 the demand really was bull (red Bull) strong and so SSB decided to buy more heavy duty buses like 10m Bedfords and big carrying capacity stuffs like Hino Rk 176. note hte Hino were numebred in the CSS178 --200 range. later when they were retired, some very very famialr (lol) air-con  UDs took over the regto series. these are the UDs were see on the roads today...although all may have died.</p>
              <p>but by 1988 or so, NTUC decided to give up the CSS adventure and withdrew their services. bye bye NTUC 1 4 and 6.</p>
              <p>Hence the reason why we assocaite CSS with the orange SSB buses and interchnagably refer to CSS as the ornage buses. these bus services lived on much longer and became renumebred to 60x , eg CSS 2 became CSS 602 and CSS5 became CSS 605</p>
              <p><strong>I would like to propose we remmeber the legacy of CSS by refrain from saying CSS is assocated with orange bus. dun forget NTUC as well</strong></p>
              <p>Much later some of the UDs were CAC and the fleet also saw the introduction of Dennis lance CSS310K and a ex TIBS bus TIB310  became CSS 294 the ex TIB DAFS lived out their final years on CSS as well.</p>
              <p>CSS services then began to be withdrawn in the most chui move . cheaper bus services being withdrown. it chui-ed me alot. very very chui.  Even high demand svc 605 was withdrawn. in the end one service stands alone CSS 608</p>
              <p>I spent much of 2008 snapping CSS 608 UDs in a sort of CSS themed locations or even governemnt municipal buidling backgrounds . but finally on Aug 2008, CSS 608 ran its last bus for the last time and so ends the 33 years of CSS.A post celebration party saw many bus fans gather to big farwell to CSS. me included.</p>
              <p>today a few of the CSS buses live on in SMRTbuses fleets. TIb1257 the Dennis lance ex CSS 608 bus will be the only thing left to connect to CSS after 2012. =-(</p>
              <p>ZYX</p>
              <p>Will the paark and ride Bus to town scheme return in todays congested roads scenario...only time will tell...if so CSS may yet make a return to the Singapore road scene.</p>
