In the 70s and 80s, the Leyland brand was a dominant force, with models such as the Viking, Victory, Atlantean and Olympian. I guess it was only natural that when Leyland was acquired by Volvo, the loyalty remained and we see an influx of Volvo products in the 90s; namely the B10M, Volvo Olympian, B10TL etc.</p>

              <p>Luckily 147 was saved from the NEL rationalisation, the demand now is still high for this service, even with NEL. This shows that bus services are still important despite MRT lines. Too bad many of the services, 81, 82, 84, old 85, 97, 111, 501, 502, 511 and 512 are not so lucky. I missed the rides of double deckers along the tunnels of CTE.</p>

              <p><br>Nein. As mentioned by some forumers, 8031 is now inside ST Kinetics at Portsdown Rd. It's 1 year evaluation period has expired but its future fate is uncertain. It is understood that negotiations are ongoing. If the operator; read SBS Transit, doesn't purchase the bus, it would have to be re-exported and that would be a sad end, considering its predecessor, 81S, survived until its mandatory life span expiry date.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can see 8031, though only the back of it, if you are on the upper deck of a DD travelling on the AYE towards the city. It is parked near the fence just before the Portsdown Rd exit.</p>

              <p><br>Well, it depends on how you would define as "Jurong East". The New Town wasn't built before 1981. However, there was a village located around the junction of Jurong Town Hall Rd and Jurong Rd (now a part of PIE). It approximately covers the area surrunding Jurong East St 24. Yuhua Primary School was built on the grounds of the old village school, then known as Joo Hwa Public School. The old 143 terminated at Jurong Rd 10 ms market, which was in the vicinity of the area. Other buses which pass through the area via Jurong Rd were 157, 174, 175 and 178.</p>

                  Just to add on. During the service amendments in connection to the
                  opening of Boon Lay Interchange in 1990, 197 was amemded to ply via
                  Jurong Town Hall Rd, Jurong East/West Ave 1 and Boon Lay Ave.
                  Somewhere in 1991?, 198 was shortened to end at Jurong East, but it
                  still went to Sims Place. In 1992?, there was a reversal when 197
                  was cut back to end at Jurong East and the present 198 was formed
                  to cover its route to Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>Yes, the first Volvo B10M MK2, Alexander Walter bodied, SBS 1696L, was featured on this service.</p>
              <p>Before that, the old 174 uses only Mercedes Benz OF1417s Hawke.</p>

              <p><br>Well, it depends on how you would define as "Jurong East". The New Town wasn't built before 1981. However, there was a village located around the junction of Jurong Town Hall Rd and Jurong Rd (now a part of PIE). It approximately covers the area surrunding Jurong East St 24. Yuhua Primary School was built on the grounds of the old village school, then known as Joo Hwa Public School. The old 143 terminated at Jurong Rd 10 ms market, which was in the vicinity of the area. Other buses which pass through the area via Jurong Rd were 157, 174, 175 and 178.</p>

                      Its not possible that it will plan to have more services to Eunos. Just that it has lengthened space for its boarding berths rather than a crampy ones, just like Bishan in the past on which it has 56 and 58 at the start in apr 1989.<br><br>In fact, Tuas Ter (the current one) has the same fate, there aer more unused boarding berths after 182, 183 &amp; MAJU 262 withdrawn.

              If the service gets renumbered, then it would be a waste of resources and other passengers had to look out for the correct service to get to their destination, like what TIBS had renumbered its Bukit Batok feeder services, unless there is any major amendments in the service, but still this is not necessary even though there is any major amendments or other service changes.<br><br>171 has a significant history behind it from Sembawang (Mandai Rd) to Queen St then it was extended to Yishun by SBS and no longer divert its route to Mandai Lake Rd on certain timings. As 171 plys along the Bt Panjang Estate, the service was handed over to TIBS in 1995 and Yishun became a full TIBS service until 2003 when SBS introduce 39 from Tampines to Yishun and followed by 85 from Punggol to Yishun in Jan 2006.

                  SS services were actually introduced as a temporary service between new satellite HDB towns while the MRT is still under construction or haven't extended its route yet. The services were meant to operate until the MRT starts its operation on the 1st day, after which it will be withdrawn.<br><br>SS1 - Yio Chu Kang to Yishun (Loop)<br>SS2 - Clementi to Jurong East St 32 (Loop)<br>SS3 - Clementi to Bt Batok West Ave 7 (Loop) [was shortened to Jurong East when Clementi MRT opened]<br>SS4 - Tampines to Tanah Merah MRT (Loop)<br>SS5 - Tampines to Tanah Merah MRT (Loop)<br>SS6 - Simei to Tanah Merah MRT (Loop)<br>SS7 - Woodlands to Choa Chu Kang [was extended to serve WRI for a while].

              <p>The first service to the infant Jurong East New Town was 76.  It was introduced in Nov 1981 as a loop service between Clementi Interchange and Jurong East Ave 1 (loop at Jurong Town Hall Rd and return via Boon Lay Way), charging a flat fare of 40c.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first trunk route to end at the Jurong East Terminal was 79 (introduced in 1982, I presume), which looped at Bras Basah Rd. The Jurong East feeders 333, 335 and 334 were gradually introduced as more flats were completed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since 79 duplicated the route of 147 between C'wealth Ave and Hill St, in 1984, 79 was withdrawn and 147 extended to cover its route between C'wealth Ave West and Jurong East Central. During this period also, 7 was extended to Jurong East; services 97 and 98 were introduced. The original 97 was via Clementi Rd and Pasir Panjang Rd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jurong East Bus Interchange opened in 1 June 1985 and with it come a few changes. Most notably, of course, was the relocation of the present services  to the new site. 99 was introduced (Jurong East - Boon Lay Garden), 79 was resurrected as a loop service from Jurong East - Empress Place (later it would terminate at Marina Centre) and 76 was amended and became a loop service from Jurong East to Clementi. 335 was amended and 336 was introduced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>76 was withdrawn in 1987 when 99 was modified to run between Clementi - Jurong West St 91. In 1988, 79 was withdrawn and 97 was amended to cover Alexandra Rd and AYE while 51 was extended to Jurong East from Labrador via Pasir Panjang Rd. The present 79 was the 3rd coming, introduced in 1993.</p>

              <p>I seem to recall the Jurong East Roadside ter was located next to the Shaw Theatre Jurogn East Entertianment centre. a plot of land stands there now. the road access leading to the lib and the Jurong Entertainment Shaw Centre has a slight road access way (before u make the right turn towards lib and entertainment CLSOED carpark) . this road access (cut off) used to lead to the Terminal ..</p>

              example given:<br>85x services are Yishun service introduced by TIBS (like 854, it was newly introduced)<br>But for 171, it was an SBS service extending its route to Yishun from Sembawang (Mandai Rd), then in 1995 handed overr to TIBS, thus it cannot be renumbered to avoid any confusion like what TIBS has done to renumber its Bt Batok Feeders.
