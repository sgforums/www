              <p><br>TIBS was the main suplier of bus services in yishun during 1983, when there was no bus service there before 1983.</p>
              <p>As for Woodlands and North East bounds, Woodlands is in 1983 (the original suplier there is SBS like SBS introduced 372(the current 903)on 7 Feb 1982) .</p>
              <p>The north eastern bound buses were taken over in 1995 but when SBS win the bid to operate NEL, the north eastern buses were handed back to SBS in late 1999.</p>

              <p><br>no. I mean, the four services were not park services even though they were numbered 40x or something. Because once before TIB657M told that why 410 must be 410 and not 2xx or 3xx since it was a townlink service since 40x is meant for park service (<strong>but there were no parks service when 410 is introduced!</strong>) , and im afraid that you might make the same mistake so i write that statement. hope that you wont mind it.</p>

              <p>I believe he meant that 410 was chosen as it was the next sequence of numbers which was available. Notice that the pattern for feeder service numbers were like this:</p>
              <p>22x - Bedok, 23x - Toa Payoh, 24x, 25x - Jurong, 26x - Ang Mo Kio....and the list goes on with existing services already having numbers between 27x - 40x. So, 410 was chosen for the new feeder service number as it was the next sequence in line.</p>
              <p>Originally, the 40x series were reserved for special services which operates only on Sundays &amp; PH. In addition, the 30x series were for Blue Arrow services.</p>

              <p>Svc 170 trips sometimes go into the depot to refuel.</p>
              <p>Some even went to the workshop area to fix advertisements. imagine paxs still onbaord and the mechanics banging the bus side with hammers to fix a advertisement</p>
