            <div class='col-md body'><p>LOR 1 GEYLANG / GEYLANG FRINGE CAR PARK BUS TERMINAL<br><br>Its story...<br>The Lor 1 Geylang Ter started off as a fringe car park and a bus terminus for CSS buses cum the SSB Geylang Depot. However, the terminus was not heavily used when CSS kicked start its operations in May 1975.<br><br>The terminal was constructed and was never being used by SBS or SMRT, neitehr do NTUC Comfort CSS bsues terminated at. It was solely used by the insolvent Singapore Shuttle Bus as a commissionised bus service for CSS. There was only one service plus a variant for that parent service - SSB Service 10 - running in different routing system assigned by the timings. 10 and 10A runs in AM/Off and PM peak respectivelt from Lor 1 Geylang to New Bridge Rd, with selected stops. 10B only runs at PM Peak, and terminates at South Canal Rd.<br><br>Later on, the CSS was extended to serve the major HDB towns. SSB Service 10 was being abolished and replaced with a new set of CSS bus services, by the SSB and NTUC Comfort.<br><br>CSS No. 9 was the only service that terminates at Lor 1 Geylang. It was withdrawn on 27th June 1988, though NTUC Comfort had already faced several difficulties in competition with SSB. On the same year, its NTUC Comfort CSS Services, 1 and 4 followed by 6 were withdrawn. It was then CSS Service 9 did not stay for long despite the withdrawal of all NTUC Comfort CSS Services.<br><br>However, the SSB Depot remains until the entire shutdown on 28th Apr 2007, with the bus terminal that only houses SBS 11 &amp; 175 and SMRT 853, 961, 980, 985. The site is still there but mostly you would see taxis, Bus Plus buses, SMRT PA Dennis Lance and Nissan UD Training Buses that usually parks there regularly.<br><br>The bus terminus (known as "Geylang Fringe Car Park" or "Geylang Terminal") started life as the SBS and CSS terminus. SBS Services 5, 9, 46, 71, 197 began to terminate at the bus Terminus when its bus bays were expanded to accomodate those SBS services. In 2002, again, the bus bays were upgraded again to allow bendies to terminate there. Previously, 980 does not have any bendies when it was amended to Lor 1 Geylang, previously knwon as 160 at Crawford St, on which 160 used to have crossover bendies when it was introduced by KJDEP.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Its services dated from the 1980s till present...<br><br>5 - Lor 1 Geylang to Upp Bt Timah Rd. Extended to Zhenghua Ter in 1985, and then Bt Panjang Ter at Petir Rd (present site at the vicinity of Petir LRT Station) - this was also the first bus service at Zhenghua New Town (now Bt Panjang New Town). In 1992, amended to serve Margaret Dr and became a TIBS service in 1995. It was withdrawn on 26th Dec 1999.<br><br>9 - Lor 1 Geylang to Changi Point. Integrated with 391 as part of the Changi Airport Bus Plan 1983, and serve the Changi Airport Cargo Cplx. It was cutback to start from Bedok with the MRT Rationalisaion.<br><br>11 - Lor 1 Geylang to National Stadium. Another service in the making, when Service 46 and Special Service D was withdrawn. This service was recently amended.<br><br>46 - Service withdrawn.<br><br>70# - Lor 1 Geylang - Yio Chu Kang (Weekdays Night, Sat, Sun &amp; PHs Service) - service extended to Suntec City in Oct 2000.<br><br>71 - Lor 1 Geylang to Old Upp Thomson Rd. Due to the closure of Old Upp Thosmon Rd Ter, this service was withdran.<br><br>91 - Lor 1 Geylang to Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) - Service withdrawn.<br><br>148 - Lor 1 Geylang to Buona Vista.

              <p>LOR 1 GEYLANG / GEYLANG FRINGE CAR PARK BUS TERMINAL<br><br>Its story...<br>The Lor 1 Geylang Ter started off as a fringe car park and a bus terminus for CSS buses cum the SSB Geylang Depot. However, the terminus was not heavily used when CSS kicked start its operations in May 1975.<br><br>The terminal was constructed and was never being used by SBS or SMRT, neitehr do NTUC Comfort CSS bsues terminated at. It was solely used by the insolvent Singapore Shuttle Bus as a commissionised bus service for CSS. There was only one service plus a variant for that parent service - SSB Service 10 - running in different routing system assigned by the timings. 10 and 10A runs in AM/Off and PM peak respectivelt from Lor 1 Geylang to New Bridge Rd, with selected stops. 10B only runs at PM Peak, and terminates at South Canal Rd.<br><br>Later on, the CSS was extended to serve the major HDB towns. SSB Service 10 was being abolished and replaced with a new set of CSS bus services, by the SSB and NTUC Comfort.<br><br>CSS No. 9 was the only service that terminates at Lor 1 Geylang. It was withdrawn on 27th June 1988, though NTUC Comfort had already faced several difficulties in competition with SSB. On the same year, its NTUC Comfort CSS Services, 1 and 4 followed by 6 were withdrawn. It was then CSS Service 9 did not stay for long despite the withdrawal of all NTUC Comfort CSS Services.<br><br>However, the SSB Depot remains until the entire shutdown on 28th Apr 2007, with the bus terminal that only houses SBS 11 &amp; 175 and SMRT 853, 961, 980, 985. The site is still there but mostly you would see taxis, Bus Plus buses, SMRT PA Dennis Lance and Nissan UD Training Buses that usually parks there regularly.<br><br>The bus terminus (known as "Geylang Fringe Car Park" or "Geylang Terminal") started life as the SBS and CSS terminus. SBS Services 5, 9, 46, 71, 197 began to terminate at the bus Terminus when its bus bays were expanded to accomodate those SBS services. In 2002, again, the bus bays were upgraded again to allow bendies to terminate there. Previously, 980 does not have any bendies when it was amended to Lor 1 Geylang, previously knwon as 160 at Crawford St, on which 160 used to have crossover bendies when it was introduced by KJDEP.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Its services dated from the 1980s till present...<br><br>5 - Lor 1 Geylang to Upp Bt Timah Rd.

In 1992, amended to serve Margaret Dr and became a TIBS service in 1995. It was withdrawn on 26th Dec 1999.<br><br>9 - Lor 1 Geylang to Changi Point. Integrated with 391 as part of the Changi Airport Bus Plan 1983, and serve the Changi Airport Cargo Cplx. It was cutback to start from Bedok with the MRT Rationalisaion.<br><br>11 - Lor 1 Geylang to National Stadium. Another service in the making, when Service 46 and Special Service D was withdrawn.
