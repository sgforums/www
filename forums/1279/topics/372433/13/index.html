              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br><strong>74 -</strong><br><br>74 is a generation 2 route. it was one the promised cross island routes of the 1980s. tranquilice has epxlained the service rigins.</p>
              <p><strong>Svc 154</strong> is a gen 1 route - Introduced when Toa payoh new Town was opened. service 154 was the only service designated among the 15x services to "pass by" toa payoh townc entre. the service ran from macpherson Est to jurong. Somewhere in Sixth Lokyang rd 9when the days they had not much feeder services in the brand enw ind est).</p>
              <p>it is of note that Service 154 was the only service to ply the entire stretch of North Bouna Vista rd in 1971, . the only service running (entire) North Bouna Vista rd then was a STC svc 24 which ran to town.  No the generation1 , svc 154 did not run Clementi Rd. that was a later amendment. <br><br><strong>Svc 7 -</strong> <br>Service 7 was orginally introduced as a generation 2 limited stop express route. This set of generation1 limited stop routes consisted of 6 , 7 and 8. In line with the requirement that bus services run from a new town to Chinatown, Orchard rd and Shenton Way, the services 6, 7, 8 run to these palces respecitvely in that order. This was for the new town bedok in 1975?</p>
              <p>the express sector choosen was ebtween moutnbatten rd and capitol using Nicholl HW as express. Nicholl HW was a new spanking highway.</p>
              <p>Svc 7 ran orginally from CMPB Dempsey - Bedok. <br><br><strong>Svc 30</strong><br>Classification type - Western gen 0. Overall gen 1</p>
              <p>In the days when the Chiense Bus Companies run only in their terriory, cross terrirotiral services were seldom mentioend of. The original service 30 in 1969 when introduced took in KEPPEL BUS SERVICES ROUTE 1 ( Keppel Rd - West Coast rd - tebna agrdens village area)</p>
              <p>As for the eastern region, it was a integration of the many Changi or paya lebar Bus Services route providing a better bus route from Siglap Area to town. namely Shenton Way. <br><br>As with any Jurong ind est ending service, there was again no Jurong Int yet when the poor new gen 1 service was introduced. so it go past the bus termins at Corporation Rd Blk 61 then ended its working at International Rd.</p>
              <p><strong>classification system</strong></p>
              <p>By generations</p>
              <p>gen 0 - Chiense Bus company orgins, between 1930s to 1968. 15 bus companies. incldues the STC (the english bus co)</p>
              <p>gen 1 - introduced during the ABS ABC UBC formation</p>
              <p>gen 0 conversion - converted to ABC ABS or UBC service (this is not mentioned, just mention conversion of service thru the 1969 to 1971 era)</p>
              <p>gen 2 - this is when Clementi, bedok new towns were being built. ie between 1973 to 1984  Most gen 2 services are cross sialnd services. <br><br>after 1985 its pretty much my memeories so i will use memories and nsotalgias. le.</p>

              <p>What about the route of 186, 147, 63 and 166? How did they came about?</p>
              <p>Posted by Rk 2010</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Again i'll just supplement some basic info. <br><br><strong>186 </strong><br>186 existed as a gen 2 service<br>Introdcued for Clementi new Town - bus to Shenton Wqay <br>run via MRT line then down to cantonment rd then town.<br>obviusoly killed off when MRT ran.</p>
              <p>the 186 today is NOT the 186 i remember. in fact to eb frank, I'd rather they call the service 126.</p>
              <p><strong>147</strong><br>gen 1 introduction</p>
              <p>During gen 1, TPY new town was opened. all 14x services ran from it. Likewise 147. <br>147 : TPY &lt;&gt; Commonwelath Dr. <br><br>147 was extended to clementi when gen 2 feeder service 78 (Clementi - Queesnway loop) is withdrawned. obviusoly of little use...147 way betetr with a town connection.</p>
              <p><strong>63</strong><br>gen 1 introduction<br>little need to eb said about the roginal 63. It ran almost same as todays 63 except it cut thru Kim tian rd to the Lower Depot bus term. later it got extended to labrodor pk via Depot Rd. today svc 175 sort of acts like the 63 between depot rd to kim tian area.</p>
              <p>Now this said 63 was in fact withdrawn. prob due to route duplciations with 62.</p>
              <p><strong>166 </strong><br>feeder bus<br>gen 0 ( tay Koh yat Svc 1)</p>
              <p>Sembawang naval Base - nee soon village <br>this is the orginal 166. later withdrawn when the naval base was half shut down as the british military prescence pulled out of singapore by 1972 (because we are independant in 1965 and the miltiary of britian slowoyly pull out. See The Singapore Story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this IS the orginal 166.</p>
              <p><strong>166</strong><br>gen 2<br>Introduced for AMK town. The route pretty much is todays 166 between the AMK - labordor parts. <br><br>but do note in early 1980s, a service 165 was introduced as well. both services could be intro at same time. 165 ran to jurong via town and chinatown. Much later 165 was converted to a gen 2 cross island, via lornie rd instead of the mad route thru town. 166 route was adjusted to cover up for the lost 165. the orginal 166 ran via shenton way.</p>
              <p>it was thus re routed via chinatown.</p>
              <p>as 165 became a hot service, 166 was changed to clementi. when the MRT came and <strong>146</strong> had to be withdrawn. <br></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>When Tibs took over from SBS bus services,<br>2 remaining SBS services remained in Tibs Territory. <br><br>The notorious 170 and 171. <br><br>171 was amended to serve Bukit Panjang in the mid 1990s, plying from Woodlands Road, to Bukit Panjang Road, then Pending Road, then Cashew Road, before plying to its original route. <br><br>171 then came under Tibs later when Tibs took over Bukit Panjang. <br><br>171 was then amended in 1999 with the opening of the LRT. Instead of using Mandai Road and Woodlands Road to reach Bukit Panjang, it was amended to serve BKE and then Bukit Panjang Road, Pending Road, Petir Road, Jelebu Road, Bukit Panjang Road, back to Upper Bukit Timah Road before continuing its former route. <br><br>927 was extended from Mandai Road To Choa Chu Kang in 1995, serving BKE/Bukit Panjang Road/Teck Whye Avenue/Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4. <br><br>Service 927 was amended to cover 171's deleted sector of its amended route in Mandai Road and Woodlands Road and oso started plying KJE in 1999 with the LRT rationalisation.<br><br>Service 190 covered the deleted sector from Choa Chu Kang Int to Bukit Panjang Service 927 formely covered.<br><br>Service 951 serving Marsiling To Boon Lay was deleted with the opening of Woodlands Int in 1996. Service 187 was extended from Bukit Panjang Int to Woodlands Int to cover most of the missing routes 951 formerly did. 180 was introduced to cover the existing route of 951 from Boon Lay to Bukit Panjang Road in 1996. <br><br>If I am not wrong. 75 was amended to start from Bukit Panjang instead of Choa Chu Kang Int when 190 was extended to Choa Chu Kang Interchange in early 1990s? </p></div>
