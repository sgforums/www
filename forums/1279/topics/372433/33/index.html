              <p><strong>The 1973 unification <br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Note on bus regos</strong></p>
              <p>the time came for the ABC ABS and UBC to come as one. to form
              SSBS, this is 1970,</p>
              <p>buses in those days were being bought a lot by the current UBC
              ABS and ABC. they were registereed SH</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in 1971 with nothing happening towards full unity, the govt
              stepped in. this was when SBS bus regos begin to appear.<br> <br> Essentially they took all the ABS ABC UBC buses and re-registered
              everyone. even those at the vehcile registeration compoud etc with
              current SH rego registered 1 month earlier, were to get SBS
              regos.</p>
              <p><strong>A system was decided upon.</strong><br> <br> Buses belonging to each company (ABC UBC ABS ) were to msotly
              remain in their own depots. However, to balance out and to
              introduce new routes, some of the company buses are to "Depot
              trasnfer".</p>
              <p>Now they have to decide which places are to be depots.<br> <br> After that they decided to number the buses according to
              depot.<br> <br> <strong>List</strong></p>
              <p>ALDEP<br> ALExnadra Depot<br> (Ex Hock lee then later ABC) -  SBS 1xxx<br> (SSo if u were registered SBS1144, it just means u are the 144th
              bus to be registered there)<br> <br> BDDEP<br> Bedok Depot (Location near to Somapah Bus Interchange)<br>  (Origins unknown - awaiting Mike davis 2nd book) -
              SBS 2xxx<br> <br> WLDEP<br> Woodlands Depot (Location - as stated by u guys, kranji
              there)<br> (origins likely UBC depot, prob belonged to tay Koh yat) - Svc 170
              bsues come inside here to refuel.</p>
              <p>If I was riding a svc 170 MB oF1413 then I would have had the
              opporutinity to visit a depot whilst remain on bus as they refuel.
              I have heard stories of them even banging on advertisement panels
              while u were refuleing.</p>

              registeration rules. the rule was dropped by mid or early
              80s.<br> <br> Note- the above does not explain how some 600xx UDs ended up in
              BNDEP in 1975 or 1976. Perhaps a depot trasnfer is unknown. 40xx
              UDs were certainly under BNDEP</p>

              <p><br>Not interchangeable. When the term "interchangeable" is used, it normally means something like the old  system for Svc 900/901,Svc 920/922 and Svc 941/945/947 whereby the perms will swop services every single week, maintaining the same group of buses for that entire week. Example will be something like this:</p>
              <p>Svc 900 and Svc 901 perms (then) were: TIB904A TIB999B TIB1049L TIB1181L TIB1183G TIB1222C (TIB1245L is out as the bus is perm 900S151 and does not rotate, TIB447C is out because the bus was never interchanged between both services)</p>
              <p>For one week, Svc 900 takes TIB904A TIB1049L TIB1181L TIB1222C (TIB1245L) and Service 901 takes (TIB447C) TIB999B TIB1183G. This pattern goes on for a week, then next week the 6 buses that are interchangeable would form another pattern that goes on for the next week and so on.</p>
              <p>The example of Svc 167 and Svc 178 would not be interchangeable, but more of a cameo basis because the buses do not rotate around and stay in the same pattern for a single week. It is just that the Svc 167 bus appears on Svc 178 for a day, just like how a cameo should, although it happens more than once. Using the term "interchangeable" for this example, doesn't it mean that all buses from all services are "interchangeable" with each other just by appearing on another service for a day?</p>
              <p>As for Merz cameos after UDs came to perm 178, it is not really counted as rare, but more of uncommon ... ...</p>

              900/901,Svc 920/922 and Svc 941/945/947 whereby the perms
              will swop services every single week, maintaining the same group of
              buses for that entire week. Example will be something like
              this:</p>
              <p>The example of Svc 167 and Svc 178 would not be interchangeable,
              but more of a cameo basis because the buses do not rotate around
              and stay in the same pattern for a single week. It is just that the
              Svc 167 bus appears on Svc 178 for a day, just like how a cameo
              should, although it happens more than once. Using the term
              "interchangeable" for this example, doesn't it mean that all buses
              from all services are "interchangeable" with each other just by
              appearing on another service for a day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>interchangeability don't happen everyday/week, only on an occasional basis</p>
              <p>TIB 649L,662Y and 663U are some of them that did 178 before, and on a full day basis, who says they arent? 670Z and 674M did 167 before</p>

              <p><br>They did. But not in a FULL WEEK basis. As in they did the full day slots, but not for an entire week ... ... occasional basis is known as a CAMEO</p>

              <p>so when did 368Y-376Z officially become perms on 178?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and after the UDs came on, is it rare for mercz cameos to come on 178?</p>

              <p><br>That was somewhere after service 950 was introduced in Sept 2004. Some of the Mercs from services 75, 167, 961, 963 (just to name a few) went over to do service 950, this services in return got hold of some OAC Scanias from services 178 and 980. In return, service 178 kana some Nissan UD perms (both OAC and ex-CSS CACs which were re-regoed), whereas some of service 980's duties were transferred over to AMDEP. And in 2006 service 178 officially became a full Nissan UD fleet.</p>
              <p>Note that some of the ex-CSS Nissans also did Bt Panjang feeders before but they were never perms.</p>
              <p>As for the Mercs on service 178, I would say that they do cameo once in a while only.</p>
