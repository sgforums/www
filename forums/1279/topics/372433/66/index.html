              <p>- Mercedes Benz O303 (10 bought from SATS)</p>
              <p>- Volvo B10M demo, SBS 9C, bodied by Vanhool</p>
              <p>- Leyland Victories, body reworked from Soon Chow and fitted air con units. (Some non air con Victories were used for this conversion, but unsure of how many were there,)</p>

              <p><br>They were Mercedes Benz O303 air con coaches used by Changi Airport in the 1980s. SBS bought them from SABS and converted them for public bus operations, in order to trial the possibility of using air con buses in future.</p>

              I would like to know that did TIBS bought extra new Hinos and
              Nissans for the CSS services in the early 1990s or were they all
              old TIBS buses converted to CSS buses all the while? And what was
              the criteria of TIBS to convert their old TIBS bus to CSS bus, like
              age, etc?</p>
              <p>And many years back, a few CSS UDs shown up in Yishun bus
              interchange. What happened?</p>
              
              The CSS UDs went to do SMRT services, as CSS 608 went to down-sized its fleet. They let it run for a few years as a temporary measure before SMRT then bought new OCs to replace majority of the CSS UDs.<br><br>SSB, the provider of CSS, used to form TIBS and was under a management of SSB. This comes round when new CSS UD buses were ordered to replace the older CSS fleet. As for the criteria, it has to ensure that its lifespan doesn't expire. TIBS do not buy Hinos anymore, after TIB380K - TIB389L entered into the fleet.</div></blockquote>

              <p><br>Service 13 had Volvo B57 and SC Albion Viking fleets in the 1980s when serving its old route from Eunos to Ghim Moh. In 1989 the route was changed to terminate at YCK and converted to FAC service. I believed that the Nissan U31SCNs were deployed from the withdrawn service 118.</p>
              <p>I remembered service 13 used to have full Volvo MK3 fleet in the early 90s. Before that there were also Merc 0405s from HGDEP I think.</p>
              <p>In 17 Dec 1995 when 6 services (59, 82, 103, 163, 214E and 214W) were handed over to Tibs, service 13 was made partial AMDEP controlled, that was when Merc 0405s made a comeback. HGDEP also deployed newly registered Volvo MK4s to service 13.</p>
              <p>In1997/98, service 13 was extended from Eunos to terminate at Marine Parade.</p>
              <p>Somewhere in 2001 when Marine Parade was closed down, service 13 was made full AMDEP and it became a full Merc 0405 fleet.</p>

              <p>Let me contribute the history of Woodlands Bus Services.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that you all know that Woodlands Bus Services were started by SBS in the early 1980s.<br><br>In the humble days of Woodlands Bus Services pre-dominantly in the 1970s, only service 169, 180, 182 and 208 plys from a small bus terminal in Admiralty Rd. Service 169 goes from Admiralty Rd and Marsiling Dr and continues its route to Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 via Admiralty Rd West. Services 180, 182 and 208 plys from Admiralty Rd and pass through Woodlands Town Centre.<br><br>Service 178 and 181 was believed to have been extended to Admiralty Rd terminal for a very short while in 1980 after it was being amended to call at Woodlands Bus Interhcange.<br><br>The Woodlands Bus Interchange was opened on 29 Nov 1981. Services 169, 178, 181, 204 and 208 were called at the new Interchange. Service 204 was the first service that called from the Woodlands Interchange (it was neither introduced from Admiralty Rd, and the service goes to the Sg Kadut Industral Estate, when the industrial estate is developed to resettle several existing factories from nearby rural areas). Services 180 and 182 remains at Admiralty Rd Terminal.<br><br>IN early 1982, Feeder Service 372 from Woodlands to Marsiling Rd (A loop svc) was introduced to cater the Marsiling residents.</p>

It was started off as Woodlands to Woodlands St 13 loop service in mid-1985. In late 1985, Service 204 and 208 was being merged to form service 925, with the Sg Kadut route on ordinary days (Mon-Sat) and alternate route to Kranji Way on Sunday &amp; PHs.

Service 901 was the only service that ply from old Woodlands Int (better known as Woodlands Checkpoint Terminus). Although the routes that ply doesn't call at the new WRI Int, there were many feedbacks from residents. So TIBS decided to split out the route from 901 and introduce a new Service 904 that plys from Woodlands to Woodlands Checkpoint Terminus).
