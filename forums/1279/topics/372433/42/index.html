Sooner, the trend for the new colour coding berth were introduced at later stages, i.e. Tampines &amp; Jurong East<br><br>It used to have 5 berths at a start, with 1 berth reserved for Alighting, there wasn't any end-on berths (like the current Interchange layout). However, in the later years, the Bedok Interchange was expanded with the end-on berths to accomodate the existing Chai Chee Terminal services, on which the terminal was acquired by the HDB for housing developments.

              <p>400 401 403 were all along trunk services. Even with the implementation of the Parks branding for 408 and 409, these three services, though designated as part of the Parks Services, charged a different fare from the two services 408 and 409 (the fare was all along the same as the other trunk routes), operated different hours (everyday compared to weekends only) and carried the normal desto compared to the 408 409's special green coloured desto.</p>
