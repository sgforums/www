              <p>From RK 2010:<br>"How did Bukit Merah services came about?"<br><br>============================================================<br><br>let's emphasise about the late 1970s till the 1980s of the Bt maerh, Services<br><br>Bukit Merah Services were quite sketchy in the past, compared to the 1971 re-organisation. They were terminating in different parts of Jln Bukit Merah like Service 50 from Kaki Bukit Malay Settlement (Jln Eunos) to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd) and Service 65 from MacPherson to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd). Those services were clustered in different locations making it inconvenient for other passengers, which began a critical point to re-organise its Bt Merah services into one interchange, so the need of a centralised bus service hub is needed for Bukit Merah. The Bukit Merah Interchange was completed and commence operations in 1980.<br><br>More feeders were added for the Bukit Merah areas. This allows residents from both estates to have direct and convenient links to the town centres of Bukit Mearh rather than taking its regular trunk services to get around and a walking distance just to get to the town centres.

              <p>582 - 881 will be your fave MKIIIs.</p>
              <p>882 - 996 will be the MKIV DMs.</p>
              <p>997A is the Superlong</p>
              <p>998Y is the MKIV Artic</p>
              <p>999U is the 0405G.</p>
              <p>The latter 2 have been sold to New Zealand, while it appears that nobody still wants to purchase 997A despite years of indications of wanting to sell this bus.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>The majority was Scania buses indeed, but I did remember seeing a Mercedes MB O405 doing the route too, likely as a cameo. Can't remember any Dennis Lance buses on them though.</p>
