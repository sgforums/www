              <p>================================================<br>HISTORY OF BISHAN SERVICES<br>================================================<br><br>Background information:<br>Before the developmentof Bishan New Town, it was previously known as Kampong San Teng. There was only squatter huts, a Chinese Cemetry and temples situated around the Kg San teng area. There were no bus services serving around Kg San Teng and only one road serving the whole of Kg San Teng and many unnamed dirt tracks/roads surrounding it.<br><br>In late 1981, the village was earmarked for urban development, many squatters were cleared and resettled to other estatss like Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh. It took at least 5-6 years to fully developed its new Sattellite town at Bishan. The MRT and bus interchange was still under construction at that time. When the new town is near completion of its development, a new bus services starting from Bishan Terminal to Toa Payoh was launched in 1986. Bishan, too, started off as a roadside terminal before the services termiante at Bishan Int, with easy access to the Bishan MRT, first of its kind that the station platform is on ground level.<br><br>In the start of 1986, only service 56 serve Bishan and loop at Toa Payoh and at the end of 1986, service 353 was introduced from Sin Ming to Bisahn St 31 (Loop)<br><br>In 1987, service 58 from Bishan to Marina Centre was introduced to provide Bishan residents proper and direct linkage to shopping centres around Marina Centre area like Marina Square and Raffles City. It was withdrawn when serviec 56 and 58 was integrated to form service 56 in 1989/90.<br><br>In 1988, service 57 was renumbered from 353. This service was re-routed to start from Bishan to Sin Ming Dr (Loop), to serve the residents better instead of transferring buses to get to their destinations around Bishan New Town. On the same year, Service 59 from Bishan to Jln Kayu (Loop) was introduced but it was shortened to start from Ang Mo Kio a few years later.<br><br>In 1989/90, service 56 was integrated with service 58. Service 56 was extended to Marina Centre and part of the srvice 58 route (the Marina Ctr stretch ) is now part of service 56.<br><br>The first "Bishan Townlink" service 410 was introduced in JUne 1992, with links to Sin Ming Dr. This service was swapped plates in 1993. At the same time, service 57 which plies along Sin Ming Dr was withdrawn.<br><br>From 1993 onwards, here are the changes in the Bishan Services<br><br>52 - New service that plies from Bishan to Jurong East (introdiced on 23 Oct 05)<br>53 - New service that plies from Bishan to Hougang St 22 (Loop) in 1994, about a year later, it was extended to Changi Airpot<br>54 - New service that plies from Bishan to New Bridge Rd (introduced on 5 dec 93), when 104 and 134 merged. The service was amended to ply Bishan St 13 from 5 nov 06<br>55 - Service amended to serve Bishan instead of Ang Mo Kio in 1993<br>57 - New service that plies from Bishan to Bt Merah via Depot Rd on 31 jul 2005. This service ples to Thomson Rd, Kg Java Rd/Keng Lee Rd instead of Bt Timah Rd / Duneanr Rd on 21 Jan 2007<br>58 - New service that plies from Bishan to Pasir Ris on 31 jul 2005.<br>59 - new service that plies from Bishan to Changi Village on  23 oct 2005, plies via Toa Payoh, Bedok Reservoir Rd and Tampines New Town.<br>134 - Service amended to serve Bishan but it was withdrawn when 104 and 134 merged to form service 54.<br><br>In the past, Bishan Int was the only interchange with the least services, 5 services i.e. 53, 54, 55, 56 &amp; 410. With the addition of the 4 new services - 52, 57, 58, 59, Bishan Int has more variety of its services that ply different parts of Singapore. Like 57 that goes to Bukit Merah, 58 goes to Paris Ris and so on. Now Bishan Int has 9 services serving the needs of the Bishan Residents.<br><br>SIN MING ROAD TERMINAL<br>In the past, only 130 plies from Sin Ming Rd terminal to Anson Rd as well as CSS Bus no 5. When the Ang Mo Kio Int opens in 1983, Service 130 amended to serve Ang Mo Kio Int leaving CSS 5 behind which still terminates at Sin Ming Rd. At the end of 1986, sefvice 353 was introduced but too the service amended to start from Bishan instead and renumbered as 57.<br><br>THe only sole service of Sin Ming Rd terminal was CSS 5. On Nov 97, the service was renumbered as 605 and continued its operation without any service changes until it was eventually withdrrawn on Sep 2004. after its withdrawal, the Sin Mign Rd terminal is in a quiet state.<br><br>edit: corrections made.</p>

              <p>==================================================<br>SERANGOON SERVICES HISTORY<br>==================================================<br><br>Majority of its Serangoon Services were from Serangoon Garden Estate, located as Serangoon Garden Way wayback in the 1960s and the 1970s. In its pre-reorganisation in 1971, the Serangoon Services were operated by STC, Paya Lebar Bus Service, and TKY Bus co. STC was the only route that goes trhough the City area while, PLBS and TKY bus co operates only around other routes excluding CBD areas like Shenton Way/Robisnon Rd, where those roads were monopolized by STC and other services had to ensure that they do not ply along those roads.<br><br>STC has 18A and 18B in Seragnoon Garden area. 18A has 2 variants - ordianry and limited stop service plying along Finlasyon Green to Serangoon Gdns edtate, while 18B from Serangoon Gdns Circus to Finlayson Green.<br><br>18A is very confusing route and commuters must be able to know the sketchy routes of 18A. Not many though have known by these routings and had a very hard fatigue on travelling along STC routes.<br><br>18A plies the partial route of Route 18B. During its peak hours, one of each buses of 18A will loop at 2 different directions, viz the Nothern &amp; Southern Loops while the another bus will terminate at Serangoon Garden Circus. On its off peak, both alternate buses will serve the Northen Loops &amp; Southern Loops of this sector.<br><br>After 7.30pm , 18A buses operate from Finlayson Green and Bras Basah Rd and after 8.30pm, buses only operates from Bras Basah Rd.<br><br>18A - Limited Stop Service<br>There were 2 routes fro this service.. one that goes via Paya Lebar Rd and Guillemard Rd and the another that goes via Lanveder St and Crawford St. The services ran on an AM peak trip (7am-9am) and PM Peak tip (4.30pm to 6pm) - on saturdays it ran from 12.30 to 2pm and no operation on Sundays &amp; PHs.<br><br>18B operates exactly the same as vice versa route of 18A. From Serangoon Garddens to Finlayson Green. This service uses the buses from 18A.<br><br>PLBS service 3 - Serangoon gearden estate to Gay World Pk<br><br>This service plies along the inner areas of Serangoon Garedn estate (Chartwell Dr, Tavistock Ave , Hemsley Ave etc etc before proceding its route via Yio Chu Kang Rd/UppS erangoon Rd all the way down to Lor 5 Geylang, where the Gay World Pk is conveniently located nearby.<br><br>One of Alternate buses will go via Northern &amp; Southen Loops each.<br><br>TKY 9 - Havelock Rd to Serangoon Garden Circus<br><br>Service plies from Havelock Rd to Seraangoon Garden Circus via Orchard Rd, Newton Circus, Thomson Rd, Lor Chuan..<br><br>Int eh 1971 reorganisation, 11 Apr 1971, the services were being freshly re-introduced as the entire existing chinse bus service were amalgamated, indluding STC, which continues to stay until its bankruptcy at the end of 1971.<br><br>STC and ABS were the only 2 bus companies that plys the Serangoon Gardens Estate.<br><br>STC we have ...<br>100 - Serangoon Garden - Prince Edward Rd -- handed to ABS<br>100A - Serangoon Garden - Finlayson Green (Loop) -- handed to ABS<br>101 - Serangoon Garden - New Bridge Rd/Neil Rd(via Berwick Dr) -- handed to ABS<br>101A - Serangoon Garden - New Bridge Rd/Neil Rd (via Tavistock Ave) -- handed to ABS<br>102 - Serangoon Garden - Prince Edward Rd(via Berwick Dr) -- handede to UBC<br>102A - Serangoon Garden - Prince Edward Rd (via Tavisotck Ave) -- handed to UBC<br><br>ABS we have ...<br>103 - Serangoon Garden -C'wealth Ave/North Buona Vista Rd (via Holland Rd)<br>103A - Serangoon Garden -C'wealth Ave/North Buona Vista Rd  (Via C'wealth Dr, Queens Circus)<br><br>In other words, ABS 156 also plys along the Serangoon Garden Estate.<br><br>New services introcuded in 1972:<br><br>ABS 72 from Serangoon Garden to Tangjong Rhu (note that alternate buses will ply via Berwick Dr and Tavistock Ave each)<br>UBC 104 was introduced from Seangoon Gardens to Havelock Rd (Loop Service) plies via Orcahrd Rd, New Bridge Rd, Havlock Rd.<br><br>============================================<br>1974 BUS RATIONALISATION<br>============================================<br><br>in the 1974 bus rationalisation, serangoon services that has duplication on its route were either cancelled/re-routed/re-numbered.<br><br>100/100A - Renumbered as 100<br>101A - Service withdrawn<br>102 - Became a supplement service as limited stop serice.

              <p>Hmm, maybe I should contribute the Changi Point (Now known as Changi Village) Bus Services. Some FAQs below.<br><br><strong>In the past, which bus company used to operate the Changi Point / Changi Village Bus Services before its bus reorganisation on 11 Apr 1971?</strong><br><br>Well, there were only 3 main services and 1 variant services operated by Changi Bus Co.

With the cutting of its roads of the Upp Changi Rd, with the development of Chai Chee Rd/Bedok New Town and the development of Changi Airport, Upp Changi Rd became segmented. Changi Village, in fact was part of Upp Changi Rd and to avoid further confusion, the segment of the road serving Changi Village became Changi Village Rd.<br><br>Changi Village became a landmark, partly because of a famous seafood restaurant at Changi Village Road and a small holiday accomodation units at the HDB flats.<br><br><strong>What were the services being introduced in the later stages till the present day?

              <p><br>Yes, service 147 last time terminated at Potong Pasir. Somewhere in 1992 service 147 was extended to Upp Serangoon via Serangoon Central, YCK Road and Hougang Ave 2/8 (which covered the withdrawn service 83).</p>
              <p>The Hougang Ave 10 to Punggol Road end stretch is still continued to be served by service 82 till today.</p>

              <p><br>Thank you for your information.<br><br>The date when 147 was merged with 83 was on 28th June 1992, when 148 was introduced and 196, 197 &amp; 198 were amended as mentioned by Tranquilice.</p>

              <p><br>The compass MRT line wasn't a real simple withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Some routes were merged, deleted (amended to serve elsewhere like Sv 13) to suit w/ new town devt n MRT commencement.</p>
              <p>83 &amp; 147 merged to better serve Hougang, reduce resources at Punggol Rd. 201 became 151.</p>
              <p>137 &amp; 163/ 173 &amp; 205's case pretty similiar, cut away CBD leg.</p>
              <p>149 I think is split into 2, w/ 16 &amp; 31 taking over. Pretty logical in some sense back then.</p>
              <p>206 was total withdrawn.</p>
              <p>104 became Sv 54 and Sv 156.</p>
              <p>Sv 72 &amp; 158 rationalised together. I believe has to do w/ S'goon New Town devt if I could still remember &amp; reduce duplication w/ 152.</p>
              <p>4 merged w/ 21.</p>
              <p>As for feeders, wat I believe is because as buses became bigger (12m), reduction of feeder routes became inevitable</p>
