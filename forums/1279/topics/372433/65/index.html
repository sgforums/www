              <p><br>No. A bus operating from somewhere far away doesn't need to be under control of a depot that is nearer to boarding or terminating points. e.g. Some Premium services like 532, 533 in under HGDEP control despite that they did not serve places nearer to Hougang.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I don't remember any dates but the chronology of events is something like this. In the beginning, the only access to JW N9 was via Pioneer Rd Nth. Both 99 and 188 would turn in from Upp Jurong Rd (now JW Ave 3). When N7 and N8 were occupied, it was 188 which was first amended via Ave 5 &amp; St 72. Eventually, 99 was also amended along the same route and everything was cool until the opening of Boon Lay Int/MRT.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">175 was amended and 242 was introduced. So, for a while, JW St 91 was happily served by 4 services: 99, 175, 188, 242. Service 175 was a CMI case after its amendment. The buses were always empty, although it was nice to see an Albion Viking going round the bends. :-) And so, due to poor ridership, its sayonara 175.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As for 188's case, its duplication. The main purpose for 188 was for the JW Ext residents to gain access to Jurong Bus Interchange and Lakeside MRT. So when the MRT and interchange at Boon Lay was completed, it became redundant and its ridership wasn't as strong as before. And so, arrivederchi 188 and we are left with 2 services again; 99, 242.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Then somewhere along the line came 243. If I'm not mistaken, when 243 came, it took over the route via JW St 72, Ave 5 &amp; Pioneer Rd Nth. 242 was amended to go via Upp Jurong Rd, Pioneer Rd Nth. This chapter was a bit confusing as changes took place back and forth between 242 and 243. Eventually when St 81 was completed and 243 was made to serve that area while 242 got back its original route.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Route enhancements were made to 243 later on but as far as 99 and 242 were concerned, that was the end of the story until 2009, when Pioneer MRT was opened and I'm sure everyone knew what happened then. ;-)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">That's the end of my long winded tale. This is pure memory work from my experience as a JW resident of over 20 years. There's bound to be mistakes and some things which I've missed out. Hence, I'd like to apologise beforehand. Thank you.</span></p>

              <p><br>There's two errors in your history.</p>
              <p>1st: Service 242 was not introduced in when 175 was amended in 1990. It actually existed in 1978 from Jurong to Kang Ching Rd. Amended to Boon Lay in 1990, but I'm not sure when is it amended to St 91 &amp; 92.</p>
              <p>2nd: In this sentence '99 was also amended along the same route and everything was cool until the opening of Boon Lay Int', this is incorrect as you are making others to believe that 99 was amended to Ave 5 &amp; St 72 before the opening of Boon Lay Int. 99 was actually amended in 1991.</p>

              <p>========= WORLD TRADE CENTRE / HARBOURFRONT BUS SERVICES HISTORY =============<br><br>Well, its long overdue for the WTC bus services history, so I should carry on posting the info here.<br><br>A SHORT HISTORY...<br><br>Back then, that plot of land near Seah Im Rd/Telok Blangah Rd were solely belonged to the former Port of Singapore Authority (PSA). In its meantime, commuters would alight from one bus stop facing directly or just opposite the WTC to head the venue for its exhibition. These services were NEVER terminate at the roadside around the WTC though, but these existing buses came from Alexandra Rd / Tanjong Pagar Rd (near Anson Rd)<br><br>SBS had negotiated with the PSA to built a new bus terminal at WTC in 1983. A possible site - at Seah Im Rd / Telok Blangah Rd was drawn out by PSA, and its proposal of the new bus terminal at WTC is to improve the bus services at WTC, though there is a growing demand of bus services that served WTC. Before the terminus was made to fully fledged its existing bus services terminating at the two terminus, the agony comes to waiting for a bus scheduling to pass by the WTC and its terminus was the main purpose to better serve the commuters who are heading to WTC.<br><br>The WTC bus terminus was completed at the end of 1984, with existing SBS Services CBD 1, 84, 93, 100 &amp; 163, and TIBS 167 &amp; 180 serving the new WTC terminus. It commenced its operations on 13th Jan 1985, replacing the Tg Pagar Rd and Aleaandra Rd Terminus.<br><br>(The terminus was being upgraded in par with the new North East Line connectivity, and was renamed as "Harbour Front Interchange".<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SERVICES AT WTC BUS TERMINUS<br><br>CBD 1 - World Trade Ctr to Orchard Rd (Loop) - Service was extended from Marina Centre to World Trade Centre.<br>84 - World Trade Ctr to Upp Serangoon<br>93 - World Trade Ctr to Paya Lebar Airport (Loop)<br>100 - World Trade Ctr to Serangoon Gaden<br>163 - World Trade Ctr to Jln Kayu<br>167 - World Trade Ctr to Admiralty Rd West<br>180 - World Trade Ctr to Admiralty Rd (Marsiling Est)<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>CURRENT SERVICES AT HARBOURFRONT INTERCHANGE<br><br>65 - HarbourFront to Tampines<br>80 - HarbourFront to Sengkang<br>93 - HarbourFront to Eunos<br>188 - HarbourFront to Choa Chu Kang<br>855 - HarbourFront to Yishun<br>963 - HarbourFront to Woodlands Reg Int<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SERVICES EVER TERMINATED AT WTC TERMINAL / HARBOURFRONT INTERCHANGE<br><br>84 - Hougang Ctrl to WTC (Service withdrawn)<br>85 - Sengkang to WTC (Harbourfront) (Service withdrawn due to NEL Rationalisation)<br>521 - Bt Panjang to WTC (Service renumbered to 963, with the extension of Woodlands Reg Int)<br>865 - Sengkang to WTC (Service renumbered to 85, when 865 became SBS)<br>NR1 - Harbourfront To Yishun (Service extended to RWS)<br>NR6 - Harbourfront To Sengkang (Service extended to RWS)<br><br>In addition, Express Services 188E and 963E also serves the HarbourFront Int and 2 special Parks Services, 408 to Labrador Pk (12 Mar) and 409 to Mount Faber (14 Nov) were introduced both in 2005.</p>

              <p>I haven't got anything concrete but as I recall, when Boon Lay Interchange was opened there was no 242. 242 was introduced as a new service. The old 242 was withdrawn.</p>
              <p>As for the 2nd point, I've always thought that the amendment to 99 was done earlier. You may be right on this one.</p>

In its meantime, commuters would alight from one bus stop facing directly or just opposite the WTC to head the venue for its exhibition. These services were NEVER terminate at the roadside around the WTC though, but these existing buses came from Alexandra Rd / Tanjong Pagar Rd (near Anson Rd)<br><br>SBS had negotiated with the PSA to built a new bus terminal at WTC in 1983. A possible site - at Seah Im Rd / Telok Blangah Rd was drawn out by PSA, and its proposal of the new bus terminal at WTC is to improve the bus services at WTC, though there is a growing demand of bus services that served WTC. Before the terminus was made to fully fledged its existing bus services terminating at the two terminus, the agony comes to waiting for a bus scheduling to pass by the WTC and its terminus was the main purpose to better serve the commuters who are heading to WTC.<br><br>The WTC bus terminus was completed at the end of 1984, with existing SBS Services CBD 1, 84, 93, 100 &amp; 163, and TIBS 167 &amp; 180 serving the new WTC terminus. It commenced its operations on 13th Jan 1985, replacing the Tg Pagar Rd and Aleaandra Rd Terminus.<br><br>(The terminus was being upgraded in par with the new North East Line connectivity, and was renamed as "Harbour Front Interchange".<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SERVICES AT WTC BUS TERMINUS<br><br>CBD 1 - World Trade Ctr to Orchard Rd (Loop) - Service was extended from Marina Centre to World Trade Centre.<br>84 - World Trade Ctr to Upp Serangoon<br>93 - World Trade Ctr to Paya Lebar Airport (Loop)<br>100 - World Trade Ctr to Serangoon Gaden<br>163 - World Trade Ctr to Jln Kayu<br>167 - World Trade Ctr to Admiralty Rd West<br>180 - World Trade Ctr to Admiralty Rd (Marsiling Est)<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>CURRENT SERVICES AT HARBOURFRONT INTERCHANGE<br><br>65 - HarbourFront to Tampines<br>80 - HarbourFront to Sengkang<br>93 - HarbourFront to Eunos<br>188 - HarbourFront to Choa Chu Kang<br>855 - HarbourFront to Yishun<br>963 - HarbourFront to Woodlands Reg Int<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SERVICES EVER TERMINATED AT WTC TERMINAL / HARBOURFRONT INTERCHANGE<br><br>84 - Hougang Ctrl to WTC (Service withdrawn)<br>85 - Sengkang to WTC (Harbourfront) (Service withdrawn due to NEL Rationalisation)<br>521 - Bt Panjang to WTC (Service renumbered to 963, with the extension of Woodlands Reg Int)<br>865 - Sengkang to WTC (Service renumbered to 85, when 865 became SBS)<br>NR1 - Harbourfront To Yishun (Service extended to RWS)<br>NR6 - Harbourfront To Sengkang (Service extended to RWS)<br><br>In addition, Express Services 188E and 963E also serves the HarbourFront Int and 2 special Parks Services, 408 to Labrador Pk (12 Mar) and 409 to Mount Faber (14 Nov) were introduced both in 2005.</p>

              <p><br>101 was from Serangoon to New Bridge Road and it was withdrawn in Dec 1990.</p>
              <p>100 was amended to WTC from Prince Edward Road in 1985 together with 167, but I don't know when was it amended once again.</p>

              <p>Sv. 100 was extended to Ghim Moh when sv. 20 was withdrawn. At the same time, sv. 111 was made to end at Ghim Moh from Buona Vista when sv. 13 was amended to Yio Chu Kang. Two of my early childhood SBS services gone in one sweep.</p>

              <p><br>Add on service 191 which terminated at Ghim Moh when newly introduced. 191 was later amended to terminate at Buona Vista instead.</p>
              <p>Service 13 was amended to Yio Chu Kang instead of Ghim Moh and on the same day it was upgraded to full aircon service.</p>
              <p>Question: <br>Which aircon bus model did services 13 and 76 had before the OAC Merc 0405s rolled into service in 1990?</p>
