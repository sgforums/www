              <p>In the past the 2 feeders were 214E and 214W. When under Tibs control the feeders were renumbered to 820 and 821. Eventually got renumber them again to 378 and 379 when SBS took back control.</p>

              I vaguely rmb a NAC scania on 88, also loads of DM3500
              like 2754-2757, 2792-2794 appearing, I think 9276 hints the
              provision of Bndep buses back then, though i didnt trace the status
              of buses back then.</p>
              <p>Anyway, my greatest impression is the premiere joyride on 88: A
              dry ride on <strong>NAC</strong> 3773 driven by a helpful (help old
              pple in boarding etc) but slowpoke BC whose bus crawls on

              <p><br>Service 61 did have route changes before, that was in the 80s.</p>
              <p>Initially was between MacPherson Estate and Ulu Pandan, I remember Merc OF1417 Hawkes and Albion Vikings did that route in the past. Ulu Pandan terminal was shut down in 1987 and service 61 was extended to Bt Batok via Clementi Rd and Jln Jurong Kechil. DDs (0305s and LAs) were introduced then.</p>
              <p>Somewhere in 1990 service 61's route was further extended to Eunos from MacPherson Estate via Ubi Ave 2 and Jln Eunos. No route change since then.</p>

              <p><br>i said route changes except extensions. u emntioned only extensions. svc 61 route between machperson to Ulu panadan still tis orginal route in 1969.</p>

              <p>tay Koh yat Seaside bus depot (charming..)</p>
              <p>anyhow they set up one base of operations at Crawfurd St area then known as Hoi how Rd.</p>
              <p>And mostly they (Tay Koh yat) cater to the army croowd in the north . so they ran services to Sembawang naval base and air filed etc . <br><br>by the 1950s, the Singapore Mallacca Express also called ard the area,. thus a bus interchange was formed. No sure if there are any other bus co use the same terminus areas.</p>
              <p>Later in 1969 or 1970, tay Koh yat was merged with some other co to form UBC. <br><br>the new bus numbering system was use. Thus came the UBC 160 and 161 to call at Crawfurd st. TPY was new so came ??? 150. a new svc 195 was introduced as orchard rd and town area needed more links to the West (beiong that kampong Bahru Bus co was being dumb and din into any svc that ran like 195 so that the municipal authorities had to interfere with a new route after the rationalisation into 3 bus co)</p>
              <p>195 essentially served the Mallaca exp servixes and the UBC svcs to YMCA, havelock, Delta and telok blanagh. The service prob ended at Delta bus ter (gagek berat dunno what...) (along with 65, and 196)</p>
              <p>Side tracking UBC 160 became SBS 160. in 1983 i guess became TIB 160. then SMRT 980. 161 which ran paraell to 160 was switftly withdrawn by mid 1980s.</p>
              <p>150 too was found useless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lets concetrate on the 195</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have no idea on this 195. assuming we begin off from the 195 i mentioned above, it was invovled in a feeder service integration. namely svc 203 Bouna Vista - margaret dr (via commonwelath dr north)</p>
              <p>this integration meant that 195 had a new roadisde ter at commonwelath dr north having been extended thru depot rd. ( assume svc 63 then serving depot rd is not invovled in this)</p>
              <p>at the other end it is likely that South Canal is chosen as the new ending terminus.</p>

              <p>i have no idea on this 195. assuming we begin off from the 195 i mentioned above, it was invovled in a feeder service integration. namely svc 203 Bouna Vista - margaret dr (via commonwelath dr north)</p>
              <p>this integration meant that 195 had a new roadisde ter at commonwelath dr north having been extended thru depot rd. ( assume svc 63 then serving depot rd is not invovled in this)</p>
              <p>at the other end it is likely that South Canal is chosen as the new ending terminus.</p>
              <p>this i assume to be 1989,.</p>
              <p>end of crawfurd st ter story.</p>
