                      Typically, Service 30 used to serve Chai Chee to Jurong for a very short while. Majority of its Bedok Town Bus Services terminate at Chai Chee Terminal.

                          Oh.. that's a good question.<br><br>Let me analyse you about the situations about the Reorganisation of Bus Services in 1971 and the 11 bus services that were clustered before the pre-reorganisation. In the pre-Reorganisation days, STC and the 11 chinese bus companies came out with their own numbering systems and if a service that plies in an Alternate direction or its terminating point, it has to be prefixed with 'A', 'B' or so on, so that passengers would not take the wrong bus. One of the major problem faced is that there are many detours, irregular frequency and routing systems, generating unwanted competitions, poor description of its route details, which lead to inconveniences like long delay or a sudden suspension of bus services. There wasn't a proper bus terminal shelter at that time even its re-organisation and only very few amendments/withdrawl/introduction of bus services were made during the pre-Reorganisation. Another problem faced with the 11 Chinese bus companies is that they cannot ply on city or municipal routes becuase STC entirely monopolized the city and municipal areas and the bus stops and terminus are exclusively used by STC and not other companies. The 11 Chinese bus companies had to struggle with the problem and routes in the rural districts were introduced and it must not be plying around the city and municipal areas.<br><br>The possible confusion is one good example - STC Bus 18A, which has 2 routes, Normal and Limited Stop. You would have known that most of the passengers at that time do not possess a bus guide to travel around and no one even knows the timing of STC Bus 18A that operates full route with bus stops and limited stops. STC Bus 18A was known to have 3 different route systems during its peak hours, one bus will terminate at Seragoon Garden Way, another two plies on Northern &amp; Southern Loops each. After 7.30pm, buses will operate alternatively from Brah Basah Rd and Finlayson Rd and after 8.30pm from Bras Basah Rd only.<br><br>During the 1971 Bus Re-organisation, its existing bus routes from 11 bus companies including STC were revamped into new and re-organised routes introduced and the number of bus companies after the re-organisation was 4. The prupose of the re-organisation is to minimise wastage duplication of services and provide an efficient travelling on buses. There was an introduction of Fare Structures, depending on which fare stages a passenger travelled, ranging from 10 c to 50c and with introduction of Student Concession, they can travel for only 10c at no extra charge until 8pm.<br><br>Although after the Re-organisaion of the Bus Companies, the situation did not improve, some passengers do not really know which buses to take (partly because they known of the older routes and unable to get familiarised with the major changes - you would notice still not many passengers can afford to have the Bus Guide with them) and possibly a crew fatigue due to long and irregular bus routes (like 42 and 45), longer waiting time and also off-peak wastage (the bus plies to a bus stop that not many have frequented). This continues for 2 years before the 3 remaining bus companies were formed into SBS in 1973. STC on the other hand, shut down its operations due to serious financial problems and its existing services / bus fleet were forced to be handed over to ABC, ABS &amp; UBC.<br><br>The first rationalisation took place in 1974, which would solve majority of its problem, it was a humble start to make travelling on buses an easier part of their life without having to walk to a bus stop and make different transfers. Several duplicated routes were withdrawn, services were renumbered to avoid confusion and route changes to serve the passengers better. SBS then took another step in the 1978 Jurong Bus Rationalisation, becuase of the Jurong Bus Interchange being constructed and housed all its boarding and alighting points for Jurong Town &amp; Industrial Bus services, rather than a clustered terminus in Jurong Town &amp; Industrial Estates.

There was a feeder 230 in the past, Toa Payoh - Lor 8 (Loop), which was the only feeder service in Toa Payoh, possibly meant for serving new bus stops along Lor 8 &amp; Toa Payoh East. It was said that Toa Payoh Bus Plan &amp; intro of its feeder service was in 1983<br><br>Toa Payoh services were numbered 1XX in the past.<br><br>Let's make a breakdown of the services during its re-organisation.<br><br>Kim Keat Ave:<br><br>141 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>144 - To C'wealth Ave (Near North Buona Vista Rd)<br>148 - To C'wealth Ave / Noth Buona Vista Rd<br>149 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>151 - To South Canal Rd<br>155 - Bedok Rd/Upp changi Rd (via Macpeherson Rd)<br><br>Toa Payoh Lor 1:<br><br>140A - Stamford Rd (Loop Svc)<br>142 - To South Canal Rd<br>145 - To Keppel Harbour<br>146 - To Keppel Harbour<br>149A - Finlayson Green (Loop Svc)<br>150 - To Crawford St<br>152 - To Telok Kurau<br>153 - To Jln Bukit Merah<br>155A - Bedok Rd/Upp changi Rd (via Macpeherson Rd)<br>156 - Upp Serangoon Rd End<br><br>Toa Payoh Lor 6:<br><br>140 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>141A - Finlasyon Green (LOop svc)<br>143 - Jurong Rd 10 ms Market<br>147 - To C'wealth Ave (Near North Buona Vista Rd)<br><br>When the Toa Payoh TOwn Centre Bus terminus opened on 1 Oct 1971, all of its Toa Payoh Services clustered in 3 terminals were called to the new bus terminus located at the town cenre. A few of its services were amended or introduced during the period. The services in 1972 are as follows:<br><br>138 - To St Michael's Est (Loop svc)<br>139 - To Lengkok Bahru<br>140 - To Prince Edward Rd (Via Lor 6)<br>140A - To Prince Edward Rd (Via Lor 1)<br>141 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>141A - To Finlasyon Green (Loop Svs)<br>142 - To South Canal Rd<br>143 - To Jurong Rd 10ms Market<br>144 - To C'wealth Ave<br>145 - To Pasir Panjang Rd<br>146 - To Pasir Panjang Rd<br>147 - To C'wealth Ave<br>148 - To C'wealth Ave/North Buona Vista Rd<br>149 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>149A - To Finlayson Green (Loop Svc)<br>150 - To Crawford St<br>151 - To South Canal Rd<br>152 - To Telok Kurau<br>153 - To Jln Bt Merah<br>153A - To Jln Bt Merah<br>155 - To Bedok Rd/Upp Changi Rd<br>155A - To Bedok Rd/Upp Changi Rd<br>156 - To Uper Serangoon Rd End<br>157 - To Jurong Shipyrad<br>158 - To Opera Estate<br>159 - To Outram Pak<br><br>During the 1974 Rationalisation, which was the first after the merger of 3 bus companies to SBS, services were either being amended/extended/withdrawn<br><br>Withdrawn services: 138, 141A, 149A, 153A, 159<br><br>Other changes for the rationalisation<br><br>73 will call at Toa Payoh instead of Tanjong Pagar Rd.<br>141 and 141A was integrated to form the normal 141 route<br>149 and 149A will follow the 149 route but part of its routings in Toa Payoh has been changed.<br>151 - Re-routing of service but its start and end points remain unchanged.<br>155 - Amended to Kg Chai Chee instead<br>158 - To by pass Opera Estate.<br><br>Renumbering of services:<br><br>140A to 136<br>155A to 135<br><br>As it was mentioned in the Jurong Bus Rationalisation of 1978, Service 157 was later being amended to start from Jurong Bus Interhcange instead.<br><br>Now, let's focus about the Toa Payoh Bus Plan of 1983<br><br>At first existing Toa Payoh services that circled around Toa Payoh Estate had been abolished and replaced with a new set of Toa Payoh feeders, so that services do not clutter along the roads around Toa Payoh. The only solution to avoid the situation is to re-route all of its services that plys around Toa Payoh Estate without having to alter the routes that ply outside of Toa Payoh. It was said that a sole feeder service 230 had been withdrawn and was replaced with new feeders.<br><br>Before that, Lor 1, Lor 1A, Lor 2, Lor 3, Lor 4, Lor 5 were served by many Toa Payoh services and Service 230 only served Toa Payoh East and Lor 8.<br><br>New set of feeder services introduced:<br><br>231 - To Lor 1 Toa Payoh (G/W)<br>232 - To Lor 2 Toa Payoh (G/W)<br>235 - To Lor 3 Toa Payoh<br>237 - To Lor 7 Toa Payoh<br>238 - To Lor 8 Toa Payoh<br>239 - To Kim Keat Ave (withdrawn in 1985)<br><br>- Summary of Toa Payoh Services of the 1970s (amendments/service changes made in the 1980s are in brackets, in addition to the feeders as listed above) -<br><br>73 - To Old Upp Thomson Rd<br>135 - To Upp Changi Rd (later extended to Ang Mo Kio)<br>137 - To Singapore Zoo<br>139 - To Bt Merah Int<br>140 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>141 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>143 - To Jurong Rd 10ms Market (later amended to Penjuru Depot)<br>144 - To C'wealth Ave (withdrawn)<br>145 - To Pasir Panjang Rd (later amended to Buona Vista)<br>146 - To Pasir panjang Rd (later amended to Clementi)<br>147 - To C'wealth Ave (later amended to Potong Pasir)<br>148 - To C'wealth Ave (later amended to Buona Vista)<br>149 - To Prince Edward Rd (later it was re-introduced to Changi Airport)<br>150 - To Crawford St<br>151 - To New Bridge Rd (withdrawn)<br>152 - To Bedok<br>153 - To Toa Payoh (later amended to Upp Serangoon)<br>155 - To Upp Changi Rd 13.3km (later amended to 15.5 km and subsequently to Somapah Termainal)<br>156 - To Upp Serangoon Rd End (withdrawn)<br>157 - To Jurong Int<br>158 - To Kg Chai Chee (later amended to Bedok)<br>159 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>Service B to National Stadium (for special event only)</div>

              <p>I also have clarification about depot management:</p>
              <p>Why 882 is under AMDEP (YIshun group) control, but not WLDEP (Sembawang group)? Since Sembawang is near WLDEP and WLDEP controls all of Sembawang Services.</p>
              <p>Why AMDEP had to handover some of YIBP services (like: 811, 812, 851) to WLDEP? Was it something to do with the introduction of 965 and 969?</p>
