              <p>From RK 2010:<br>"How did Bukit Merah services, Clementi services and Kent Ridge services came about?"<br><br>============================================================<br><br>In the past, Bukit Merah Services terminates at two different terminals. One at Gagak Selari Barat (now known as Jln Bukit Merah) and the another at Redhill Close. Kent Ridge services terminate at Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd) ans South Buona Vista Rd (sv 200). Clementi Services were introduced in 1978 after certain parts of Clementi New Town were developed.<br><br>Below shows the list of the services after the 1971 re-organatisation<br><br>- Services from Gagak Selari Barat (Jln Bukit Merah) -<br>63 - To MacPherson Est<br>65 - To MacPherson Est<br>90 - To Paya Lebar Airport<br>92 - To Paya Lebar Airport<br>93A - To Paya Lebar Airport (was later introduced)<br>153 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>195 - Loops at this terminal from Crawford<br>196 - To Jurong Shipyard<br><br>- Services from Redhill Close -<br>41 - To Telok Kurau<br>41A - To Joo Chiat Rd<br><br>- Services from Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd) -<br>33 - To Changi Rd (near Siglap Rd)<br>145 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>146 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>192A - To South Canal<br>201 - To Jln Jurong Kechil<br><br>- Services from South Buona Vista Rd -<br>200 - To Up Bt Timah Rd (10 ms)<br><br>During the 1974 rationalisation, certain alternate routes were withdrawn to aviod duplication of existing service that ply on the same route.<br><br>90 - To by pass Paya Lebar Rd<br>92 - Amended to ply at the Jln Bukit Merah Terminus (near Rumah Bomba Circus)<br>93A - Service withdrawal<br>192A - Renumbered to 192<br>196 - Amended to Prince Edward Rd<br>200 - Amended to Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd)<br>201 - Amended to Toh Tuck Rd with integration of former 207.<br><br>Now let's emphasise about the late 1970s till the 1980s of the Bt maerh, Kent Ridge &amp; Clementi Services<br><br>Bukit Merah Services were quite sketchy in the past, compared to the 1971 re-organisation. They were terminating in different parts of Jln Bukit Merah like Service 50 from Kaki Bukit Malay Settlement (Jln Eunos) to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd) and Service 65 from MacPherson to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd). Those services were clustered in different locations making it inconvenient for other passengers, which began a critical point to re-organise its Bt Merah services into one interchange, so the need of a centralised bus service hub is needed for Bukit Merah. The Bukit Merah Interchange was completed and commence operations in 1980.<br><br>Kent Ridge Services were termianted in a new location at Clementi Rd, previous location was at Pasir Panjang Rd, which is known as the Kent Ridge Ter on which the name 'Kent Ridge' was taken from the NUS Kent Ridge Campus as well as the proposed Kent Ridge Hospital (now known as NUH).<br><br>Clementi Services has a terminal at Clementi Ave 3 (Os Blk 437), which temporary houses the Clementi Services including feeder 284 as the new interchange is still under construction. It was a roadside terminal as well. The bus interchange was completed in 1984.<br><br>More feeders were added for the and Clementi areas. This allows residents from both estates to have direct and convenient links to the town centres of Clementi rather than taking its regular trunk services to get around and a walking distance just to get to the town centres. Off peak wastage could be a possible reason as to why certain services are taking a long time to arrive at the bus stops.<br><br>- List of services in Clementi in the late 1970s -<br>74 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>176 - To Crawford St<br>185 - To C'wealth Ave<br>186 - To Anson Rd<br>191 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>209 - To Crawford St<br>284 - To Clementi Ave 4 (Loop)<br><br>- List of services in Clementi in 1985 -<br>74 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>75 - To Empress Place (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>76 - To Jurong East Ave 1 (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>92 - To Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) [extended from Alexandra Rd]<br>95 - To Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) [extended from Ulu Pandan Ter]<br>96 - To Kent Ridge Cres (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>146 - To Toa Payoh [extended from Pasir Panjang Rd]<br>186 - To Shenton Way [extended from Anson Rd]<br>205 - To Jalan Anak Bukit (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>209 - To Crawford St<br>282 - To Clementi Ave 5 (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>284 - To Clementi Ave 4 (Loop)<br>285 - To Pandan Loop (Loop) [newly introduced<br>287 - To Clementi Ave 2 (Loop) [newly introudced]<br><br>Here are the Clementi services that were introduced/amended/withdrawn from the 1980s to present.<br><br>7 - Route extends to Clementi in 1982.

              <p>Actually, 162 did terminate at Lor 1 Geylang. It is just after Lor 1 Geylang Terminal was offically accomodated to let SBS &amp; TIBS services terminate at the terminal. 162 loop at Lor 3 Geylang before terminating at the upgraded terminal.</p>

              <p>About Jurong East services.</p>
              <p>The first service to the infant Jurong East New Town was 76.  It was introduced in Nov 1981 as a loop service between Clementi Interchange and Jurong East Ave 1 (loop at Jurong Town Hall Rd and return via Boon Lay Way), charging a flat fare of 40c.</p>
              <p>The first trunk route to end at the Jurong East Terminal was 79 (introduced in 1982, I presume), which looped at Bras Basah Rd. The Jurong East feeders 333, 335 and 334 were gradually introduced as more flats were completed.</p>
              <p>Since 79 duplicated the route of 147 between C'wealth Ave and Hill St, in 1984, 79 was withdrawn and 147 extended to cover its route between C'wealth Ave West and Jurong East Central. During this period also, 7 was extended to Jurong East; services 97 and 98 were introduced. The original 97 was via Clementi Rd and Pasir Panjang Rd.</p>
              <p>Jurong East Bus Interchange opened in 1 June 1985 and with it come a few changes. Most notably, of course, was the relocation of the present services  to the new site. 99 was introduced (Jurong East - Boon Lay Garden), 79 was resurrected as a loop service from Jurong East - Empress Place (later it would terminate at Marina Centre) and 76 was amended and became a loop service from Jurong East to Clementi. 335 was amended and 336 was introduced.</p>
              <p>76 was withdrawn in 1987 when 99 was modified to run between Clementi - Jurong West St 91. In 1988, 79 was withdrawn and 97 was amended to cover Alexandra Rd and AYE while 51 was extended to Jurong East from Labrador via Pasir Panjang Rd. The present 79 was the 3rd coming, introduced in 1992.</p>

              <p><br>It used to terminate at Bukit Panjang roadside terminal before 1992. After that, amended to terminate at Chua Chu Kang. Leyland Atlanteans, Albion Vikings were used then. After that we see the VO2xes, LO3xes and VO3xes serving 190 before TIBS handover.</p>
              <p>Those were the days. Wish there wasn't such handovers then. Bus services could have been better now if it is still under SBS.</p>
