              <p>That was in the later parts of the numbering system.<br><br>92x - Bt Panjang Services (920-924 range)<br>92x - Services that ply Sg Kadut / Mandai areas (925-929 range)<br><br>SMRT do not intend to re-number other services for no purposes unless there is a major amendments or re-routing in its service. Eg. 181 was renumbered to 961 becuase it was amended to Lor 1 Geylang Ter, and 175 was renumbered to 975 becuase of the changes of the routing system.</p>

              <p>The first service to the infant Jurong East New Town was 76.  It was introduced in Nov 1981 as a loop service between Clementi Interchange and Jurong East Ave 1 (loop at Jurong Town Hall Rd and return via Boon Lay Way), charging a flat fare of 40c.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first trunk route to end at the Jurong East Terminal was 79 (introduced in 1982, I presume), which looped at Bras Basah Rd. The Jurong East feeders 333, 335 and 334 were gradually introduced as more flats were completed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since 79 duplicated the route of 147 between C'wealth Ave and Hill St, in 1984, 79 was withdrawn and 147 extended to cover its route between C'wealth Ave West and Jurong East Central. During this period also, 7 was extended to Jurong East; services 97 and 98 were introduced. The original 97 was via Clementi Rd and Pasir Panjang Rd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jurong East Bus Interchange opened in 1 June 1985 and with it come a few changes. Most notably, of course, was the relocation of the present services  to the new site. 99 was introduced (Jurong East - Boon Lay Garden), 79 was resurrected as a loop service from Jurong East - Empress Place (later it would terminate at Marina Centre) and 76 was amended and became a loop service from Jurong East to Clementi. 335 was amended and 336 was introduced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>76 was withdrawn in 1987 when 99 was modified to run between Clementi - Jurong West St 91. In 1988, 79 was withdrawn and 97 was amended to cover Alexandra Rd and AYE while 51 was extended to Jurong East from Labrador via Pasir Panjang Rd. The present 79 was the 3rd coming, introduced in 1993.</p>

              <p><br>Just to add on. During the service amendments in connection to the opening of Boon Lay Interchange in 1990, 197 was amemded to ply via Jurong Town Hall Rd, Jurong East/West Ave 1 and Boon Lay Ave. Somewhere in 1991?, 198 was shortened to end at Jurong East, but it still went to Sims Place. In 1992?, there was a reversal when 197 was cut back to end at Jurong East and the present 198 was formed to cover its route to Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>What is the reason behind to cancel 189A (Orginal 189 route from BBT to West Ferry Terminal (Loop)) route in which TIBS decided to shorten 189 route to Kent Ridge Terminal?</p>

              <p>I know. But what was the reason behind it to cancel 189A (Old 189) route?</p>
              <p>Only allow trucks go inside Ferry Terminal, but not buses?</p>
