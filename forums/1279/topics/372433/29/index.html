              <p><br> I believe that I've mentioned the Sembawang, Yishun &amp; Punggol ones, maybe you can check the previous pages of this thread.<br><br>Hmm, did i mention about Sengknag service? I dun think so, So i will just post here.<br><br>------------- HISTORY OF SENGAKNG SERVICES --------------<br><br>Sengkang New Town, was in the midst of development, since 1997, when the URA Master Plan was unveiled to include 2 new towns - Sengkang &amp; Punggol which is located at the north-east side of Singapore. Sengkang was named after a rural road named Lorong Sengkang off Punggol Rd and bound by Cheng Lim Farmway roads, just like the rural roads in Bukit Panjang - the current roads in Bukit Panjang were also named after the rural roads.<br><br>As the north eastern bus services in Singapore were under the TIBS territory, Sengkang fell under TIBS territory, when its very first bus service, 860, from Sengkang to Hougang South (St 21) was introduced on 12 Jun 1998.<br><br>This service was generally useful to travel to Sengkang, without having to take a long walk after alighting from bus 82 that travels along Punngol Rd. To extend its coverage and to make improvement to its linkage to Sengkang, service 860 was extended to WTC terminus on 13 Dec 1998, renumbered to 865.<br><br>864 was introduced from Sengkang to Marina Centre which was on 15 Nov 1998.<br><br>Another service, 866, which ran from Sengkang to Ang Mo Kio from 28 Feb 1999, was actually an extenstion from Jalan Kayu to serve Sengkang new town, previously known as TIBS 59.<br><br>When the North East Line contract won by the SBS, the company had decided to take over the 3 services from TIBS and exchange for Service 190 from Choa Chu Kang. As for CCK, SBS services were handed to TIBS in stages, making CCK to become TIBS terrotry and Sengkang to become SBS Territory. This took place on 25 Jul 1999.<br><br>Few months after SBS took over the Sengkang bus service, there were 2 feeders and 1 trunk servce introduced later that year - feeders 371 and 372 and trunk 87. 371 loops at Compassvale Dr and 372 loops at Anchorvale Rd. and 87 from Sengkang to Bedok. 87 was the service which gets its demo VSO bus (SBS9888Y) with a Mobitec flip dot EDS.<br><br>The renumbering and amendment took place on 12 Dec 1999:<br>864 (Sengkang - Marina Cenrte) and 84 (Hougang Ctrl - WTC) became 80 (Sengkang - WTC)<br>865 (Sengkang - WTC) became 85<br>866 (Sengkang - Ang Mo Kio) became 86.<br><br>Other noticeable changes from 1999 to current:<br>27 was extended to Sengkang from Tampines [extended to Hougang Ctrl in end 2002]<br>83 was introduced as Sengkang to Punggol Field (Loop) in end 2001 [amended to ply Sengkang East Rd, extended to Edgedale Plans and subsequently to Punggol Int]<br>85 was withdrawn on 27 Jul 2003 (NEL Rationalistaion)<br>119 was introduced from Sengkang to Upp Sernagoon Rd on 14 Sep 2003<br>156 was extended to Sengkang from Serangoon on 29 Jul 2001<br>159 was extended to Sengkang from Ang Mo Kio<br>163 was amended to Sengkang (skipped Jln Kayu Ter) on 29 Dec 2002.<br>371 was amended to Anchrvale Lane and then re-routed to loop at Sengkang West Ave as part of Sengkang LRT (East Loop) Rationalisation [it was withdrawn when Sengkang LRT (West Loop) opens on 12 Mar 2005]<br>372 was amended to loop at Punggol Rd on 28 Oct 2007<br>Express 501 - extended to Sengkang in Sep 2000 but was withdrawn during the NEL Rationalisation<br>Express 502 - extended to Sengkang in Sep 2000 but was shortened to loop at Marina Crentre during the NEL Rationalisation<br>Express 508 - Peak-Hour Express Service from Sengkang to Penang Rd [service was shortened to Hougang Ctrl with the extension of 501 to Sengkang and this service was renumbered to 511 but withdrawn due to NEL RAtionalisation]<br>TIBS 965 - Sevice from Woodlands to Sengkang from 7 Jul 2002. This service apparently make a comeback to Sengkang after 3 years, when TIBS services in Sengkang were handed to SBS.</p>

              <p><br>Kangkar New Town started construction in 1995 at Rivervale. But even before the New Town started construction, there were already a few block of 4 storeys HDB flats in the area. The name of the town was renamed to Sengkang in 1996. Lorong Sengkang was actually off Lorong Buang Kok, not Punggol Rd. Part of Lorong Buang Kok is today's Sengkang East Way.</p>
              <p>The North Eastern (Punggol and Sengkang) bus services were under Tibs from 1995 to 1999 only. 1995 was the year when bus services in Punggol, Kangkar (now Sengkang), Bukit Panjang, Jalan Kayu, Seletar and Yishun (service 171) came under Tibs.</p>
              <p>Tibs lose the tender to operate NEL and had to give up control of Punggol, Sengkang, Jalan Kayu and Seletar back to SBST, and in return, took Choa Chu Kang, Lim Chu Kang and Bukit Batok under its control.</p>
