              <p>Service 265 never merged with 267. It merged with 266. 267 was withdrawn itself.</p>
              <p>Service 268 only plied outside the interchange, without going up Ang Mo Kio Ave 8.</p>
              <p>Note that why the two were Townlink services although they only plied a loop direction because they plied two ways between the interchagnge.</p>

              <p>ABOUT ANG MO KIO BUS SERVICES (latest updates)<br><br>At first, when Ang Mo Kio New Town is still currently under development in the 1970s, there were 2 terminals situated - one at Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (os Blk 324) and the other at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (opp Blk 202). In fact, there was a feeder 260 that serve from AMK Ave 6 to St 22/24. Initially, there was only one terminal, Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (os Blk 324) and because as there are more services terminating at Ang Mo Kio New Town, another termporary terminal was constructed at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (opp Blk 202).<br><br>- List of Ang Mo Kio Services in 1979 -<br><br>From AMK Ave 3 (os Blk 324)<br>25 - To Bedok<br>74 - To Clementi<br>132 - To Tomlinson Rd (Loop)<br>138 - To Shenton Way<br>165 - To Jurong<br>166 - To New Bridge Rd<br>168 - To Orchard Rd (Loop)<br>169 - To Woodlands<br><br>From AMK Ave 6 (opp Blk 207)<br>133 - To North Bridge Rd<br>136 - To Upp Serangoon Rd (End)<br>159 - To Toa Payoh<br>162 - To Sims Ave (Loop)<br>260 - Loop Service to St 22/24<br>261 - Loop Service to Ind pk i<br>262 - Loop Service to Ave 2<br><br>In fact, the Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 terminus was known as the "Ang Mo Kio Interchange" for most residents living in Ang Mo Kio.

Amended to ply Hougang Ave 3 and then Kent Ridge Cres in 1994. On 15 Feb 2004, service extended to Hougang Ctrl Int with the closure of Hougang South int.<br>183 - Service introduced as Kent Ridge to Jurong East. It was amended to loop via Science Park Rd in Oct 2005.<br>189 - Service loops at Kent Ridge Ter<br>200 - Service re-routed to serve Buona Vista Ter in Dec 2006<br>201 - Service withdrawal due to MRT rationalisation.<br>202 - Service withdrawal in 1993. Part of 202 route became part of 74.<br>216 - Service withdrawal in 1990.<br><br>On a side note about 216, there were mixed reactions by NUS students who were being left out with the withdrawal of 216 and had to take the alternate bus 96 to NUS, which leads to long queues in the Clementi Bus Interchange.<br><br>Exteacted from a TNP article on 27/7/1990:<br><br>"The withdrawal of a bus service to the Kent Ridge campus from April has upset some undergraduates because it now takes longer to get to their classes."<br><br>"The National University of Singapore Students Union (Nussu) said the withdrawal has led to long queues at the Clementi interchange for service 96."<br><br>"As a result, some students spend more time travelling, Nussu said. It added that its feedback showed that many undergraduates wanted a return of service 216."<br><br>"An SBS spokesman said a new bus service, No. 95, was started in January. It connects Buona Vista MRT Station to NUS/National University Hospital near the science faculty."<br><br>"Moreover, the savings from scrapping services 216 had been channeled to improve service 96."<br><br>"SBS said service 216 was getting less popular, so it was scrapped."<br><br>"With the MRT now serving major housing estates, many NUS students have switched to service 96, which provides the link to the nearest MRT station, at Clementi."<br><br>"Although service 216 linked NUS to the MRT system at Buona Vista, it was less popular as the transfer between bus and MRT involved a long walk, SBS said."<br><br>"Also the trip by service 96 between NUS and the MRT station is some 2km shorter than that by service 216."<br><br>Certain factors on why 216 was withdrawn was been drawn out and explained in detail by SBS. That's why 216 was never being re-introduced, despite many feedbacks from the NUSSU to get the service 216 back and they had no choice they had to take 95 or 96 to get to NUS campus.<br><br>============================================================</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>=========================================================<br><strong>HISTROY OF NEW BRIDGE ROAD BUS SERVICES</strong><br>=========================================================<br><br><strong>1) Year 1971 - Its humble days.</strong><br>New Bridge Rd Bus Services began its humble days at a small bus terminus at New Bridge Rd/Neil Rd, as part of the 1971 Bus Reorganisation. Back then, there were still clustered bus terminals around New Bridge Rd such as Outram Park (where sv 159 used to terminate).<br><br>Its bus service back then was operated by the 4 bus companies:<br><br>ABS 81 from Upp Changi Rd (near Tampines Rd)<br>ABS 81A from Upp Serangoon Rd ((6½ ms)<br>ABS 83 from Punggol Rd End<br>STC 101 from Serangoon Gerden Est<br>STC 101A from Serangoon Garden Est<br>UBC 154A from Jln Besi (Mobil Refinery)<br>UBC 164 from Sembawang Rd End<br>UBC 173 from Princess Elizabeth Est (Upp Bt Timah)<br>UBC 174 from Nanyang University<br><br>(The ABC bus company does not opearte any services that terminates at New Bridge Rd)<br><br><strong>2) Year 1971 - 1973</strong><br>Minor changes made between the range of 1971-73,.<br><br>- A new service by UBC, Service 160A from Rotterham Gate (HM Naval Dockyard) was introduced.<br>- Secondly, with the revokation of STC public bus license, STC 101 and 101A were handed over to ABS.<br><br>3) 1974 Bus Rationalisation<br>When the 3 remaining bus companies had merged to form the new SBS bus company in 1973, its first rationalisation took place on 3rd Feb 1974.<br>Only Service 31 was made to re-route to avoid any route duplication and unneccessary diversion and service 101A was withdrawn. A new service 183 from Benoi Rd to New Bridge Rd was then introduced and the rest of the "A" vairant was then renumbered.<br><br>Affected services:<br>31 - Route changes from Kg Chai Chee to New Brisge Rd<br>81A - Renumbered to 85<br>101A - Service withdrawal<br>154A - Renumbered to 209.<br>160A - Renumbered to 167.<br><br>New Service:<br>183 from Benoi Rd to New Bridge Rd<br><br><strong>4) Year 1975 - 1979</strong><br>Between the above years, there were more services to New Bridge Rd, plying from various new towns, to link up and provide easier access to New Bridge Rd without having to transfer. Another reason is partly because, its older bus terminus were integrated to a bigger bus terminus in New Bridge Rd, thus its older bus terminus ceased to operate and re-located into a proper bus terminal, which also gives a green light to phsed out roadside bus terminus. A special service, CBD2, from Holland Rd Fringe Car Park was introduced, to "supplement" the CSS, to provide links to Orchard Rd and loops at New Bridge Rd via North Bridge Rd/South Bridge Rd.<br><br>A variety of bus services serving New Bridge Rd Terminal were listed below as of circa 1979:<br><br>11 from Upp Changi Rd 13.3km [previously terminates at Tg Pagar Rd/Anson Rd]<br>81 from Upp Changi Rd [No route change]<br>83 from Punggol Rd End [no changes in route]<br>101 from Serangoon Gdn Est [no changes in route]<br>123 from St Michael's Est [previously terminates at Kg Bahru Rd/Keppel Rd]<br>126 from St Michael's Est [previously loops at New Bridge Rd]<br>151 from Toa Payoh New Twon [previously terminates at South Canal Rd; extended to New Bridge Rd]<br>164 from Sembawang Rd End [no change in route]<br>166 from Ang Mo Kio [nwe service]<br>173 from Princess Elizaberth Est (Upp Bt Timah) [no change in route]<br>174 from Nanyang University [no change in route]<br>182 from Admiralty Rd Ter [route extended to Marsiling Rd and made to extend to terminate at New Bridge Rd instead of looping at Shenton Way]<br>183 from Jurong Int [route extended to Jurong Int as part of the 1978 Rationalisation of Jurong Town Bus Sercices.]<br>CBD 2 from Holland Rd Fringe CP [it is a loop service]<br><br><strong>5) Year 1980 - 2010</strong><br>Between the range, there were major changes which had taken place over the past 30 years till the present time.

              <p>Service 81 did not ply Stamford Rd and Prinsep St, instead it ply bi-directional along Victoria St and Middle Rd. Before the route amendment, it did ply Waterloo St together with service 147 and 163. The reason why they no longer ply Waterloo St wasn't due to the pedestrian mall but was due to permanent closure of Waterloo St between Stamford Rd and Bras Basah Rd.</p>
