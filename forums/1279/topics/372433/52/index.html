            <div class='col-md body'><p>HISTORY OF MARINE PARADE TERMINAL<br><br>Its Humble Years...<br>Back then, Marine Parade Estate was in a development stage when more land in the eastern part of Singapore was under reclamation in par with the East Caost Park. With new residents from shanty rural districts moving to Marine parade estate, one of its bus service had been amended to Marine Terreace.<br><br>Service 15 was the first service to be terminated at Marine Terrace, on 4th July 1976. The terminal was just a road-side one, just outisde Blk 54. At the same time, Service 15 was also amended to become a loop service from Marine Parade to Shenton Way (it was cease to termiante at Prine Edward Terminal)<br><br>It was known that Marine Terrace Terminal was being resited to opposite Blk 52 on 27th Mar 1977, when Services 15 and 16 would run its route from Marine Terrace, Marine Cres, Marine Parade Rd and continue alonh its usual route.<br><br>FACT!<br>Service 16 was the first service to serve Telok Blangah Estate.<br><br>AN OVERVIEW...<br>Marine Parade back then has 2 services terminating at its estate<br><br>15 - Marine Terrace to Shenton Way<br>16 - Marine Terrace to Telok Blanagh Heights<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>EXPANSION OF MARINE PARADE BUS SERVICES<br><br>To accomodate more buses and to avoid the over-crowding of buses at Marine Terrace, a plot of land was set aside to built the new Marine Parade Terminal, situated at Marine Parade Rd and Siglap Rd. It was known that both bus services, 15 &amp; 16 were then terminated to the new terminal in 1981/82.<br><br>Service 135 was then amended to terminate at Marine Parade Teeminal and loops at MacPherson Estate before another round of extension to Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>Serice 211 and 213 was the only known feeder services in Marine Parade<br><br>211 plies from Marine Parade to East Coast Rd and 213 plies from Marine Parde to Opera Estate.<br><br>A few years later, 196 from Jurong to Prince Edward Rd was extended to Marine Parade Terminal, with the integration of 15 and 196. (With 196 covering the old route of 15, service 15 was then withdrawn)<br><br>So we have 15, 16, 135, 211 and 213 terminating at Marine Parade Terminal as described in the Bus Guide 1985.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>ITS AMENDMENTS BACK THEN &amp; SERVICES THAT USED TO TERMINATE AT MARINE PARADE RD TERMINAL...<br>13 - Yio Chu Kang - Marine Parade [was previosuly terminated at Eunos, it was then extended to Marine Parade via Still Rd, Still Rd South &amp; Marine Parade Rd]<br>15 - Pasir Ris - Marine Parade [With the integration of 13 and M4, it was then extended to Marine Parade]<br>16 - Bukit Merah - Marine Parade [Service was extended to Changi Airport with the merger of 16 and 149 to form 16. Another round of amendments back to Marine Parade Terminal, was the amendment of 36 to Changi Airport]<br>55 - Re-introduced as Ang Mo Kio to Marine Parade. (The service was extended to cover Bishan New Town. It was one of the FAC services in this introduction, along with 53 and 54)<br>76 - Yio Chu Kang to Marine Parade (It was one of the few FAC services back then. The 8 former SABS buses were then served 76 after the withdrawal of 118)<br>135 - Ang Mo Kio to Marine Parade<br>155 - Toa Payoh to Marine parade (previously from Toa Payoh - Somapah, it was amended to Paya Lebar Rd/Geylang East Central as part of the TL Intergated Transport Exercise)<br>196 - Clementi to Marine Parade (this service had several amendments. It was relocated from Jurong to Boon Lay, then Buona Vista and thereon, Clementi)<br>853 - Yishun - Marine Parade (Alternate service Operates on Sundays &amp; PHs)<br><br>211 and 213 was withdrawn.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>CLOSURE OF MARINE PARADE TERMINAL ON 16 SEPT 2001<br>With the acquistion of the land by the Land Office, the bus terminal will have to be closed to make way for new Victoria School development, which had announced that it would be completed in the next few years as part of the school's expansion programme.<br><br>All of its Marine Parade Services were then amended to loop at Siglap Rd with the exception of 196, which extended its route to Bedok.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>UPPER EAST COAST TERMINAL<br>The Upper East Caost Terminal was erected and completed in Mar 2002. Tenders by LTA were called up for the proposal of the new bus terminal along Upp East Coast Rd in Jan 2001. However, the new terminal was not heavy utilitzed as there were only 2 services, 13 and 853C terminating there. Service 13, was the first bus service to be terminated at Upper East Coast Ter, with the only amendment via Upp East Coast Rd.<br><br>(Until today, the terminal is not heavy utilized, only a few passengers had taken its bus services from that terminal, just like the Tuas Bus Terminal. If you are intending to go to that terminal, the Canteen and the Passenger Service Centre stays empty until now. But its bus services terminating at Upper East Caost are still popular among passengers.)<br><br><br>In 2005, saw another 2 new services that is to be terminated at Upper East Coast terminal. This introduction back then was to keep up with the efforts that SBS had made and to progress with better links, quality of service and proper route structure.<br><br>43 - Punggol to Upp East Coast (Introduced on 23 Oct 2005)<br>48 - Buona Vista to Upp East Caost (Introduced on 3 Jul 2005)<br><br>Another service, Express 506, amended from Bedok to Upp East Coast on 12 Nov 2006.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>TIBS SERVICE 966<br>To cater Woodlands residents for quicker links to Marine Parade, a new Service 966 was introduced on 16th Nov 2003 to provide links from Woodlands to Marine Parade via the BKE/PIE. Previously, passengers would take 168 to Bedok and 196/197 to Marine Parade. It generally saves 40% of the travelling time with Service 966.<br><br>On 7th Jan 2007, the service was then amended to serve Bukit Panjang New Town, via Bt Panajng Rd, Pending Rd, Petir Rd and Dairy Farm Rd. Like the above, Bt Panjang residents did feedback about the faster links to Marine Parade from Bt Panjang, saying that they would either take:<br>- 75/700/970 to Shenton Way and transfer 196 to Marine Parade<br>- 171 to Marina Centre and change 36 to Marine Parade<br>- 184 to Clementi and 196 to Marine Parade<br>- 67 to Bedok and transfer on to 196/197 to Bedok<br>- 960 from Bt Panjang to Victoria St and change 197 to Marine Parade.<br>- 961 to Bt Merah and 16 to Marine Parade<br>(these route taken, to the passengers in Bt Panjang, isn't a good route as it is costly and incur long travelling time inclusive of waiting/transfer time)<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>CURRENT SERVICES AROUND MARINE PARADE ESTATE &amp; SIGLAP RD<br><br>Marine Parade Rd:<br>13, 15, 16, 31, 43, 48, 55, 76, 135, 196, 197, 401, 853(C), 966<br><br>Siglap Rd (near former Marine Parade Ter):<br>36, 55, 76, 135, 155, 401<br>-----------------------------------------------------------</p></div>

              <p>It's been a while for me to contribute the history of bus services. hmm, let's see what I'll should contribute, maybe I'll go for the Yishun bus services<br><br>I'll go briefly on how Yishun New town was developed. Initially, that part of the Sembawang Rd (around Nee Soon/Chong Pang Village) stretch stands 2 new blocks (Blks 101, 102 and the 4 precedding blocks 103-106) around the small satellite town which was known as Nee Soon new town. Even its road name was known as Nee Soon Ave 5, Nee Soon ring Rd before Nee Soon new town was renamed as Yishun new Town because this town was expected to expand its developemnt on other parts and fully developed by the end of 1989, other blocks in the 7xx series (blks 701, 702, etc) were still under construction, although villages/kampongs were cleared due to the redevelopemnt of the residential area. With the renaming of the New Town, the roads were also being renamed as Yishun Ring Rd, Yishun Ave 5, etc<br><br>Now let's go on to its bus services.<br><br>It's very obvious that none of its bus services catering at the pre-development of Yishun New Town. However, noticably some of the bus services that ply along Sembawang Rd like 160, 161, 164, 167 &amp; 169, although those service served along the block of HDB flats that are situated adjacently to Sembawang Rd.<br><br>Those 5 services were then handed over to TIBS in 1983, and as early as 1984, because Yishun fall under the Northern boundaries of Singapore, the services as well were fully operated by TIBS, with the rapid developemnt of the Yishun New Town. There were only 4 services from TIBS at the start, 2 were feeders and the ohter 2, were trunk services.<br><br>Feeders:<br>800 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun St 71 (Loop)<br>801 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun Ave 7 (Loop)<br><br>Trunks:<br>850 - Yishun Central to Bt Merah (via Thomson Rd and enters Marina Centre on Suns &amp; PHs))<br>851 - Ysihun Central to Bt Merah<br><br>Both Yishun Ave 5 and Yishun Central terminus was only a small temporary bus terminal for feeders and trunk services respectively, awaiting for its bus interchange to be completed in 1987, which generally coupled conveniently to the new Yishun MRT station and the proposed shopping Centre at the Yishun Town Centre (presently known as Northpoint).<br><br>Before the interchange opened to the public in 1987, here was the newly introduced services that operated from Yishun Ave 5 and Yishun Central Terminus in additional to 800,801,850, 851.<br><br>Feeders From Yishun Ave 5<br>802 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun Ave 3 (Loop) [ introduced in 1986]<br>803 - Yishun Ave 5 to Yishun St 61 (Loop) [introduced in 1987]<br><br>Tunk from Yishun Central<br>852 - Yishun to Jurong [introduced in 1986]<br>853 - Yishun to Marine Parade/Lor 1 Geylang [introduced in 1987]<br>854 - Yishun to Bedok [introduced in 1987]<br><br>When the interchange opened, all of its Yishun serivces were amended to call at the new Yishun Bus Interchange.<br><br>Yishun services introduced/amended /withdrawn after 1987 to present date (Minor amendmnets are not included)<br>39 - Tampines to Yishun (SBST service, introduced in 2003)<br>85 - Punggol to Yishun (SBST service, introduced in 2005)<br>171 - Yishun to Marina Centre [SBS service extended to Yishun from Sembawang (Mandai Rd) terminus in 1987 and amended to Marina Centre from Queen St, amended to Bt Panjang in 1993, skips Mandai Lake Rd in 1994, handed to TIBS in 1995, and services 171 and 927 exchanges its route along Mandai Rd and Woodlands Rd in 1999, which means that 171 will ply BKE and Bt Panjang Rd while 927 ply Mandai Rd and Woodlands Rd]<br>520 - Express service from Yishun to Chinatown [introduced in 1997, withdrawn due to the NEL]<br>801 - Yishun to Yishun Ave 5 [amended to Yishun Ave 5 when int opened.

Service 13, was the first bus service to be terminated at Upper East Coast Ter, with the only amendment via Upp East Coast Rd.<br><br>(Until today, the terminal is not heavy utilized, only a few passengers had taken its bus services from that terminal, just like the Tuas Bus Terminal. If you are intending to go to that terminal, the Canteen and the Passenger Service Centre stays empty until now. But its bus services terminating at Upper East Caost are still popular among passengers.)<br><br><br>In 2005, saw another 2 new services that is to be terminated at Upper East Coast terminal. This introduction back then was to keep up with the efforts that SBS had made and to progress with better links, quality of service and proper route structure.<br><br>43 - Punggol to Upp East Coast (Introduced on 23 Oct 2005)<br>48 - Buona Vista to Upp East Caost (Introduced on 3 Jul 2005)<br><br>Another service, Express 506, amended from Bedok to Upp East Coast on 12 Nov 2006.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>TIBS SERVICE 966<br>To cater Woodlands residents for quicker links to Marine Parade, a new Service 966 was introduced on 16th Nov 2003 to provide links from Woodlands to Marine Parade via the BKE/PIE. Previously, passengers would take 168 to Bedok and 196/197 to Marine Parade. It generally saves 40% of the travelling time with Service 966.<br><br>On 7th Jan 2007, the service was then amended to serve Bukit Panjang New Town, via Bt Panajng Rd, Pending Rd, Petir Rd and Dairy Farm Rd. Like the above, Bt Panjang residents did feedback about the faster links to Marine Parade from Bt Panjang, saying that they would either take:<br>- 75/700/970 to Shenton Way and transfer 196 to Marine Parade<br>- 171 to Marina Centre and change 36 to Marine Parade<br>- 184 to Clementi and 196 to Marine Parade<br>- 67 to Bedok and transfer on to 196/197 to Bedok<br>- 960 from Bt Panjang to Victoria St and change 197 to Marine Parade.<br>- 961 to Bt Merah and 16 to Marine Parade<br>(these route taken, to the passengers in Bt Panjang, isn't a good route as it is costly and incur long travelling time inclusive of waiting/transfer time)<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>CURRENT SERVICES AROUND MARINE PARADE ESTATE &amp; SIGLAP RD<br><br>Marine Parade Rd:<br>13, 15, 16, 31, 43, 48, 55, 76, 135, 196, 197, 401, 853(C), 966<br><br>Siglap Rd (near former Marine Parade Ter):<br>36, 55, 76, 135, 155, 401<br>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
