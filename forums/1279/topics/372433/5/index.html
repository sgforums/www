              <p><br>I remember 61 had 9213U - 9224M series. I think even though it had the consecutive regoes, but in between the regos were buses from bbdep, hgdep didn't take the entire series for 61 alone. I am wondering were those buses shift from hgdep to bbdep in the beginning.</p>
              <p>9213U came to bndep from hgdep.</p>
              <p>9214S 9216L 9217J were from bbdep.</p>
              <p>9215P 9219D 9220Z went to amdep from hgdep.</p>
              <p>9218G 9222T 9223R 9224M retained in hgdep. 9224M went to bndep in 2003.</p>
              <p>9221X I've got no idea. I thought it went amdep.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, 1753E was regular to services like 95 96 191 etc.</p>
              <p>58 got MK2s from hgdep: 1707P 1710D 1722U 1746B (HG SP)</p>
              <p>57 got MK2s from slbp: 1706S 1745D (157), 1747Z (182), 1748X (333), 1771C 1773Y 1775S (335), 1792S (333), 1814M (335), 1843D (SP)</p>
              <p>These 10 were then transfered to bndep for 32 &amp; 66 when bndep took over these 2 services in 2005. 7 got 985J 986G 992M from amdep 21 &amp; 124. hgdep converted 32 into PAC soon before the transfer, and 1701E 1702C 1711B were given to bndep for 32.</p>
              <p>52 59 got MK2s from arbp: 1708L, 1712Z, 1717K, 1720A, 1721Y, 1725L, 1726J, 1727G, 1741P, 1774U<br>The 1st 4 were deployed on 52, while the last 6 deployed on 59.</p>
              <p>These 10 were transfered to bndep in exchange for MK4s from bndep. 9 was greatly affected. Most of its MK4 DMs were sent to amdep and 923M was the sole survivor in 9. That was when 9 started to get older buses, from a SD fleet of MK4s to MK2s to CRBs.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, most of the MK2s that came to bndep since 2005, some of them actually forms a series. Nice.</p>

              <p>1772A didn't come because of its ad.</p>
              <p>1731T went over to slbp in exchange for a few NAC MK2s like 1783T 1786K 1791U 1862Z 1864T etc (if there were more). 1731T still came back to hgdep in the end.</p>
              <p>slbp sent off 182 MK2s to hgdep (1728D 1742L 1825G 1888A etc). The JE feeders cleared their MK2s too.</p>
              <p>Yes, hgdep sent a few MK2s over to arbp to serve 175. 1842G swop for 1927X from 273.</p>

              <p>Well these are from HGDEP!.  later the buses were given to 83 and / or 50 when 390 started getting Scania N113CRB and OAC from BNDEP. this was when 390 went over to BNDEP leaving HGDEP control..

              <p><br>Yup, I remembered service 390 with Albion Viking fleets in the 80s.  In 1989 service 390 got upgraded to Volvo MK2 fleets, followed by Scania N113CRB fleets and later it was converted PAC then FAC with OAC Scania N113CRBS and Merc 0405s. </p>
              <p>Service 1 (Changi Village - Delta) also had MK2s too before it was withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Service 9 also had Volvo MK2s too in 1989. That time it was still terminating at Geylang Lor 1.</p>
              <p>The BBDEP took in most of the WAs. It was first deployed on service 174, followed by services 75, 105, 176, 189, 190 etc. Service 170 started to get MK2 WAs in 1993 replacing Volvo B57s.</p>

              for the empty space in hgdep, 159 went from amdep to hgdep.</p>
              <p>1701 1702 1711 were xferred to bndep from HG SP to do 32<br> HG 32 Mk3s and HG 66 Mk4s were spreaded around to 80 147 159</p>
              <p>All S57 Mk2s went to bndep for 32 and 66.<br> Most 159 Merc ended up on 57, rest went to 21 and 124 cos their
              B10Ms were xferred to BN also.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intro of 43 52
              59</span></strong><br> bbdep transfered Mk2s to amdep for 52 and 59, rest of the fleet
              made up of spare merc</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-IMF Depot
              Transfer<br></span></strong>As amdep's fleet is generally made up
              of older buses, they took in mainly Mk4 DMs from BN in June 2006
              and threw out all their Mk2s, some Mk4s and some N113s .</p>
              <p>Mk2s from 52 59 went to bndep to do 9 15 66.<br> Mk4s from BN went straight to perm services that go to town,
              resulting in 52 59 getting full Merc fleet.</p>
              <p>and so on and so forth since then...</p>

              <p><br>That was temporary. The move lasted at least 10 days.</p>
              <p>97 took Batch 3 VOs from bbdep. Can't recall all, but guessed these were those used: 9589K 9591C 9601H 9605Y 9606U 9607S 9610G 9611D 9628G 9639A 9640U 9641S 9664B 9665Z. Should be less than that. Thse VOs did cameos as well, like 179/242, etc</p>
              <p>133 took VOs from 88</p>
              <p>56 took 131's MK4s. Basically if you know which Volvo service which doesn't serve the suntec area are affected.</p>
