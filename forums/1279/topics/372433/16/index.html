              <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
              <p>I am very interested to know what happened to Princess Elizaberth bus terminal in the early 1990s, which houses service 192 and 193. What happened to it?</p>
              <p>When did SBS 173 went to cover Hillview area?</p>
              <p>Any ideas on the above.</p>
              <p>I hope you can share more of the lists of these bus service changes in major new towns in the 1970s and 1980s in future. I am thinking of compling them together and do a print out for easy references. Thanks a lot.</p>

              <p><br>I'm certain that 192 never made an appearance in Princess Elizabeth. Its route covered South Canal, Pasir Panjang and eventually to Jurong. 193 came to end at Princess Elizabeth after having its route cut short from Bukit Panjang Circus around 1981. An interesting point for sv. 193 was that it had once served two 'royalties', its route displayed Princess Elizabeth at one end and Prince Edward on the other. This happened after services at Anson Rd terminal was shifted to new facilities at Prince Edward Rd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>173 was the 'pioneer' service for Princess Elizabeth and, as pointed out by 8533C, could've started operations in the pre-SBS era of the early 1970s.</p>

              <p>Of course I know the famous Renualt PR100.3 model, one of the most mysterious demonstrator in SBS history, because of its famous story of its unknown disapperance. Although I had not rode in it nor seen it in person before.</p>

              <p><br>The Renault wasn't intended for SBS in the first place. It was actually being delivered to Australia but stopped over in SG for a short trial with SBS.

              <p>Hmm...I think it survived a bit longer. maybe 1991 or 92?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>So 168 is the first air con service by SBS in 1984, and second is service 3 is in 1987(?), then third is service 118 (1988) and fourh is service 76 (1988) and then service 390 (198_?). Am I right???</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, the chronology is in that order.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I would like to ask, which air con services in the late 1980s (before Scania N113CRB air con buses are introduced) uses the following air con buses???</p>
              <p>- Leyland Victory</p>
              <p>- Mercedes Benz O303</p>
              <p>- Volvo B10M Vanhool demonstrator</p>
              <p>- Nissan Diesel U31</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>- The Leyland Victory were first used on 76 and 3. Also used on 390 and 8 as well as other services.</p>
              <p>- The Merc 'O303' was actually an OF1413 with bodywork built locally by Chua Heng. It was first used on 168.</p>
              <p>- The Volvo B10M Van Hool was first used on 3. It was then used on 118, 111 and finally 9 before resigning to become a training bus.</p>
              <p>- Nissan U31SCN were first used on 3. Also used on 118, 13, 15 with small appearences on other services before becoming training buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>When was the Leyland Victory and Mercedes Benz O303 air con buses deregistered??? I don't see them by the mid 1990s already.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Roughly in the beginning of the 1990s. I last rode the Merc "O303" in 1991.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Yep, the BACos were usually seen on 140 while the Metal Sections were last seen on 159 before they are all deregistered in the early 1990s. Leyland Olympians 2 axles were also introduced on 140 when new.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The DDs were redeployed to svs. like 140 and 141 due to poor response from svs. 86 and 6. Only sv. 159 was able pull in the crowds. (86, 6 and 159 were the first three DD routes)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I see. But when was service 86 withdrawn and why???</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sv. 86 was a semi-express service which charged a flat fare (40c initially but this became 70c by 1982, the year which I think it was withdrawn). It was intended for long distance commuters and hence does not cater for short distance travellers who consisdered its flat fare as excessive. There were also other services plying the same route and going to the same destinations which charged less.</p>

              <p>Same here. Somehow Dennis double deckers seems to be unpopular here. And same goes for the Scania BR112 double decker demo, returned to UK after a short period.</p>
              <p>I think since the 1980s, Singapore and Hong Kong had already decided on the brands of their double decker fleets, Singapore - Leyland/Volvo, Hong Kong - Dennis. Till now we can only see majority Volvos in SBST and majority Dennis/Alexander Dennis in KMB/CityBus/LWB.</p>
              <p>Same goes for the Leyland Leopard demo. It's demo period was also very short. I don't even know such a bus model exist till recently. Don't know what service it piled during SBS days in the 1980s.</p>

              <p>Same as the Volvo Ailsa B55 demo, I had seen it quite a few times on service 65 when young but never got to rode it. Now regretted.</p>
              <p>Not sure about the Willowbrooke demo of the O305, probably it had rarely been in service in the early 90s before deregistered. Heard it was on service 111 in 1988/89. Also never took the O305 demos before.</p>
              <p>How about demos like the following and what services they served???</p>
              <p>- Ford Type B-1617</p>
              <p>- Isuzu BDTIZCHSS -&gt;(exported after 1 year trial)</p>
              <p>- Nissan UAZDN</p>
              <p>- Mercedes Benz OF1417 (Supreme Star bodied demo)</p>
              <p>- Hino AK176MA</p>

              <p>I don't know about its amendment to Tampines in 1992. But it's
              only for such a short period before service 4 was withdrawn in

              <p><br> Oh ok, no wonder I still see the public housing in the 1992

              of bus services in major new towns again, starting from the older
              towns like Clementi, Bukit Merah, Marine Parade, Jurong East, etc

              <p>I guess it was answered below.</p>
              <p>Buses used for TIBS in the 1980s (before Hispano DAFs are introduced):</p>
              <p>Nissan UDs, 2 types, the U31URCN (Back sliding door type) and another variant U31__(Not sure) (Back folding door type, with super high front seats at the front wheel axles, seat hand grips all white, deployed on 856 before). Possible there is an air con version of the U31SCN(Not refering to CACs). UDs are mainly on 178.</p>
              <p>Hino RK176 (shorter rounder Hinos), 2 types, 1 is the Back <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mid positioned</span> folding door, another, AK176, is Back <span style="text-decoration: underline;">end positioned</span> folding door, with front grille (the only TIBS bus model with back door at the back of the bus, before the last row of seats). I think 169 use this bus, since most bus services (160,161,164,167) along Sembawang Rd used them.</p>
              <p>Hino HT228KA (angular designed Hinos), Back mid positioned <span style="text-decoration: underline;">folding</span> door, deployed on 181 and 182.</p>
              <p>Hino HT238K (angular designed Hinos), Back mid positioned <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sliding</span> door, deployed on 181 and most Woodlands feeders.</p>
              <p>Hino HT238K air con version (angular designed Hinos), Back mid positioned <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sliding</span> door, deployed on 950 and 951 before.</p>

              <p>182 went to New Bridge Rd, 950 to Shenton Way and 952 to marina Center.</p>
              <p>Prior to handover to TIBS in the mid 1980s, SBS operates Woodlands New Town.</p>
              <p>169 - Woodlands To Ang Mo Kio<br>178 - Woodlands To Boon Lay (When was 178 amended to Woodlands from Upp Bukit Timah Rd???)</p>
              <p>180 - Woodlands To Anson Rd<br>181 - Woodlands To Crawford Street<br>182 - Woodlands To New Bridge Rd</p>

              <p>372 - Woodlands To Masiling Rd (Loop)</p>
              <p>169 and 178 had double deckers before, which was the Leyland Atlanteans, with Alexander Walter L type bodies. Most services in Woodlands under SBS used the Mercedes Benz buses, DM bodied OF1413s, Soon Chow bodied OF1413s, etc. Possible there were also Volvo B57s in some Woodlands services during SBS days.</p>
              <p>I hope SBS8533C will provide more historical info about Woodlands bus services during pre SBS days (before 1973), during SBS days (after 1973) and the period TIBS took over (around 1986/87).</p>

              <p>Questions about Volvo B57s:</p>
              <p>1. What did the "7 Turbo 6" signage on the big front grille meant??? 7 litre engine, and 6 speed automatic???</p>
              <p>2. Which were the Volvo B57s being to converted to have air con ducts for driver seats??? Regos???</p>
              <p>3. Was there a B57 being converted to a full air con bus before??? If so, which bus (rego) was it??? Which depot did the modifications and it was based in which depot??? Which service it ran before???</p>
              <p>4. Which were the last B57s being deregistered??? The ones based on Bedok North or Ayer Rajah??? Regos and year???</p>
              <p>5. What happened to the Volvo B57 that involved in a serious accident in the late 1980s??? It piled on service 220, and crashed into many places around Bedok New Town before coming to a halt in Bedok Interchange. Was it scrapped or repaired??? Rego and year of the accident???</p>
              <p>6. Why are the designs of the 2 batches of Volvo B57 different, as in the design of the top canopy of the raised front route display board, one flat, one rounded, when they were newly acquired in the 1980s???</p>
              <p>7. What happened to the B57 Soon Chow built Dumple Metsec demostrator??? Is it exported after a year or it was with SBS throughout its lifetime??? When was it deregistered then???</p>
              <p>8. I remembered that the interior of the B57s are fully wood panel designs from driver onwards to end. Anyone can confirm???</p>
              <p>9. I saw a picture of a B57 chassis in Soon Chow anniversary book. It had a newer generation front rims, like those on the Volvo Olympian 2 axles. I am certain it is a B57 because of the front engine layout. Did SBS change this rims to the older designed ones when the bus was built up??? Why SBS did that???</p>
              <p>10. The NZB and DM(demo) bodied B57s had center back service number holder. Was it used in public operations before??? If so, for how long??? Why was it not successful??? When was the year that they eventually put a SBS logo behind??? Same for the NZB and Hawke Mercedes Benz OF1417s???</p>
              <p>10 questions about a bus model, and so as you can see, it is my favourite single decker during childhood times.</p>
              <p>I would gladly appreciate to those who can answer my above quries about the Volvo B57s. Thanks a lot.</p>
