                  Firstly, SBS did used sort of running numbering system back in 1970's. Hence it's possible that next rego is a SD or DD.
              Next, SBS did not have e MKIV when Senosa Sv first came about, MKIII was the newest in SBS's fleet.

              <p>1st: alrdy mentioned 1696 - 1895 are MK2. You disputed tat 1695 cannot be LA as what you claimed.</p>
              <p>2nd: You disputed MKIII was never used on Sentosa though there are picture and evidence tat the SC MK4 only appeared 1 yr later.</p>

              <p>For your both points:</p>
              <p>1st: I don't know LA serve 1637 - 1695 at first and I thought all buses were Mark IIs.</p>
              <p>2nd: I also don't know Mark IIIs serve Sentosa earlier on.</p>
              <p>Both of your points I realised my mistake, but it's you who claimed that I say Mark IIs serve Sentosa. So I think you should go and get your claim clear.</p>
