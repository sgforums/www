              <p><br>Before that, service 88 was introduced, the only SBS service when Sengkang was still under TIBS. The fleet upgraded very fast, from non air con Scania N113CRBs to air con Volvo Olympians, B10Ms, Leyland Olympians after a short span of about 6 months.</p>
              <p>Service 864 had Volvo Olympians and B10Ms for its short span of service before it merged with service 84 to become service 80.</p>
              <p>In the 1980s, when Sengkang was not developed, there are only two bus services to Punggol end.</p>
              <p>Service 82, Punggol Road End - Shenton Way, mainly used Volvo B57s and after that, Volvo B10Ms MKIIs.</p>
              <p>Service 83, Punggol Road End - New Bridge Rd, used Mercedes OF1413s (DM bodied) and after that, Volvo B10Ms MKIIs.</p>

              <p><br>Don't forget the VSO perm before they were replaced by B9TLs.<br>Yes, 9030, 9133, 9135, 9138 etc used to 72 perms. They were also replaced by B9TLs too. Svc 13 was benefitted from getting LO3x perms after SP for awhile.<br>SBS9002L was the solo LO3x perm before it was being replaced by one of buses.<br>So,  SBS9002L AMDEP 72&gt; AMDEP SP&gt; SLBP 79 (now)</p>

              <p><br>This service 80 (Tampines - Hougang Central) was introduced due to the modification of the TPE / Elias Rd / Tampines Rd junction in 1996, with the opening of the stretch of TPE between Lor Halus and SLE. Vehicles can no longer proceed straight from Elias Rd to Tampines Rd and vice-versa, therefore service 81 was amended to ply Pasir Ris Dr 12 instead to get to TPE, skipping the eastern part of Tampines Rd. Service 80 was introduced to replace the deleted sector of service 81 along Tampines Rd and also to provide passengers in Hougang a faster link to Tampines town without going thru Pasir Ris.</p>
