              <p><br>Not all Marine Parade Services fell under BNDEP. For services like sv 13 &amp; 76, it was all along AMDEP.<br><br>Most of the OAC Scanias that did 55 came from BNDEP. It was only then, small portions of OAC were depot xfered to AMDEP/ BRAM, when several of its NAC Scanias were converted to CAC and to improvise the standards of Air Con Services and at the same time converting some PAC services into FAC. (For example, Toa Payoh feeders would only use OAC or CAC Scanias, as the service was declared FAC)<br><br>If you realise back then, OAC Scanias were new to BNDEP and had done 3, 8, 66, 390. Service 8 was the first service to had square side destos with major destination listings.<br><br>When those OAC Scanias went to AMDEP/BRAM, those buses would appear on 155, 157, 231, 232, 235, 238, 410 together with CAC Scanias.</p>
