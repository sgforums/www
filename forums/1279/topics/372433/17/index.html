Services 169, 178, 181, 204 and 208 were called at the new Interchange. Service 204 was the first service that called from the Woodlands Interchange (it was neither introduced from Admiralty Rd, and the service goes to the Sg Kadut Industral Estate, when the industrial estate is developed to resettle several existing factories from nearby rural areas).

              <p>How many air con Hinos HT238Ks and Nissan UDs were there in TIBS fleet in the late 1980s??? When they were derigistered, mid 1990s??? Since when and how long did the air con Nissans did on 852???</p>
              <p>When SBS was on the operations in Woodlands, was it Ang Mo Kio, Woodlands or Ayer Rajah depot controlled or a combination of them???</p>
              <p>Not to forget some of the SBS NZB bodied Mercedes Benz OF1417s were painted into TIBS colors to serve SS7 because TIBS had a shortage of buses back then. Think it happened in 1989 to 1990.</p>
              <p>Maybe next to go is to Hougang South/Central and Punngol bus services history. :)</p>

              <p><br>Hino BF177s??? How do they looked like??? I had never seen them before.</p>
              <p>For services at Admiralty Rd West, Sembawang Road End and Nee Soon Camp (160,161,164,167,171), how do the services came about before SBS took over in 1973??? Is there any other services other than these which might have withdrawn when SBS took over??? And I seen in other forums that Sembawang services under SBS used Volvo B57s before, how true is this claim???</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Bus services which started as FAC aircon in the past:<br>79, 138, 156, (Before extension to Sengkang) 186</p>
              <p>After Feeder services had converted to PAC, those 3 services received those NAC Merczs from feeders.</p>
              <p>When all DM Merczs had converted to aircon, those 4 buses became FAC once again.</p>
              <p>However, when AMK feeders became FAC, those LO2x permers were spread to 136, 186 etc....</p>
              <p>And 79, 156 received some of MK2 permers.</p>
              <p>So, only 138 was only remain FAC service all the way.</p>

Service 169 goes from Admiralty Rd and Marsiling Dr and continues its route to Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 via Admiralty Rd West. Services 180, 182 and 208 plys from Admiralty Rd and pass through Woodlands Town Centre.<br><br>Service 178 and 181 was believed to have been extended to Admiralty Rd terminal for a very short while in 1980 after it was being amended to call at Woodlands Bus Interhcange.<br><br>The Woodlands Bus Interchange was opened on 29 Nov 1981. Services 169, 178, 181, 204 and 208 were called at the new Interchange. Service 204 was the first service that called from the Woodlands Interchange (it was neither introduced from Admiralty Rd, and the service goes to the Sg Kadut Industral Estate, when the industrial estate is developed to resettle several existing factories from nearby rural areas). Services 180 and 182 remains at Admiralty Rd Terminal.<br><br>IN early 1982, Feeder Service 372 from Woodlands to Marsiling Rd (A loop svc) was introduced to cater the Marsiling residents.</p>
              <p>The services were then handed over to TIBS in 1983 by phases.<br><br>- Summary of Woodlands Services -<br>169 - Woodlands To Ang Mo Kio<br>178 - Woodlands To Jurong<br>180 - Admiralty Rd to WTC<br>181 - Woodlands To Crawford St<br>182 - Admiralty Rd to Anson Rd<br>204 - Woodlands To Sungei Kadut Est (Loop, charges Step Fare)<br>208 - Woodlands To Kranji Way (Loop, charges Step Fare)<br>372 - Woodlands To Marsiling Rd (Loop, feeder)<br><br>To avoid confusion between Admiralty Rd and Admiralty Rd West, the Admiralty Rd Terminal was known as Marsiling Terminal because of the HDB flats in teh Marsiling area.<br><br>In late 1984, a proposed second feeder service 900 was planned for the later phase of Woodlands New Town developments. It was started off as Woodlands to Woodlands St 13 loop service in mid-1985. In late 1985, Service 204 and 208 was being merged to form service 925, with the Sg Kadut route on ordinary days (Mon-Sat) and alternate route to Kranji Way on Sunday &amp; PHs. Service 925 was the only flat fare services which issue bus tickets and charge at a flat fare of 60c<br><br>925 - Woodlands to Sungei Kadut Ave (Loop) (Mondays to Saturdays)<br>925 - Woodlands to Kranji Way (Loop) (Sundays &amp; PHs)<br><br>A thrid feeder was started in 1987. Service 901 was introduced as Woodlands - Woodlands St 81 service and thereafter, the fourth feeder, Service 902 from Woodalnds - Woodlands St 32 in 1989.<br><br>Service NS1 (a special shuttle from Woodlands to National Stadium) was introduced in 1989. This service only operates from 1800-1900 from Woodlands and After Events back to Woodlands. The operating details would be published on newspapers and posters at Woodlands Int as well as along bus stops that plies the NS1 route.<br><br>Service 926 was introduced as a Sunday &amp; PH service with a flat fare of 70c. It plys from Woodalnds to Singapore Zoo (loop service)<br><br>Service 950 (Marsiling - Shenton Way), the first full fleet Air-Con service was introduced in 1989, with 10 Air Con Hino Ht238K buses (TIB380K to TIB389L) plying on Service 950. Other buses like the 2 OAC Nissan Diesel buses (TIB279X and TIB280R) from 852 also settled on 950. TIB390G, another Nissan bus joins the service 950 fleet.<br><br>IN 1990, 3 more services were introduced. Service 951, 952 and SS7.<br><br>Service 951 was introduced as Marsiling to Jurong Service, designated to be a Full AirCon fleet. DAF Hispanos were brought in to do service 951 as well as Service 950.

              <p><br> 900, 901, 902 and 904 only loops at the old Woodlands Checkpoint terminus. 905 and 906 doesn't loop there.<br><br>In addition, 911, 912 &amp; 913 continue serving the Woodlands Checkpoint terminus until Mar 2003 when the terminus can no longer be used for buses to enter. The problem is that the old bus bay in the terminus is frequently used for illegal parking since 2001, when mototrists were unable to find a proper parking lots in the car park. It was sealed up to curb illegal parking.</p>
