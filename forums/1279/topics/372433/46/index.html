              <p>HISTORY OF CITYBUZZ SERVICES</p>
              <p>Citybuzz Services were introduced by SBS Transit on 13 December 2004. The concept name is a pun of " city bus services", which means bus services plying in th city. The CityBuzz services are offered on aircon double deckers and will stop at each bus stop every 10-15 minutes. All CityBuzz buses will spot a different service plate from the normal SBS Transit buses and commuters can identify them by looking out for a friendly bee at the bus stops and in front of the buses. Like a monorail, CityBuzz will call at all designated stops without the need to press the bell for stop. A chime will be sounded at every stop to alert passengers. Fares for CityBuzz are at $1 a trip by ez-link card or cash. A $5 CityBuzzPass is also available for unlimited rides on all CityBuzz services for a day. CityBuzzPass is available at all TransitLink Ticket Offices and authorized sales agents. There were three services, named C1, C2 &amp; C3.</p>
              <p>The routing of the three services is shown below:</p>
              <p><strong>Citybuzz C1 - The Orchard Route</strong></p>
              <p>Marina Centre Terminal, Raffles Avenue, North Bridge Road, North Boat Quay, River Valley Road, Clemenceau Avenue, Havelock Road, Zion Road, Paterson Road, Orchard Road, Bras Basah Road &amp; Raffles Boulevard.</p>
              <p><strong>Citybuzz C2 - The Chinatown Route</strong></p>
              <p>Marina Centre Terminal, Raffles Avenue, Connaught Drive, Collyer Quay, Cross Street, South Bridge Road, Kreta Ayer Road, Eu Tong Sen Street, High Street &amp; Temasek Boulevard.</p>
              <p><strong>Citybuzz C3 - The Little India Route</strong></p>
              <p>Marina Centre Terminal, Raffles Avenue, Victoria Street, Rochor Road, Rochor Canal Road, Serangoon Road, Kitchener Road, Jalan Besar, Ophir Road, Beach Road and Raffles Boulevard.</p>
              <p>However, 2 years later, due to declining demand, the Citybuzz services were subsequently withdrawn on 1 January 2007. Its last day of operation was 31 December 2006.</p>

              <p>HISTORY OF SMRT EXPRESS SERVICES</p>
              <p>(Due to space constraints, the information of Express Services for SBS Transit &amp; SMRT were given in different posts.)</p>
              <p>In 1997, TIBS introduced the first Express Service 520, from Yishun - New Bridge Rd. It follows the route of NR1 closely, until NR1's amendment to loop around Yishun town instead of terminating at the interchange from Harbourfront.</p>
              <p>In 1999, TIBS introduced the second Express Service 521 from Bukit Panjang to Harbourfront (World Trade Centre at that time). The routing details had been given by someone who also posted here. In 2002, due to no express route on this service, it was converted to trunk service, extended to Woodlands Interchange and renumbered 963.</p>
              <p>In 2003, Express 520 was withdrawn (not during the NEL Rationaliasation, but on 24 August itself).</p>
              <p>In 2006, the Express concept for SMRT made a comeback when the company introduced 963E, a peak hour one-way service from Woodlands to Harbourfront, skipping some stops from the original route of 963.</p>
              <p>In 2007, Express 854E &amp; 188E were also introduced.</p>
              <p>In 2009, Express 963E was converted to two-directional service from Woodlands to Harbourfront during the morning peak, and vice-versa in the evening peak.</p>

              <p>HISTORY OF STADIUM DIRECT SERVICES</p>
              <p>Stadium Direct Services were only introduced once by SBS Transit on 23 December 2005. There were four services from Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Boon Lay &amp; Tampines.</p>
              <p>The routing of the four services are shown below:</p>
              <p>The Ang Mo Kio Route</p>
              <p>Stadium Walk, Mountbatten Road, Sims Way, PIE, CTE, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, 10, 3, 4, Yio Chu Kang Rd, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, Yio Chu Kang Terminal.</p>
              <p>The Bedok Route</p>
              <p>Stadium Walk, Mountbatten Road, Guillemard Road, Paya Lebar Road, Sims Avenue, Jalan Eunos, Bedok Reservoir Road, Bedok North Avenue 3, Bedok North Street 1, Bedok Interchange.</p>
              <p>The Boon Lay Route</p>
              <p>Stadium Walk, Mountbatten Road, Fort Road, ECP, AYE, Buona Vista Flyover, AYE, Jurong Town Hall Road, Jurong East Central, Jurong East Avenue 1, Boon Lay Avenue, Jalan Boon Lay, Boon Lay Interchange.</p>
              <p>The Tampines Route</p>
              <p>Stadium Walk, Mountbatten Road, Guillemard Road, Paya Lebar Road, PIE, Tampines Avenue 2, Tampines Street 32, Tampines Street 34, Tampines Street 45, Tampines Avenue 9, Tampines Street 41, Tampines Avenue 7, Tampines Interchange.</p>
              <p>Stadium Direct services will charge a flat fare of $2 for adult and a flat fare of $1 for student, child or senior citizen paying by ez-link card or cash. Concession rate and e-stamp will not be applicable for these services.</p>
              <p>As Stadium Direct services are deployed for selected events, posters will be put up at the four terminating bus interchanges and terminal as well as at bus-stops that these services call at to inform commuters whenever these services are available. Commuters can also log on to the SBS Transit website to find out more about Stadium Direct services.</p>
              <p>On 18 June 2006, The Boon Lay Route was amended to Boon Lay Temp Int along Jurong West Street 64, calling at an additional stop along Jurong West Street 3.</p>
              <p>On 27 December 2009, The Boon Lay Route was amended back to the new interchange.</p>
              <p>It is not known what happened to the services in the end.</p>

              <p>HISTORY OF STADIUM DIRECT SERVICES</p>
              <p>Stadium Direct Services were only introduced once by SBS Transit
              on 23 December 2005. There were four services from Ang Mo Kio,
              Bedok, Boon Lay &amp; Tampines.</p>
              <p>The routing of the four services are shown below:</p>
              <p>The Ang Mo Kio Route</p>
              <p>Stadium Walk, Mountbatten Road, Sims Way, PIE, CTE, Ang Mo Kio
              Avenue 1, 10, 3, 4, Yio Chu Kang Rd, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, Yio Chu

              terminal as well as at bus-stops that these services call at to
              inform commuters whenever these services are available. Commuters
              can also log on to the SBS Transit website to find out more about
              Stadium Direct services.</p>
              <p>On 18 June 2006, The Boon Lay Route was amended to Boon Lay Temp
              Int along Jurong West Street 64, calling at an additional stop

              <p>I dun remember seeing any NAC Hinos doing service 188 before, the NAC fleet were mainly 0405s. Service 188 was made FAC mainly due to the fact that all the NAC 0405s were converted to AC buses.</p>
              <p>OAC Scania Striders made its 1st appearance on service 178 only in Oct 1998 when WLDEP started operations and 178 went under partial WLDEP. Before that service 178 was mainly DAFs from KJDEP.</p>

              For your information, Stadium Direct Services are STILL around. Just that currently there are no events ending in the late hours at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
              
              Apparently, those Stadium Direct Services usually operates at the late hours and heads back to the respective bus interchanges. It does not start from the interchange to the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

This service only operates only on Suns &amp; PHs on selected timings only.<br><br>Not many have noticed that Pasir Ris (in the past there was Kampong Pasir Ris which is off Loyang Rd) was once a fishing village, which coupled together with Loyang area, facing the sea and the famous Pasir Ris Bach Chalet Resort and the pasir ris park. But until in the late 1980s, several HDB flats were completed in Pasir Ris mainly block 1xx and the NTUC Pasir Ris Resort (now Downtown East) was also erected just around pasir Ris Close/Pasir Ris Dr 3.<br><br>The only service, whcih was the first service to terminate at Pasir Ris terminal at Pasir Ris Dr 6 was service 12, which was extended from Somapah Terminal because that terminal was closed permanently in 1989 and at the same time shortened to New Bridge Rd.

              <p>I dun remember seeing any NAC Hinos doing service 188 before,
              the NAC fleet were mainly 0405s. Service 188 was made FAC mainly
              due to the fact that all the NAC 0405s were converted to AC
              buses.</p>
              <p>OAC Scania Striders made its 1st appearance on service 178 only
              in Oct 1998 when WLDEP started operations and 178 went under
              partial WLDEP. Before that service 178 was mainly DAFs from
              KJDEP.</p>

              NAC Hinos did cameo on 188, together with the NAC Mercs, such as TIB790K. Those NAC Hinos were mainly from KJDEP 172 and KJDEP 175.

              <p><br>In the early days of Pasir Ris, service 403 can be "considered" the first service in the rural district of Pasir Ris village. Interestingly, the Nissan Civilian rego-ed SBS8000Z to SBS8003R were the pioneer mini buses that used to serve 403 before scattering around as Chartered services. (SBS8000Z and SBS8001X were re-registered to the current Sunlong Buses, just like the SBS5XXX series)<br><br>Noticeably that 400 401 403 charged fare stages and not flat fares although it was classified as Parks Services.</p>
