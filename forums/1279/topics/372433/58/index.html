              <p><br>Service 980 during the beginning days of WLDEP operations in 1998-1999 was worst off with majority Nissan UD fleets (the above mentiones were perms only during this period), after which 980 became full AMDEP controlled due to the SBS/Tibs swop.</p>
              <p>In Jan 2001, service 980 came back under partial WLDEP again, this time round with full Scania fleets (565U 658K 665P 666L 672T 673R). There were Nissan UDs from WLDEP too but not very common then.</p>

              <p><br>Yup, the deployment became very messy for service 980 ever since Sept 2004.</p>
              <p>Mercs I would say they appear on service 980 once in a while on weekends, regardless of AMDEP or WLDEP.</p>
              <p>In 2006, these 4 were perm under WLDEP 980: TIB658K TIB665P TIB673R TIB1254K (3 Scanias and 1 s-shift Nissan UD). CSS183U replaced TIB1254K later that year.</p>
              <p>In May 2008, changes were made again. 2 AP duties from WLDEP were handed over to AMDEP. TIB673R and CSS183U left, TIB934M and TIB939A becoming perm from AMDEP side. TIB658K became perm s-shift.</p>
              <p>Ever since then, TIB658K and TIB665P had been the only perm service 980 under WLDEP side. More WLDEP buses will appear on weekends to replace the missing AMDEP slots (AMDEP will have any 2 perm buses that don't operate on Sundays). This messy arrangement had been made since Nov 2007.</p>

              <p><br>someone mentioned 242 was cut because of duplication w/ 99.</p>
              <p>When there was only N7, N8 &amp; N9 to begin with, there wasn't much road for 99 &amp; 242 to use.</p>
              <p>To me 175 &amp; 188's case is all because of e MRT. SBS could concentrate onto improving the feeder svs or corridors w/o e MRT w/ the MRT commencement. </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I don't remember any dates but the chronology of events is something like this. In the beginning, the only access to JW N9 was via Pioneer Rd Nth. Both 99 and 188 would turn in from Upp Jurong Rd (now JW Ave 3). When N7 and N8 were occupied, it was 188 which was first amended via Ave 5 &amp; St 72. Eventually, 99 was also amended along the same route and everything was cool until the opening of Boon Lay Int/MRT.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">175 was amended and 242 was introduced. So, for a while, JW St 91 was happily served by 4 services: 99, 175, 188, 242. Service 175 was a CMI case after its amendment. The buses were always empty, although it was nice to see an Albion Viking going round the bends. :-) And so, due to poor ridership, its sayonara 175.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">As for 188's case, its duplication. The main purpose for 188 was for the JW Ext residents to gain access to Jurong Bus Interchange and Lakeside MRT. So when the MRT and interchange at Boon Lay was completed, it became redundant and its ridership wasn't as strong as before. And so, arrivederchi 188 and we are left with 2 services again; 99, 242.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Then somewhere along the line came 243. If I'm not mistaken, when 243 came, it took over the route via JW St 72, Ave 5 &amp; Pioneer Rd Nth. 242 was amended to go via Upp Jurong Rd, Pioneer Rd Nth. This chapter was a bit confusing as changes took place back and forth between 242 and 243. Eventually when St 81 was completed and 243 was made to serve that area while 242 got back its original route.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Route enhancements were made to 243 later on but as far as 99 and 242 were concerned, that was the end of the story until 2009, when Pioneer MRT was opened and I'm sure everyone knew what happened then. ;-)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">That's the end of my long winded tale. This is pure memory work from my experience as a JW resident of over 20 years. There's bound to be mistakes and some things which I've missed out. Hence, I'd like to apologise beforehand. Thank you.</span></p>
