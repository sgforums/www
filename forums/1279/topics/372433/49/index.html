In fact, there was a feeder 260 that serve from AMK Ave 6 to St 22/24. Initially, there was only one terminal, Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (os Blk 324) and because as there are more services terminating at Ang Mo Kio New Town, another termporary terminal was constructed at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (opp Blk 202).<br><br>- List of Ang Mo Kio Services in 1979 -<br><br>From AMK Ave 3 (os Blk 324)<br>25 - To Bedok<br>74 - To Clementi<br>132 - To Tomlinson Rd (Loop)<br>138 - To Shenton Way<br>165 - To Jurong<br>166 - To New Bridge Rd<br>168 - To Orchard Rd (Loop)<br>169 - To Woodlands<br><br>From AMK Ave 6 (opp Blk 207)<br>133 - To North Bridge Rd<br>136 - To Upp Serangoon Rd (End)<br>159 - To Toa Payoh<br>162 - To Sims Ave (Loop)<br>260 - Loop Service to St 22/24<br>261 - Loop Service to Ind pk i<br>262 - Loop Service to Ave 2<br><br>In fact, the Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 terminus was known as the "Ang Mo Kio Interchange" for most residents living in Ang Mo Kio.

              <p><br>118 was a new service. 118 and 168 co-existed at one point in time so it was unlikely that 118 was formed as a result of the amendment to 168. This in addition to the different routes and 'loop point' of the two.</p>

              <p>168's aircon service was withdrawn earlier and its fleet transferred to 118, which may have given rise to the confusion. 118, although the 3rd aircon service by SBS, was essentially the first full aircon service from new. 168 can be considered as 'partial aircon' while sv. 3, although 'full aircon', was converted from an existing route.</p>

              <div>Service 238 was left to cover up the link that the current 232 has skipped, minus the stop at United Medicare Ctr, where 57 now stops. On 31 July 2005, Service 57 was introduced to create new links for people living along TPY Lor 6 to town area where there is no trunk/passing through service passing.(As Passing through services only go through Lor 6/4/central/lor 2 and out) With the introduction of 57, it did help in relieving the overcrowding of people boarding 238. In Jan 2010, 235 was amended to serve Lor 6, Toa Payoh East before resuming on it's normal route to ease 238's overcrowding situation. As a result, only 1 bus stop( Lor 4 Toa Payoh-Near Storehub) was skipped and 1 pair of stop along Toa Payoh East was created to better serve people living at that area where there was no bus serving there at all.</div>

              <p><br>To be exact, it was on 1st November 1973, that these 3 bus companies were merged to form SBS. However, STC was still around although it has its public bus license was revoked at the end of 1971, after which, its shareholders remained and sometimes Annual General Meetings were held. Its full liquidation of the company was heard in early 1979 and there were plans to wind up its business in 1978, due to the general slowdown in 1973 and quiet market stock operations back then.</p>

              <p>===================================================<br>HISTORY OF BT PANJANG SERVICE<br>===================================================<br><br>At the end of 1985, the first service to terminate at Bt Panjang New Town (formerly known as Zhenghua New town) was service 5, which had its route extended from Bt Timah to the Gangsa Rd Terminal for a short period of time before extending to Petir Rd, which is a roadside terminal. This terminal was named as Bt Panjang Terminal.<br><br>There are two side of Petir Rd for boarding &amp; alighting activities. When a bus terminares its trip at Bt Panjang, it would park at the side of Petir Rd stretch , between the junction of Gangas Rd and Pending Rd junctions. (which means the location is o/s blk 108,118,128), and the small bus stops are used for boarding activities. On the opposite side of Petir Rd (facing blk 139,142,150) are used for alighting activities.<br><br>The Petir Rd area became a hive of a busy bus terminal serving residents of Bukit Panjang, when more bus services serving the Bt Panjang Area in the 1990s. But first we go through the changes made in the late 1980s. When there is road constraints along Petir Rd, TIBS had taken a paramount task to plan its new bus interchange, connecting Bt Panjang LRT and the Bt Panjang Plaza in 1999 so that the residents will have an improvised bus interchange for boarding &amp; alighting actvities as well as a bus bay for buses to park.<br><br>In 1995, TIBS had also showcased its new Mercedes-Benz O405 buses around the Bukit Panjang area, before it actually takes over the Bukit Panjang services by phases. In fact, these new buses were deployed on Bukit Panjang services, to get the residents a new feel on its new buses and also the EDS system which made them to see the service number clearly.<br><br>In 1988, two services were introduced - 187 and 190, on july 10. Service 187 plies from Bt Panjang to Jurong while 190 from Bt Panjang to New Bridge Rd and on the same year, two new feeders were introduced -- 343 and 344.<br><br>343 - to Petir Rd (loop at end)<br>344 - to Bt Panjang Ring Rd<br><br>Service 190 was extended to Choa Chu kang Int in 1989, when the Choa Chu Kang Int opened to the public.<br><br>- Changes made after 1990 (include external services that ply via Bt Panjang, but amendments that made outside Bt Panjang are not shown here.

              <p>======================================================<br>EARLY DAYS OF CHANGI AIRPORT SERVIECS<br>======================================================</p>
              <p>In 1981, when the Changi Airport commences its commercial flight operations, SBS had decided to introduce a new set of Changi Airport service which commences as early as May 1981. The airport was opened to the public for flight check-in and flight arrivals/departures on 1 July 1981, which comprises a big move from Paya Lebar Airport.</p>
              <p>======================================================<br>ITS SERVICES BACK THEN...<br>======================================================</p>
              <p>There were 6 services that plies Changi Airport and the new Changi Airport Cargo Cplx. Services 390, 392, 394 serve the Changi Airport while 391, 393, 395 serves the Changi Airprot Crago Cplx.</p>
              <p>390 - Queen Street - Changi Airport<br>391 - Changi Point - Cahngi Airport Cargo Complex<br>392 - Somapah - Changi Airport<br>393 - Somapah - Changi Airport Cargo Complex<br>394 - Bedok - Changi Airport<br>395 - Bedok - Changi Airport Cargo Complex</p>
              <p>It was interesting to know that Somapah Interchange was vaguely known as the 'airport interchange'. It was meant that commuters would have taken a bus down all the way to Somapah Interchange and transfer the newly introduced Changi Airport services to Changi Airport and Changi Airport Cargo Complex.</p>
              <p>Singapore Shuttle Bus (SSB), whih runs the CSS buses, together with 2 other private bus companies - the SSTA and Singapore School and Private Hire Bus Owner's Association, jointly introduced 4 new services to Changi Airport and 1 new service to Cahngi Airport Cargo Complex on 29 Jun 1981.</p>

              <p>The 1983 Changi Airport Bus Plan was introduced to integrate its existing SBS Changi Airport Services as well as the SSB jointly operated private services.</p>
