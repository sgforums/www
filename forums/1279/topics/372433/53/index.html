              <p>Beside using N113CRB on 378, 379, did other models did these 2 svc? Like maybe merz? hehe</p>

              <p>also, there was a video of Scania n113CRB on 101 on youtube doing a u-turn at Buangkok Cres... not sure who uploaded it but properly has being removed.. cause i watch it like 2/3 years ago??</p>

              <p>1) Probably 378 and 379 had MK2s? That i'm unsure.. but all I can remember is 3600A was either 378 or 379 perm at that time.<br><br>2) I believe Jln Kayu terminal is under AMK Route group? also because of the NEL rationalisation and lastly small terminals should be gone by now.. <br><br>3) 101 had perm N113s when 101 was still under AMDEP</p>
