              <p>hougang depot is a fairly new depot. roughly opened in 1988. as such ur answer is falwed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>198 when brand new was JRDEP based. lots of new new o305 of 198 were 24xx also suggesting it had BNDEP (opened in 1981) roots.<br><br>198 later became Jurong with the LO2x and with O305s from HGDEP, the other o305 zao to 197 (i think)</p>
              <p>when 198 got sliced at mei chin in early 1990, the Lo2x remained on 198, suggesting 198 became full jurong.<br><br>it was only in more recent times when SLBP opened in 1995 then 198 zao to BBDEP. For reasons unknown , but service)_239 suggested off service running time is short. I once had a BC of 198 tell me about "the short cut from BBDEp to Boon lay" int , that i din understood at all..hahah</p>
              <p>64 when brand new started from Ulu pandan to macpherson, suggesting it was of Hock lee origin.</p>
              <p>it was later invovled in a big mess of amendmentws involving 190, 191 14 and 32.</p>
              <p>(pls refer to the 1969 bus guide in wiki pls)</p>
              <p>this was when 64 was under the PJRBP<span>1529<span> </span> 1592<span>  </span></span> were ran on 64<br>Much later 64 as u know loop at mei Chin. and ALDEP was still around</p>
              <p>i spotted <span>1155<span> </span> 1195<span> </span> 1395 1400</span><span><span>   on 64.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>because 64 ended at Macpherson Est - it was probably close to BNDEP. as such many BNDEP buses found its way onto 64. but all these chnaged when HGDEP opened</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>and u know the rest of the story.</span></span></p>

              <p>BNDEP buses had 4 series rego. I think the 2 series ones ended up in HGDEP when the old Bedok depot closed.</p>

              <p><br>hgdep took in a lot of buses. amdep and bndep were also affected. Those 920x VO3x from 10 were transfered to hgdep, while 10 receives LO3x from 106 which was handed over to Tibs. And I saw 9037L on 87. LOL.</p>
              <p>166 was under majority amdep. After 67 and 103 handover, 166 Mercs from amdep went to 103, 166 went majority control under bbdep, using Striders from 67 (1913K - 1917A, 1931H - 1933C).</p>
              <p>143 was moved to majority jrdep too. At the same time bram took full control of 88 from bndep.</p>

              <p>In 2003, there's:</p>
              <p>East - hgdep bndep <br>Central - amdep brbp<br>West - bbdep arbp slbp</p>
              <p>1st bus park indicates district HQ</p>
              <p>there was some district restructuring in early 2004. East closed down, so Central took over East and rename it as East. As combining East and Central would be too big, one of the old East bus park would have to go West. As hgdep is geographically more west of HG and BN, HG went West.</p>
              <p>So the new classification is:</p>
              <p>East: amdep brbp bndep<br>West: slbp bbdep arbp hgdep</p>

              <p><br>I remember seeing LO3x and Mercs on 502 before the route amendment. 9120D was perm on 502, and served awhile more after the route amendment before 502 was reduced to full SD fleet. 9120D went arbp as SP and then perm 10. So 502 was under bbdep before or which jurong before slbp era?</p>
              <p>507 had no DDs? Yeah, the Striders went over to slbp for a short while and returned to bbdep after the PA Mercs perm 502 and 507. Some of those 264x Striders went to slbp and back to bbdep. Remember seeing a pic of 1897Z on 157 when slbp was new.</p>

              <p><strong>South Canal terminal</strong></p>
              <p>this terminal existed in the late 50s with hock lee bus Services operating it. Among them Hock lee Svc 1 and 2 and some others i frogot.</p>
              <p>Two of the ex Hock lee Bus services went thru the number conversion excercise of 1968 or 1969 and became 192A and 192.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 192A and 192 still operated from South Canal. <br><br>Into the early 1970s as the network gets rationalised, 192 was withdrawn and 102A was converted to svc 192. THIS ISS the 192 that most of us here will know. The one that became today 51.<br><br>Svc 186 of today is regarded as the closest being to hock lee bus service from Queenstown to town. If u hear me saying I want to take the Hock lee bus service, i refer to 186.</p>
              <p> So when the terminal closed in 1995 is it? it was one of the longest running bus terminals in Town.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>today a traffic island diving the shophosues and the other side along South Canal road reminds us of its past as mianly a bus services turn around point. <br><br>In the late 1950s pcitures show the buses parking at the shophouses in a saw tooth berth format.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>pictures depitcing the place in 1980s show the parking bays still are saw tooth but now on the middle of the road. (easier for bus to u turn i guess)</p>

              <p><strong>The 1973 unification</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Note on bus regos</strong></p>
              <p>the time came for the ABC ABS and UBC to come as one. to form SSBS, this is 1970,</p>
              <p>buses in those days were being bought a lot by the current UBC ABS and ABC. they were registereed SH</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in 1971 with nothing happening towards full unity, the govt stepped in. this was when SBS bus regos begin to appear. <br><br>Essentially they took all the ABS ABC UBC buses and re-registered everyone. even those at the vehcile registeration compoud etc with current SH rego registered 1 month earlier, were to get SBS regos.</p>
              <p><strong>A system was decided upon.</strong> <br><br>Buses belonging to each company (ABC UBC ABS ) were to msotly remain in their own depots. However, to balance out and to introduce new routes, some of the company buses are to "Depot trasnfer".</p>
              <p>Now they have to decide which places are to be depots. <br><br>After that they decided to number the buses according to depot. <br><br><strong>List</strong></p>
              <p>ALDEP <br>ALExnadra Depot<br>(Ex Hock lee then later ABC) -  SBS 1xxx <br>(SSo if u were registered SBS1144, it just means u are the 144th bus to be registered there)<br><br>BDDEP<br>Bedok Depot (Location near to Somapah Bus Interchange)<br> (Origins unknown - awaiting Mike davis 2nd book) - SBS 2xxx<br><br>WLDEP<br>Woodlands Depot (Location - as stated by u guys, kranji there)<br>(origins likely UBC depot, prob belonged to tay Koh yat) - Svc 170 bsues come inside here to refuel.</p>
              <p>If I was riding a svc 170 MB oF1413 then I would have had the opporutinity to visit a depot whilst remain on bus as they refuel. I have heard stories of them even banging on advertisement panels while u were refuleing.</p>
              <p>WLDEP</p>

              <p>Yeah the population for s189 Mark Threes is really quite a small amount to divide out... I don't remember taking Mark Twos on s189, but the older fleet consisted of LAs and Mark Threes. Soon it was Mark Threes and VO2Xs, then Striders, Mark Threes and VO2Xs. The 'farewell fleet' was as such. Some SBS s189 buses which I kept tickets of were 753, 2609, 2612 and 7256.</p>
              <p>I remember taking 1716/1719 or similar on s77. That bus did not seem to be a JB going bus though. ZF with CAC mode Mark Two climbing Toh Tuck Road is... Dots, literally.</p>
              <p>Flashes of memory indicate the LO3Xs that served s106 so many years, until TIBS booted SBS out of this part of the West... I had loved the feeling of a LO3X going at speed down Commonwealth Ave West.</p>

              <p><br>The 160 got their perm MK3 some from HGDEP.</p>
              <p>AMDEP intaked some of 170 MK2 permers last time. 125 and 186 had their permers. Whereas the rest went over JRBP/SLBP.</p>
              <p>SBS1892L and SBS1894G were 170 permers went over to perm 333. I remembered that when SBS1892L became 333 perm, the JB-sign still never removed whereas SBS1894G did. So how about the rest?</p>

              <p><br>BNDEP 32 got some of the NAC MK2 permers after converting back to PAC service. One of it was: SBS1711D</p>
              <p>Is it something to do with the introduction of ARBP 48?</p>
