              <br>
              Take Service 181 and 850 for example, many residents from Woodlands
              &amp; Yishun do not work on Sundays &amp; PHs - they might take a
              day off to do shopping at Marina Square as one reason, the basic
              reason behind the Sunday &amp; PHs schedule is to provide a direct
              linkage from the 2 HDB towns to Marina Centre without having to
              transfer extra bus services.<br>
              <br>
              As for Service 853, it is exactly the same reason, just like 181
              and 850. For 853, this service will serve Marine Parade via
              Mountbatten Rd, Amber Rd, Marine Prade Rd, Siglap Rd. 
              Although for some who wants to go to East Coast Park, they would
              take another bus 401 at the vicinity of Marine Parade which goes to
              East Coast park or walk from Marine Parade through the underpass to
              East Coas tPark.<br>
              <br>
              Suggestions to request for more bus services is not the cause of
              the introduction but it was introduced accordingly to provide the
              necessary satisfaction and the needs of the residents.</p>
