              <p><br>It is common for some of SBS services cover through TIBS area. I shan't mention all of them. (In vice versa, TIBS cover through SBS area too)</p>
              <p>But 67, as I did mentioned earlier on, it only covers 1/3 of TIBS area.</p>
              <p>Can just say, LTA does not allow SBS (TIBS) to cover the secondary road of TIBS (SBS) area, but only main road in order to be fair? Just like 161, 168 only cover main road of Woodlands whereas 965, main road of Sengkang and so on.</p>

                  AMDEP have to control services in Jln Kayu and Sengkang services, that's why they push Yishun services to WLDEP in 1998 when WLDEP opened..

                  In 2001, Trans Island and CSS (SSB) became under SMRT Group. CSS falls under SMRT body, which means CSS became SMRT controlled until its withdrawal. CSS service can only be withdrawn, neither can be amended or introduced becuase the SSB was dissolved and SMRT take over the CSS services, becuase the routes belongs to the former SSB.

              <p><br>Thanks, SBS8533C, for all the historical insights of the bus service rationalisation of Jurong, Bedok and Toa Payoh, in the 1970s and 1980s. I certainly had learnt a lot of things of Singapore bus history from here. They are very interesting and I really wish I could go back to those days again for the memories of this hobby. Hope you will share more with us on the history of bus services changes in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
              <p>Btw, when was service 146 and 148 withdrawn???</p>
              <p>And do you know what happened to some of the bus terminals in the 1980s I mentioned earlier in this thread that had cease to exist from the mid 1990s???</p>

              <p>I am very interested to know what happened to Princess Elizaberth bus terminal in the early 1990s, which houses service 192 and 193. What happened to it?</p>

              <p>Any ideas on the above.</p>
              <p>I hope you can share more of the lists of these bus service changes in major new towns in the 1970s and 1980s in future. I am thinking of compling them together and do a print out for easy references. Thanks a lot.</p>

              Princess Elizabeth Estate Terminal closed down in the early 1990s as the estate is earmarked for demolition on the later years. SBS 173 covers the Hillview areas possibly in the late 1970s.

              <p>ABOUT ANG MO KIO BUS SERVICES (latest updates)<br><br>At first, when Ang Mo Kio New Town is still currently under development in the 1970s, there were 2 terminals situated - one at Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (os Blk 324) and the other at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (opp Blk 202). In fact, there was a feeder 260 that serve from AMK Ave 6 to St 22/24. Initially, there was only one terminal, Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 (os Blk 324) and because as there are more services terminating at Ang Mo Kio New Town, another termporary terminal was constructed at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (opp Blk 202).<br><br>- List of Ang Mo Kio Services in 1979 -<br><br>From AMK Ave 3 (os Blk 324)<br>25 - To Bedok<br>74 - To Clementi<br>132 - To Tomlinson Rd (Loop)<br>138 - To Shenton Way<br>165 - To Jurong<br>166 - To New Bridge Rd<br>168 - To Orchard Rd (Loop)<br>169 - To Woodlands<br><br>From AMK Ave 6 (opp Blk 207)<br>133 - To North Bridge Rd<br>136 - To Upp Serangoon Rd (End)<br>159 - To Toa Payoh<br>162 - To Sims Ave (Loop)<br>260 - Loop Service to St 22/24<br>261 - Loop Service to Ind pk i<br>262 - Loop Service to Ave 2<br><br>In fact, the Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 terminus was known as the "Ang Mo Kio Interchange" for most residents living in Ang Mo Kio.

              <p><br>Some additions:</p>
              <p>You forgot about 25 and 159 under the part of the opening of Ang Mo Kio interchange in 1982.</p>
              <p>132 was extended to Hougang South in 1986 or 1988 and ending point was extended to Bukit Merah around the same period.</p>
              <p>74 was extended to Hougang Central in the 1990s and the route was shortened to Buona Vista terminal.</p>
              <p>267 was withdrawn in 2002 when 159 was extended to Sengkang.</p>
              <p>133A was an express service along CTE in the late 1980s.</p>
              <p>When was 168 withdrawn??? Is it in 1987 or 1988???</p>
              <p>Thanks for the information about Ang Mo Kio bus service history. Maybe you can edit the revisions the next day.</p>
              <p>I remembered the Leyland Olympian 2 axles demostrator piled on the old service 162.</p>
              <p>About Tampines, what I know about it was service 80 in the 1970s. The first SBS service to use double deckers in 1977, with the first fleet of 20 Leyland Atlanteans double deckers bodied by BACo and Metal Sections.</p>

                  <p>You forgot about 25 and 159 under the part of the opening of Ang
                  Mo Kio interchange in 1982.</p>
                  <p>132 was extended to Hougang South in 1986 or 1988 and ending
                  point was extended to Bukit Merah around the same period.</p>
                  <p>74 was extended to Hougang Central in the 1990s and the route
                  was shortened to Buona Vista terminal.</p>
                  <p>267 was withdrawn in 2002 when 159 was extended to Sengkang.</p>
                  <p>133A was an express service along CTE in the late 1980s.</p>
                  <p>When was 168 withdrawn??? Is it in 1987 or 1988???</p>
                  <p>Thanks for the information about Ang Mo Kio bus service history.
                  Maybe you can edit the revisions the next day.</p>
                  <p>I remembered the Leyland Olympian 2 axles demostrator piled
                  on the old service 162.</p>
                  <p>About Tampines, what I know about it was service 80 in the
                  1970s. The first SBS service to use double deckers in 1977, with
