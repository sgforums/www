              <p><br> Ok, lets discuss about Blue Arrow services.<br><br>Blue Arrow services started as early back as 1976, bringing people who live in private estates to the city area. THey were numbered as 30x series in the past. The service operates on weekdays and saturdays in AM peak for citybound and PM peak for hombound. But for the homebound direction, the service operates in the afternoon from 12pm up to 2pm on saturdays instead of the usual PM peak timings,  and charged at 60c for adult and 20c for students.<br><br>initially, it has 6 services and at its peak in 1977, the service grew to 8 services.<br><br>301 - Katong Seaview Palace/Meyer Rd - Robinson Rd<br>302 - Bedok Gdn/Lucky Hills/Changi Rd - Robinson Rd<br>303 - Tai Keng Gsns and Sennett Est - Robisnon Rd<br>304 - Serangoon Gdn, Lor Chuan &amp; Braddell Est - Robinson Rd<br>305 - Mayflower Gdns / Sembawang Hils Dr/ Upp Thomson Rd - Robinson Rd<br>306 - Eng Kong Pk - RObinson Rd<br>307 - Chai Chee - Tanglin Circus [was introduced in c. 1976/77, note it didnt terminate/strat from Robinson Rd]<br>308 - Ang Mo Kio - Robinson Rd [was introduced in c. 1976/77]<br><br>In 1978, BA services 304 and 308 were withdrawn as the service was poorly used and do not meet the demand for the services. BA Service 308 was introduced as a trail basis for AMK residents but at the end with the new services/amended ones serve the AMK estate, service 308 became unreliable and they had to utilise the other services to get to the city.<br><br>BA service 307 was amended to start from Bedok South Rd to focus on the inner areas of Bedok New Town via Bedok South Ave 2.<br><br>Later that year, 1978, another BA service 302 was withdrawn, when the service was integrated with service 301 to form 301. After 1978, the service was scaled down to 4 services - 301, 303, 305, 306.<br><br>301 - Bedok Gdn - Robisnon Rd [integrated with BA 302]<br>303 - Tai Keng Gdns - Robinson Rd<br>305 - Mayflower Gdns - Robinson Rd<br>306 - Eng Kong Pk - Robinson Rd<br><br>In the 1980s, with more trunk services introduced at nearby bus stops and many residents in the area owned cars (or similar expensive ones like Mercedes-Benz Cars), the Blue Arrow services had dwindled in terms of the passenger demand. Although In 1988, BA service 306 was withdrawn, the latter services could not cope up witht he demand of the passengers. So in 1989, followed up by 303 and 305 and finally 301. This marks the end of the Blue Arrow services serving the private estates for 13 years.</p>

              <p>at any rate, i guess what i din reckon until now was how SSB was saved. reckon is Mr Ng's doing. instead of concentrating on park n ride, i reckon mr Ng decided to convert the SSB services to normal route operations serving the new towns in 1976.</p>
              <p>thus saving SSb and of course CSS in general.</p>

CSS was introduced both by SSB &amp; NTUC Comfort, which alleviates the road traffic congestions along the CBD area, which is better known as the Park And Ride Scheme.<br><br>With the scheme, commuters can park their cars at the 16 designated CSS fringe car parks (which I'll mentioned at the later parts) and take the CSS services from that fringe car parks. But only a big failure was --- the Fringe Car Parks is a wasteless facility because not many park their cars since the car parks has many parking lots that no one bothers to use them.<br><br>FRINGE CAR PARK TERMINAL NOTATIONS<br><br>A - Lorong 1 Geylang<br>B &amp; C - National Stadium Car Park B &amp; C<br>D - National Stadium Car Park D<br>E - National Stadium Car Park E<br>F - Serangoon Rd/Kallang Basin<br>G - Kampong Jaya Park<br>H - Clemencaeu Ave / Netwon Circus<br>J - Chancery Lane/Dunearn Rd<br>K - Whitley Rd/Dunearn Rd<br>L - Holland Rd/Peice Rd<br>M - Delta Circus<br>N - New Bridge Rd/Hospital<br>P - Outram Pk<br>Q - Chin Swee Rd/Havelock Rd<br>R - Jalan Kukoh<br><br>CITY TERMINUS NOTATIONS<br>1.

The PM Peak would use A &amp; B initally uses as a limited stop service, whcih is for SSB ones, but for NTUC Comfort Routes they simply run their AM Peak/OffPeak &amp; PM Peak routes at a fixed basis. We take a very good example -- service 3 (SSB) which plies from Chancerty Lane/Dunearn Rd to the Upp Corss st (near OG Building), which runs on AM Peak and off peak routes. Its off peak routes is actually a loop service and it covers additional selective bus stops.

THey were numbered as 30x series in the past. The service operates on weekdays and saturdays in AM peak for citybound and PM peak for hombound. But for the homebound direction, the service operates in the afternoon from 12pm up to 2pm on saturdays instead of the usual PM peak timings,  and charged at 60c for adult and 20c for students.<br><br>initially, it has 6 services and at its peak in 1977, the service grew to 8 services.<br><br>301 - Katong Seaview Palace/Meyer Rd - Robinson Rd<br>302 - Bedok Gdn/Lucky Hills/Changi Rd - Robinson Rd<br>303 - Tai Keng Gsns and Sennett Est - Robisnon Rd<br>304 - Serangoon Gdn, Lor Chuan &amp; Braddell Est - Robinson Rd<br>305 - Mayflower Gdns / Sembawang Hils Dr/ Upp Thomson Rd - Robinson Rd<br>306 - Eng Kong Pk - RObinson Rd<br>307 - Chai Chee - Tanglin Circus [was introduced in c. 1976/77, note it didnt terminate/strat from Robinson Rd]<br>308 - Ang Mo Kio - Robinson Rd [was introduced in c. 1976/77]<br><br>In 1978, BA services 304 and 308 were withdrawn as the service was poorly used and do not meet the demand for the services. BA Service 308 was introduced as a trail basis for AMK residents but at the end with the new services/amended ones serve the AMK estate, service 308 became unreliable and they had to utilise the other services to get to the city.<br><br>BA service 307 was amended to start from Bedok South Rd to focus on the inner areas of Bedok New Town via Bedok South Ave 2.<br><br>Later that year, 1978, another BA service 302 was withdrawn, when the service was integrated with service 301 to form 301. After 1978, the service was scaled down to 4 services - 301, 303, 305, 306.<br><br>301 - Bedok Gdn - Robisnon Rd [integrated with BA 302]<br>303 - Tai Keng Gdns - Robinson Rd<br>305 - Mayflower Gdns - Robinson Rd<br>306 - Eng Kong Pk - Robinson Rd<br><br>In the 1980s, with more trunk services introduced at nearby bus stops and many residents in the area owned cars (or similar expensive ones like Mercedes-Benz Cars), the Blue Arrow services had dwindled in terms of the passenger demand. Although In 1988, BA service 306 was withdrawn, the latter services could not cope up witht he demand of the passengers. So in 1989, followed up by 303 and 305 and finally 301. This marks the end of the Blue Arrow services serving the private estates for 13 years.</em></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>==================================================<br>SERANGOON SERVICES HISTORY<br>==================================================<br><br>Majority of its Serangoon Services were from Serangoon Garden Estate, located as Serangoon Garden Way wayback in the 1960s and the 1970s. In its pre-reorganisation in 1971, the Serangoon Services were operated by STC, Paya Lebar Bus Service, and TKY Bus co. STC was the only route that goes trhough the City area while, PLBS and TKY bus co operates only around other routes excluding CBD areas like Shenton Way/Robisnon Rd, where those roads were monopolized by STC and other services had to ensure that they do not ply along those roads.<br><br>STC has 18A and 18B in Seragnoon Garden area. 18A has 2 variants - ordianry and limited stop service plying along Finlasyon Green to Serangoon Gdns edtate, while 18B from Serangoon Gdns Circus to Finlayson Green.<br><br>18A is very confusing route and commuters must be able to know the sketchy routes of 18A. Not many though have known by these routings and had a very hard fatigue on travelling along STC routes.<br><br>18A plies the partial route of Route 18B. During its peak hours, one of each buses of 18A will loop at 2 different directions, viz the Nothern &amp; Southern Loops while the another bus will terminate at Serangoon Garden Circus. On its off peak, both alternate buses will serve the Northen Loops &amp; Southern Loops of this sector.<br><br>After 7.30pm , 18A buses operate from Finlayson Green and Bras Basah Rd and after 8.30pm, buses only operates from Bras Basah Rd.<br><br>18A - Limited Stop Service<br>There were 2 routes fro this service.. one that goes via Paya Lebar Rd and Guillemard Rd and the another that goes via Lanveder St and Crawford St. The services ran on an AM peak trip (7am-9am) and PM Peak tip (4.30pm to 6pm) - on saturdays it ran from 12.30 to 2pm and no operation on Sundays &amp; PHs.<br><br>18B operates exactly the same as vice versa route of 18A. From Serangoon Garddens to Finlayson Green. This service uses the buses from 18A.<br><br>PLBS service 3 - Serangoon gearden estate to Gay World Pk<br><br>This service plies along the inner areas of Serangoon Garedn estate (Chartwell Dr, Tavistock Ave , Hemsley Ave etc etc before proceding its route via Yio Chu Kang Rd/UppS erangoon Rd all the way down to Lor 5 Geylang, where the Gay World Pk is conveniently located nearby.<br><br>One of Alternate buses will go via Northern &amp; Southen Loops each.<br><br>TKY 9 - Havelock Rd to Serangoon Garden Circus<br><br>Service plies from Havelock Rd to Seraangoon Garden Circus via Orchard Rd, Newton Circus, Thomson Rd, Lor Chuan..<br><br>Int eh 1971 reorganisation, 11 Apr 1971, the services were being freshly re-introduced as the entire existing chinse bus service were amalgamated, indluding STC, which continues to stay until its bankruptcy at the end of 1971.<br><br>STC and ABS were the only 2 bus companies that plys the Serangoon Gardens Estate.<br><br>STC we have ...<br>100 - Serangoon Garden - Prince Edward Rd -- handed to ABS <br>100A - Serangoon Garden - Finlayson Green (Loop) -- handed to ABS <br>101 - Serangoon Garden - New Bridge Rd/Neil Rd(via Berwick Dr) -- handed to ABS<br>101A - Serangoon Garden - New Bridge Rd/Neil Rd (via Tavistock Ave) -- handed to ABS<br>102 - Serangoon Garden - Prince Edward Rd(via Berwick Dr) -- handede to UBC<br>102A - Serangoon Garden - Prince Edward Rd (via Tavisotck Ave) -- handed to UBC<br><br>ABS we have ...<br>103 - Serangoon Garden -C'wealth Ave/North Buona Vista Rd (via Holland Rd)<br>103A - Serangoon Garden -C'wealth Ave/North Buona Vista Rd  (Via C'wealth Dr, Queens Circus)<br><br>In other words, ABS 156 also plys along the Serangoon Garden Estate.<br><br>New services introcuded in 1972:<br><br>ABS 72 from Serangoon Garden to Tangjong Rhu (note that alternate buses will ply via Berwick Dr and Tavistock Ave each)<br>UBC 104 was introduced from Seangoon Gardens to Havelock Rd (Loop Service) plies via Orcahrd Rd, New Bridge Rd, Havlock Rd.<br><br>============================================<br>1974 BUS RATIONALISATION<br>============================================<br><br>in the 1974 bus rationalisation, serangoon services that has duplication on its route were either cancelled/re-routed/re-numbered.<br><br>100/100A - Renumbered as 100<br>101A - Service withdrawn<br>102 - Became a supplement service as limited stop serice.

              <p>The Comfort CSS buses vanished and the Chinatown-Suntec link never came about at all. Route 4 could have become 604 and provide the future link between these 2 areas until DTL came about.</p>

              <p>I would rather 148 extended to EUN via Suntec instead of getting the chop in 11/92.</p>
              <p>O305s didn't remain long in JR. When the LO3Xes arrived the former were all transferred to East Dist (HG). Later a small number moved over to AM, classic example being 2583 (HG 154 &gt;&gt; AM 166).</p>

              <p><br> 57 - withdrawn in 1985<br>149 - withdrawn when svcs 16 &amp; 31 merged in 1993. Apparently, scheme B service took over the route of 149, which duplicates majority of sv 31 in the Marine Parade corridor. It was renumbered as 646 few years after scheme B took over the service and was subsequently amended to call at Lor 6 Toa Payoh instead of Toa Payoh Int.</p>
