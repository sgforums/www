              <p><br>Yes, AMDEP did took in some 0405Gs when it was new in 1997. They were deployed on 82, 812, 851 and 856. As well as made cameo appearances on service 160.</p>
              <p>It was when WLDEP opened in 1998, those 812, 851 and 856 0405G permers got transferred to WLDEP. The remaining service 82 0405G permers transferred to KJDEP to do service 190 in 1999. After which AMDEP hardly had MB0405Gs. Remembered TIB856E and TIB892A got transferred to AMDEP for a short while in 1999-2000 after which went back to KJDEP again when more Habits were bought in.</p>

Service 5, 75, 176 in the past did have DAF hispanos cameo and it rarely appears on 179 and 180.<br><br>- 2 of its feeders 344and 345 was withdrawn due to the LRT Rationalisation, leaving only one sole feeder 343 behind, which was renumbered to 921.

              <p><br>Before that, service 88 was introduced, the only SBS service when Sengkang was still under TIBS. The fleet upgraded very fast, from non air con Scania N113CRBs to air con Volvo Olympians, B10Ms, Leyland Olympians after a short span of about 6 months.</p>
              <p>Service 864 had Volvo Olympians and B10Ms for its short span of service before it merged with service 84 to become service 80.</p>
