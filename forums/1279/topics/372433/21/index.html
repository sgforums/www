              <p>Some services are not renumbered due to legacy reasons, and not because of this or that.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>================================================<br>HISTORY OF BISHAN SERVICES<br>================================================<br><br>Background information:<br>Before the developmentof Bishan New Town, it was previously known as Kampong San Teng. There was only squatter huts, a Chinese Cemetry and temples situated around the Kg San teng area. There were no bus services serving around Kg San Teng and only one road serving the whole of Kg San Teng and many unnamed dirt tracks/roads surrounding it.<br><br>In late 1981, the village was earmarked for urban development, many squatters were cleared and resettled to other estatss like Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh. It took at least 5-6 years to fully developed its new Sattellite town at Bishan. The MRT and bus interchange was still under construction at that time. When the new town is near completion of its development, a new bus services starting from Bishan Terminal to Toa Payoh was launched in 1986. Bishan, too, started off as a roadside terminal before the services termiante at Bishan Int, with easy access to the Bishan MRT, first of its kind that the station platform is on ground level.<br><br>In the start of 1986, only service 56 serve Bishan and loop at Toa Payoh and at the end of 1986, service 353 was introduced from Sin Ming to Bisahn St 31 (Loop)<br><br>In 1987, service 58 from Bishan to Marina Centre was introduced to provide Bishan residents proper and direct linkage to shopping centres around Marina Centre area like Marina Square and Raffles City. It was withdrawn when serviec 56 and 58 was integrated to form service 56 in 1989/90.<br><br>In 1988, service 57 was renumbered from 353. This service was re-routed to start from Bishan to Sin Ming Dr (Loop), to serve the residents better instead of transferring buses to get to their destinations around Bishan New Town. On the same year, Service 59 from Bishan to Jln Kayu (Loop) was introduced but it was shortened to start from Ang Mo Kio a few years later.<br><br>In 1989/90, service 56 was integrated with service 58. Service 56 was extended to Marina Centre and part of the srvice 58 route (the Marina Ctr stretch ) is now part of service 56.<br><br>The first "Bishan Townlink" service 410 was introduced in JUne 1992, with links to Sin Ming Dr. This service was swapped plates in 1993. At the same time, service 57 which plies along Sin Ming Dr was withdrawn.<br><br>From 1993 onwards, here are the changes in the Bishan Services<br><br>52 - New service that plies from Bishan to Jurong East (introdiced on 23 Oct 05)<br>53 - New service that plies from Bishan to Hougang St 22 (Loop) in 1994, about a year later, it was extended to Changi Airpot <br>54 - New service that plies from Bishan to New Bridge Rd (introduced on 5 dec 93), when 104 and 134 merged. The service was amended to ply Bishan St 13 from 5 nov 06<br>55 - Service amended to serve Bishan instead of Ang Mo Kio in 1993<br>57 - New service that plies from Bishan to Bt Merah via Depot Rd on 31 jul 2005. This service ples to Thomson Rd, Kg Java Rd/Keng Lee Rd instead of Bt Timah Rd / Duneanr Rd on 21 Jan 2007<br>58 - New service that plies from Bishan to Pasir Ris on 31 jul 2005.<br>59 - new service that plies from Bishan to Changi Village on  23 oct 2005, plies via Toa Payoh, Bedok Reservoir Rd and Tampines New Town.<br>134 - Service amended to serve Bishan but it was withdrawn when 104 and 134 merged to form service 54.<br><br>In the past, Bishan Int was the only interchange with the least services, 5 services i.e. 53, 54, 55, 56 &amp; 410. With the addition of the 4 new services - 52, 57, 58, 59, Bishan Int has more variety of its services that ply different parts of Singapore. Like 57 that goes to Bukit Merah, 58 goes to Paris Ris and so on. Now Bishan Int has 9 services serving the needs of the Bishan Residents.<br><br>SIN MING ROAD TERMINAL<br>In the past, only 130 plies from Sin Ming Rd terminal to Anson Rd as well as CSS Bus no 5. When the Ang Mo Kio Int opens in 1983, Service 130 amended to serve Ang Mo Kio Int leaving CSS 5 behind which still terminates at Sin Ming Rd. At the end of 1986, sefvice 353 was introduced but too the service amended to start from Bishan instead and renumbered as 57.<br><br>THe only sole service of Sin Ming Rd terminal was CSS 5. On Nov 97, the service was renumbered as 605 and continued its operation without any service changes until it was eventually withdrrawn on Sep 2004. after its withdrawal, the Sin Mign Rd terminal is in a quiet state.<br><br>edit: corrections made.</p></div>

(off topci though)<br><br>at first, it was named after a small village population around the Bt Timah/Bt Panjang area. Bukit Panjang Estate was located around Teck Whye, off Choa Chu Kang Rd (the 1st gen HDB flats at Teck whye and also the 32 block of single story flats around the village. THe 32 block of single story flats were since demolished and Bt Panjang estate was started to extend its development. That estate was re-named as Choa Chu kang new town instead, which was taken from the road named "Choa Chu Kang Rd" to avoid further confusion between the two towns and also the new propesed branch line MRT. For the new Zhenghua New town, it was renamed as Bukit Panjang New Town, possibly named from the old Bt Panjang Village and its new road names was taken from the dirt roads surrounding the area (Lor Petir, Lor Gangsa, Jln Fajar, etc)</p></div>

              <p>================================================<br>HISTORY OF BISHAN SERVICES<br>================================================<br><br>Background information:<br>Before the developmentof Bishan New Town, it was previously known as Kampong San Teng. There was only squatter huts, a Chinese Cemetry and temples situated around the Kg San teng area. There were no bus services serving around Kg San Teng and only one road serving the whole of Kg San Teng and many unnamed dirt tracks/roads surrounding it.<br><br>In late 1981, the village was earmarked for urban development, many squatters were cleared and resettled to other estatss like Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh. It took at least 5-6 years to fully developed its new Sattellite town at Bishan. The MRT and bus interchange was still under construction at that time. When the new town is near completion of its development, a new bus services starting from Bishan Terminal to Toa Payoh was launched in 1986. Bishan, too, started off as a roadside terminal before the services termiante at Bishan Int, with easy access to the Bishan MRT, first of its kind that the station platform is on ground level.<br><br>In the start of 1986, only service 56 serve Bishan and loop at Toa Payoh and at the end of 1986, service 353 was introduced from Sin Ming to Bisahn St 31 (Loop)<br><br>In 1987, service 58 from Bishan to Marina Centre was introduced to provide Bishan residents proper and direct linkage to shopping centres around Marina Centre area like Marina Square and Raffles City. It was withdrawn when serviec 56 and 58 was integrated to form service 56 in 1989/90.<br><br>In 1988, service 57 was renumbered from 353. This service was re-routed to start from Bishan to Sin Ming Dr (Loop), to serve the residents better instead of transferring buses to get to their destinations around Bishan New Town. On the same year, Service 59 from Bishan to Jln Kayu (Loop) was introduced but it was shortened to start from Ang Mo Kio a few years later.<br><br>In 1989/90, service 56 was integrated with service 58. Service 56 was extended to Marina Centre and part of the srvice 58 route (the Marina Ctr stretch ) is now part of service 56.<br><br>The first "Bishan Townlink" service 410 was introduced in JUne 1992, with links to Sin Ming Dr. This service was swapped plates in 1993. At the same time, service 57 which plies along Sin Ming Dr was withdrawn.<br><br>From 1993 onwards, here are the changes in the Bishan Services<br><br>52 - New service that plies from Bishan to Jurong East (introdiced on 23 Oct 05)<br>53 - New service that plies from Bishan to Hougang St 22 (Loop) in 1994, about a year later, it was extended to Changi Airpot<br>54 - New service that plies from Bishan to New Bridge Rd (introduced on 5 dec 93), when 104 and 134 merged. The service was amended to ply Bishan St 13 from 5 nov 06<br>55 - Service amended to serve Bishan instead of Ang Mo Kio in 1993<br>57 - New service that plies from Bishan to Bt Merah via Depot Rd on 31 jul 2005. This service ples to Thomson Rd, Kg Java Rd/Keng Lee Rd instead of Bt Timah Rd / Duneanr Rd on 21 Jan 2007<br>58 - New service that plies from Bishan to Pasir Ris on 31 jul 2005.<br>59 - new service that plies from Bishan to Changi Village on  23 oct 2005, plies via Toa Payoh, Bedok Reservoir Rd and Tampines New Town.<br>134 - Service amended to serve Bishan but it was withdrawn when 104 and 134 merged to form service 54.<br><br>In the past, Bishan Int was the only interchange with the least services, 5 services i.e. 53, 54, 55, 56 &amp; 410. With the addition of the 4 new services - 52, 57, 58, 59, Bishan Int has more variety of its services that ply different parts of Singapore. Like 57 that goes to Bukit Merah, 58 goes to Paris Ris and so on. Now Bishan Int has 9 services serving the needs of the Bishan Residents.<br><br>SIN MING ROAD TERMINAL<br>In the past, only 130 plies from Sin Ming Rd terminal to Anson Rd as well as CSS Bus no 5. When the Ang Mo Kio Int opens in 1983, Service 130 amended to serve Ang Mo Kio Int leaving CSS 5 behind which still terminates at Sin Ming Rd. At the end of 1986, sefvice 353 was introduced but too the service amended to start from Bishan instead and renumbered as 57.<br><br>THe only sole service of Sin Ming Rd terminal was CSS 5. On Nov 97, the service was renumbered as 605 and continued its operation without any service changes until it was eventually withdrrawn on Sep 2004. after its withdrawal, the Sin Mign Rd terminal is in a quiet state.<br><br>edit: corrections made.</p>

              <p>Bishan New Town developed quite fast in the early 1990s, a lot of the flats along St 22, 23 and 24 were built up within 1 to 2 years. Even faster than Sengkang.</p>

              <p><br>59 plied from Bishan to Jln Kayu via Bishan St 11, 21, Marymount Rd, AMK Ave 6, YCK Rd, Jln Kayu (Loop at Seletar Camp Gate). It was shortened to ply from AMK somewhere in 1992/1993. Then later handed to TIBS then they renumber 866 and then went back to SBS and etc. Today is part of 86.</p>
              <p>54 was born due to the withdrawal of 134 in 1993/1994 and with the amendment of 104 to 54. If i'm not wrong 156 (Serangoon - Clementi) was subsequently carved out of this to retain 104's direct link between Bishan and Serangoon Int.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">104 Serangoon - New Bridge Rd</span></strong><br>Boundary Rd, AMK Ave 1, Bishan Rd, Braddell Rd, Thomson Rd, Keng Lee/Kg Java Rd, Bt Timah Rd, Scotts Rd, Paterson Rd and then the current 54 route to New Bridge Rd</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">134 Bishan - New Bridge Rd</span></strong><br>Follows 52 to Bishan St 22, Marymount Rd, Thomson Rd, current 56 route to Bugis Junction, North/South Bridge Rd, Upp Cross St, New Bridge Rd.</p>
              <p>134 was deemed unnecessary as 851 plied most of 134's route.</p>

              <p><br>Service 59 was renumbered to service 866 by Tibs when the route was extended to Sengkang in early 1999.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong service 134's route from Bishan to NBR duplicated services 166 and 851 from Thomson Rd to Chinatown. Service 54 was introduced to reduce duplication.</p>
              <p>Service 156 was introduced on the same day to cover service 104 from Serangoon to Thomson Road, and then to Clementi. It also covers part of service 105 route between Holland Rd (6th Ave) to Clementi, as well as 74's route along Clementi Ave 2.</p>
              <p>Service 74 was amended to Buona Vista using the old service 202's route whereas service 105 was diverted to ply along Queensway and Commonwealth Ave.</p>
