              <p>Let me contribute the history of Woodlands Bus Services.<br> <br> I'm pretty sure that you all know that Woodlands Bus Services were
              started by SBS in the early 1980s.<br> <br> In the humble days of Woodlands Bus Services pre-dominantly in the
              1970s, only service 169, 180, 182 and 208 plys from a small bus
              terminal in Admiralty Rd. Service 169 goes from Admiralty Rd and
              Marsiling Dr and continues its route to Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 via
              Admiralty Rd West. Services 180, 182 and 208 plys from Admiralty Rd
              and pass through Woodlands Town Centre.<br> <br> Service 178 and 181 was believed to have been extended to Admiralty
              Rd terminal for a very short while in 1980 after it was being
              amended to call at Woodlands Bus Interhcange.<br> <br> The Woodlands Bus Interchange was opened on 29 Nov 1981. Services
              169, 178, 181, 204 and 208 were called at the new Interchange.
              Service 204 was the first service that called from the Woodlands
              Interchange (it was neither introduced from Admiralty Rd, and the
              service goes to the Sg Kadut Industral Estate, when the industrial
              estate is developed to resettle several existing factories from
              nearby rural areas). Services 180 and 182 remains at Admiralty Rd
              Terminal.<br> <br> IN early 1982, Feeder Service 372 from Woodlands to Marsiling Rd (A
              loop svc) was introduced to cater the Marsiling residents.</p>
              <p>The services were then handed over to TIBS in 1983 by
              phases.<br> <br> - Summary of Woodlands Services -<br> 169 - Woodlands To Ang Mo Kio<br> 178 - Woodlands To Jurong<br> 180 - Admiralty Rd to WTC<br> 181 - Woodlands To Crawford St<br> 182 - Admiralty Rd to Anson Rd<br> 204 - Woodlands To Sungei Kadut Est (Loop, charges Step Fare)<br> 208 - Woodlands To Kranji Way (Loop, charges Step Fare)<br> 372 - Woodlands To Marsiling Rd (Loop, feeder)<br> <br> To avoid confusion between Admiralty Rd and Admiralty Rd West, the
              Admiralty Rd Terminal was known as Marsiling Terminal because of
              the HDB flats in teh Marsiling area.<br> <br> In late 1984, a proposed second feeder service 900 was planned for
              the later phase of Woodlands New Town developments. It was started
              off as Woodlands to Woodlands St 13 loop service in mid-1985. In
              late 1985, Service 204 and 208 was being merged to form service
              925, with the Sg Kadut route on ordinary days (Mon-Sat) and
              alternate route to Kranji Way on Sunday &amp; PHs. Service 925 was
              the only flat fare services which issue bus tickets and charge at a
              flat fare of 60c<br> <br> 925 - Woodlands to Sungei Kadut Ave (Loop) (Mondays to
              Saturdays)<br> 925 - Woodlands to Kranji Way (Loop) (Sundays &amp; PHs)<br> <br> A thrid feeder was started in 1987. Service 901 was introduced as
              Woodlands - Woodlands St 81 service and thereafter, the fourth
              feeder, Service 902 from Woodalnds - Woodlands St 32 in 1989.<br> <br> Service NS1 (a special shuttle from Woodlands to National Stadium)
              was introduced in 1989. This service only operates from 1800-1900
              from Woodlands and After Events back to Woodlands. The operating
              details would be published on newspapers and posters at Woodlands
              Int as well as along bus stops that plies the NS1 route.<br> <br> Service 926 was introduced as a Sunday &amp; PH service with a flat
              fare of 70c. It plys from Woodalnds to Singapore Zoo (loop
              service)<br> <br> Service 950 (Marsiling - Shenton Way), the first full fleet Air-Con
              service was introduced in 1989, with 10 Air Con Hino Ht238K buses
              (TIB380K to TIB389L) plying on Service 950. Other buses like the 2
              OAC Nissan Diesel buses (TIB279X and TIB280R) from 852 also settled
              on 950. TIB390G, another Nissan bus joins the service 950
              fleet.<br> <br> IN 1990, 3 more services were introduced. Service 951, 952 and
              SS7.<br> <br> Service 951 was introduced as Marsiling to Jurong Service,
              designated to be a Full AirCon fleet. DAF Hispanos were brought in
              to do service 951 as well as Service 950. This service was later
              amended to Boon Lay due to the closure of Jurong Int, together with
              178.<br> <br> Service 952 was introduced later in 1990 as Marsiling to Marina
              Centre, 3rd Full Aircon service. DAF Hispanos were used as
              well.<br> <br> Service SS7, a services that plys from Woodlands to Choa Chu Kang
              via Bt Panjang New Town. This service was the first service to use
              farecards on board, along with SBS 78.<br> <br> Known amendments of Service 182 was an amendment of route to
              Shenton Way instead of New Bridge rd.<br> <br> Service 180 was withdrawn in the late 1980s.<br> <br> Service 856 from Yishun to Woodlands was introduced in 1989 to
              cater the workers of Senoko Industral Estate.<br> <br> Let's take a look at the Woodlands Services in 1990<br> <br> 169 - Woodlands to Ang Mo Kio<br> 178 - Woodlands to Boon Lay<br> 181 - Woodlands to Crawford St<br> 182 - Marsiling to Shenton Way<br> 372 - Woodlands to Marsiling Dr (Loop)<br> 856 - Yishun to Woodlands<br> 900 - Woodlands to Woodlands St 13 (Loop)<br> 901 - Woodlands to Woodlands St 81 (Loop)<br> 902 - Woodlands to Woodlands St 32 (Loop)<br> 925 - Woodlands to Sungei Kadut Dr (Loop) - Mon-Sat<br> 925 - Woodlands to Kranji Way (Loop) - Sun &amp; PHs<br> 926 - Woodlands to Mandai Lake Rd (Loop)<br> 950 - Marsiling to Shenton Way<br> 951 - Marsiling to Boon Lay<br> 952 - Marsiling to Marina Centre<br> SS7 - Woodlands to Choa Chu Kang<br> <br> On 4 Feb 1996, the Woodlands Regional Int opened, located
              conveniently to Woodlands MRT Station. The first of a kind
              underground bus interchange, which intergates both Bus &amp; MRT
              hubs in the Woodlands area. A Retail development was also being
              planned at that time, that is linked conveniently to the MRT as
              well.<br> <br> The changes that took place when Woodlands Regional Int
              opened:<br> <br> Services that serves WRI (with minor amendments)<br> 169, 178, 181, 182, 856, 900, 902, 925, 926, 950, 951, 952,
              SS7<br> <br> Services that remains at the old Woodlands Int:<br> 372, 901<br> <br> Details of the extended route:<br> 169 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 8, Ave 9, continue its route from
              Admiralty Rd West<br> 178 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 5, Marsiling Rise, Rd, Drive,
              Admiralty Rd, continue its route from Woodlands Rd<br> 181 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from Woodlands
              Rd<br> 182 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from Woodlands

              Ctr Rd<br> 900 - Loops at old Woodlands Int<br> 902 - Loops at St 41 instead of St 32<br> 925 - Extended its route to CCK (Mon-Sat)<br> 926 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from BKE<br> 950 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from BKE<br> 951 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from BKE<br> 952 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from BKE<br> SS7 - Woodlands Reg Int, Ave 3, continue its route from BKE<br> <br> The rationalisation of Woodlands services was on 10 Mar 1996.
              Several services that had been affected.<br> <br> 169 - Merged with Service 857. It plys along Admiralty Rd East
              (part of 857 route) instead of Canberra Rd .<br> 178 - Amended to ply the deleted sector of former Service 372
              around the Marsiling Estate.<br> 181 - No route changes<br> 182 - Service withdrawal<br> 187 - Extended to Woodlands Int. Originally a Bukit Panjang to Boon
              Lay service.<br> 372 - Amended to operate at Woodlands Regional Int and became
              Service 903. Note that this service still plys from old Woodlands
              Int when the Woodlands Reg Int just opened.<br> 856 - Amended to ply along Canberra Rd<br> 858 - New Service from Woodlands to Yishun<br> 903 - Renumbered from Service 372. This service plys from Woodlands

Service 901 was the only
              service that ply from old Woodlands Int (better known as Woodlands
              Checkpoint Terminus). Although the routes that ply doesn't call at
              the new WRI Int, there were many feedbacks from residents. So TIBS
              decided to split out the route from 901 and introduce a new Service
              904 that plys from Woodlands to Woodlands Checkpoint Terminus).
              Service 901 was amended to start from the new Woodlands Reg Int and
              plys the existing route of 901.<br> <br> Service 905 and 906 were introduced to ply Woodlands Dr 50 and
              Woodlands Circle respectively.<br> <br> On 14 July 1996, is the merger of the existing feeder services to
              became an intra-town service. Intratown services means its a merger
              of 2 existing feeder service and it calls at the Interchange after
              doing its 1st loop before continuing its 2nd loop. Intra-town
              services are useful for passengers, so that they will not have to
              transfer buses to get to other side of Woodlands.<br> <br> 900 &gt; 911<br> 901 &gt; 911<br> 902 &gt; 912<br> 904 &gt; 913<br> 905 &gt; 912<br> 906 &gt; 913<br> <br> On the same day itself, a new Service 960 from Woodlands to Marina
              Centre via Bt Panjang was introduced.<br> <br> Services that were introduced/amended after 1996:<br> 181 - Was amended to Geylang Lor 1 Terminal due to the closure of

              <p>Questions about Volvo B57s:</p>
              <p>1. What did the "7 Turbo 6" signage on the big front grille meant??? 7 litre engine, and 6 speed automatic???</p>
              <p>- It means 7 litre, 6 cylinder turbocharged engine. This was found on Volvo heavy vehicles of the time. The B10MD had "10 Turbo 6" and I've seen an old Volvo truck showing "12 Turbo 8".</p>
              <p>3. Was there a B57 being converted to a full air con bus before??? If so, which bus (rego) was it??? Which depot did the modifications and it was based in which depot??? Which service it ran before???</p>
              <p>- This is a good question. I wish I knew the answer.</p>
              <p>6. Why are the designs of the 2 batches of Volvo B57 different, as in the design of the top canopy of the raised front route display board, one flat, one rounded, when they were newly acquired in the 1980s???</p>
              <p>- The raised desto design was fitted to the first batch of B57s. The second batch had the curved roof design, which was also fitted to the second batch of OF1417. Perhaps it was a design change requested by SBS?</p>
              <p>7. What happened to the B57 Soon Chow built Dumple Metsec demostrator??? Is it exported after a year or it was with SBS throughout its lifetime??? When was it deregistered then???</p>
              <p>- I saw the B57 demo by chance when I was cycling around Ang Mo Kio with my cousins in 1989/90. It was being used as a training bus. I presume it stayed with SBS till the end</p>
              <p>8. I remembered that the interior of the B57s are fully wood panel designs from driver onwards to end. Anyone can confirm???</p>
              <p>- Yes. Grey woodgrain design on a white background.</p>
              <p>9. I saw a picture of a B57 chassis in Soon Chow anniversary book. It had a newer generation front rims, like those on the Volvo Olympian 2 axles. I am certain it is a B57 because of the front engine layout. Did SBS change this rims to the older designed ones when the bus was built up??? Why SBS did that???</p>
              <p>- I'm quite sceptical of the picture. This is because Soon Chow had bodied another kind of front-engined Volvo chassis, the newer generation Volvo B7. The bus was owned by Paya Lebar Transit. I found a derelict B7 abandoned at a heavy vehicle park in Sin Ming but I'm not sure if its still there. Also, the knob I'm inclined to think that the chassis in the picture is that of a B7.</p>
              <p>10. The NZB and DM(demo) bodied B57s had center back service number holder. Was it used in public operations before??? If so, for how long??? Why was it not successful??? When was the year that they eventually put a SBS logo behind??? Same for the NZB and Hawke Mercedes Benz OF1417s???</p>
              <p>- Yes, the rear desto was used to show the service number but it didn't last very long. It was disused somewhere in 1985-86. Why they ditched the idea I do not know.</p>

                  Its front design of the BF177s do not follow the same as the other Hino buses, apart from its chassis,<br><br>Service 86 of 1977 (Tampines Way to Shenton Way) is under Hougang. Tampines Way is now part of Hougang Ave 3, to avoid confusion between Hougang new town and Tampines new town. Will post up the Hougang &amp; Punggol ones later

              <p>Let's now talk about the Hougang services first then to Punggol ones.<br><br>In 1978, the first few HDB blocks were completed at Tampines Way (the current Hougang Ave 3 stretch). With the completion of the estate, a new service 86 was introduced from Tampines Way to shenton way. It was the first pioneered service that uses the first batch of Layland Atlantean DDs with BACO and Metsec body.<br><br>Before Hougang New Town was developed, there were two terminals situated at Upp Serangoon Rd. They were situated at 10.5km of Upp Seragoon Rd and the another at the end of Upp Serangoon Rd. (Do not confuse Upp Serangoon Rd as Serangoon New Town as Upp Serangoon Rd runs through Hougang)<br><br>The Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at 10.5km has:<br>85 - To Sims Ave (loop)<br>111 - To C'waelth Ave (via Orchard Blvd)<br>112 - To C'wealth Ave (via Tiong Barhu Rd)<br><br>The Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at road end has:<br>136 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>156 - To Toa Payoh<br><br>In the early 1980s, the Hougang New Town began construction and its developing until the 1990s, together with the first gen of HDB blocks at Tampines Way. With this new satellite town developing, another new bus interchange was planned at Hougang St 21. In 1983, existing services from Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at 10.5km (except 112 which was withdrawn) began to termiante at the new Hougang Bus Interchange at Hougang St 21. Other services like 97 to Jurong East Central Ter were introduced as well as feeder services like 321, 323 and 329 that plies within the neighbourhood Hougang areas.<br><br>However, the Upp Serangoon Rd Ter at road end, still continues to operate, with 3 services, 84, 136 and 153. Service 156 was known to have been withdrawn in the early 1980s.<br><br>- Services in Hougang Bus Int in 1985 - <br><br>85 - To Sims Ave<br>97 - To Jurong East Ter<br>111 - To Buona Vista<br>321 - To Upp Paya Lebar Rd (Loop)<br>[322 - To Hougang Ave 2 (Loop)] - introduced at late 1985<br>323 - To Hougang Ave 5/7 (Loop)<br>[327 - To Hougang Ave 7 (Loop)] - introduced at late 1985<br>329 - To Defu Ave 1 (Loop)<br><br>In fact, in addition to the existing feeders, more feeders were planned, they were 326 and 328. 326 plys to Hougang Ave 6 and 328 plys to Hougang Ave 8. But there's only a minor change to 2 feeders, 323 and 329. Service 323 was actually an integration of existing 323 and 329, it plys via Hougang Ave 5 and 7 (old 323 route) and Defu Ave 1 (old 329 route), instead of Tampines Rd.<br><br>Service 54 was introduced as Hougang to Eunos service (a loop service) in 1986. Its routrings were:<br><br>Hougang Int, Hougang St 21, Hougang Ave 1, Tampiens Rd, Hougang Ave3, Eunos Link, Jln Eunos, Changi Rd, Jln Turi (Loop), Sims Ave, Jln Eunos, Eunos Link, Hougang Ave 3, Tampines Rd, Hougang Ave 1, Hougang St 21 and Hougang Int<br><br>And Service 54 was withdrawn in 1987. On the other hand, Service 51 was integrated with Service 54 for Hougang to Jln Eunos stretch, thus Service 51 extends to Hougang Int.<br><br>Other significant changes<br><br>The first Aircon Service in Hougang was Service 118, which was introduced to loop at Orchard Rd. This service was duplicated with existing 111 and was withdrawn after 2 years of service<br>62 was extended to Hougang Int (St 21) with the introduction of 63 that will termiante at Rumah Tinggi ter.<br>74 was extended to Upp Serangoon Rd End Ter in late 1988.<br>97 was being amended to Jurong East Int when the interchange kicks off operation in 1986.<br>111 was extended to Ghim Moh in the early 1990s.<br>132 was extended to Hougang Int (St 21) in the late 1980s.<br>147 was extended to Upp Serangoon Rd Ter in the early 1990s, with the merger of Service 83.<br>151 was introduced as Hougang to Kent Ridge Ter service<br>153 was amended to serve Bt Merah Ctrl in 1992 instead of Henderson Rd<br>322 was amended to ply along Hougang St 61 in 1986.<br><br>A new interchange was planned at Hougang Central. As the existing bus interchange in Hougang St 21 does not have enough boarding space to accomodate more services, the latter had to be terminated at the new interchange instead. Upp Serangoon Rd End Ter was acquired for future developments and services that terminate at the terminal had no choice but have to re-amended all its routings.<br><br>By end 1994, the Hougang Central Interchange was completed. All the exising Upp Serangoon Rd End Ter  services terminate at the new int. The existing interchange in Hougang St 21 was renamed as Hougang South Int, so as not to confuse between the 2 interchanges bearing the same estate.<br><br>Service 97, 111 and 165 was also being amended to Hougang Ctrl.<br><br>- Services at Hougang Ctrl Int -<br>74 - To Buona Vista<br>84 - To WTC<br>97 - To Jurong East<br>111 - To Ghim Moh<br>136 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>147 - To Clementi<br>153 - To Bt Merah<br>165 - To Clementi<br>325 - To Hougang St 51 (Loop)<br><br>- Services at Hougang South Int -<br>51 - To Jurong East<br>62 - To New Bridge Rd<br>132 - To Bt Merah<br>151 - To Kent Ridge<br>321 - To Upp Paya Lebar Rd (Loop)<br>322 - To Hougang St 61 (Loop)<br>323 - To Defu Ave 1 (Loop)<br>326 - To Hougang Ave 6 (Loop)<br>327 - To Hougang Ave 7 (Loop)<br>328 - To Hougang Ave 8 (Loop)<br><br>- Changes after 1994 -<br>27 - Extends to Hougang Ctrl Int on end 2002 running via Buangkok.<br>51 - Amended to ply Pandan Gdns in 2002 and extends to Hougang Ctrl int on 15 feb 2004 when the Hougang South int closed.<br>62 - Re-routed to form Punggol to Lor 1 Geylang loop svc under NEL Rationalisation<br>80 - New Service between Tampines to Hougang Ctrl.

              <p><br>Great write up on the Hougang, Punggol bus service history.</p>
              <p>I missed the heydays of Hougang South bus interchange. The Hougang feeders all fully used Volvo B57s before changing to Volvo B10M MK2 NACs then to Volvo Olympians 2 axles NACs to Volvo B10M MK2 CACs.</p>
              <p>Luckily 147 was saved from the NEL rationalisation, the demand now is still high for this service, even with NEL. This shows that bus services are still important despite MRT lines. Too bad many of the services, 81, 82, 84, old 85, 97, 111, 501, 502, 511 and 512 are not so lucky. I missed the rides of double deckers along the tunnels of CTE. :(</p>
              <p>Anyway, the old estate along Tampines Way in the late 1970s refers to BLK 1 to 25 along Hougang Ave 3, near Hougang CC???</p>
              <p>Was there a bus terminal along Tampines Way for service 86 or was it just a roadside bus stop???</p>

One at Gagak Selari Barat (now known as Jln Bukit Merah) and the another at Redhill Close. Kent Ridge services terminate at Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd) ans South Buona Vista Rd (sv 200). Clementi Services were introduced in 1978 after certain parts of Clementi New Town were developed.<br><br>Below shows the list of the services after the 1971 re-organatisation<br><br>- Services from Gagak Selari Barat (Jln Bukit Merah) - <br>63 - To MacPherson Est<br>65 - To MacPherson Est<br>90 - To Paya Lebar Airport<br>92 - To Paya Lebar Airport<br>93A - To Paya Lebar Airport (was later introduced)<br>153 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>195 - Loops at this terminal from Crawford<br>196 - To Jurong Shipyard<br><br>- Services from Redhill Close - <br>41 - To Telok Kurau<br>41A - To Joo Chiat Rd<br><br>- Services from Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd) -<br>33 - To Changi Rd (near Siglap Rd)<br>145 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>146 - To Toa Payoh Town Centre<br>192A - To South Canal<br>201 - To Jln Jurong Kechil<br><br>- Services from South Buona Vista Rd - <br>200 - To Up Bt Timah Rd (10 ms)<br><br>During the 1974 rationalisation, certain alternate routes were withdrawn to aviod duplication of existing service that ply on the same route.<br><br>90 - To by pass Paya Lebar Rd<br>92 - Amended to ply at the Jln Bukit Merah Terminus (near Rumah Bomba Circus)<br>93A - Service withdrawal<br>192A - Renumbered to 192<br>196 - Amended to Prince Edward Rd<br>200 - Amended to Pasir Panjang Rd (near Clementi Rd)<br>201 - Amended to Toh Tuck Rd with integration of former 207.<br><br>Now let's emphasise about the late 1970s till the 1980s of the Bt maerh, Kent Ridge &amp; Clementi Services<br><br>Bukit Merah Services were quite sketchy in the past, compared to the 1971 re-organisation. They were terminating in different parts of Jln Bukit Merah like Service 50 from Kaki Bukit Malay Settlement (Jln Eunos) to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd) and Service 65 from MacPherson to Jln Bukit Merah (near Henderson Rd). Those services were clustered in different locations making it inconvenient for other passengers, which began a critical point to re-organise its Bt Merah services into one interchange, so the need of a centralised bus service hub is needed for Bukit Merah. The Bukit Merah Interchange was completed and commence operations in 1980.<br><br>Kent Ridge Services were termianted in a new location at Clementi Rd, previous location was at Pasir Panjang Rd, which is known as the Kent Ridge Ter on which the name 'Kent Ridge' was taken from the NUS Kent Ridge Campus as well as the proposed Kent Ridge Hospital (now known as NUH).<br><br>Clementi Services has a terminal at Clementi Ave 3 (Os Blk 437), which temporary houses the Clementi Services including feeder 284 as the new interchange is still under construction. It was a roadside terminal as well. The bus interchange was completed in 1984.<br><br>More feeders were added for the Bukit Merah and Clementi areas. This allows residents from both estates to have direct and convenient links to the town centres of Bukit Mearh  &amp; Clementi rather than taking its regular trunk services to get around and a walking distance just to get to the town centres. Off peak wastage could be a possible reason as to why certain services are taking a long time to arrive at the bus stops.<br><br>- List of services in Bt Merah [brackets denote previous termination point] -<br>14 - To Somapah [previously from Mei Chin Rd]<br>16 - To Marine Terrace [previously from Telok Blangah Heights]<br>41 - To Bedok [previously from Redhill Close, was amended later in 1985]<br>44 - To Chai Chee Ter [previously from Redhill Close, was later withdrawn]<br>50 - To Jln Eunos [previously from Jln Bukit Merah (Henderson Rd)]<br>125 - To St Michael's Est [previously from Telok Blangah Way]<br>132 - To Ang Mo Kio [previously loops at Tomlinson Rd from Ang Mo Kio]<br>139 - To Toa Payoh [previously from Jln Bukit Merah (Henderson Rd)]<br>153 - To Toa Payoh [previously from Jln Bukit Merah (Henderson Rd)]<br>184 - To Jurong [previously from Telok Blangah Way]<br>271 - To Telok Blangah Cres (Loop)<br>272 - To Telok Blangah Way (Loop)<br>273 - To Telok Blangah Heights (Loop)<br>274 - To Depot Rd (Loop)<br>275 - To Bt Purmei Ave (Loop)<br>850 (TIBS) - To Yishun<br>851 (TIBS) - To Yishun<br>CSS 8 - To Bedok South Rd [Re-routed to HDB new town instead of plying around the city area and it was subsequently amended to Bedok Int]<br><br>- List of services in Kent Ridge Ter -<br>33 - To Chai Chee [was extended to Bedok in mid-1984 when Chai Chee Ter closed]<br>145 - To Toa Payoh<br>200 - To Jln Anak Bukit (Loop)<br>201 - To Jln Anak Bukit (Loop)<br>216 - To C'wealth Ave (Loop)<br><br>- List of services in Clementi in the late 1970s -<br>74 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>176 - To Crawford St<br>185 - To C'wealth Ave<br>186 - To Anson Rd<br>191 - To Prince Edward Rd<br>209 - To Crawford St<br>284 - To Clementi Ave 4 (Loop)<br><br>- List of services in Clementi in 1985 -<br>74 - To Ang Mo Kio<br>75 - To Empress Place (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>76 - To Jurong East Ave 1 (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>92 - To Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) [extended from Alexandra Rd]<br>95 - To Paya Lebar Airport (Loop) [extended from Ulu Pandan Ter]<br>96 - To Kent Ridge Cres (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>146 - To Toa Payoh [extended from Pasir Panjang Rd]<br>186 - To Shenton Way [extended from Anson Rd]<br>205 - To Jalan Anak Bukit (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>209 - To Crawford St <br>282 - To Clementi Ave 5 (Loop) [newly introduced]<br>284 - To Clementi Ave 4 (Loop)<br>285 - To Pandan Loop (Loop) [newly introduced<br>287 - To Clementi Ave 2 (Loop) [newly introudced]<br><br>Here are the Bukit Merah, Clementi &amp; kent Ridge services that were introduced/amended/withdrawn from the 1980s to present.<br><br>In Bukit Merah<br>5 - Service introduced as Bukit Merah to Pasir Ris on 11 Mar 2007<br>14 - Service extends to Changi Village Ter when Somapah ter closed and later on cutback to Bedok.

It added that its feedback showed that many undergraduates wanted a return of service 216."<br><br>"An SBS spokesman said a new bus service, No. 95, was started in January. It connects Buona Vista MRT Station to NUS/National University Hospital near the science faculty."<br><br>"Moreover, the savings from scrapping services 216 had been channeled to improve service 96."<br><br>"SBS said service 216 was getting less popular, so it was scrapped."<br><br>"With the MRT now serving major housing estates, many NUS students have switched to service 96, which provides the link to the nearest MRT station, at Clementi."<br><br>"Although service 216 linked NUS to the MRT system at Buona Vista, it was less popular as the transfer between bus and MRT involved a long walk, SBS said."<br><br>"Also the trip by service 96 between NUS and the MRT station is some 2km shorter than that by service 216."<br><br>Certain factors on why 216 was withdrawn was been drawn out and explained in detail by SBS. That's why 216 was never being re-introduced, despite many feedbacks from the NUSSU to get the service 216 back and they had no choice they had to take 95 or 96 to get to NUS campus.<br><br>EDIT: service 165 correction made<br>============================================================</p>

              <p>Anyway, the old estate along Tampines Way in the late 1970s
              refers to BLK 1 to 25 along Hougang Ave 3, near Hougang CC???</p>
              <p>Was there a bus terminal along Tampines Way for service 86 or
              was it just a roadside bus stop???</p>
