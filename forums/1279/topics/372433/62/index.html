              <p>u dun get it</p>
              <p>The MRT rationalisation was not really for e MRT.</p>
              <p>Cos for 4 reasons.</p>
              <p>Before I go on, they stopped at 1993 cos too many complains abt e changes.</p>
              <p>1) Resettlement: No pt for places like Punggol to have both 82 &amp; 83. Hence, SBS could get deploy better resources onto the amended 147 to Hougang which was developing.</p>
              <p>2) Feeder Svs: Though lesser buses needed to CBD due to MRT and remove bus - bus duplication, buses were alrdy needed to cover the new towns. Singapore experienced boom in New Town devt in 1980s.</p>
              <p>3) Corridor w/o MRT: Like Sv 163, instead of going to CBD, serve Toa Payoh instead. Or like 201, extend to Hougang to let ppl at Bt Timah got bus svs to Hougang Ave 3.</p>
              <p>4) Buses still needs to be there: Eg like 105 ended up plying MRT route instead of Holland Rd. The buses still needs to be there.</p>
