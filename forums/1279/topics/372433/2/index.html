              <p><br>Yes, there used to be a Jurong interchange in the past. Services 10, 30, 154, 157, 165, 187 (now Tibs/SMRT), 196, 198, 199, feeders and JIS all terminate there. Tibs services 178, 852 and 951 terminate at the Jurong Interchange too. All the SBS services plying along Jurong Interchange should be based under JRBP.</p>
              <p>When Boon Lay interchange opened together with the MRT in 1990, most to the Jurong interchange bus services were amended to terminate at Boon Lay interchange. Whereas services 10, 165 and 196 terminate at Clementi instead. Feeder 241 (not the current one) was amended to Jurong East interchange.</p>

              handed over to JRBP (now SLBP), the Merc WAs replaced the Volvo

              <p>I took Sv 157 to my camp every day from 1993 - 1995. No MK III at all. It got SBS381-386 + some other merc... lot of LO2x during that period. 6929/6959/6985/7148/7176 etc etc...i think the BC of former 6959 still drove Sv 157 as of today... Sv 157 was alrd under JRBP that time. It was under BBDEP in the 80s if i am not wrong.</p>

              <p><br>Some clementi routes like service 96 and feeders 282 284 285 used to be under JE groups with soon chow Merc OF1413s. Remembered seeing them when I was young. Service 92 (Clementi - PLA) was under BB side or HG side if I am not wrong, had perm Merc OF1417s and Albion Vikings.</p>
              <p>It was in 1990 when Clementi routes came under BB. Albion Vikings and subsequently Volvo B57s and MK2s were deployed on Clementi short haul services.</p>
              <p>I also remembered service 105 under BB group when newly introduced in 1988 - with Albion Viking, Volvo B57 followed by Volvo MK2s. Then came under AM group in 1990 with Merc OF1417 Hawke. LAs was also introduced on service 105 until in 1992 the route was diverted to Lorong Chuan, service 105's fleets became a NAC MB0405 fleet.</p>

              <p>105 had full Merc fleet because it was joint AMDEP/JRDEP responsibility, IIRC. Anyway, the Leyland Vikings and Volvo B57s never served on this route, but on its predecessor (95-CLE to PLAB via Holland Rd, Scotts Rd, TPY new town and 93 route to PLAB).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember it was around 1990-91 that the Merc fleets were being pulled from CLE and replaced by Leyland Vikings and Volvo B57s. Also interesting to note that 106 (SER-BBT) had B57s too. My impression was that 106 was full AMDEP all along.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>198 was JRDEP/HGDEP before being cut short to BMR. It was full JRDEP (LO2X, Merc O405 OAC) later on, then BBDEP took control in 1993 (LA, Volvo B10M Mk III).</p>

              <p>When 188 was intoduced, it was under JRBP group, instead of BBDEP since BBDEP controls all of CCK services. It was mainly made up of LO2xs and Merczs. I saw SBS7120S, some LO2xs and some Merczs. SBS453C was also one of permers. After handover to TIBS, 188 became FAC, whereas SBS7120S went back to serve 335, not sure about the other redeployment of buses. </p>
              <p> Is it not enough space for BBDEP to control 188?</p>

              <p>later it was amended to ply the lornie rd sector and skip town altogether provinging a cross island fast link, which was the trend of the bus changes in late 1970s say 1978. by then 165 was allowed to recive new new atleantans all from AMK side.</p>

              <p><br>Service 198 was amended to Jurong East interchange when Jurong interchange closed. Became Boon Lay - Bukit Merah in June 1992 when service 64 took over part of its route. With service 198 went over from Jurong East to Boon Lay, service 197 came over from Boon Lay to Jurong East.</p>

              <p><br>There is an interesting story here to inform also.</p>
              <p>then 125 terminated at Shenton Way along with svc 400. it was odd then. Svc 400 was a full BRAM svc So for meal breaks relief, svc 125 was chosen as the meal break crossovers. So we saw HGDEP amrk 3s jump from 125 do svc 400. this was in 1994 or so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after so many many years, svc 125 was amended and became some Sims place and st mikes svc serving kallng ind park, totally losing its orginal service chracter and route. But the 125.400 crossover stays on till today.</p>
