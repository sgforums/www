              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I don't remember any dates but the chronology of events is something like this. In the beginning, the only access to JW N9 was via Pioneer Rd Nth. Both 99 and 188 would turn in from Upp Jurong Rd (now JW Ave 3). When N7 and N8 were occupied, it was 188 which was first amended via Ave 5 &amp; St 72. Eventually, 99 was also amended along the same route and everything was cool until the opening of Boon Lay Int/MRT.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">175 was amended and 242 was introduced. So, for a while, JW St 91 was happily served by 4 services: 99, 175, 188, 242. Service 175 was a CMI case after its amendment. The buses were always empty, although it was nice to see an Albion Viking going round the bends. :-) And so, due to poor ridership, its sayonara 175.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As for 188's case, its duplication. The main purpose for 188 was for the JW Ext residents to gain access to Jurong Bus Interchange and Lakeside MRT. So when the MRT and interchange at Boon Lay was completed, it became redundant and its ridership wasn't as strong as before. And so, arrivederchi 188 and we are left with 2 services again; 99, 242.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Then somewhere along the line came 243. If I'm not mistaken, when 243 came, it took over the route via JW St 72, Ave 5 &amp; Pioneer Rd Nth. 242 was amended to go via Upp Jurong Rd, Pioneer Rd Nth. This chapter was a bit confusing as changes took place back and forth between 242 and 243. Eventually when St 81 was completed and 243 was made to serve that area while 242 got back its original route.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Route enhancements were made to 243 later on but as far as 99 and 242 were concerned, that was the end of the story until 2009, when Pioneer MRT was opened and I'm sure everyone knew what happened then. ;-)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 5pt; margin-left: 5pt; margin-right: 5pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">That's the end of my long winded tale. This is pure memory work from my experience as a JW resident of over 20 years. There's bound to be mistakes and some things which I've missed out. Hence, I'd like to apologise beforehand. Thank you.</span></p>

              <p><br>Is it true that apart from Upp Jurong Road being renamed to Jurong West Ave 4 and the Jurong West Central 1 portion, the current 242 route is almost identical to the past 243 route?</p>

              <p><br>Service 858 was introduced in 4 Feb 1996, initially from Woodlands to Yishun with the opening of the new Woodlands Regional Interchange. The route initially plied along Yishun Ave 3 passing by Yishun Junior College. Only in Nov 1997 service 858 was extended to Changi Airport via SLE/TPE/PIE, on the same day the route was diverted to ply along Yishun Ave 5 instead of Ave 3.</p>
