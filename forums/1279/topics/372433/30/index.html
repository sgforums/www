                  I think there was a plan for Seletar New Town wayback in 1981, one of its case is probably that the parts of Seletar areas are adjourned by private housing estates.<br><br>Similar to the case when there were plans to have a high rise development and a shopping mall that was previously being occupied by the New World Park at Jln Besar in 1982, but it failed to materalise for nearly 25 years until a new shopping cum office space was erected at the former site of New World Park, known as City Square Mall (not to confuse with JB City Suqare).

              <p><br>Nope, the villages are still there as of today. I stay near that area and passes by the village houses everyday. Also notice a lot of heavy vehicles parking along Lor Buangkok tracks. Suyra home is still there as well (entrance by service 101 looping point). Perhaps soon in the next 5 years?</p>
              <p>According to the plan Buangkok Dr is supposed to be extended to YCK Road from Buangkok Green, but till now still yet to see the road construction begin.</p>

              <p><br>There wasn't Sengkang in the past. Punggol Rd used to be bounded by its smaller rural tracks (Track 1, Track 2, etc), Cheng Lim &amp; Buangkok South Farmway roads. Until massive developments in that area, then these roads were abolished to make way for Senggkang New Town. For Buangkok South Farmawy 1, it was shortened to connect to the 7 4-storey HDB blocks (Blks 1-5, 206,207), which was aslo affected by SERS and was also cleared for redevelopment and so that road is gone.<br><br>It is true to come to a point that only 82 &amp; 83 serve the rural districts of Punggol Village - there was only one terminal at the end of Punggol Rd (bound by Track 24 &amp; 26) and located at a nearby seafood restaurant. But Service 83 was withdrawn when the service integrates with 147, leaving 82 behind, serving Shenton Way.</p>

              I don't recall the Mercedes-Benz OF1417 (Hawke body and NZB body)
              still on service in 2000. The Mercedes-Benz OF1417 was brought in
              by SBS in 1980/1981. Even if the statutory lifespan was 15 years,
              they only lasted till 1995/1996. And I think that the statutory
              lifespan of buses in 2000 is still 12 years, so they should have
              already pharsed out by 1993/1994, together with the Volvo B57s.</p>

              That's how TIBS had decided to purchase the new Mercedes buses in 1994 to replace older fleets, as some of the Hinos/Nissans that were registered in 1983 were about to complete its 12 year statutory lifespan.

              <p><br>The Tibs expansion did not just stop here. It expanded its network further to the upcoming Yishun new town in 1985-1987. The following Yishun bus services were introduced originally by Tibs:-</p>
              <p>850 - Yishun to Bt Merah via Orchard Rd and Shenton Way (withdrawn in 1993)<br>851 - Yishun to Bt Merah via Bugis, Chinatown and Outram Park (no route change)<br>852 - Yishun to Jurong via Bt Timah and Bt Batok (cutback to Bt Batok in 1996)<br>853 - Yishun to Lor 1 Geylang/Marine Parade via Serangoon<br>854 - Yishun to Bedok via Hougang and Jln Eunos (no route change)<br>855 - Yishun to WTC via Upp Thomson and Bt Merah (no route change)<br>856 - Yishun to Woodlands via Admiralty and Senoko estate</p>
              <p>On top of that, Yishun feeders 800 801 802 803 804 805 were also introduced by Tibs too. Woodlands feeders 900 901 902 were eventually introduced when Woodlands new town continued to expand in the 1980s.</p>
              <p>Service 171 was also amended to terminate at Yishun interchange in the 1980s and it was the only SBS service to ply along Yishun all those while. In Nov 1995 service 171 finally went under Tibs control.</p>

              <p><br>Service 72 initially plied from YCK to Seagate along AMK Ave 5. It was integrated with the former service 80 (Hougang Ctrl to Tampines) to become a YCK - Tampines service. The integrated service 72 used HGDEP Volvo MK3s previously from service 80 as well as some MB0405s from AMDEP for a start. It was only sometime later when service 72 went under full AMDEP control.</p>
              <p>Service 85 all the while is under HGDEP, never controlled by AMDEP before.</p>

              <p><br> 900, 901, 902 and 904 only loops at the old Woodlands Checkpoint
                      terminus. 905 and 906 doesn't loop there.<br> <br> In addition, 911, 912 &amp; 913 continue serving the Woodlands
                      Checkpoint terminus until Mar 2003 when the terminus can no longer
                      be used for buses to enter. The problem is that the old bus bay in
                      the terminus is frequently used for illegal parking since 2001,
                      when mototrists were unable to find a proper parking lots in the
                      car park. It was sealed up to curb illegal parking.</p>

              <p> <br>Another point to note: 901 still terminate at the old Woodlands Int when its Woodlands services were amended to Woodlands Reg Int on 4 Feb 1996.<br><br>Some missed out facts: When the Woodlands Chekpt Terminus closed down in early 2003, and 911, 912, 913 would terminate at Marsiling Rd. Passengers who want to continue the trip will board the bus from Woodlands Centre Rd (opp the Town Garden)</p>
