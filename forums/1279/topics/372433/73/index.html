              <p><br>From what I could know, when 800 was introduced in 1984, someone says the route is:</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 5, 2, 7, Sembawang Rd &amp; Yishun Ave 5.</p>
              <p> In 1987, they said that the route is:</p>
              <p>Yishun Int, Yishun Ctrl, Yishun Ave 9, Yishun Ring Rd, Yishun Ave 7, Sembawang Rd, Yishun Ave 5, 2, Yishun Ring Rd, Yishun Ave 9, Yishun Ctrl, Yishun Ave 2, Yishun Int.</p>
              <p>In 1988 it was then amended to the current route looping at St 71.</p>

              <p>It's M1. If I'm not wrong, in the past M1 plys between Ghim Moh &amp; Mount Sinai, later change starting &amp; ending point in 1994 at Science Park I, but in 2007 or 8, it was changed back to start at Ghim Moh, plying Science Park I before Mount Sinai. Can be say to be a Townlink service. Same goes to M2.</p>

              <p><br>Service 859's fleet had several fleet changes and depot transfers ever since its introduction in Apr 1999. It started off under WLDEP control with full fleet Scania Striders, TIB657M and TIB659H were among the perms if I am not wrong. When 859 was handed over to AMDEP, Lances were initially deployed, after which 0405s from AMDEP were deployed too. In 2000 service 859 started getting bendies and slowly upgraded to a full bendy fleet.</p>
