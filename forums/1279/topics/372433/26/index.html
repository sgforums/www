              <p>==== HISTORY OF PASIR RIS SERVICES ====<br> <br> The history of Pasir Ris service can be traced back as early as
              1984, when its lone service, 403, which plys from Pasir Ris Rd
              (Pasir Ris Beach paek) to Elias Rd and loops back. This service
              only operates only on Suns &amp; PHs on selected timings
              only.<br> <br> Not many have noticed that Pasir Ris (in the past there was Kampong
              Pasir Ris which is off Loyang Rd) was once a fishing village, which
              coupled together with Loyang area, facing the sea and the famous
              Pasir Ris Bach Chalet Resort and the pasir ris park. But until in
              the late 1980s, several HDB flats were completed in Pasir Ris
              mainly block 1xx and the NTUC Pasir Ris Resort (now Downtown East)
              was also erected just around pasir Ris Close/Pasir Ris Dr 3.<br> <br> The only service, whcih was the first service to terminate at Pasir
              Ris terminal at Pasir Ris Dr 6 was service 12, which was extended
              from Somapah Terminal because that terminal was closed permanently
              in 1989 and at the same time shortened to New Bridge Rd. Another
              service 19, which loops at Pasir Ris Dr 6 from Bedok, was also
              being amended to terminate at Pasir Ris Ter until when the new
              Pasir Ris Int opened, then service 12 and 19 was amended to
              terminate at the new Pasir Ris Int.<br> <br> when Service 4 was being merged with Service 19, the service became
              Pasir Ris to St. Michael's ter in 1989. Service 19 was then
              withdrawn and a new feeder service 350 from Pasir Ris to Pasir Ris
              Dr 4 (Loop) was introduced, followed by 351, 352, 353 in the later
              years of Pasir Ris Services.<br> <br> Service 403 was amended to start its operations from pasir Ris Int
              to pasir Ris Rd (Loop), to enhance its services to the newly
              developed Pasir Ris New Town.<br> <br> PASIR RIS SERVICES IN 1990<br> 4 - To St Michael's Ter<br> 8 - To Toa Payoh (AIRCON SERVICE)<br> 12 - To New Bridge Rd<br> 350 - To Pasir Ris Dr 4 (Loop)<br> 351 - To Pasir Ris St 11 (Loop)<br> 352 - To pasir Ris St 12 (Loop)<br> 353 - To Pasir Ris Dr 10 (Loop)<br> 403 - To Pasir Ris Rd (Loop)<br> <br> Another interesting point to know about Service 350, is that the
              service runs through Pasir Ris Close / NTUC Pasir Ris Resotr (the
              looping point of current Service 354) on selected timings only. On
              other occasion, the service would directly continue via Pasir Ris
              Dr 3.<br> <br> SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PASIR RIS SERVICES AFTER 1990:<br> NOTE: Other amendments that were taken place externally are not
              shown here.<br> 4 - Service shortened to Tampines in 1992.<br> 5 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah in 2007.<br> 6 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Loyang Cres (Loop) service
              in 1993. The service was amended to ply along Loyang Way and Loyang
              Ave in 2004.<br> 8 - Service shortened to Tampines in 1992.<br> 12 - Service amended to ply Victoria St and Hill St instead of
              North Bridge Rd and South bridge Rd.<br> 15 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Eunos in 1990. In 1997,
              meged with Service M4 and extended to Marine Parade Ter. When
              service 13 was amended, the service would no longer ply along
              Marine Cres.<br> 17 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Bedok. It was amended to
              serve Bedok North Ave 4, when 227 was withdrawn in 2002 and bacame
              a loop svc in 2003.<br> 21 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Geylang Lor 1 Ter. With the
              merger of Service 4, the service was extended to St. Michael's Ter.
              Service was then amended to Jln Beasr and Kitchener Rd as part of
              the NEL Rationalisation in 2003.<br> 27 - Service amended to pasir Ris int in 1993 and then pasir Ris St

              <p>==== HISTORY OF PASIR RIS SERVICES ====<br><br>The history of Pasir Ris service can be traced back as early as 1984, when its lone service, 403, which plys from Pasir Ris Rd (Pasir Ris Beach paek) to Elias Rd and loops back. This service only operates only on Suns &amp; PHs on selected timings only.<br><br>Not many have noticed that Pasir Ris (in the past there was Kampong Pasir Ris which is off Loyang Rd) was once a fishing village, which coupled together with Loyang area, facing the sea and the famous Pasir Ris Bach Chalet Resort and the pasir ris park. But until in the late 1980s, several HDB flats were completed in Pasir Ris mainly block 1xx and the NTUC Pasir Ris Resort (now Downtown East) was also erected just around pasir Ris Close/Pasir Ris Dr 3.<br><br>The only service, whcih was the first service to terminate at Pasir Ris terminal at Pasir Ris Dr 6 was service 12, which was extended from Somapah Terminal because that terminal was closed permanently in 1989 and at the same time shortened to New Bridge Rd. Another service 19, which loops at Pasir Ris Dr 6 from Bedok, was also being amended to terminate at Pasir Ris Ter until when the new Pasir Ris Int opened, then service 12 and 19 was amended to terminate at the new Pasir Ris Int.<br><br>when Service 4 was being merged with Service 19, the service became Pasir Ris to St. Michael's ter in 1989. Service 19 was then withdrawn and a new feeder service 350 from Pasir Ris to Pasir Ris Dr 4 (Loop) was introduced, followed by 351, 352, 353 in the later years of Pasir Ris Services.<br><br>Service 403 was amended to start its operations from pasir Ris Int to pasir Ris Rd (Loop), to enhance its services to the newly developed Pasir Ris New Town.<br><br>PASIR RIS SERVICES IN 1990<br>4 - To St Michael's Ter<br>8 - To Toa Payoh (AIRCON SERVICE)<br>12 - To New Bridge Rd<br>350 - To Pasir Ris Dr 4 (Loop)<br>351 - To Pasir Ris St 11 (Loop)<br>403 - To Pasir Ris Rd (Loop)<br><br>Another interesting point to know about Service 350, is that the service runs through Pasir Ris Close / NTUC Pasir Ris Resotr (the looping point of current Service 354) on selected timings only. On other occasion, the service would directly continue via Pasir Ris Dr 3.<br><br>SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PASIR RIS SERVICES AFTER 1990:<br>NOTE: Other amendments that were taken place externally are not shown here.<br>4 - Service shortened to Tampines in 1992.<br>5 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah in 2007.<br>6 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Loyang Cres (Loop) service in 1993.

It was amended back to Tampines int in 1995, with the amendments of service 15 and 53.<br>58 - Service introduced as Pasir Ris to Bishan in 2005.<br>88 - Service introdced as Pasir Ris to Toa Payoh in 1999<br>350 - Withdrawn and merged with 353 to form Townlink 358<br>351 - Withdrawn and merged with 355 to form Townlink 359<br>352 - Feeder svc introduce from Pasir Ris To pasir Ris St 12 (Loop) in 1993.
