              <p><br>Service 190 when newly introduced in 1988 was a full single deck fleet made up of majority SC Albion Vikings and a few Volvo B57s. The Volvo MK2 WAs were meant to replace the outgoing Albion Vikings at that time. However due to the overwhelming crowd SBST had no choice but to deploy Leyland WAs to this route (can't remember when DDs started).</p>
              <p>For service 190 going PAC, Merc 0405 DMs were initially deployed, followed by Volvo MK3s and then the LO3x deployments.</p>
