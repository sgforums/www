              <p>Ulu Pandan was a roadside terminal, its location was at the last bus stop before the junction with Clementi Rd. As far as I recall, there wasn't a terminal at the restaurant site and that the restaurant had at one time co-existed with the terminal. There was also a radio taxi stand there (I believe it still exists?). It was taxis rather than buses which parked in the compounds of the restaurant.</p>

              <p>I would repeat this again:</p>
              <p>171 was from full AM to AM/WL. At the same date after 852, 859 went full WL from full AM, 961 became WL/AM from full WL, 985 from full KJ to KJ/AM. AM 985 inherited ex-AM 852 dennis Lances.</p>
              <p>To conclude, some of WL 961 buses went over AM 961, 5 AM 171 buses and KJ 173 permers went over KJ 970, ex-WL 75 Scanias went over WL 171. WL 173 inherited some of WL 75 and WL 970 merczs. WL 61 get WL 700 merczs.</p>
              <p>Unsure about KJ 75 fleets though.</p>
              <p>Maybe can talk about June redeployment (2nd Round) on past route &amp; deployments as this thread is talking at qns about Singapore buses.</p>

              <p>During 2nd round,</p>
              <p>Buses which they were from orginally before March went back to the perm services.</p>
              <p>For example, TIB468S WL 970&gt; WL 173. Then, it went back KJ 970. The same goes to: TIB469P WL 75&gt; WL 859&gt; KJ 75, TIB490B AM 859&gt; KJ 188???&gt; WL 859</p>
              <p>The ex-WL 75 Scanias went back to KJ 75, except TIB669D which is sole WL 171 permer (meant to replace TIB497H or TIB505T, not sure which one). So, which means all of AM 171 permers went over from KJ 970 to WL 171 except TIB497H which stayed. The only KJ 173 permer which stayed at KJ 970 was: TIB625E.</p>
              <p>This involved most of total fleets. As the rest of them were not affected on 2nd round. For example. TIB824Y  KJ 61 &gt; KJ 700. It did not went over WL 61 with TIB425R and companies, but stayed.</p>

              <p>Well, can say for 2nd round of reployment,</p>
              <p>Those which were from KJ 173 like: 761, 785, 787 went back WL 173 from KJ 970 whereas some went over AM 985, 790, 794 went over 177/925 to replace 739 and another bus and the rest went back WL 171.</p>

              <p><br>You missed out TIB725A from the WLDEP 920/922 before handing to KJDEP. There were about 2 or 3 buses which went back to KJDEP after transfer to WLDEP during the 2nd round (if i can remember correctly it was either 805C/806A and 633G and 828L).</p>
              <p>TIB1155M came to WLDEP during 2nd round of deployments, the very same batch that TIB1154R came to WLDEP, TIB1037X to AMDEP and TIB1062Y to KJDEP.</p>
              <p>TIB671X and TIB672T did not cameo on Svc 911 at all during that period. Both cameo-ed on Svc 912 during Nov and Dec 2007 (some speculations on it being perm for Holiday1 schedule). In fact TIB868X's slot had been done by TIB1037X all that while. TIB1032J, TIB1037X and TIB1039R all arrived in WLDEP during first batch redeployment and went to perm Svc 911 about a month after at the same time. It was due to TIB1037X's transfer to AMDEP that TIB868X was redeployed from WL 169 to WL 911. </p>
              <p>Similarly TIB1025E left Svc 900 to become a SP bus so that TIB878S could join the fleet from WL 169. TIB1025E was later a 187 WLDEP (believed to be replacement for the burnt 1105H)</p>

              <p>The paragraph said he "turned a sleepy bus terminal corner....into a seafood haven". The statement is vague as it didn't mention that the restaurant was built over or converted from an old bus terminal. Neither were there any statements in the article which indicate that the restaurant was formerly a bus terminal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was a long time ago but I'm certain that the terminus was a roadside affair because I've seen it before as a 10 yr old kid. Only someone who was old enough to have seen and remember the terminal would be able to confirm its true location.</p>

              <p>After 1981 - The terminal was a roadisde terminal. Much liike most bus terminals of the day. the timekeepers hut location is assumed to had been where the current bus stop at the terminal is standing.</p>
              <p>before 1981 - It is unclear but mention was made that when Clementi new town was new, no bus int was in the new town. instead a "Ulu pandan terminal" located in the big car park to blk 343 and 340 was sued and that 'services called there and parked in the car park" the car park still stands. I spoke to a resident living there for many years and he does indeed recall bsues parked there as a bus terminus.</p>
              <p>Whether this was Clementi temp ter is unclear as it weas the norm for SBS to sue big car parks as temp terminlas in new towns in the 1970s.</p>
              <p>before 1977 - it is unclear whether the terminal existed.</p>

              <p><br>heh 183   i recall seeing the service serving Upper Ayaer rajah rd. Where it goes not very sure. current assumption is Jurong ind est then AYE and then telok Bl;anagh rd vefore Chiantown.</p>
              <p>200 - yes indeed. the service ended all the way up at Bt Pnajang Village. Poor service was cut short many times. At one time it even served to Holland rd and queesnway junction.</p>
              <p>200 descended from the Chinese Bus Company Easy Bus which operated a set of bus routes in the South Bouna Vista rd, portsodwn rd  and Clementi rd area.</p>
              <p>209 orignsated from the Jurong Ind services. grouped with the odler 202 203 204 etc, this service served to town via the Holland rd sector.</p>
              <p>Much later poor 209 was cut short as during the late 1970s and 180s, SBS made many mnay route rationlaisation to develop a btter bus netowrk. sv 209 was cut short to terminate at Ulu pandan HDB car park terminal. it was finally made to terminate at Clementi int when the int open.</p>
              <p>i have fond memeories of watching the OF1417s on 209 going by alg Clementi Ave 5 while visiting my auties provision shop next to some orange docotr clinic at blk 34?</p>
              <p>209 was later withdrawn. MRT? i guess so.</p>

              <p><br>in 1977 or so, SBs wanted a bus terminla at marine Parade area, current at presently in 1977 there was a bus terminal along Marine terrace serving for then svcs 15 and 16. (much later 15 wd be integrated with a 2nd gen sv 196 to form the 196 i know and love).</p>
              <p>also in 1977 Neptune court and the many other condos in the area were being built. This being so after the reclaimed land has pretty much settled. the residents moved in. It was amde clear that the bus terminal would be re sited to nearby the condos to better serve these residents, but wow. did they complain...they did not want the loud buses near their homes. And they argued that we already have sv 41 and some other svc going by what...we dun need the 15 and 16...</p>
              <p>Much later eventually marine parade ter was built. the terminal was a smple roof covered area for waiting for buses under the rain. the layout was a end on saw tooth pattern if i not wrong.</p>

              <p><br>87 route was never changed. this guy is a new millennium type service.</p>
              <p>196 - 196 haqs a rich and colourful hisotry</p>
              <p><strong>196 - my darling service</strong></p>
              <p>intro-</p>
              <p>196 was a most frequented service for me in my childhood years,.</p>
              <p>1985 - 1988. taking the service to east coast park with family. always insisting on a non air-con double decker. esp if Lo2x. hahah. of coruse my parents wun let me stick my ehad out of the windows lest we have man overbaord...</p>
              <p>1988-1996 - gg to sch . or gg to grandma home. alogn c'wqeatha ve and later shift to dover rd. when the scanias first came out i'd always "spot" them to ride on.</p>
              <p>1996-7 - must ride Vo3x superbus.</p>
              <p>1998-1999 JC days. msut ride 196 to sch. haha. i developed affnity to then 9621A and much later the 9664. 9591C was also my fav bus then. 9621A was my perm bus to JC in yr 2 every morning without fail.</p>
              <p>i went into the army. 196 rides were few. except to visit realtives.  go out with frens must take 196 to suntec. take 196 to parkway.</p>
              <p>2002--2006 - NUS days - rides on 196 to dover then walk voer to NUS were common. thus my freq of riding 196 increased again. by then i had a close affinity with 196 and declared it my darling svc.</p>
              <p>after 2006 - 196 is my officila parkway9ren living there)  and suntec shopping bus. also the regular visits to dover</p>
              <p>2008- now - must ride B9TL..hahah</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><strong>196 - some info</strong></p>
              <p>196 did not really descend from any Chinese Bus co nor STC services. It was an integration or new route of the services then in 1969.</p>
              <p>introduced in 1969, 196 served Gegek S???? D????......whatever the place is. simply it refers to lower Delta rd (Jln Bt merah was NOT BUILT then) and where Jln Bt merah wd have crossed. The terminal also hosued svcs 92 and 65 then.</p>
              <p>anyways 196 served "Jln Bt merah / lower Delta" to Jurong. As was in 1969, Jurong ind was opening. No Jurong Int then so the svc terminated at Shipyard rd</p>
              <p>later Jurong Int opened sometime ard 1980 and svc 15 was integrated into 196. this was the hey days of 196, using Merc O305 from JRDEP and later even some nice new LO2x.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<strong>196 Jurong - marine Parade.</strong></p>
              <p>then in 1990 or so , jurong Int is to be knocked down. 196 was not shifted to Boon lay, instead it got cut to terminate at bouna Vista. this was a frsutration for many residents in the west as they depended on the service to go Dover Rd. the true blue 1969 196 ran by Dover rd. it is an unforgivable cut of route. heck i wd depnd on the svc to go sch and dover rd visit realtives. very not happy. Parents omplained. i recalled one yr we go CNy visit and found that 196 no longer served dover rd we had to trasnfer bus... grumble grumble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>later after all those complanings and got extended to Clementi and serve back dover rd area.</p>
              <p><strong>196 in 1989</strong>. began a new era of hey days for 196. it ebcame partial air-con in 1989. using the latest Scania N113CRB. which i throughly enjoyed riding to sch or to town. the novelty of 196 then was being able to ride on a Lo2x thru the wide expanse of the Nicholl HW. then a 3 way crrraige road. the middle crraige was for peak hour directionlaity.  the Lo2x or atleantan ride thru nicoll HW then was very fun as bus just chiong.</p>
              <p>it was a sad day when marine Parade ter was closed. <strong>196 became bedok - Clementi</strong>, losing its character of terminating at Marine Parade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>today 196 uses the latest Volvo  B9TL and is a WAB service and is still in tis prime and hey days period. .</p>
