                  WA Mercs, LAs and LO2x were used for 187. BBDEP also used to control 187 in the past. The LAs on 187 came from mostly BBDEP and LO2x/WA Mercs from JRBP.

              <p><br>Nope, that was because in 1998 SBS wanted to deploy full fleet AC on the more popular bus routes. Services like 2, 7, 12, 27, 30, 143, 166 etc were converted to FAC. As such services like 77 as well as 6, 79, 90, 138, 151, 156, 175 etc were converted to PAC. Feeder services only started getting PAC one year later when the NAC Volvo MK2s, Scania N113CRBs and Mercs were converted to CAC.</p>
              <p>And I remembered service 77 converted back to FAC in Jan 2000 just before it was handed over to Tibs in Jun that year <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

I took it for a joy ride during my school holiday in the later 80s and early 90s. This bus has the same feeling as today Scania buses which the engine sound like the n113crb, not really as comfort as the 0305s DD. But it better than all leyland DDs that time. Volvo DDs that time was on service 7 and 65. I like the volvo DD that operate on service 7 it very smooth. I also had taken volvo DD that had a front engine on service 65, the driver complained very noisy and hot and the shake like leyland DD bus, I discovered it had the same gear changes as leyland. Still that time it was the merc 0305 the best DD bus I had taken. It use to operate on Toa Payoh service 143. I think the service 143 had 4 or 5 merc 0305 the rest is leyland DDs that time when the bus is new. And it the only merc DDs operated from Toa Payoh bus terminal in the early 80s, before later years service 26 came to join in at the new toa payoh interchange. I taken it to my school.</p></div>

              <p>Volvo b55 Alisa ver rare indeed. I remenber it look and sound
              like a volvo b57 with a extra sitting 2nd level. I wonder which bus
              deport it attached to ? Most of the Merc 0350s DD seems comming
              from the west side deport and most volvo buses seems comming from
              the east side deport. Toa Payoh had all the leyland buses from SD
              to DDs. </p>

              <p><br>Nope, that was because in 1998 SBS wanted to deploy full fleet AC on the more popular bus routes. Services like 2, 7, 12, 27, 30, 143, 166 etc were converted to FAC. As such services like 77 as well as 6, 79, 90, 138, 151, 156, 175 etc were converted to PAC. Feeder services only started getting PAC one year later when the NAC Volvo MK2s, Scania N113CRBs and Mercs were converted to CAC.</p>
              <p>And I remembered service 77 converted back to FAC in Jan 2000 just before it was handed over to Tibs in Jun that year <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Scania BR112DH double decker demo use to operate in service 10 or 30 from old jurong interchange to Bedok interchange. I took it for a joy ride during my school holiday in the later 80s and early 90s. This bus has the same feeling as today Scania buses which the engine sound like the n113crb, not really as comfort as the 0305s DD. But it better than all leyland DDs that time. Volvo DDs that time was on service 7 and 65. I like the volvo DD that operate on service 7 it very smooth. I also had taken volvo DD that had a front engine on service 65, the driver complained very noisy and hot and the shake like leyland DD bus, I discovered it had the same gear changes as leyland. Still that time it was the merc 0305 the best DD bus I had taken. It use to operate on Toa Payoh service 143. I think the service 143 had 4 or 5 merc 0305 the rest is leyland DDs that time when the bus is new. And it the only merc DDs operated from Toa Payoh bus terminal in the early 80s, before later years service 26 came to join in at the new toa payoh interchange. I taken it to my school.</p>
