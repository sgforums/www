              <p><br>THE HISTORY OF CITYSHOPPER SERVICES</p>
              <p>Cityshopper Services were only introduced by SBS Transit once - on 15 December 2007. They were introduced to cater commuters to the city in shopping comfort. Unlike normal bus services, these services have been introduced to cater specifically to a group of commuters who are willing to pay a bit more for a more comfortable and convenient ride. They are also designed to make maximum use of expressways to offer commuters a more direct and faster journey.</p>
              <p>The routes of the 8 services is here as shown below:</p>

              <p>The fare for adults is $3.30 for commuters on 551, 575, 576, 577, 579 &amp; 580 and $3.60 for commuters on 578 &amp; 581. Child's fare is $1 on all service. <strong>(However, in Mighty Minds Bus Guide 2008 &amp; 2009, there is an error stating that the services' fare are paid by fare stages.)</strong></p>
              <p>Due to Cityshopper 575 &amp; 576 plying the same stops before &amp; after plying the city, there will be a terminating sign to show that it is terminating.</p>
              <p>Initially at first, the demand was quite good, but due to the expensive fare, the demand decreased and on 21 July 2008, Cityshopper 551, 575, 577 &amp; 580 were withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Onn 28 October 2008, Cityshopper 576 was suspended, but was never re-introduced and was subsequently counted as withdrawn. The other 3 services' timing was also adjusted. Finally, on 27 July 2009, the 3 services were withdrawn and this removed the Cityshopper Services concept.</p>

              <p><strong>SEMBAWANG BUS SERVICES</strong><br><br>Previously, at that time Sembawang was in a prelimary stage in development. The only TIBS service that serve that area was 160, that plies along Canberra Rd. Some ex-RAF private roads, such as Old Nelson Rd, Kowloon Rd, were still in existence.<br><br>When Sembawang New Town began to sprung up at the middle stage of development in 1998/99, a new bus service 859, connects to the new Sembawang New Town, but however, there were no plans for a new terminal to be constructed at that time, and was made to loop st Sembawang from Yishun.<br><br>Later on, a new peak hour one-directional service, 981, was introduced from Sembawang Way to Senoko Loop (for the AM Peak); whereas for the PM Peak, it served vice-versa.<br><br>It was planned that a new bus interchange should be erected near their doorstep. The Sembawang Bus Interchange began constructed in early 2004 and began its opeartions on 20th November 2005. Refer to the post on "Sembawang Bus Interchange" below.</p>

              <p><br> THE HISTORY OF CITYSHOPPER SERVICES</p>
              <p>Cityshopper Services were only introduced by SBS Transit once -
              on 15 December 2007. They were introduced to cater commuters to the
              city in shopping comfort. Unlike normal bus services, these
              services have been introduced to cater specifically to a group of
              commuters who are willing to pay a bit more for a more comfortable
              and convenient ride. They are also designed to make maximum use of
              expressways to offer commuters a more direct and faster
              journey.</p>

              Child's fare is $1 on all service. <strong>(However, in Mighty
              Minds Bus Guide 2008 &amp; 2009, there is an error stating that the
              services' fare are paid by fare stages.)</strong></p>
              <p>Due to Cityshopper 575 &amp; 576 plying the same stops before
              &amp; after plying the city, there will be a terminating sign to
              show that it is terminating.</p>
              <p>Initially at first, the demand was quite good, but due to the
              expensive fare, the demand decreased and on 21 July 2008,
              Cityshopper 551, 575, 577 &amp; 580 were withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Onn 28 October 2008, Cityshopper 576 was suspended, but was
              never re-introduced and was subsequently counted as withdrawn. The
              other 3 services' timing was also adjusted. Finally, on 27
              July 2009, the 3 services were withdrawn and this removed the
              Cityshopper Services concept.</p>
