            <div class='col-md body'>This issue of crime rates i'll consider as 'subjective' in nature, not to be measured in absolute terms, which many people would over simplistically prefer to see it from !! My way of looking @ it is that as Malaysia is so many times larger with so many times more people than Singapore then of course if you hear of more murders, robberies, kidnaps etc., that to me does NOT make it any less 'safe' there &amp; neither does that offer me any 'consolation' that Singapore appears any 'safer', which in reality i personally do NOT think so anyway ! Put it @ 30 murders per year in Singapore even there's 100 per year in Malaysia that to me need NOT suggest it's worse there or better here, unless both Malaysia &amp; Singapore are exactly the same size &amp; population.<br><br>Newspapers there &amp; here like to write on almost every minute incident, blow it up in all wild imaginable ways to boost their circulation, to scare the timid etc. &amp; many here would almost then 'console' themselves &amp; think they are 'safer' here. For me, i'm in Malaysia almost as often as i'm in Singapore &amp; have been having residential properties in both Johor Baru &amp; Singapore for many years &amp; to me, i find this 'crime rate' thing in reality not very different whether there or in Singapore !! I find that many people from Singapore if they don't know Malaysia better or have not been there long enough tend to harbour quite a lot of negative perceptions (some real but much not real or unproven) about almost anything from there. They like to think that because it's Malaysia there must be something up to 'no good' or inferior etc. Some things are true but some things from there can be as good if not better than in Singapore !<br><br>There's still plenty of lousy junk buses in Malaysia but the newest ones there like those i've mentioned in JB, can be so new in design &amp; model that no operator in Singapore has yet upgraded to !!<br><br>The crime rates whether in JB or KL or Singapore would to me always never be satisfactory, simply because everybody wants perfection in such issues, which is understandable by human nature ! From personal experiences i find the overall situation managable enough to get by, which is good enough for me !<br><br>Malaysia is so many times larger than Singapore that it'll almost always appear to have not developed 'much', looking from Singapore ! But i'll not under estimate their potential so although 'progress' may appear slow seeing from this side, i can expect to see e.g. their new CIQ complex ready, integrated with their new light rail system (similar model like the present KL Sentral station) which runs from Taman University across to Masai possibly little further east later. I'll also be harder to find freehold houses with land in localities near to JB city centre &amp; the other 2 links to Singapore. The bungalows in Seri Alam i'll see these in the next 1 to 2 decades to become the<br>'district 10' of housing estates in JB !<br><br>In short, i'll NOT under estimate their potential for development &amp; improvements. It's already happening, but perhaps starting up @ too slow a pace for anyone to take notice.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PJ_Quek:</div><div class="quote_body">Currently the crime rates of Tmn Rinting, Bandar Seri Alam, Tmn Megah Ria are not that satisfactory.<br><br>Even if Sg's land used up, MY side still haven't much developed, places like Tg.
