My family &amp; other residents in the isolated neighbourhood of Segar Road are excited and grateful for its new benefits.<br><br>However, we tried to take the bus but were disappointed. A waiting time of 30 minutes is too long. It is discouraging when you see a number of LRT trains pass by and you are still waiting for the miserable bus to arrive.<br><br>Another sad experience: My mother lives in Petir Road. For me to reach there, I have to take service 922 to Bukit panjang bus itnerchange, then another bus service. it takes me almost 45 minutes. If I take the LRT, it takes 20 minutes at most.<br><br>How about adding a bus route to Bangkit Road via Pending Road, Petir Road and bukit Panjang bus interchange? After all, Bukit Panjang is just a small estate-why is it so diffcult to get around?<br><br>If these problems continue, residents will soon avoid taking service 922. Will this be an excuse for SMRT to terminate this long awaited bus service, so we are forced to use the LRT instead?<br><br>So, was wondering what comments do you have for the above forum?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">{The above can be found in the ST forums page dated 22nd May 200}[i]</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SMRT new management is screwed up! I personally feel that when wants to do something, you should give the best, and not those "half plus six" standard! Feeder service of freq 30 mins??? what message it wants to show the Bt Panjang's residents? Not happy, then take LRT la!<br>Same to the bloody services 960 and 190! Being it peak hours and non peak, it is always damned crowded!<br>Tonight I experienced that the last bus service 960 departs from Marina Square  is damned crowded and afraid that some may not even get the chances to board! (TIB1088!) Last bus timing is 2330hrs.<br>Rather unfair for the Bt Panjang's residents!!!!!<br>If this is run by SBST, the lastest departure I can say is at least 0045hrs, based my observation for most SBST buses last departure timings!<br>So whose fault is it to give the sole operating rights to SMRT????<br>LTA ? PTC? or Govt?<br><br></div>
