              <p>In my opinion, I feel that bus service 258 has a very unique
                      loading pattern. It is only during two periods of the day that it
                      has very high loading and needs double decker buses - trips
                      starting from Boon Lay between 5:30am and 6:30am, and trips
                      starting from Joo Koon between 6pm and 7:30pm. You should record
                      the loading during those periods, to see it for yourself.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>258 loading is mainly during peak hours, during the off-peak, it compliments 243W from Street 81 - Boon Lay where commuters would board the first bus that arrives, in addition, it receives demand towards Pioneer MRT during AM peak hours.</p>
              <p>I've suggested a SWT 258A some time back to ply Street 63 (Blk 649A) - Street 63 (Blk 651A) via Boon Lay Interchange during peak hours, utilizing 2 citaros (or 2 SD), though after observing the Jurong Camp loading from 6pm to 7pm, I think 258 can operate SWT 258A in the mornings as a supplementary service</p>
              <p>I feel that what 258 needs is a frequency boost to 7 buses while downgrading 3 DD to 3 SD and upgrading 243G/W to only DDs and NWAB SDs, reducing fleet size</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I feel that 258 operates similar to how 66 and 228 operates, spreading the demand between the two services (258 and 243G/W depending on direction), however, with 243's frequency, there is a high chance where 258 can be empty from Street 81 to Boon Lay and vice-versa.</p>

              <p><strong>Okay. Enough about 258, please.</strong></p>
                                                                      <p>All that 258 needs is just a capacity downgrade from DD to SD, and an adjustment of frequency to match the other Jurong Industrial Bus Services (excluding 256). That's all.</p>
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p>I would like to propose the following set of frequency for bus service 258:</p>
                                                  <p><strong>0630hrs - 0830hrs: 7 - 8 minutes</strong> (9 buses)</p>
                                                  <p>0831hrs - 1659hrs: 12 - 14 minutes (5 buses)</p>
                                                  <p><strong>1700hrs - 1900hrs: 7- 8 minutes</strong> (9 buses)</p>
                                                  <p>After 1900hrs: 12 - 14 minutes (5 buses)</p>
                              
                                                  <p> </p>
                                                  <p>Reason:</p>
                                                  
                                                              
                                                          <p>Currently, with a full double decker fleet at eleven minutes frequency, the capacity of 258 is 725.45 pax/hr (133 Ã— 60/11). If we change to use full single decker fleet, I would propose having seven minutes frequency during peak period, so that the capacity of 258 during peak period would be 711.42 pax/hr (83 Ã— 60/7).</p>
                                  <p>Although the capacity during peak period would be lower, frankly speaking, even the double decker buses now are not fully occupied. After so long, the authorities probably have the data on what is the average loading like during peak periods. If it is less than 711.42 pax in one hour during peak period, I think it is feasible to use all-SDs and have frequency at 7 - 8 minutes.</p>
                                                          <p>During non-peak periods, 258 can continue to run at its current frequency of thirteen minutes, except now it uses only single decker buses. Capacity would be reduced from 613.85 pax/hr (133 x 60/13) to 383.08 pax/hr (83 x 60/13). Based on my observations, as well as the comments here, I think even at reduced capacity, this should be more than enough for non-peak period loading.</p>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p>For the above frequencies, I propose 9 single decker buses during peak period and 5 single decker buses during non-peak periods. But, what are we going to do with the 4 single deckers not in use during non-peak periods?</p>
                          <p>Alternatively, we can have 5 single decker (83 x 5 = 415 pax) permanently deployed on 258. During peak periods, we can have 2 double decker (133 x 2 = 266) cross-over to 258 - but from where, I do not know, maybe from 182. If so, peak period frequency can only be at 8 - 9 minutes, at least still better than the current 10 - 12 minutes. Total capacity would be 681 pax/hr during peak period. If average actual loading per hour during peak period on 258 is less than 681, I think it can be done.</p>
                                 <p>meanwhile, SLBP needs government-funded buses for bus services transferring to Bulim Depot. So, might as well...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, only the authorities know the actual figures of loading on bus service 258, through the data collected from the EZ-Link card readers. I hope that they can refer to the average of the actual figures and set the frequencies accordingly while making changes from double decker to single decker.</p>
              <p> </p>
                                                                      <p><strong>Let's move on to discuss other bus services.</strong></p>

              <p>1st April. At paya Lebar station bus stop</p>
              <p>1856. Bus stop very crowded. Sv76 DD came n lot of ppl wan to board but most of them when the BC told them bus not going Marine parade.  Lot of ppl are not aware of the amendment at all. There is one SBST staff at bus stop. But she does not really put in effort to tell the crowds. She just hold some sv76 service guides n just say to take sv134. Some paxes ask for service guide/route of 134. She direct them to the bus stop pole.  </p>
              <p>1900.  134 citaro (1097) arrived at bus stop. Depart 1902 with at least 15 paxes left behind.  Sv76 DD arrive at 1902   BC have to tell pax that bus not going marine parade  that sbst staff just stand n see  </p>
              <p>1905 135 kub (8706) arrive. Depart 1907 with 20 paxes stranded. </p>
              <p>1909 Another sv76 DD arrive. BC have to keep telling paxes same thing. </p>
              <p>1910 Sv43 DD arrive. Paxes were rushing to board. 1911 sv134 dd (5549) arrive.  Sv43 paxes were full till entrance door. While sv134 DD pick up around 40 paxes n overtake sv43 at the bus stop. This sv43 DD arrive 28 mins after the previous bus. (The next bus is 12 mins behind 6512(Citaro)</p>
              <p>1918 sv134 DD arrive (5550). Took around 40-45 paxes. </p>
              <p>1920. Another sv76 DD arrive. Paxes wan to board as well. </p>
              <p>1924 sv43 SD arrive with some standees (6512).  Around 15 paxes can't board. </p>
              <p>1927 sv135 SD arrive with standees  n depart with full paxes (previous bus was 22 min in front)  </p>
              <p>1930 sv134 DD arrive. Around 30-40 paxes. Board. </p>
              <p>Sv43 is really having frequency issue. 28 mins apart ? The previous bus arrive at 1843. Next bus at 1911 n follow by 1924 n 1933.  In one hour around 4 buses.  But sv76 have 4 DD arrive in space of 25 mins. Frequency from iris is pretty regular at around 10 mins. Sv135 bus also having issue. </p>
              <p>Think LTA need to put in more effort in letting paxes know about amendment of sv76 n new service 134.   In my opinion, the sv76 amendment should have come 3 months after sv134 introduction. N poster should be out as same time as sv134 poster.  At least let them run parallel for 3 months before u amend sv76.  Right now amendment is announce around 2 weeks before n many ppl are not aware because they dun go n read the tiny posters at the bus stop</p>

              <p>Yea,Go Tg Katong,Marine Parade Rd,Still Rd back to Eunos or best way is to terminate at Upp East Coast.13 can shortened at Eunos while 150 cover its routes.134 can retain as it will supplement 43 and 76 from Paya Lebar to Marine Parade,Yes ah clever ah you and maybe those petioners can forward this to LTA?</p>

              <p>187 looks like a good candidate for A22 to bendy conversion as
                  187 has way too many buses as of now. 61 can get some A22 to bendy
                  conversion for S-shift slots. I'm not sure if giving 700/A 2
                  bendies (to redeploy the 2 DDs on 700/A) is a good idea as 700 ply

              <p>61 is going to GCM, 187 and 700 has express sections. All of them are DD-type routes.</p>
              <p>If there are extra A24s to go around, they can be deployed on 858. 180 could use a few A22s, especially for slots where bunching is likely to occur.</p>
              <p>You know they have a problem with non-WAB bendy buses when they start deploying them on E-suffix routes, 171, etc.</p>

              <p>Oops, 61 isn't part of GCM... yet. </p>
              <p>And I have had fears SMRT having this problem of having 'excess' non-WAB bendy buses. They don't have to condemn them to 171 or E services, they don't have to look far beyond the intra town services of woodlands. Way too many fleet additions consisting a22s have contributed to further bunching. maybe it's time for SMRT to rationalize these a22s by swapping 3 of them for 2 non wab bendies or so.</p>
              <p>was it really a good idea to make 911, 912 and 913 WAB given SMRT's limited wab bendy resources? pumping in more a22s is doomed to reduce service reliability.</p>

              <p>My bad, though I still view 61 as another DD route given its length.</p>
              <p>This is where the deployment of A24s on 960 made little sense, unless it is temporary.</p>
              <p>Assuming Seletar GCM comes in and takes no bendy buses at all, SMRT may be forced to let go up to 150 non-WAB bendy buses by end-2017 without extension.</p>

              <p>1st April. At paya Lebar station bus stop</p>
              <p>1856. Bus stop very crowded. Sv76 DD came n lot of ppl wan to
                  board but most of them when the BC told them bus not going Marine
                  parade.  Lot of ppl are not aware of the amendment at all.
                  There is one SBST staff at bus stop. But she does not really put in
                  effort to tell the crowds. She just hold some sv76 service guides n
                  just say to take sv134. Some paxes ask for service guide/route of
                  134. She direct them to the bus stop pole.  </p>
              <p>1900.  134 citaro (1097) arrived at bus stop. Depart 1902
                  with at least 15 paxes left behind.  Sv76 DD arrive at 1902
                    BC have to tell pax that bus not going marine parade
                   that sbst staff just stand n see  </p>
              <p>1905 135 kub (8706) arrive. Depart 1907 with 20 paxes
                  stranded. </p>
              <p>1909 Another sv76 DD arrive. BC have to keep telling paxes same
                  thing. </p>
              <p>1910 Sv43 DD arrive. Paxes were rushing to board. 1911 sv134 dd
                  (5549) arrive.  Sv43 paxes were full till entrance door. While
                  sv134 DD pick up around 40 paxes n overtake sv43 at the bus stop.
                  This sv43 DD arrive 28 mins after the previous bus. (The next bus
                  is 12 mins behind 6512(Citaro)</p>
              <p>1918 sv134 DD arrive (5550). Took around 40-45 paxes. </p>
              <p>1920. Another sv76 DD arrive. Paxes wan to board as
                  well. </p>
              <p>1924 sv43 SD arrive with some standees (6512).  Around 15
                  paxes can't board. </p>
              <p>1927 sv135 SD arrive with standees  n depart with full
                  paxes (previous bus was 22 min in front)  </p>
              <p>1930 sv134 DD arrive. Around 30-40 paxes. Board. </p>
              <p>Sv43 is really having frequency issue. 28 mins apart ? The
                  previous bus arrive at 1843. Next bus at 1911 n follow by 1924 n
                  1933.  In one hour around 4 buses.  But sv76 have 4 DD
                  arrive in space of 25 mins. Frequency from iris is pretty regular
                  at around 10 mins. Sv135 bus also having issue. </p>
              <p>Think LTA need to put in more effort in letting paxes know about
                  amendment of sv76 n new service 134.   In my opinion, the sv76
                  amendment should have come 3 months after sv134 introduction. N
                  poster should be out as same time as sv134 poster.  At least
                  let them run parallel for 3 months before u amend sv76.  Right
                  now amendment is announce around 2 weeks before n many ppl are not
                  aware because they dun go n read the tiny posters at the bus
                  stop</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So people say 76 has erratic frequency... And expect those pax from Tai Seng / Serangoon / YCK Road to take 43 which has much worse frequency than 76?</p>
              <p>And now 43 has less space when reaching Paya Lebar MRT and end up harder to board for MP residents...</p>
