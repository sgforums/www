              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, the trend now is new bus services. Not really
                      into rationalization. I believe rationalization is only last
                      resort. When I see people even talking about rationalization for
                      popular services here, I am shocked. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Isn't it in both LTA and the bus companies' interest to utilize their resources optimally to reduce operation cost wastage? Putting less resources / modifying / withdrawing an unpopular route such that the saved resources can be better utilized elsewhere (such as new routes or those in need of fleet adds)? That's the entire purpose of service rationalization, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Granted, the main obstacle to that would be PR and complaints from commuters, but economically it makes perfect sense to do so.</p>
              <p>(When done properly, all alternatives should be taken care of that would reduce inconveniences to existing travel patterns to the minimum. )</p>

              <p>* Another example of how almost all services right from Stevens to BPJ carry only about 20-25 pax in peak direction of PM peak. At other times, these services could have &lt;10 pax on board. </p>

              <p>True. Before SMRT got DDs, 61 was operating with one bendy only. </p>
              <p>For 700, it got major capacity reduction with DDs/bendies removed + buses cut, but again buses got added incl. DDs. From my observation, I think it is to meet the Scotts - Stevens demand which was quite high + there is still a good (40-45 pax) to BPJ. </p>

LTA just releases news that another 8 more new services to go in various towns by end 2017. 4 already implemented from sep 2016 to feb 2017 and another 2 new ones (374, 381) in march 2017. Another 8 more coming. Don't think much rationalisation will happen. I think maybe just cut back or minor amendment of 1-2 services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Isn't cutting back services a part of rationalization? For example, if 171 is cut to Yishun - Bukit Panjang, it is considered rationalization.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes cutting back bus service routes is part of rationalization. But if cutting back 1 service and introducing another new service to replace a part of the 'cut-back' route is not really rationalisation. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, yes I am the one. If it is really about economics, they will not introduce so many new services and pour in so many BSEP buses on existing services and only aim at less loading on each service and also to relieve overcrowding. Now 60% of bus services experience less overcrowding. They could have simply just give exact buses and let people stand up to the doors on most service during peak hours. Nowadays even during peak hours, most bus services can get to sit down already. I dare say better than MRT. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

                              <p>You know, the LTA should introduce surge pricing on bus
              services, where bus fares are cheaper after peak hours. Just like
              the price for utilities. This would encourage people to change
              their travel pattern, and reduce bus loading.</p>

              You know LTA is encouraging carlight society.
