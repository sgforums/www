              <p><strong>Sunday night observations at Bukit Timah Rd (Little
              India MRT) towards Woodlands Road, between 2110 hrs and 2215
              hrs</strong></p>
              <p>There seems to be some disagreements in this forum regarding the
              utility of 170, so I went to observe its loading from Little India
              (together with all other services there). I thought the peak would
              be at night from 10pm onwards, but it seems that I'm wrong - it's
              probably much earlier at 6-8pm instead.</p>
              <p>Some of these figures below are just estimations and may be
              extremely inaccurate, as there are usually multiple buses arriving
              at this bus stop together, and it's also hard for me to count the
              no. of pax on the upper decks of DDs. (My method of estimation on
              DDs: Check no. of people on the left side of upper deck, assume
              same no. of ppl on both sides, then plus those on lower deck)</p>
              <p>Note: The previous bus stop (Rochor MRT) has slightly less pax
              boarding, but still significant.</p>

              <p>I stopped recording here because: 1) Loading seems to be dying
              (maybe it will pick up again at 11pm or so, but I really don't
              know); 2) I was tired and wanted some rest.</p>
              <p><strong>My conclusions:</strong><br> - Even with erratic frequency, 170/A still has SD loading only.
              Loading might be better from 6-8pm but I'm not sure.<br> - 67 has been hit heavily by DTL2 - what I observed was actually SD
              loading. Guess DDs are there for the Tampines-Little India sector
              with better loading.<br> - 960 has also been impacted. Previously bendies and DDs would be
              packed to the door. (Maybe it's due to the wrong timing)<br> - 980 seems to be doing quite well. In fact it has the best loading
              among the SD services.</p>
              <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br> - It does make sense for 170 to be cut to Bukit Panjang Int,
              provided if there's still space.<br> - However, if that is done, there needs to be fleet addition for
              960 on weekends. Based on my knowledge, most Indian workers take
              170 to their dorms between BPJ and Kranji, so they will turn to
              960. From above, 960 currently has 60-70 pax between 9-10 pm, and
              with pax from 170, it can easily hit 90-100 pax.<br> - The remaining pax travelling to Bt Timah Rd / Upp Bt Timah Rd can
              take 67, which will improve its utility between CCK and Little
              India.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents worth.</p>

              <p>Your observations are similar to mine. I thought weekend loading would be better as some claimed, but doesn't seem so. Please note 6-8pm is definitely not the peak loading as workers will eat dinner and leave between 8-10 pm from Little India area.</p>
              <p>It is simple, most of them now take DTL2 to BPJ. Those who want to take bus opt for 960. Hence, you still see high loading on 960. 66/67 loading is poor. Your estimates are higher, because if you ever notice more people sit on the left of upper deck than on the right side. So you can still reduce some numbers. 170/A as I have always said will have some 20-30 pax throughout its route until it hits BPJ. + once 171, 961 kick in along the way, loading gets even further split. </p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, MRT may have stolen 170 loading which has sort of dropped a bit significantly as compared to the days where there is no MRT. However, this does not mean the route will be shortened. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Two ideas I can think of to rationalize 961 -- either:</p>
              <p>(1) Cut/split the sector north of Bt Timah (say, around Beauty World); this can be in the form of merging with 41, 67 (split) or some other method. Downside is the increased load on 170/178/960 at Mandai;</p>
              <p>(2) Make a stretch along either UBT Rd or Woodlands Rd or both express and allow transfer to 170/178 around UBT. Both would improve frequency reliability and reduce duplication to some extent.</p>
              <p>Btw any further discussions of this should be at the DTL2 rationalization thread, so best be back to topic.</p>

              <p>Not sure why 961 should be rationalized. Route quite unique and will inconvenience more pax when there are other services running in parallel to other services and DTL2 that should be first considered for rationalization. </p>

              <p>** Unlike other Bukit Timah services that hover around 20-30

              <p>** The above loading could be a one off, but the frequency seems
              consistent at 10-12 mins/bus. So unlike 190/972 is not coming at

              <p>** There isn't high loading (just 10 pax) in total between Petir

              <p>Loading increased throughout last year? Seems it wasn't so high in demand around the same time last year.</p>
              <p>I wonder if the introduction of 973 suggest that they're considering making 700 a peak hour service and merging it with 971E...</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, the trend now is new bus services. Not really into rationalization. I believe rationalization is only last resort. When I see people even talking about rationalization for popular services here, I am shocked. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
