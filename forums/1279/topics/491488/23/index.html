              <p>I would categorise this service 46, as well as 116, as 'cannibal

              <p>Yes. Weekday peak hour observations have peak loading of 15-17 pax from Tampines - UEC. Most buses leave Tampines Interchange with 0 pax on board. </p>
              <p>Such a waste to deploy DDs. Can do with full fleet SD. </p>

              <p>AM peak, the OC doing the 725AM (around that time) timing (on 18/8 was SMB87K) always have problem as it is always crowded for that trip.</p>
              <p>BC activate two door boarding throughout the whole journey. Bus was packed by the time it left Lot One bus stop, and only a few passengers managed to board the bus from the rear door at the first CCK Ave 1 bus stop. It skipped the 2nd bus stop and as there are people alighting at the 3rd bus stop, a few pax managed to board from the rear door again at that stop... Bus again skipped the stop at Sunshine place onwards until HTA...</p>
              <p>Bus have no loading problems after HTA though it was roughly 3/4 full throughout the whole journey.</p>
              <p>IIRC both front and back bus are bendies and frequency is 8 mins at that time..</p>
              <p>Interesting thing to note is that along the route that duplicates with 308, there are no alighting activities, which was common for 172 when there was no 308 last time.. so i guess those going to those few stops took the 308 behind (trailing behind SMB87K).. so indeed 308 has helped to relieve the crowd for 172 at least for AM peak...</p>

              honestly i think TT is deploying too many buses on some rts n the opp for other rts.
              
              49 - is thr even a demand? so many dds deployed. mayb if got a small bit of demand can put 1 dd liddat. other than that i thik this svc is not v useful.
              
              189 - needs 3-5 dds, sd pack to door drg peak hrs n sch dismissal hrs. even an off peak demand csn fill tje bus to 3/4
              
              333 - doing fine, better freq?
              
              334 - can cut 1-2DDs, too many liao

              Anyone can do a loading of 854 DDs or bendy during peak n off peak?
                      
                  Coz some people are disagreeing with me that 854 need full fleet DDs whereas i believe 851,855 and some others AMDEP svc deserved its fair of share also. 
                  
                  I know 854 loads from YCK to Yishun and vice versa. After that idk liao coz it literally parallels 70 and 25 and a number of other routes along the way
                      
                  I still disagree that 854 needs full fleet DDs like 972. Tht is my stand. 
              
              Busanal, Cbb what do ya think?
