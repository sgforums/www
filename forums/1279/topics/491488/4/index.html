              <p>3 mins frequency is indeed over supply. If I am not wrong,
              feeder 241 also running at 3 mins frequency. Even the standard set
              by LTA for the GCM model is 6-8 mins frequency for feeder bus
              services.</p>
              <p>if 243 and 241 runs at a uniform frequency of 6 mins, they may
              need a full fleet of double decker buses. and I think that's enough
              to meet the demand.</p>

              <p>241 is okay as it is, with its current frequency and running on full DD fleet, the buses are well utilised, though I once suggested a SWT 241B from Pioneer MRT - Blk 953 during PM peak but I think it is best to stay as it is now.</p>

              <p>Hey my friend, if you are a full-time student and you purposely
              take time off to observe bus loadings, I feel that it is better
              that you focus on your studies. Let us do the bus observations for
              you. :)</p>
              <p>There are adults in this forum who live in Jurong West (for
              example, lemon1974, ashrafjj, gekpohboy, chickenlittle/CHT). The
              people behind Facebook pages "Buses in Singapore" and "Singapore
              buses" are based in Jurong West. There is a lunatic who keeps
              checking on bus services 179 and 179A. Rest assured, the bus
              service standard in Jurong West is in good hands. :)</p>

                      <p>It's good that I have a "successor" who is better than me, and can take over from me.</p>
                      <p>Thanks for joining the forum.</p>
                      <p>Nonetheless, please do not be over-obsessed in writing in forum. That's the mistake I made.</p>
                      <p>if can, then write. Otherwise, never mind.</p>
                      <p>It's entirely volunteerily.</p>
                      <p>and it's not as if the authorities really read this forum, actually. (It's better to just write a one-time email to the LTA and wait around three weeks to three months for their reply, which is usually a kind rejection unless they are able to relate to the issues you raised in the e-mail... and then continue on with life)</p>
                      <p>In fact, what I have been trying to do is to "shift the focus" over to the east side... but once a while, the focus comes back to the West.... </p>
                      <p>anyway, thanks for coming. have fun. :)</p>

                                              <p>erm.... actually, 241 (and 243,  actually) need the three minutes frequency. but that's only during peak hours. I have been taking the buses here for years. 241 double deckers always full during peak hours, but during regular hours sometimes there are only a few cats inside the bus. 243 is gek poh side well-utilised; Pioneer side not really well-utilised... but then, at least 243 at gek poh has 181... and for the intra-town connections, it cannot be split.</p>
                                              <p>243 "wastage" can be reduced by having SWT at Jurong West Street 75 and 82, while the main bus service 243 frequency reduce to around six minutes.</p>
                                              <p>i think this would work.</p>
                                              <p>I have written so much about gek poh already.... but almost all are being ignored by the community here. I am not surprised if this reply is also ignored.... never mind. :(</p>

              <div><br></div>
              <p>- Students are generally more aware of 181M now as compared to last week<br>- Still, less students take 181M than 185 (which is understood due to 185's larger catchment area)<br>- Some workers at nearby industrial arras use 185 to go to work. However didn't see any using 181M (but there are pax boarding 181M here)<br>- Quite a lot of people were waiting at these 2 stops from around 7.40 onwards, though I have no idea where they came from<br>- Suggest 181M to be converted to full day service (and replace 181) once the industrial buildings are all completed</p>

              <p>- The theory that people will take the more direct 192 from Boon Lay / Pioneer to Tuas is not really true (although it was already quite late for AM peak - but 251 at this time still gets 60-80 pax from Boon Lay towards Shipyard Rd)</p>

              <p>- Suspect most people onboard are joyriding (especially those who alighted at Telok Kurau)<br>- Many people either don't know 150's route or still need to take 15/155<br>- According to my observation at Marine Terrace prior to this ride, there are a handful of people deliberately waiting for 150. But still, of the 5 services at Marine Terrace, most people are taking 13.</p>
              <p>- Therefore, guess there will be greater demand on 150 during PM peak from Eunos back to Marine Terrace, if people are too lazy to walk from 13's bus stop along Marine Parade Rd back to Marine Terrace</p>
              <p>- 134 and 150's frequency are still not that great during off-peak, average 15 mins and 150 can be as long as 20 mins. You may argue it's an improvement from the old 76, but this is not what I would hope to see if I'm a resident there.<br>- Took 7 mins from Still Rd to Eunos Int</p>

              <p>76's sector between Eunos and Paya Lebar is quite useless... The only few pax taking 76 that I spotted are either from Eunos to Changi Rd (who would have taken 154) or from Changi Rd to Paya Lebar (who would have taken 24/28/154/155).</p>
              <p>On the other hand 134 is slightly more useful in bringing people from Paya Lebar to Geylang East Ctrl, complimenting 155. Some people also take 134 from Sims Place area too, with similar loading as 64 for this sector.</p>

              <p>I think 243 has way too many SDs, I feel that 243G and W can convert 2 SD to 1 DD each as the frequency is between 03-05 mins on average and SDs may not be able to clear the queue (see previous page mini loading analysis on 243G)</p>
              <p>258 loading has definitely improved as compared to when it was introduced, though I need to observe to see if commuters are changing their travelling habits by taking 258 from Pioneer to St 81 instead of taking from BNL during evening peak.</p>
              <p>During the school term, I took the MRT train daily from Pioneer MRT and by the time it reaches Boon Lay, the train will be quite packed or even fully packed at times once it reaches Boon Lay (this observation is during trains that arrive at Boon Lay ard 7:10-7:30am) which may be a possible reason why commuters prefer to take 258 to Pioneer during AM peak instead of going towards BNL to take the MRT</p>

              <p>Guys, let the loading speak... here is the real loading at Paya Lebar MRT this evening.</p>
              <p>* Rego numbers noted down only for 134</p>
              <p>* Counted only pax boarding at Paya Lebar and not the ones inside the bus</p>
              <p>18.58 - 134 - 58 pax (1097C SD)</p>
              <p>19:06 - 43 - 64 pax (DD - packed to door... so assume there were at least 50 pax on board going towards Tanjong Katong)</p>
              <p>19:07 - 135 - 43 pax (SD)</p>
              <p>19:09 - 134 - 18 pax (DD 5549)... just came after 43/135 so left with only 18 pax</p>
              <p>19:18 - 135 - 50 pax (SD - packed to door)</p>
              <p>19:21 - 134 - 52 pax (DD 3487)</p>
              <p>19:23 - 43 - 26 pax (SD - lot of standees... assume around 30 pax already on bus)</p>
              <p>19:31 - 134 - 55 pax (DD 5546)</p>
              <p>19.33 - 43 - 24 pax (DD - assume 30-40 pax already on bus)</p>
              <p>* Average frequency = 04-05 mins.</p>
              <p>* Total = 9 buses (43 - 03, 134 - 04, 135 - 02) | (5 DDs, 4 SDs)</p>
              <p>* <strong>Average loading on 134 at Paya Lebar = 50-55 pax.</strong> Helps to clear the crowd. </p>
              <p>* Only 2 buses packed to door, but there was always another bus behind.</p>

              <p>That's why I always suggested EXTENDING 76 from Marine Terrace to Eunos via Still Rd, calling at Marine Terrace in both directions. This way 76's frequency from Marine Terrace to Paya Lebar and then to YCK will be improved as it starts from Eunos. Then technically 150 can be withdrawn while 134 can be retained with less capacity to provide connections and act as backup (in case of bad frequency on 43/76/135 towards MP).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately some forumers here think that only two options exist: one to keep 76 looping at Marine Terrace and one to SHORTEN 76 to Eunos via Sims Ave/Changi Rd.</p>

              <p><strong>service 76</strong></p>
              <p>19.04, 19.07, 19.32...</p>
              <p>On time board, next sv 76 - 04 mins, 17 mins.</p>
              <p>* Can you see how horrible sv 76 is in terms of its frequency. I
              came to stop at 18.55... not sure when earlier 76 had gone, but two
              76 DDs came at 03 min interval. Next bus was after 25 mins followed
              with bus in 04 mins. Then again 13 mins gap. </p>
              <p>* Definitely 134 is bringing more consistency at 09-12 mins
              frequency as observed. 134 is still not there on the Paya Lebar
              time board. </p>
              <p>* Imagine if sv 76 is 25 mins late at Paya Lebar by the time it
              loops at Marine Crescent and back, this gap can easily extend to
              30-35 mins. </p>
              <p>* People still run to board 76. But BC tell everyone that it
              does not go Marine Parade, and then people alight again. Good job
              done by BCs. This shows people don't really read announcements.</p>
              <p>* When 134 comes, many run and board. But there are many who
              don't bother to figure out which service it is and wait for next
              bus (43 or 135). </p>

              <p>horrible sv76 frequency? tot a lot of ppl say that more services should become bi-drectional and shortened so that there will be LESS bunching and frenquency will improve... so is it the case in sv76? </p>
              <p>why u never talk about the frequency of sv43? 1906/1923/1933? </p>
              <p>LTA put 7 buses on sv134....that why the frequency is ok..</p>
              <p>imagine if LTA put that 7 buses on sv76, it will also help in its frequecy as well and also benefit other passengers along route of sv76,</p>
              <p>LTA should have add 7 buses to 76 and just make 76A run full day... and let 76A terminate at the last bus stop at marine terrace... then the bus will off service to start new trip from marine cres as Sv76 and go back to YCK...(which is similar to what 195B is doing now)....</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes I agree with 2nd last paragraph. Sbs 134 is good as it connects sims place and geylang east central to other areas. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
