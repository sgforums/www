              <p>But can meh? Like that paya lebar, tanjong katong, marine parade side how? That time already cut 76 now they suggest cut 135 off from similar places again? If like that, many DIRECT connections are lost. Need to transfer. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              i'm more concerned about Upp Aljunied - Paya Lebar pax (155 is winding) and Circuit Rd - MP.
              Paya Lebar got many developments coming up.
              As for Paya Lebar - MP stretch, full fleet DD sv 43 can tahan lah, maybe can intro 43A/downroutes.
              
              If you ask me, I rather sv 155 be cut.

              <p>don't say anyhow. 155 is more useful than 135 and is a unique route. it loops around circuit/pipit for a reason, as it needs to connect macpherson estate with geylang east central polyclinic and industrial estate. </p>
              <p>135 still has alternative options and if not for all sectors, will have option for transfer to other service. 155 not the case. </p>
              <p>Especially Paya lebar - MP is not a problem with both 43 and 134 having a huge number of DDs and decent frequency. There is also 40 from Macpherson Estate going to Tanjong Katong.</p>

              <p>How exactly will 135 be cut - is it going to make a long detour of MacPherson - Paya Lebar - Sims/Geylang - Sims Place, or will it turn into Aljunied straight away from Sims Place, skipping MacPherson Estate entirely? If it's the latter, this amendment will be a HUGE failure.</p>
              <p>Even if 135 still goes to Paya Lebar, it will still lose the unique (and probably well-utilised) connection between MacPherson and Marine Parade. I doubt 40 will be a viable alternative for MP residents, as its route is much more winding and does not serve Marine Parade Road directly. MacPherson residents will also find it troublesome to reach Tanjong Katong Rd - for such a short journey they now have to make transfers.</p>

              <p>I don't really know. I am not sure terminating at Sims place is a good idea either. They could actually make it loop around Paya Lebar MRT. Macpherson-Tanjong Katong-East Coast is also served by sv 40. </p>
              <p>From what I know, Marine Parade/East Coast has way too many buses and many of them are running absolutely empty off-peak and not superly crowded during peak hours either (apart from 36, 48, 196 heading to CBD).</p>
              <p>Even 43/134/135 has only the first bus with good # pax, the remaining 2 buses have less than 20 pax on board at most times during peak hours as if you think of it there is a bus every 03-04 minutes between Paya Lebar &amp; Marine Parade. In addition, you have 197 from Tanjong Katong in parallel till Bedok south ave 1 with sv 43. </p>

                      Lebar MRT. Macpherson-Tanjong Katong-East Coast is also served by
                      sv 40. </p>
              <p>From what I know, Marine Parade/East Coast has way too many
                      buses and many of them are running absolutely empty off-peak and
                      not superly crowded during peak hours either (apart from 36, 48,
                      196 heading to CBD).</p>
              <p>Even 43/134/135 has only the first bus with good # pax, the
                      remaining 2 buses have less than 20 pax on board at most times
                      during peak hours as if you think of it there is a bus every 03-04
                      minutes between Paya Lebar &amp; Marine Parade. In addition, you
                      have 197 from Tanjong Katong in parallel till Bedok south ave 1
                      with sv 43. </p>
              <p>Hence, I am not really surprised if they are trying to cut short
                      135.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, just let the buses to marine parade and east coast off-hook for the time being. Marine parade parkway parade is currently the most patronized mall in an area where there is no MRT. It is just like another jewel in the east. Once the TEL mrt line starts operating in marine parade in yr 2023 onwards, there will be some bus routes rationalization due to TEL. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I think if better combine 135 and 853 and extend to yishun from Bedok Road where the terminal 853 terminated on the weekend. since LTA is taking over the route make it the first one to have smrt and sbst service combine. where 155 if can combine with 134 it will even better. </p>
              <p>All other services around the area is more like political things then proper planing. LTA should I say the MPs want people live around the area to take public transport than drive cars so all those bus service like 134 150 all rubbish planing. 76 also the same stupid planing. maybe as 76 or 135 combine with 853 to yishun better. </p>
