              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, just ask any 10 people out there (not those in
              bus forums) and most will tell you they will rather take MRT than
              12E. The perception that bus routes are lengthy are stuck in people
              minds and will not go away even if you take the kind intention to
              explain to them. Most people are already used to MRT with the
              Station names being the only thing they need to remember rather
              than the bus stop and road names. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I already did actl. I stay near where 12e plies and used to study near where 12e plies too. Many of my friends have switched to 12e after my recommendation, which proves my point that publicity plays a huge role in the success of the route. </p>
              <p>And so what if there is a perception? Does it mean we stop trying? So all the new express routes by LTA under BCM, all for nothing one? If there is a perception isn't the solution to break it? I also know got perception what. You like the perception to be there? Is this why you always reject the idea of express routes?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I'm a somewhat frequent user of 12e as I use it for my commute
              from my school in the east to New Bridge Rd sometimes, and from
              what I observe, it takes me on average 10+ minutes longer to get to
              Chinatown via 12e as compared to DTL, which by itself is a 30
              minutes journey. Not too bad I would say, if I'm not in a rush.
              Also noted that people take 12e as an alternative to 12 between
              Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah MRT and from TNM to Bedok South. On
              average there would be like 10-15 pax on board but by the time the
              bus touches ECP, the number of pax would have already halved
              (usually most of the pax who board 12e at Pasir Ris, Tampines or
              Simei would have alighted at Bedok South). At Bugis Junction, most
              of the remaining pax would have alighted leaving me as the only pax
              on board. From Bugis to Kampong Bahru, the bus would practically be
              running empty.</p>
              <p>Personally, I would say the main factor that puts me off from
              taking 12e excluding travel time and fare is its low frequency (if
              I miss the bus I might as well take DTL than wait another 20-30
              mins).</p>

              <p>12e, as with many other express routes, works on the concept of a suburban intercity route rather than a commuter trunk. This is why the idea is for travellers to plan their journey ahead for their long distance travel. This also ensures maximum catchment and revenue as the reduction in catchment areas is compensated by a reduction in operational costs with less buses that carries more. </p>
              <p>The main reason why this is currently not working in Singapore can be attributed to how this habit has not yet been instilled in Singaporeans. Otherwise, the 30 mins freq won't be a problem at all. </p>
              <p>The exception is if the demand picks up to a sufficiently high level for such a service to be more frequent, such as 190. </p>
              <p>I would agree that with DTL 12e would have a struggle getting pax at Tamp East to Chinatown. But in Simei quite a number actually take 12e to town leh.</p>

              <p>That is true if you are staying near to MRT Stations (1 or 2 bus stops away)<br><br>Imagine you are travelling from bus stops along Bedok South Road/Ave 1 heading to Bugis or the other way round, that's where 12e provides a really good alternative. It is defintely faster as compared to train. It's unfair to compare MRT and Buses travelling time in some cases since most do not stay within walking distance of MRT station.</p>
              <p>On a side note, there is still some commuters mistaking it for 12 and only realising it when it hits ECP.</p>

              <p>137 loading has improved quite a bit. Easily touches 60-70 pax

              <p>We're no longer in the era where new services are introduced with an abundance of DDs (e.g. 46). The downside is that services which everyone thinks will do well with DDs are also having full SD fleets, like 137 and 974.</p>

              <p>Which in my opinion is okay rather than just wasting resources anticipating that 3 years down the line, HC buses will be needed.</p>
              <p>Take 117 for instance. First 2 years DD were an absolute waste when Canberra/Punggol Matilda/SAP and Yishun 1 was still under development. DDs should have added once these were up. 883 was started with full fleet SD, now upgraded to 50% DD fleet (the right thing to do!)</p>
              <p>46, 119, 127 that received DDs under LTA, still don't warrant those DDs. Same case with 83. </p>
              <p>137 now needs 3 split shift DDs. They should consider! 116 too needs 2 DDs. </p>
              <p>DDs should be deployed to match demand and not for political wow-wow!! </p>
