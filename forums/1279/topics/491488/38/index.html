              YTBI @ 1741. </p>
              <p>* At all times, upper deck was more utilized than lower deck as
              most people take 103 for long distance travel, but at this timing
              the DD is just NOT justified.</p>
              <p>* I was told that 445pm-5pm is peak for SAP, but it didnt seem
              so as all bus stops in both directions had &lt;5 pax. Is SAP on
              holiday?? </p>
              <p>* AM trip may have super high loading because of shift timing,
              but PM loading is quite poor for all buses observed in SAP area on
              both 103 and 117 </p>
              <p>* Not sure 103 needs any DDs for PM but if they want to deploy,
              its nice to get the views of Yishun dam (super scenic).</p>

              <p>Bus in front = 04 min, bunched with the rigid at stop aft av 11 towards Yishun interchange. Bus behind = 03 min (rigid).</p>
              <p>As you can see from loading, the upper deck got v well utilized on this bus but not until the bus stop aft st 51. Most people were lower deck who boarded near northlight and before. But at st 51 around 30 pax came to upper deck. </p>

              <p>PM loading on 243W very different from 243G. I would recommend that for PM 243G is full fleet DD whereas 243W can do with full fleet SD. In AM, good to have DDs on both 243G/W. The average loading on 243W was 43 pax, and there was a bus on average every 03 mins. Too much IMO!</p>

              <p>No need extend 102 as demand is for certain timings only. The thing I now noticed about SAP is that people work in shifts. So there is huge loading for certain shift timings and almost no loading at other times and the area is like ghost town with empty bus stops and buses.</p>
              <p>hgdep103 has a good suggestion to do a SWT for those timings or crossover AM DDs. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes I am interested. I agree with few statements made and also disagree with few statements too. The so called 'grossly wasted resources on Punggol services' only can agree half. This statement arises because they change 83/85 from SD to almost Full DD for 83 and totally full DD for 85. So we can only agree the statement applies for 83 and 85 only.</p>
              <p>Why the service provider change it to Almost Full DD for 83? Nobody knows why the decision was given. At sbst times, 83 was full SD. On date of transfer to Go Ahead, it suddenly become Full DD. Because of this, people and bus critics say 83 is over-pampered. And also because of this, people may think Punggol services waste resources. But this only applies to 83 and 85.</p>
              <p>Why the service provider change it to Full DD for 85? This we only half know. At sbst times, 85 was full SD until one day when Sengkang west MP asks LTA to change it to have SOME DDs due to the increasing demand due to increasing flats along Sengkang west. At that time, only some DDs for 85 were activated. Nobody knows why it becomes full DDs when transferred to Go Ahead.</p>
              <p>Above scenario explains wasted resources only apply to few services like 83 and 85.  </p>
              <p>For the next statement of 'there is a bus for Punggol central (last 2 stops) every 3 min', please take it with a pinch of salt. Firstly, it will be true only for peak hours. Secondly, in many cases, when it comes, 3/83/85 tend to turn up (at Punggol central last 2 stops) together around same time with tolerance of +/-3 min. If you miss that, it will not be another 3 min. You have to wait for the next cluster of buses 3/83/85. If it is off peak, it is even longer. </p>
              <p>On the same side, 3/83/85 is facing increasing frequency of being hampered badly along Punggol central last 2 stops all the way to Punggol east to turn to Punggol field (for 3/83) and go straight to Sengkang east (for 85) early in the morning. Heavy jams for many cars going to one-lane temporary exit to TPE/KPE by slip road happens every weekday morning. This results in the lengthening time for 3/83/85 along Punggol central last 2 stops and all the routes for 3/83/85 after that. So do all of you still think you get a bus every 3 min along Punggol central last 2 stops? Even if you manage to get it sometimes at peak hours, think of the journey after the last 2 stops! Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, the jam is 2-prone.</p>
              <p>1st) Punggol central (last 2 stops) stretch to Punggol east to Slip road to TPE/KPE for cars. This affects 3/50/83/85.</p>
              <p>2nd) Punggol field (junction of blk 173D to whole stretch near Punggol plaza) stretch to Punggol east to slip road to TPE/KPE for cars. This affects 3/62/83/386. </p>
              <p>So this affects peak hours every morning. So expect journeys to be longer. </p>
              <p>Out of all these services plus all other services in Punggol, service 3 journey time is the hardest hit. After clearing this, service 3 drives out to TPE and gets hit again by the slow staggering traffic even if without major jam. </p>
              <p>Service 3 gets a double whammy. Hit at both stages. Good luck for passengers and bus captains of service 3 too. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Yes I am referring to the same. Wasted resources on 83/85. On an average there should be a bus every 03 minutes, but if 3/83/85 come together, no one can do anything about it. Even if you add another two services, all 5 can come together and still waiting time would be 10 min.</p>

                  <p>Lowest loading: 0</p>
                  <p>Average loading: 15.6</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Highest boarding was observed at "Temasek Poly" bus stop (+26).</p>
                  <p>Highest alighting was observed at "Opp Bartley Stn" bus stop (-27).</p> 
                  <p>Generally, this bus service is for Temasek Poly students.</p>
                  <p>There are around 10 passengers from Tampines who take it to Toa Payoh, for whatever reason I don't know.</p>
                  <p>The section at Jalan Bahagia and Jalan Tenteram is redundant, honestly, as there was already bus service 21, although they could have introduced a new feeder for that area from Toa Payoh instead.</p>
                  <p>With 33 bus stops, I feel that the route is very long. Considering the loading above average is concentrated between Tampines Avenue 1 and Balestier Road, I would recommend that the bus take a shorter route before and after that section.</p>

              <p>Loading analysis on bus service 129, from Tampines to
              Whampoa</p>
              <p>Date: Thursday, 9 February 2017</p>
              <p>Time: 5:32pm to 6:39pm</p>
              <p>Bus: SG1111U; Mercedes-Benz Citaro</p>
              <p><img src="http://i1104.photobucket.com/albums/h324/frappochinoguy/129_zpsi2knpc8p.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="288"></p>
              <p>Highest loading: 50</p>
              <p>Lowest loading: 0</p>
              <p>Average loading: 15.6</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Highest boarding was observed at "Temasek Poly" bus stop
              (+26).</p>
              <p>Highest alighting was observed at "Opp Bartley Stn" bus stop
              (-27).</p>
              <p>Generally, this bus service is for Temasek Poly students.</p>
              <p>There are around 10 passengers from Tampines who take it to Toa
              Payoh, for whatever reason I don't know.</p>
              <p>The section at Jalan Bahagia and Jalan Tenteram is redundant,
              honestly, as there was already bus service 21, although they could
              have introduced a new feeder for that area from Toa Payoh
              instead.</p>
              <p>With 33 bus stops, I feel that the route is very long.
              Considering the loading above average is concentrated between
              Tampines Avenue 1 and Balestier Road, I would recommend that the
              bus take a shorter route before and after that section.</p>

              <p>Loading is not bad considering it is still a new service. With time more people will take it from Bartley/TPY to Tampines. For Jalan Tenteram, there is 21 but 129 connect to TPY - no connection today. 139M is redundant now given there is 129 and 139, 139M can be withdrawn. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes I agree with DDs on 3 than 83. The
              authorities who make the decision maybe has his own way of
              thinking. What commoners like us cannot do anything but just whine
              about it in forums. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
