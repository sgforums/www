              <p>Excuse me BusAnalayzer, can you please do a loading observation on service 43 (not 43M) at 5:40pm (SBS9532Z) at NEX towards Punggol. Loading seems to have increased here. Frequency is ok at this time, but during the peak at 6pm, the frequency is 12 mins and the buses are all SD. Then right at 7pm, there would be a bunching of 2 DDs on 43 and 43M each, all at the same time: SBS3795X, SBS7703K, SBS3458U, and SBS3435K.</p>

              <div>Apparently, there are some pax at Jurong West St 61 who take 256 to Boon Lay Int. Yesterday at 6pm there were 10 pax boarding 256. Also, 256 can clear all pax at St 62 towards Boon Lay Int especially if 243G has not called (though the number is usually small). As a result, the SD that I took had standees (although it's maximum 25 pax on the bus). Expect better loading during peak hours. <br>Some foreign workers also take 256 from Joo Koon to Soon Lee Dorm. I'm not sure whether they went to Joo Koon for shopping or they come from other JIS (if it's the latter, 193 at Benoi Rd can do the job).<br>Surprisingly, nobody boarded 256 at Pioneer MRT.<br>(Did not record down loadings as I did not expect any good loading due to PH)</div>

              <p>You are talking about 20+10 = 30 pax on sv 258 in AM towards Joo Koon. And you call this "so many people". To be honest, 258 fetches much more pax between 7.30-8.15am towards Joo Koon. The DDs usually have between 50-70 pax on board, half of which alight at Pioneer MRT, few on Upper Jurong Road and around 25-30 pax go all the way to Joo Koon. </p>
              <p>258 in opposite direction from Joo Koon has &lt;5 pax on board on every bus during AM peak and afternoon until you hit the PM peak. </p>

              <p>I was quite surprised with the loading on weekends as I expected lesser for weekends, though I feel that weekday loading has improved as DDs have about 30-40 people alighting at Pioneer during weekdays around 7:30am.</p>

              <div>I was at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (aft Blk 304) bus stop from 3-4pm today, and had interesting observations on 130/130A.</div>
              <div>During this time, 130 in both directions had at least 40-50 pax per bus, probably due to Qing Ming period. However, 130A, which was introduced for the Qing Ming period, was almost empty. 130A towards AMK is still not that bad and have standees at times, but 130A towards Sin Ming is a disaster.</div>
              <div>Thus, I decided to take 130 from there.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Loading on 130 to Sin Ming:</div>
              <div>(15:56) Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 - [+6-1] 27</div>
              <div>(15:58) Sin Ming Ave - [-3] 24</div>
              <div>(15:59) Sin Ming Dr - [-5+4] 23</div>
              <div>(16:01) Sin Ming Rd - [-5+2] 20, [+1] 21 (last stop for 130A), 21</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Loading on 130A back to AMK:</div>
              <div>(16:08) Sin Ming Rd - [+1] 1, 1 (1 pax chose not to board)</div>
              <div>(16:10) Sin Ming Dr - [+9] 10 (2 pax chose not to board)</div>
              <div>(16:12) Sin Ming Ave - [+3] 13</div>
              <div>(16:13) Marymount Rd - [+1] 14</div>
              <div>(16:14) Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 - [-2+4] 16</div>
              <div>(16:17) Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 - [-5] 11</div>
              <div>(130 that arrived 3 mins later had 15-20 pax when exiting the bus stop)</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>- Of the 27 pax onboard 130 towards Shenton Way, only 13 are going to Sin Ming - which explains the difference in loading on 130 and 130A. Another reason could be that pax are not familiar with 130A and choose to board 130 instead (hence almost empty buses on 130A)</div>
              <div>- Return leg on 130A is ok, but a lot of people asked whether 130A goes to AMK Interchange (as EDS still shows 130A)</div>

              <div>- 166's demand at Little India is much smaller than other services, probably due to lack of dorms (although quite a number of locals travel from (Upp) Thomson Rd to Little India)</div>
              <p>- Most of the loading seems to be towards Kg Bahru Rd</p>

              <p>- Surprised that 22 pax alighted at first stop along Henderson Rd, even when there's 124 that may be more direct for some people. I guess either they're too lazy to walk to HarbourFront Int or they stay closer to Henderson Rd<br>- Very few alighted at Bt Purmei, guess they're already taking the more direct 123/M</p>

              <p>While waiting for 8033D at BNL, I observed 243G loading for four buses from 5:55pm to 6:04pm</p>
              <p>Based on my observations: I feel that 243G (and W) should cut down the number of SD buses and do a 2 SD to 1 DD swap, today at 5:55pm, 1 BSEP citaro was fully loaded and packed to the door at 5:55pm, 3 mins later, 2989K was also packed to the door at BNL with less than 3 mins difference and the queue had about 10-15 people when 2989 left BNL</p>
              <p>3 mins later (6:01pm), 1 DD 243G arrived, picking about 55-60 pax, clearing the queue at 6:02pm, and 1 SD 243G (KUB) came 1 min later, picking about 20-25 pax, in my opinion, 243G has too many buses and should cut down the number of SD</p>

                              <p>While waiting for 8033D at BNL, I observed 243G loading for four
              buses from 5:55pm to 6:04pm</p>
              <p>Based on my observations: I feel that 243G (and W) should cut
              down the number of SD buses and do a 2 SD to 1 DD swap, today at
              5:55pm, 1 BSEP citaro was fully loaded and packed to the door at
              5:55pm, 3 mins later, 2989K was also packed to the door at BNL with
              less than 3 mins difference and the queue had about 10-15 people
              when 2989 left BNL</p>
              <p>3 mins later (6:01pm), 1 DD 243G arrived, picking about 55-60
              pax, clearing the queue at 6:02pm, and 1 SD 243G (KUB) came 1 min
              later, picking about 20-25 pax, in my opinion, 243G has too many
              buses and should cut down the number of SD</p>

              <p>3 mins frequency is indeed over supply. If I am not wrong, feeder 241 also running at 3 mins frequency. Even the standard set by LTA for the GCM model is 6-8 mins frequency for feeder bus services.</p>
              
              <p>if 243 and 241 runs at a uniform frequency of 6 mins, they may need a full fleet of double decker buses. and I think that's enough to meet the demand.</p>

                                  <p>Hey my friend, if you are a full-time student and you purposely take time off to observe bus loadings, I feel that it is better that you focus on your studies. Let us do the bus observations for you. :)</p>
                                  
                                  <p>There are adults in this forum who live in Jurong West (for example, lemon1974, ashrafjj, gekpohboy, chickenlittle/CHT). The people behind Facebook pages "Buses in Singapore" and "Singapore buses" are based in Jurong West. There is a lunatic who keeps checking on bus services 179 and 179A.</p> <p>Rest assured, the bus service standard in Jurong West is in good hands. You just need to focus on doing well in your studies. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
                  <p>The same goes for me, actually. I am a Polytechnic student moving on from year two to year three. As I move on to year three, I have decided that it is best that I stop writing in forums and really concentrate on my studies... I will leave soon.</p>
