              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, 45 pax is considered good enough for a single
              deck bus service. Even 30 people is considered not bad. You cannot
              always expect more than 60 people for a feeder service.</p>
              <p>Take note mr xxx loading shows substantial no of people
              alighting at upper serangoon crew and upper serangoon view. This
              shows that 324 and 102 should remain 2 separate services as they
              don’t go to same area as claimed. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Not surprising to see the high loading between AMK and Bishan. svc 55 between ave 10 (3 stops) and Bishan gets 70+ pax during peak. Likewise svc 50 gets around 50-60 pax between Ave 8 and Bishan. Similarly, 71 will reach 70+ pax loading during peak hours between AMK 1 and Bishan, eating into 262's loading.</p>

              <p>* I was supposed to do the route only till NEX but decided to stay onboard until Hougang to monitor loading on return trip.</p>
              <p>* Few people have said that DDs should be deployed on svc 82, but the peak loading in directon towards NEX was 58 pax between Punggol Road and Hougang MRT. Loading mostly is in its 30s.</p>
              <p>* Return loading as expected remains under 25 pax</p>
              <p>* Quite a few alternate services eat into the load (I guess). Frequency isn't superb at around 12 mins per bus.</p>
              <p>* Looking at the trend, I think full fleet SD still seems okay on svc 82, unless it is merged with say svc 107. </p>

              <p>I was in Yew Tee area all of yesterday. </p>
              <p><strong>302</strong></p>
              <p>A lot more rigids spammed in AM and PM in Yew Tee. Almost every bus leaves YT with standees whether it is bendy or SD. 302A gets around 50-60 pax. BCs do a good job of waiting for around 03 minutes at bus stop until another 302 or 979 comes at the back. Observed one bendy and one rigid on 302 both taking around 50-60 pax. </p>
              <p><strong>979 </strong></p>
              <p>PM Yew TEE - Comes to Yew Tee with around 40-45 pax and gets another 40-45 pax at YT. Upper deck full. There are 3 SDs still running on 979 which should be converted to DD as well as SDs are packed to door.</p>
              <p>AM towards Yew Tee - Between 0730-0815am DDs are packed to door. All DDs get more than 70-80 pax before reaching Bukit Panjang. All SDs are packed to door.</p>
              <p><strong>Definitely recommend 979 to be full fleet DD</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Loading observations on Yishun feeders/intra-towns 19/01 AM. Driving around Yishun or staying stationery between 0630 and 0800am.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>800</strong></p>
              <p>None of the high capacity buses or SDs had more than 50 pax on board. Surprisingly, I spotted a DD with 100+ pax along Yishun Ave 7 and then when I saw the same bus at Yishun Ring Road/Ave 2 junction, it had around 50 pax on board. School students?? But then 800 is only uni-directional, what do these people do in the opposite direction? Frequency around 04-07 mins per bus.</p>
              <p><strong>803</strong></p>
              <p>Buses spotted at Yishun Ave 9 had a loading of around 50-60 pax, which is v good for the short feeder. Frequency 04-05 mins.</p>
              <p><strong>804</strong></p>
              <p>None of the buses were packed to door. Clearly 804 has lost a lot of its loading. Most buses had loading in range of 40-60 pax. Good mix of DDs, bendies and SDs. Frequency was around 04 mins per bus.</p>
              <p><strong>806</strong></p>
              <p>Not a single DD or bendy was packed. This was surprising to me that 806 used to be packed to door. Frequency is outrageous at a bus every 02-03 mins. This explains. Seems like at this frequency even SDs could do the job. </p>
              <p><strong>807 towards Khatib</strong></p>
              <p>What a frequency!!! There was a bus every 01-03 mins either 807 or 807A. Most 807A were SDs whereas 807 was primarily DD/bendy. Spotted 7DDs, 2 bendies and at least 7 SDs. Almost every bus was packed. DDs carried 70-90 pax, rigids were packed to door, I guess bendies had 70+ pax too. The loading on 807 has definitely increased even further with the opening of new BTOs. I would recommend to give some of the DDs from 806 to 807 and make it 80% high capacity fleet. </p>
              <p><strong>807 towards Yishun</strong></p>
              <p>Loading is around 40-50 pax towards Yishun, most prefer to take it to Khatib.</p>
              <p><strong>811</strong></p>
              <p>Again like 806, the places where I spotted it like Ring road &amp; Ave 9, the bus wasn't packed as I expected it to be. SDs had a good 50 pax, but most bendies and 2 DDs spotted had also around 40-60 pax max. There wasn't a single bus I spotted that had very high loading. I think this is again to do with the high number of buses (19) with frequency of 03-04 mins</p>
              <p><strong>812</strong></p>
              <p>I think the loading on this intratown is the lowest among the ones I spotted. Mostly around 40 pax loading. Still spotted a good number of bendies, though the number of rigids has increased too. </p>

              <p>860 is used as an alternative for 807 and people alight at bus stop before Yishun Ave 2 to go to Khatib MRT. If 860 came behind DD/bendy, it would have around 30-40 pax on it, and if behind rigid, would have around 50-55 pax on it. After this stop, bus would have 20-25 pax going forward to Ave 2 and YCK.

              <p><strong>883</strong></p>
              <p>Surprised to see 4 DDs plying on it. And not surprised after seeing the loading. Almsot every 883 rigid was packed to door and DDs had 80-90 pax. There was 1 DD that may have had like 110 pax. I think fleet will be revised to 7-8 buses with 4 DDs given the high loading.</p>

              <p>The frequency of 965A/965 towards Yishun was one bus every 04-05 mins operating like feeder frequency that too mostly all DDs during that time. All buses had 40-60 pax not more, some had even lesser due to bunching. I think 965A operating like feeder as Yishun Ave 7 doesn't really have a direct feeder though there is 800/811 that takes longer to get to Yishun MRT. </p>

              <p>Guess 860 will continue to have poor loading past Khatib until TEL2. Even after that, loading remains questionable as I'm not sure how many people will use 860's winding route to Springleaf.</p>
              <p>On a side note, I think time has come for 117 to be amended into Canberra.</p>

              <p>This morning, 883 loading was higher towards Sembawang than Yishun... almost every SD/DD had a heavy loading. There is a SD downroute from Canberra to Sembawang. </p>

              <p>CRL actually has a lot of duplicating bus services.</p>
              <p>AMK-Hougang services (132, 165, in some sense 74) are the obvious ones. But CRLe also duplicates quite a number of existing services, particularly the TPE services to Punggol (3, 34) and PSR-Hougang services (53, 81, possibly 72 and 89).</p>
              <p>Loyang services (6, 89, maybe 19) will also suffer.</p>
              <p>Don't think AMK-AMK West services (166, 169 etc) will be affected, because CRL goes down to Sin Ming after AMK. Much greater effects will probably be felt by long-distance services, like 52, 165 and possibly 74. 165 will die as its route duplicates entirely with CRL, unfortunately. 52's loading is already in parts so it may still experience high loading between SIM and Sin Ming.</p>
              <p>Most of West Coast services (especially Teban/Pandan services) actually connect to Jurong East instead of Clementi so they will still have good demand. Services like 201 and 285 to Clementi may experience some drop in demand.</p>
              <p>Effect on the JIS/semi-JIS services will largely depend on the exact route taken by CRL. But even then, those JIS can probably serve as feeders between CRL stations and the industrial estates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall, I predict we will see the greatest drop in loading on the following services:</p>
              <p>3, 52, 81, 89, 165, 201.</p>
