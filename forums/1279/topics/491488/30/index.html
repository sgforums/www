              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, 85 DD for Sengkang west residents. 83 maybe added bonus for Punggol central residents due to spike in no of flats there. Also don't know why so many DDs for 83. Anyway good lor. I benefit as a result. Now Punggol central/Punggol east 3/83/85/50 all 4 services have DDs. Hope next to go is 386 which certainly needs DDs at peak hours. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this example is considered pampered. As usual, a portion (though not significant) will alight at TPE stop. So basically some of the people at tampines interchange can still board service 969 and stand for 12 min until TPE stop. After that, they will have a seat. </p>
              <p>Last time there is no DD but people still cramp on 969 single deck. So this is due more to people perception. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Possible to do weekday between 5.30 and 7.30 pm? That's the true reflection of peak hour. 8pm will already be off-peak and will not be the right benchmark.</p>

              <p>Yes... what you have reported is what I have observed... Usually 83 will get 50-60 pax from Punggol depending on whether sv 3, 85 have called. From Sengkang, it is usually 30-40 pax (may have improved a bit with Compassvale Cape, but need to validate).</p>
