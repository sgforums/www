              <p>147e is a bus service that replaces CT28. These people staying in NUH, Clementi and Buona Vista can really benefit from having 147 semi-express sector to Chinatown.</p>
              <p>12e is a bus service that replaces parts of 518. but is another 518 case whereby no passenger will board at Bugis to Chinatown.</p>
              <p>One thing for sure. the local sector no one will board. only the express sector to another place.</p>

              <p>Yea but you forget that Bugis to Chinatown/CQ takes shorter (max 15 min) and these are also the places where they would in fact have to travel further on the MRT, having to detour down to Outram and change to NEL. This is where 12e serves its purpose beyond Bugis. </p>

              <p>The problem with publicity here in SG is that the element of time is not highlighted sufficiently to give commuters an idea of how much time they could have saved. </p>
              <p>Take into example the posters for the RWS express services in 2010. Sure, it's great they printed in block that it's an express svc that brings them direct to RWS — but how long will it take? Compared to the MRT how much faster is it? </p>
              <p>The other factor is the lack of ability to highlight key catchment areas. Is RWS the only place the svc plies? How about HBF? I would daresay more people would go to HBF than RWS at any time actl. Similarly with 12e, do people know that this bus' first stop after ECP is right in the heart of Bugis?</p>
              <p>If these can be done correctly these svcs will be like hotcakes among people. I recently took 963R, HBF to Clementi took a stunning 15 mins, whereas the MRT would've taken almost twice of that time (incl xfer at Outram). To ensure that LTA's recent efforts can pay off the extra mile to keep typical commuters informed must be taken.</p>

              <p>I have always been in agreement of a full SDs fleet for 12e for the time being, from the beginning. My concern is that the current pitiful 12e demand shouldn't happen given the route's great potential that have been far from realised.</p>
              <p>It takes 10 minutes from TJC to Bugis. What this means is that the JC people's fav landmarks such as NLB, malls there and Haji Lane would have been much more accessible, where MRT would've taken at least 35 mins with transfers to bus. Yet, why after the major celebrations in campus, not a single student boards it? Price isn't a factor as trust me, that's the least of concerns for the milllenial students of today. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, just ask any 10 people out there (not those in bus forums) and most will tell you they will rather take MRT than 12E. The perception that bus routes are lengthy are stuck in people minds and will not go away even if you take the kind intention to explain to them. Most people are already used to MRT with the Station names being the only thing they need to remember rather than the bus stop and road names. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I'm a somewhat frequent user of 12e as I use it for my commute from my school in the east to New Bridge Rd sometimes, and from what I observe, it takes me on average 10+ minutes longer to get to Chinatown via 12e as compared to DTL, which by itself is a 30 minutes journey. Not too bad I would say, if I'm not in a rush. Also noted that people take 12e as an alternative to 12 between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah MRT and from TNM to Bedok South. On average there would be like 10-15 pax on board but by the time the bus touches ECP, the number of pax would have already halved (usually most of the pax who board 12e at Pasir Ris, Tampines or Simei would have alighted at Bedok South). At Bugis Junction, most of the remaining pax would have alighted leaving me as the only pax on board. From Bugis to Kampong Bahru, the bus would practically be running empty.</p>
              <p>Personally, I would say the main factor that puts me off from taking 12e excluding travel time and fare is its low frequency (if I miss the bus I might as well take DTL than wait another 20-30 mins).</p>
