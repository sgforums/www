              <p>291 and 292 will be still ok </p>
              <p>28 will still remain high esp between tai Seng to Bedok and

              <p>46 loading may be even lower esp between tamp West - Tampines
              int cause tat is the main loading and when 298 starts running.
              Loading will be even lower</p>
              <p>59 should be high also. Esp between kaki Bukit -TPY</p>
              <p>8 still will remain high. Students from tp and Ubi still need to
              rely it to go to MacPherson Road. Esp MacPherson road there as a

              <p>Pax who do not want to go to Rochor via that big loop can alight at Jalan Besar and walk.</p>
              <p>46 will lose some of its loading between Tampines Central and west, but will gain loading between Tampines West MRT and Tampines West estate, and also between Bedok Reservoir MRT and Bedok Nth Rd (Fengshan).</p>

              <p>nothing wrong with all those private buses...</p>
              <p>they are paid for by the companies there such as DBS...if these companies are willing to pay for the private buses for their staff, we should be happy, cos we (taxpayers) wont have to subsidy more services. </p>

              <p>My relative stay in AMK but work in DBS CBP.. she said that if there is no free shuttle from TPY to CBP, she wont be working there...  if no free shuttle, she will have to take feeder to AMK Mrt, then to Bishan MRT --&gt; CCL --&gt; EWL, then transfer another bus to get to DBS..   if there is a bus service from AMK to CBP, how long it will take? at least 1 1/2 hrs travel time unless it is express.  the free shuttle from TPY to CBP use PIE and took around 30 mins...and there are definitely seats available. </p>

              <p>Some general observations on 123's loading since its extension to Sentosa...</p>
              <p>IMO, 123 is not really a popular choice among Sentosa-goers as the loading during weekends between Tiong Bahru MRT and Sentosa is actually kind of poor as most pax alight at Bukit Purmei and only a handful (usually about 10 or even less) pax remain all the way till Sentosa. During weekdays peak, loading still remains strong but only between Tiong Bahru and Bukit Purmei and becomes kosong towards Sentosa while 123M has decent load to/from HBF. Loading during off peak is not really DD worthy as it is complemented well by 123M from Tiong Bahru to Lower Delta - don't really see much pax going up to the upper deck. Loading patterns remain relatively the same as before extension from Orchard/Havelock/Bukit Merah - remains moderate.</p>
              <p>I suggest building a pair of bus stops for 123 along Sentosa Gateway right outside VivoCity so that pax can still take 123 should they be heading towards HBF (albeit have to cross the overhead bridge and walk slightly more than 123M's stop at the entrance) and also pax taking from Sentosa can still choose to alight at HBF.</p>
