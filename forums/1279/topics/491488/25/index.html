              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, why not another service? Must maintain the headway between buses. If they keep having 2 buses of same service coming all at same time, interchange will definitely be jammed. 3M is more for direct express between Punggol and pasir ris At peak hours. Loop at Punggol east no use. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, add more service helps a bit. Other bus stops at Punggol central have lesser problems as they have 3/34/83/84/85/136. Only the last two stops have 3/83/85 which is problematic. 386 not counted for last stop because of the 2 roundabouts inside edgefield and edgedale plains. For those living at last stop, they can still walk to Punggol east to take Sbs 50. Anyway give them 1 week to improve the headway between buses of same service. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, something is terribly wrong. I went to my house bus stop downstairs and sit for 1 hour. The headway between bus of the same service seems better controlled from 10.30pm to 11.30pm. Reason I am not sure of. Cannot understand also why I saw so many DDs in both directions for service 83 compared to service 3. Something is wrong! 3 is always more crowded than 83. Even service 85 seems to have a major upgrade. So many DDs for 83 and 85 compared to 3. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, service 3 also has many long distance travellers from Punggol central up to pasir ris MRT. Beyond that, no. DDs needed for a more comfortable journey especially given the traffic conditions at TPE during morning and evening peak hours. Service 83 DDs are more of a gimmick. We need reliable services not gimmicks. Keep the gimmicks to yourself, Go Ahead Singapore.</p>
              <p>In any way, it is terribly messed up by Go Ahead Singapore as of this moment. Hope the headway between buses of same service improve. We look forward to a better tomorrow and the days ahead. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
