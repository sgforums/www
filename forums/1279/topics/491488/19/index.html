              num.</em></span></p>
              <p>6:33 - 6758E - 51pax (looking at the trend, I assume previous
              bus would be 6:23)</p>
              <p>6:42 - 8698K - 46pax +09m</p>
              <p>6:52 - 3110Y - 55paz (DD slot) +10m.</p>
              <p>7:10 - 6790P - 58pax (the frequency of 103 drops after 7pm) +
              18m</p>
              <p>7:30 - xxxx - 59 pax (could not note the rego as I went to see
              5311H on 109A) + 20m</p>
              <p>* Frequency of 103 is at 10m, but drops sharply after 7pm. I
              believe this is because by then the loading at SAP dies down and
              those along YCK road are expected to take 43/43M/70</p>
              <p>* Loading per bus departing NEX is quite decent at 50+ pax. I
              have a feeling these would be dedicated patronage along Jalan Kayu
              HDBs/dorms. Those alighting at YCK road would be in minority given
              that there is 43/43M/70 and some downroutes on 70 from NEX bus stop
              at better frequency.</p>
              <p>* There should be few more people boarding at Serangoon MRT stop
              along Upper Serangoon Road, taking the loading to 65-70 pax on each
              bus. </p>
              <p>* 103 for sure can try some more DDs.</p>

              <p>43 really needs more DDs. Full SDs are very common during pre evening peak (1.30 pm - 5 pm) throughout the route, and is particularly common from 3.30 pm onwards. SDs come at frequency of 11 min, but are still full even with 43M.</p>
              <p>The DDs in off peak are mostly on back to back slots, and have shorter headway than SDs. Headway of bus X refers to the waiting time from previous bus to bus X.</p>
              <p>Off peak headways of A/P DD slots:</p>
              <p>3461: 19 mins</p>
              <p>3506: 13 mins</p>
              <p>3462: 13 mins</p>
              <p>3440: 11 mins</p>
              <p>Compare with SD:</p>
              <p>6489 (before 3461) 18 mins</p>
              <p>6512 (before 3506) <strong>20 mins This slot has extreme loading and almost always full from NEX to Sengkang! 8 minutes longer headway than the subsequent DD.</strong></p>
              <p>3462 is directly after 3506. Both DDs often have super low loading compared to the huge no of pax who cant get onto 6512 on YCK rd. Even if the pax from the 2 DDs were merged into 1 DD, there would still be enough seats for all the pax.</p>
              <p>The huge loading on SBS6512B slot is a one off compared to the buses before and after, but is not one off for how often it happens. Strangely enough it does not happen on Wednesdays. </p>

              <p>Another problem on 43 is 'pax hogging', a more serious form of bus bunching.</p>
              <p>This is how it works:</p>
              <p>2 buses on the same bus service arrive together. The first one is SD and the second one is DD.</p>
              <p>A crowd of pax board the SD, not noticing the DD. This allows the DD to overtake the SD. But it can also cause the SD to be full.</p>
              <p>But if the pax all board the DD, it slows down the DD and the SD may move off first if it is late. The SD will eventually be full if there are enough pax and the cycle repeats until the buses reach the terminal. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>However, bus hogging can be more serious than above scenario.</p>
              <p>If the SD is very close in front of the DD, but not near enough for the BC or pax to see each other, the pax will all board the SD. If there are enough pax, the SD will be full and the DD will be empty.</p>
              <p>Just go to YCK Rd or Buangkok and see how often it happens. It happens in 50% of all bunchings between 43/M.</p>
              <p>I wonder if the SBST schedule planners have been eating snake.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This is regular scenario on sv 43 I agree. Many times 43 and 43M DD will come together and one of them will go empty all the way back to Punggol. Hence, my suggestion to make 43M full fleet SD and transfer the DDs to 43 instead. LTA/SBST is pretty slow to react. They are okay actually wasting plentiful resources. Just like 119 now for 3.5 years operating with empty DDs.</p></div>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, yes agree. This bus contracting model is just a disguise. Colour change only. Nothing interesting. Just use back most of the SBS transit buses with the sbs logo being struck off only and a bus driver in another uniform. Hope the go ahead group does not bring crawling speeds to the services in pasir ris Punggol area. Currently, travelling times from this part of island to other areas by buses are quite lousy already. So don't add on to our misery. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Thursday evening observation of frequencies at Whitley Road bus stop</p>
              <p>Timing: 18.10 - 19.20 hours</p>
              <p>190 - consistently arriving between 03-04 mins per bus. On average buses had around 60-80 pax. </p>
              <p>972 - frequency quite abrupt between 04-12 mins per bus. Quite a bit of bunching. On average buses had around 60-80 pax.</p>
              <p>960 - frequency is around 07 mins interval when A22, and around 14-16 mins when E500 or bendy. On average A22s had around 50-60 pax and DDs/bendies had around 60-70 pax. Not so bad still but observed opposite direction most buses had &lt;20 pax. Also note frequency has reduced. Is 960 still operating with 30-32 buses? I doubt so.</p>
              <p>700 - frequency around 10-16 mins. Buses had seated loading around 40-50 pax per bus.</p>
