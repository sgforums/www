              <p>Absolutely incorrect. If 43 came before 76, 76 would go empty all the way from Upper Paya Lebar to Marine Terrace during off-peak (literally with &lt;10 pax). During peak hours, it would get the leftovers from sv 43 who miss the bus by a minute or two. </p>
              <p>It was same for 43 if it followed 76, but a bit better as those going to Mandarin Gardens, Lagoon etc on Marine Parade had to wait for 43 to arrive.</p>
              <p>And by no means 134 loading is bad. 116, 120 that were launched 3 years back have still not caught up to high loading and we say it is okay. </p>

              <p>Absolutely incorrect. If 43 came before 76, 76 would go empty
                  all the way from Upper Paya Lebar to Marine Terrace during off-peak

              <p>I know what you mean. It is really a bold move on LTA's part. I guess it has to do with 43/70/76 running in parallel for such long part of its route that off-peak you can really see the buses running with unit digit pax in this sector. </p>

              <p>There aren't any loading statistics recorded, just observations.</p>
              <p>Took the 0710 hours departure for Service 181M yesterday (23 March 2016). Despite the fact that this service is supposedly dedicated for the students of Corporation Pr Sch, none of the students actually took the service to school throughout the trip.</p>
              <p>Being an alma mater of Corporation Pr Sch, I briefly remembered that the assembly time is approximately between 0745 and 0800 hours. Thus, the trip I took should have some students going to school, since 181M arrived the campus between 0720 and 0730 hours. However, there were none and several students still chose to walk from the residential blocks Jurong West Ave 3 to school (to save on the bus fare possibly and eliminate the hassle to cross the road if they took 181M).</p>
              <p>Another thing I noticed is that 2 foreign workers from the nearby factories along Jurong West St 23 actually used 181M to get to Boon Lay Int. Thus, 181M ends up benefitting factory workers instead of the students it is supposed to target? (No qualms though for the factory workers to take 181M).</p>

              <p>I wonder what was the frequency on 43 before. In 2012, sv 43 had only a fleet of 14 buses. Then SBST upgraded 2 slots to DD, consecutively 4 slots to DD, yet a fleet of 14 buses.

              <p>So overall 43 got 7 buses added for its full route in last 3 years with massive SD-&gt;DD upgrade as well. Again, <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">I wonder what was the frequency on 43 before.</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span></p>
