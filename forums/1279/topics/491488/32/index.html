              <p>SBST deployed 216 SDs and 101-102 DDs excluding spare on Loyang

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, you cannot say 3 and 83 duplicate each other like crazy. Having 2 bus services along certain sectors of the route is quite normal. They also serve many other objectives which you may not know. Take note waiting for 83 is much easier than 3 on return trips to punggol. Many people waited at bus stop 65071 (opp blk 103 along punggol rd) to go inside Punggol field/east/central for service 3 and 83 and will board either one which comes first. However, they (including me) are frustrated by 3 (due to TPE unpredictability and roundabout route in pasir ris). 83 is more consistent. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, I prefer they put more DDs even on bus services with only SD loading. This is because I feel the squeeze among passengers on SD. Sometimes SD have full seating plus some people who are standing. End up more people boarded and some alight at various stops. You often get into chances where people tell you to 'excuse me' when you are standing and also you are sitting. </p>
              <p>Worse is you thought you have finished enduring the first trip. However when you transfer to another SD, the same thing comes again. Sort of make your bus journey tiring. </p>
              <p>Hoeever, when on DDs, all these scenarios I mention above do not come into play most of the times. This is purely my observance from a public transport guy who takes buses daily. For those who drive car often, they may not feel it this way and will love to have exact loading for SD and DD which I think will not materialize in crowded Singapore. Just my two cents worth.

              <p>They want also buey tahan. SMRT will change its mind to allow all routes to be double decker. 40 bendies stay if not waste money. 1 bendy can go private hire, 8 bendies can go Phuket, 10 bendies can go Bangkok and the remaining 22 can keep for service 858.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering SMRT had took the wrong decision since 1995.</p>

              <p>My humble contribution to this thread:</p>
              <p>Svc 979 @ about 5 pm:</p>
              <p>Junction 10: approx 20 passengers on the bus</p>
              <p>CCK Dr: -2</p>
              <p>CCK N5: +3</p>
              <p><em>(A 302 SD follows this bus into CCK St 52, but everyone boards this bus anyway)</em></p>
              <p>CCK St 52: -1/+3, -2/+5</p>
              <p><em>(So far everyone who alighted boarded the bus at Bukit Panjang)</em></p>
              <p>Yew Tee MRT: -20/+20 approximately, about 5 who boarded the bus at Bt Panjang remain on the bus</p>
              <p><em>(The 302 SD is right behind, followed by a 302 Bendy bus ...)</em></p>
              <p>Hope this gives everyone a sense of how many passengers take 979 between Yew Tee and Bukit Panjang!</p>

              So you want every svc got DD ah? Routes like 11, 42, 84, 191, 200, 825, 882 and 926 also ah?
              Sir, I take public transport everyday also hor.
              Yes, you can deploy DDs on every svc, but do it on 2030, when the population reaches 6.9 million.
              If every svc got DD now, your bus fare increase by 3 times leh. You want ah?

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, I prefer they put more DDs. Not I want every service got DDs. In years to come, I PREDICT majority DDs, minority SDs. As for bus fares, they will increase or decrease accordingly. For me, I don't think DDs will play a major part in increasing bus fares. With or without DDs, fares increase. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, I prefer they put more DDs even on bus services
              with only SD loading. This is because I feel the squeeze among
              passengers on SD. Sometimes SD have full seating plus some people
              who are standing. End up more people boarded and some alight at
              various stops. You often get into chances where people tell you to
              'excuse me' when you are standing and also you are
              sitting. </p>
              <p>Worse is you thought you have finished enduring the first trip.
              However when you transfer to another SD, the same thing comes
              again. Sort of make your bus journey tiring. </p>
              <p>Hoeever, when on DDs, all these scenarios I mention above do not
              come into play most of the times. This is purely my observance from
              a public transport guy who takes buses daily. For those who drive
              car often, they may not feel it this way and will love to have
              exact loading for SD and DD which I think will not materialize in
              crowded Singapore. Just my two cents worth. Cheers and thanks.</p>

              <p>* bus in front = 08 mins, bus behind = 10 mins</p>
              <p>* Overall loading quite poor, even though sv 38 was ahead of sv
                  12</p>
              <p>* Loading in Bedok South - Bedok Interchange surprised me a lot.
                  Maybe 229 called before but wasn't evidently seen so there must
                  have been 3-4 mins gap</p>
              <p>* Seems those going to MRT prefer to do Tanah Merah as expected
                  with 12, 38 and 47. </p>
              <p>* 38 can be re-routed to do Tampines-Changi Airport via Simei
                  town, SUTD, Changi Court, PIE given current route between Simei and
                  Bedok is duplicative to sv 12 and there is also sv 47 now. Since sv
                  229 is there, no people will get affected.</p>

              <p>Who says Simei Street 1 or 4 cannot have double deckers? There is service 20 now. 38 is the one who do not need these double deckers.</p>

              <p><br> So you want every svc got DD ah? Routes like 11, 42, 84, 191, 200,
              825, 882 and 926 also ah? Sir, I take public transport everyday
              also hor. Yes, you can deploy DDs on every svc, but do it on 2030,
              when the population reaches 6.9 million. If every svc got DD now,
              your bus fare increase by 3 times leh. You want ah?</p>

              <p>No, slowly do bit by bit. Service 42 cannot use DD because of the steep slope at Opera Estate and because there are people still rely on car.</p>
