              Don't mind also. It's more comfortable and having no need to squeeze inside MRT. Also it is cheaper than taking a cab.
              Less cars on the roads = more space for buses = less jams = faster travelling time.

              <p>But such long routes are often unreliable due to traffic conditions. Moreover, 90% of people working in Tuas live in the west itself, you will hardly find anyone living in east. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, Punggol central permanent link to KPE-TPE is currently being constructed and will be ready by Q1 2019. There is also the mini express road inside Punggol plans. Expect even more cars when the population keeps growing. Currently another 40 mrt train trips are being added on weekday mornings. 2 car LRT trains also just started at peak hours. </p>
              <p>I think it is time the govt starts to build new flats elsewhere in other parts of Singapore and not always Sengkang and Punggol. It is time to build a new town such as tengah or bidadari and stop building more BTOs in Sengkang and Punggol. The surrounding land for remaining teck Lee LRT (to be opened) should just be used for the new university. Or else you will need a 30 bus services similar to that of bedok interchange just to cope with the demands of bus services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Bro, by that logic, expect Singapore to be a failed economy in future. Poverty will be on the rise, inflation will go off the roof to provide same resources. There is a lot of micro and macro-economics involved in running a country. We don't realise this. We keep blaming foreign workers and expats, but Singapore economy is built on its friendly culture to accommodate outsiders. Hence all companies have their headquarters in Singapore and not in China and India. </p>

              bring back to their families back home. May I ask, are Singaporeans
              willing to work as construction workers, etc? No right?</p>

              <p>I didnt say send all of them go back home but current quota is more than enough..If the salary for local contruction workers is sensible and acceptable why not?Since BC basic pay increase to $1950 there is slightly more locals joining.But Top level post?No need too many right?Thats like taking advantage of the situation..</p>

              <p>* 410W loading is v good from Bishan Interchange and DDs are doing v well on it as you can see</p>
              <p>* Learning for me: In future, I should measure the time when the bus leaves the berth, as sometimes a bus can stay upto 02-03 mins at berth, and next bus may appear 03 mins away, but actually came right after the previous berth left the berth, taking only few pax</p>
              <p>* Highlighted in red are all slots where DDs did well or would be good potential for DDs.</p>
              <p>* Observed fleet: 11 buses (5 SDs, 6 DDs). I thought original fleet is 12 buses (6 SDs, 6 DDs), but 1 SD seems to be cut. Can someone confirm?</p>
              <p>* Average frequency - 04 to 05 mins on sv 410W, should be 10 min until 07pm on svc 52, and then 15 mins post 7pm. </p>

              <p>Okay maybe. But the fleet is actually doing pretty fine with 6 DDs and 5 SDs I guess. Moreover, the frequency seems quite standard at a bus departing every 05 mins. I was wondering where the extra SD would fit in. Having said that, 3285B second trip at 712pm seemed to be off-time table or designed to bunch as it came together with 8537S. Till then and after that frequency consistency has been at 05 minutes.</p>
              <p>Is that regularly observed?</p>

              <p>Not really sure. But based on your loading data there is a 6 mins gap btw 8382X and 8537S. Could it be 8537S departing 2 minutes late? </p>

              <p>Could be. But still out of sequence where the board shows 410W every 05 minutes. Also strange to have meal break for the SD during prime peak hour. I thought meal breaks usually would be outside of peak hours. IMO, 11 buses just seem good with 6 DDs and 5 SDs.</p>

              <p>* AM trip may have super high loading because of shift timing, but PM loading is quite poor for all buses observed in SAP area on both 103 and 117 </p>

              <p>630 - 5904U - 38p - DD (+04m) <em>I boarded this bus. </em></p>
              <p>* Loading from YTBI max is around 40 pax. Most buses get around 20 pax. The long walk from MRT to the berth maybe encouraging people to take 860 from Khatib instead (and this was observed when I boarded the bus)</p>
              <p>* Fleet = 13 buses (9 Rigids, 2 Bendies, 2 DDs)... <strong>who the hell says it is 19 buses??</strong> It could be possible that there are AM crossovers for 860A but def couldn't observe any for PM</p>
              <p>* Frequency: Bus returns to loading berth after approx. 55 min / 13 = 04-05 min frequency. If it is 19 buses that would mean 02-03 min frequency and surely not required. </p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">860 @ 1830 from YTBI on 5904U</span></strong></p>
              <p>Yishun Interchange -- 38 (0/38)</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 9 -- 38 (0/0)</p>

I think soon they will move the bus stop, </em>28 (-5/0), 48 (-12/32) <em style="color: #ff00ff;">Surprised by the high number of pax boarding here. This is stop before Khatib MRT, </em>44 (-14/10) <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><em>Khatib MRT bunched with 1693G at back that took more pax as BC took the DD to the front end of stop</em></span>, 42 (-2/0)</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 3 -- 39 (-8/5)</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 2 -- 38 (-3/2)</p>
              <p>Yishun Ring Road -- <strong>57</strong> (-1/20) <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><em>1693G at the back also took many pax, so loading was distributed. I alighted here!!</em></span></p>
              <p>* Overall DD is doing v well on 860 contrary to my expectation. The upper deck is well utilized. I am still amazed at the # people boarding at stop before Khatib MRT and do they really do one full circle to get home. That lazy to cross road eh!? Or is it that they saw DD and fancied to take it and go to upper deck?</p>
              <p>* Too much bunching observed enroute: 5888H, 181X, 1233X bunch together at stop before Yishun Ave 11. 1689T, 174S, 1699R all turn towards Yishun Ring Road from Ave 2 when the traffic light turned green. Bunching of 3 buses very common as most of them depart in 02-04 minutes of bus in front.</p>
              <p>* Observed no downroutes from Khatib as all buses observed were those that left YTBI unless the downroute bus was parking at YTBI. </p>
