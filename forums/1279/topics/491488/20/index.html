              <p>Thursday evening observation of frequencies at Whitley Road bus
              stop</p>
              <p>Timing: 18.10 - 19.20 hours</p>
              <p>190 - consistently arriving between 03-04 mins per bus. On
              average buses had around 60-80 pax.Â </p>
              <p>972 - frequency quite abrupt between 04-12 mins per bus. Quite a
              bit of bunching. On average buses had around 60-80 pax.</p>
              <p>960 - frequency is around 07 mins interval when A22, and around
              14-16 mins when E500 or bendy. On average A22s had around 50-60 pax
              and DDs/bendies had around 60-70 pax. Not so bad still but observed
              opposite direction most buses had &lt;20 pax. Also note frequency
              has reduced. Is 960 still operating with 30-32 buses? I doubt
              so.</p>
              <p>700 - frequency around 10-16 mins. Buses had seated loading
              around 40-50 pax per bus.</p>

              <p>190 &amp; 972 got good loadings despite reducing 1 duty each(Less bunchings).700 i only managed to see Kjdep buses so far..Only peak hours can see standees.960 i also dont think got 31 buses its more like 28-29 buses with at least 10-11 SDs runnings.171 loadings from Bt Timah to Orchard also not that high.From Yishun to Bukit Panjang still maintain high loadings especially peak hours.167 now quite stable with an additional of another Amdep full day duty but peak hours continue to struggling due to no high capacity buses.</p>

              <p>sv 23 has heavy loading but not so heavy that you cannot board. There is a sv 23 DD every 08-10 mins and if the one you are boarding is too crowded, there maybe one just 2-3 mins behind and you will guaranteed find a seat. Happens usually because sv 23 is a loop service.</p>
              <p>It is extremely rare to wait for 40 mins, maybe impacted by accident or something. sv 23 usually is quite reliable. Moreover, it is full fleet DD. What more can you ask!! :)</p>

              <p>Maybe the opening of DTL3 (Geylang Bahru) may help to alleviate the loading.</p>
              <p>Would there be any incentive for 5, 59, 506 to stop at either of the Jln Kolam Ayer stops, perhaps as a link to Toa Payoh and/or Bedok Reservoir? Or would it be unnecessary due to DTL3?</p>

                          <p>Actually SBST has slowed down upgrading/adding buses on
                          services. Hardly any in the last quarter. Most services in my
                          opinion are quite okay. The ones where I personally feel some
                          upgrades (not fleet add) is required are:</p>
                          <p>5</p>
                          <p>30</p>

                      <p>Actually, I feel that most SBST bus services have just about the right capacity, so no need to enhance, unless got new residential development or something along the route.</p>
                          
                          <p>So, actually, bus services like 5, 109, 111 and 181 do need fleet add.</p>
                          <p>Whereas for 30, the only new area I know is those at Taman Jurong, but then I think 49 has already provided provisions for that, so no need for any fleet-add.</p>
                          
                          <p>Nonetheless, I agree that bus services like 43 and 103 may need fleet add in future.</p>

              <p>But overall 190 and 972 had much higher loading than 23 (before DTL2) and that's one of the reasons why they have more robust frequencies. Another would be the complaints by netizens who waited for 14 buses before successfully boarding 190.</p>
              <p>And 190 still had many rigids in its fleet even before DTL which kind of boosted its frequency...</p>

              <p>Interestingly, 79 pax alighted from Boon Lay Way to Jurong West Ave 1 while only 80 pax were onboard after Shenton Way. While there may still be some pax who boarded at IMM Â / Toh Guan and alighted at Jurong East/West Ave 1, to me it shows that 502 mainly caters to Jurong East (at best until Boon Lay Gardens) residents to CBD, not really Jurong West.Â </p>
              <p>On the other hand 502 also works well as a townlink service between Jurong East and Jurong West...</p>

              <p>Yes sv 23 is doing v well. But on most buses people can board, except for few cases. What you observed is the highest peak at Infeon between 6-7pm. Loading drops after that.Â </p>
              <p>What the other user said about poor frequency was an exagerration. Clearly if 6 buses in 42 mins, then the avg frequency is 07 mins.</p>

              <p>That why i went down to observe yesterday... not so many ppl at infenion bus stop. max around 10 who board 23.. there are alway heavy traffic along serangoon road during this evening peak which caused the frequency to vary.. and esp at the junction of macpherson/upper serangoon/PIE.. that is a real messy junction...

              Library, Tampines North, Pasir Ris that would have got good
              intra-town connectivity (rather than just duplicating 291 to
              interchange)</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, yes I agree. There are some who always take from sengkang int to compassvale street Blk 291A and Punggol road Blk 298 bus stops which I witnessed before. For those who do not know yet, the tenants list for compass one mall has been partially released online. Some are new and some are the previous tenants and some duplicate the tenants for waterway point. Nonetheless, this area used to have very high crowd due to not much places for shopping in northeast. Note some condos and HDB flats just opposite has already been completed. Whenever a mall is constructed in these areas, it draws high capacity demand. Examples are seletar mall, waterway point and also the recently renovated rivervale plaza. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
