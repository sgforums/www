              <p><strong>DTL3 Loading Analysis</strong></p>
              <p>5: Loading has dropped significantly throughout the route. Peak loading now is between Trellis towers and Toa Payoh.</p>
              <p>8: Loading has dropped along DTL segment. Still good loading between TPY and Macpherson and between Tampines Ave 1 (Temasek) and Tampines Ave 2 (Tampines East CC)</p>
              <p>18: Loading has improved. Can see around 50+ pax on svc 18 during peak hours. Pre-DTL days and route modification, most svc 18 buses would find it difficult to hit 50 pax during peak hours</p>
              <p>21: Loading still quite high between Whompoa and Geylang. Otherwise loading can be managed by SD.</p>
              <p>22: Decent loading, quite a bit of impact between Tampines and UBI on account of DTL</p>
              <p>23: Loading has dropped significantly. Still can see some DDs packed but gone are those days where every DD on 23 used to carry 80-100 pax between Kallang Bahru and Bedok North.</p>
              <p>28: Loading has significantly dropped between Bedok MRT and Tampines, though loading is still high between SAFRA and st 45. </p>
              <p>46: Loading has picked up after opening of DTL3. Still does not warrant DDs. </p>
              <p>58: Loading continues to be high between UBI and Tai Seng and Eunos Link, but has dropped significantly in Kaki Bukit estate. Loading also seems to have dropped towards Pasir Ris (shouldn't have given that 58 does not duplicate DTL3).</p>
              <p>59: Loading has dropped along DTL3 sector, but is fiercely high between Tampines East CC and Changi Village during AM and also between Toa Payoh and Kaki Bukit. DDs are still doing well.</p>
              <p>60: Once a super DD service is now manageable by SDs. Frequency continues to be excellent with DDs. I don't see the need for so many DDs or at least can convert few DDs to SDs. DTL has taken away a major chunk of load from this service</p>
              <p>61: Route has been impacted by DTL3. The DD worthy loading between Kallang - Macpherson - UBI - Eunos is now strictly SD. </p>
              <p>63/M: Loading continues to be high along UBI estate in spite of introduction of 137. A bit surprising, isn't it?</p>
              <p>64: Heavy loading continues to be in Little India area. Not much change</p>
              <p>65: Loading has dropped. Heavy loading continues between River Valley - Orchard, Orchard - Little India, post which loading is SD worthy.</p>
              <p>66: Loading has dropped throughout the route. Frequency can be reduced, too.</p>
              <p>67: Loading is super high between Little India &amp; Geylang. Especially weekends, every bus has 90-100 pax. Almost all buses on weekends are DDs, except for 4 SDs. Loading quite poor from Little India to CCK. Loading also has dropped between Bedok and Tampines.</p>

              <p>For (3), (9) I presume you mean 187. </p>
              <p>(1) (2) probably best explain your observations as the bulk of the loading will be going towards the CBD or a transport node (e.g. Stevens). I think not so much for Woodlands?</p>
              <p>(6) is likely not the case for Senja residents, where they can cross over easily to Woodlands Rd;</p>
              <p>(9) Depending on specific area, transferring 176 may be better for Bt Batok, and 180 for Boon Lay</p>

              <p>Don't think 5's loading patterns have changed much, and 'dropped significantly' is abit of an overstatement in my opinion because 5 still gets decent loading along its non-DTL parallel sectors, especially Jln Toa Payoh and Novena, though I would agree its loading in the eastern portion has taken quite a dip.</p>
              <p>As for 63, loading between Macpherson and Bugis/Chinatown has decreased considerably since DTL can get you to these areas in just under 15 mins. </p>
              <p>Agree with your analysis on 65, living near River Valley area where 65 plies, I get quite surprised when I see 65 DDs running 'empty' along Bedok Reservoir when I travel to the east lol.</p>

              <p>1) 15 hasn't been impacted as much though the crazy loading has tapered off. 87 has been impacted between Kaki Bukit and Bedok MRT. Guess, many are now taking DTL3 and hence are not taking 87 to Bedok MRT for transfer. </p>
              <p>2) 137 is doing well as expected because of its DTL feeder type of service. The route could have been further enhanced by having it stop at Eunos Link for transfer purpose, likewise at Kaki Bukit CC. 137 loading is strictly SD loading except for few slots where it has DD worthy loading between Bedok North Estate and Bedok North MRT and within Kaki Bukit North estate. A fantastic service launched with an immature route planning. Could have easily been a higher utility service if end to end route was planned well.</p>
              <p>3) 140 loading is quite respectable for its short route. Can get around 50 pax and good boarding/alighting. I am sure it is quite a profitable route.</p>
              <p>4) 293 east loading has split between the two stations. Loading still high because of new flats TOP last year end. 293 frequency at 03 minutes is a bit of a killer. </p>
              <p>5) 9, 19 etc. have always had good loading and continues to. svc 9 should get some SD -&gt; DD conversion. It is always svc 19 that gets all the upgrades.</p>
              <p>6) 20 has lost some loading. Doesnt have the crazy 100+ pax loading from Simei anymore. Around 60-75 pax on most timings. Though at Expo another 25-30 pax board, bringing it to around 80-100 pax. Hence, the DDs are still required. </p>
              <p>7) 69/118 loading has increased because of DTL3. 118 loading was always high but every DD these days has 100+ pax loading. </p>

              <p>292's loading continue to increase. But, 292 got to wait for Tampines Court to vacate on December 12 then the loading will be lowered back.</p>
              <p>518's loading has saw a dip due to DTL3, the direct link to Promenade.</p>

              <p>Don't think 5's loading patterns have changed much, and 'dropped
              significantly' is abit of an overstatement in my opinion because 5
              still gets decent loading along its non-DTL parallel sectors,
              especially Jln Toa Payoh and Novena, though I would agree its
              loading in the eastern portion has taken quite a dip.</p>
              <p>As for 63, loading between Macpherson and Bugis/Chinatown has
              decreased considerably since DTL can get you to these areas in just
              under 15 mins. </p>
              <p>Agree with your analysis on 65, living near River Valley area
              where 65 plies, I get quite surprised when I see 65 DDs running
              'empty' along Bedok Reservoir when I travel to the east lol.</p>

              <p>Yes, the loading for 63 decreases because it is more direct from Bugis, and Chinatown, along the DTL1 loop, then going to DTL3.</p>

              <p>For (3), (9) I presume you mean 187. </p>
              <p>(1) (2) probably best explain your observations as the bulk of
              the loading will be going towards the CBD or a transport node (e.g.
              Stevens). I think not so much for Woodlands?</p>
              <p>(6) is likely not the case for Senja residents, where they can
              cross over easily to Woodlands Rd;</p>
              <p>(9) Depending on specific area, transferring 176 may be better
              for Bt Batok, and 180 for Boon Lay</p>

              <p>Well, you have actually read what I have written so it's good :)</p>
              <p>I realised I made some errors. It should be 187 and not 178. It should not be Upper Bukit Timah road but Woodlands road as name changes on the other side of MRT. </p>

              <p>I like how use "fiercely high" when describing 59... quite taken
              aback XD</p>
              <p>what abt ur opinions of 292 and 518, as mentioned by Timothy,
              and also am wondering how loadings has changed for CT18?</p>

              <p>518 loading is v unpredictable; was unpredictable before DTL3 also. </p>
              <p>292 loading hasn't changed much. 292 never had too high loading in first place and still a lot of people take it from Tampines inner estate to MRT, Tampines Hub and other amenities along Tampines Central.</p>
              <p>59 loading is quite high. It picks up along ave 2 for Loyang industrial in AM, and in spite of 9, around 30-40 pax board at Tampines East CC/Tampines East MRT. </p>
