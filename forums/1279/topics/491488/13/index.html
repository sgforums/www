              <p>Btw has 117 helped to relieve 103 given that it now enters West
              Camp and enters Yishun? It should not be a problem since the bus
              service has lots of Wrights</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>117 only helps towards Yishun with small effect. Towards Serangoon, 117 has no help despite it arriving 1 min before 103. Therefore, 103 should be getting more Wrights than 117 as 117 demand is not relatively high in that "peak" sector</p>

              <p>* sv 43 loading between Punggol and NEX was <strong>lower </strong>than my expectation</p>
              <p>* Loading picked up along Paya Lebar Road and 52 pax went beyond Paya Lebar MRT, yet 43 as a SD would also be able to take everyone at Paya Lebar Road</p>
              <p>* Highest loading comes at Paya Lebar MRT, where the bus arrived at its peak loading time, and had 49 pax boarding inspit of a 134 and 135 being 04 mins in front. Clearly, there were 1-2 MRTs that caused this loading. </p>
              <p>* Looking at the loading during peak hours, seems like 43 is managing the load quite okay inspite of 76 removed</p>
              <p>* Need to observe more but this is the peak hour loading for today.</p>

              I was waiting for bus service 43 at YCK road towards Punggol for 15 minutes. SBS6826X (shift 1A, last trip) arrived at 13:45, 7 mins behind schedule, almost full, and surprisingly, crowds of about 30-40 people rushed to board the bus even though it was only 13:45.
              
              Some pax initially wanted to board, but did not board eventually. I was one of the last in the queue, but still managed to board. The Citaro somehow managed to squeeze 45 standing pax (total 80 pax). When the BC closed the doors, I was trapped by the doors behind me, and a girl carrying her school bag in front of me.
              
              The bus was full throughout the journey, even after I alighted. The loading on this timeslot is enough to warrant DDs almost every time I take the bus at this time slot.
              
              However, when I alighted, I was shocked to find SBS6104X on 43M (shift 90A, last trip) behind, with all seats occupied but still rather empty, with SBS3004X on 102 in between!
              
              If SBS3004X was the bus on 43, no pax would have been left behind, but the DD will still be full, from my observations of the number of pax left behind!
              
              Also, almost every trip of shift 90A/95P on 43M is enough to warrant DDs. But, in today's special case, it was rather empty because SBS6826X was very late.

              <p>* Bus in front (43M): 04 min, 43: 14 min (checked at Buangkok
                  Green)</p>
              <p>* At Paya Lebar MRT, bus in front: 43 (13 min), 135 (04 min),
                  134 (04 min)</p>
              <p>* sv 43 loading between Punggol and NEX was
                  <strong>lower</strong> than my expectation</p>
              <p>* Loading picked up along Paya Lebar Road and 52 pax went beyond
                  Paya Lebar MRT, yet 43 as a SD would also be able to take everyone
                  at Paya Lebar Road</p>
              <p>* Highest loading comes at Paya Lebar MRT, where the bus arrived
                  at its peak loading time, and had 49 pax boarding inspit of a 134
                  and 135 being 04 mins in front. Clearly, there were 1-2 MRTs that
                  caused this loading. </p>
              <p>* Looking at the loading during peak hours, seems like 43 is
                  managing the load quite okay inspite of 76 removed</p>
              <p>* Need to observe more but this is the peak hour loading for
                  today.</p>

              <p>Isn't this SBS3459S slot? It is scheduled just 5 minutes after SBS3448Z. How can the bus in front be 13 minutes ahead?</p>
              <p>(This is for weekday schedule.)</p>

              <p>It is actually not that difficult on a DD, if you are counting from the lower deck.</p>
              <p>You should always start counting from the interchange for DDs.</p>

              <p>Counting on DDs and SDs is not difficult at all. The one which I have not been able to master after several attempts is counting on bendy bus. I have always failed and my accuracy is not so great. </p>
