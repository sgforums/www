              <p>If you see array's loading analysis, the loading is same as I have reported, no difference. Consistent &lt;20 pax until the bus hits 291 loading area. Ofcourse from the loading you can see that 291 had not called the stop, so 46 got very high loading. But 291s frequency is 3-5 mins with DDs. It could be possible that this particular bus was delayed.</p>
              <p>So had a 291 come in time which it does on most times, 46 would not have gone with more than 20-25 pax as I have reported during evening peak hours.</p>

              <p>I would like to confess that I only observed 46 once, on weekends.</p>
              <p>Probably because BA's analysis was against peak hour's flow of traffic (5.40pm towards Tampines). Or it could be that 46 has greater demand on weekends.</p>

              <p>I think the main objective of 46 is just to connect Tampines and Bedok residents to DTL3, so it was planned to achieve maximum catchment in Bedok, and hence, the Bedok South Ave 3 sector. That's why it's impossible for 46 to reach CBP.</p>

              <p>629 - unknown rigid - 54 pax (long snaking queue)</p>
              <p>632 - 1158e - 81 pax (+03 mins, bendy)</p>
              <p>641 - 5902A - 117 pax ( +09 mins, A95)... thought this is 965 perm</p>
              <p>648 - 1169z - 88 pax (+07 mins, bendy)</p>
              <p>659 - 5896J - 124 pax (+11 mins, A95)</p>
              <p>703 - 317Y - 45 pax (+04 mins, rigid)... around 40 pax in queue who chose not to board</p>
              <p>710 - 5892U - 89 pax (+07 mins, A95).. around 30 pax still in queue</p>
              <p>** <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Is A95 able to take in more pax than other DDs (E500s, B9TLs)? After the two A95s took 117 and 124 pax, there still seemed space for another few. How?</span></p>
              <p>** Clearly, people don't want to stand and prefer to queue for the next bus. Was quite evident with the rigids, but somehow were okay to cramp into a DD. Weird?</p>
              <p>** Again, rigids at these timing is a disaster. My frustration was even higher because I was seeing empty 293 DDs and 46 DDs</p>

              <p>* The loading was better this time because somehow the buses were late after 646pm. This was evident because I could see a bus departing every 03-04 mins and back to back from the 293 berth towards st 45. 3 DDs observed during this period must have taken less than 30 pax so also the SDs</p>

              <p>Why would anyone alight at Pioneer to go to st 81 when there is 243G/W from interchange at every 03-04 mins, while 258 frequency is 10-14 mins. Moreover, they have to travel one MRT further. Those 3 pax boarding maybe transfer pax from 179/192/256 or from the food court there.</p>
              <p>Interesting to note is around 25-30 pax from Joo Koon area take it direct to JW district, which shows 258 is serving a good need. Hence, my proposal to merge 256 and 258 will work well and boost 2 non performing services. </p>

              <p>I suppose you're right about 243 being a choice alternative than 258 to Street 81 though my thoughts is that people would take 258 as an alternative to 243G/W as well as people who transferred from other services at Pioneer, on past observations. I noted an average 10-12 pax from Pioneer to St 81 (the day before I noted about 13 pax taking the 7:45pm+ bus towards St 81)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with your 258 expansion/merger, while the distance might be slightly longer, it can help to give the residents of St 71/81 a direct service to Pioneer Road North factories as well as Joo Koon Int</p>

              <p>Tanah Merah MRT -- 65 (-29/12) <em>sv 38 SD right in front</em></p>
              <p>Bedok South Ave 3 -- 65 (-2/2)</p>
              <p>Bedok South Road -- 62 (-4/1), 52 (-13/3), 50 (-5/3), 47 (-6/3)</p>
              <p>Bedok South Ave 1 -- 49 (0/2), 44 (-5/0)</p>
              <p><em>sv 36 turns right in front</em></p>
              <p>Marine Parade Road -- 39 (-5/0), 34 (-5/0), 34 (0/0), 24 (-10/0), 24 (0/0), 19 (-5/0), 18 (-1/0), 19 (0/1), 17 (-5/3), 15 (-13/11) <em>Parkway Parade. I alighted here.</em></p>
              <p>* DD loading between CBP and Tanah Merah with 48/55 seats occupied</p>
              <p>* At Tanah Merah only 29 pax alighted while 53 were still on board with around 38 pax on upper deck</p>
              <p>* As mentioned before between Tanah Merah and Parkway Parade, way too many buses and wasted resources.</p>
              <p>* sv 38 was right in front, hence loading at TNM MRT on sv 47 was poor. Had sv 47 come before, loading would be more than 70 pax</p>
              <p>* sv 36 turned at Marine Parade road and took all pax towards Parkway Parade. Behind 47 was also 197 that had between 20-30 pax</p>
              <p>* Total pax alighting/boarding along Bedok South Road = (-28/10). 47 does provide unique connection between Bedok South and Marine Parade Road</p>
              <p>* Total pax alighting/boarding along Marine Parade Road (before Parkway Parade) = (-31/4). Marine Parade really needs some rationalization</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>47 doing pretty well between CBP and Bedok South, providing unique connection to Marine Parade from Bedok South. Marine Parade response is poor but this is almost for all services today given the high number of buses.</p>
              <p>DDs still doing okay on 47 compared to many other services such as 41, 46 and 117</p>

              <p>Taken it during PM peak, the time when CBP offices leave. The buses usually between 6-7pm from CBP on 47 are quite crowded. From Tanah Merah onwards, too many buses so almost all buses go with lukewarm response.</p>
              <p>Even sv 31 loading is only between ITE and Tanah Merah/Tampines. After Tanah Merah/Bedok, 31 also goes with 30-40 pax only, till it hits Lor 1/Boon Keng towards TPY. </p>

              <p>Ofcourse la. If 41 comes before 183 along Toh Guan, it is bound to get crowded. </p>
              <p>I have a different logic to assess this which I have repeated before. Just because 143M comes before 143/79 and gets crowded or 46 comes before 291 and gets crowded, does not mean these services have good loading.</p>
              <p>If 41 comes after 183, 46 comes after 291 or 143M comes after 79/143, they will go almost empty. </p>
              <p>It has merit if even after 183 has called, 41 gets crowded, then it truly means that there is more demand at Toh Guan.</p>
              <p>The purpose of 41 when launched was to connect Beauty World to Toh Guan Estate and Industrial Complex. But surprisingly when I observed 2 months back, the loading to/from DTL2 is quite low. The frequency of 41 is around 12-16 mins, yet only around 30-40 pax. Unless it has changed in 2 months, then let me know.</p>
              <p><strong>Just to clarify: </strong>I do think sv 41 route is good as it provides new connection between Toh Guan and Beauty World. Just that they need to make few changes like extending 52 to Boon Lay and 105 direct to Bukit Batok given that there are way too many services to JE (41, 52, 105, 183, 333, 990).</p>

                  <p>* Spoke to the BC. He said it is this pattern since bus launch.
                  Say he not know why DD deploy  on this route and was laughing.
                  Say bus get more pax only to Tampines interchange but leave mostly
                  with less than 5 pax from Tampines. But he agreed when I said that
                  if there is 291 in front, there won't be anyone boarding to
                  Tampines also. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Such a waste
                  of resources.</span></strong></p>

                  <p>This is called "anticipate future and stay relevant", which is one of the principles of governance. When the DTL 3 opens next year, this bus service may receive high loadings.</p>
