There is quite good loading between BBT and JE/JW towns as well. </p>

              <p>Just saw TIB987K's post in press release on the operating dates of 405 and 130A. While i've not taken these 2 services (But does 405M count? coz i joyrode it last time :p), im pretty curious how their loading level is, and any possiblity of having 130A being withdrawn in the future? Maybe someone could shed some light on this issue? Thanks</p>

              <p>The reason of horrible loading is not because of DTL2, is because those are rich estates, and the salary cost is more than $50,000; meant to cover cost. Probably all the ministers stay there, Goh Chok Tong and Tony Tan had gave up the car and take DTL2 which is quite good.</p>

                                                      makers...only a few people (around 30) actually take 170 everyday
                                                      to get from Larkin Bus Terminal to Singapore..." I admit i
                                                       cannot physically be present at the checkpoint to observe
                                                      this but at least make comments that make sense like carbikebus.
                                                      And here are the reasons why:</p>
                      <p>1. If u talk abt people commuting to Singapore daily, workers
                                                      have their blue Bas Pekerja/Bas Kilang and students have their
                                                      orange Bas Sekolah, and the fact that it is also not convenient for
                                                      commuters to transfer at Larkin to get out of Singapore, so yes,
                                                      maybe can remove. --&gt; But bear in mind, the freq of 170 is at
                                                      abt 10-15 min per bus, so that stretch frm JB CIQ to larkin with
                                                      standees is justified. Plus, there are also crucial bus services at
                                                      Larkin (other than express bus services in case udk)</p>
                      <p>2. Have you seen how hectic it gets especially it gets to
                                                      important festive seasons like CNY and hari raya? Yes we have
                                                      alternatives (CW1,2, SJE), but 170 is still favoured by many due to
                                                      its cleanliness, reliablity, and convenience (yes, surprisingly
                                                      even when ppl are in Malaysia). And we are not talking abt
                                                      practicality, we are talking abt favourism. Commuters dun talk abt
                                                      practicality, they think abt favourism. Its literally hell in case
                                                      you havent been there yet. (Consider this: long queues for 170X at
                                                      Kranji MRT, but not as much for CW1. Why?)</p>
                      <p>Yes i agree with you that the loop at JB Sentral is redundant,
                                                      but personally I think this is the best way: 170X will still
                                                      continue to go to JB Sentral as well as 160. Reason being some 170X
                                                      shifts can convert to 170 and proceed to Larkin aft clearing JB
                                                      Customs, and the fact that 160 freq is also poor, it shldnt be a
                                                      prob ferrying those 1 or 2 lazy ppl to JB Sentral. 950, like what
                                                      carbike bus mentioned, shld go to Larkin. And yes, 170X needs
                                                      parking lots, and i mentioned b4 there ought to be a proper ter to
                                                      house 170X and CW1 to handle the mess and danger everytime at that
                                                      bus stop (yes dangerous, literally. 925 long queues and crowd and
                                                      buses cutting in to the bus stop dangerously. Chaotic). I wont
                                                      agree to you 170M idea thou.</p>

                      <p>I am aware of the local bus routes that originate at Larkin Bus Terminal and provide bus service for the surrounding areas. There are routes that connect to the Johor Bahru Checkpoint, and 170 is one of them. The other ones I know are CW1 and CW2 operated by Causeway Link.</p>
                      <p>I have observed before the loading on bus service 170 in Johor Bahru, at around 6:20am. There were only a handful of people taking the bus to Larkin Bus Terminal, and around 10-15 of them taking the bus to the Johor Bahru Checkpoint.</p>
                      <p>(For more information, read <a href="/forums/1279/topics/491488?page=39#post_11215245"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">the article I wrote at page 39 of this thread</span></span></strong></a>.)</p>
                      <p>I understand this may not be the accurate representation of the passenger volume on bus service 170 during morning peak hours, as the service begins in 5:20am and I was only able to observe the loading at around 6:20am, when most of the people at Larkin would have already reached the Causeway, to avoid getting caught in the jam on the Causeway to Singapore.</p>
                      <p>Anyway, considering there are around 11 trips made to and from Larkin Bus Terminal between 5:30am and 8:30am, and assuming the number of people on each trip is about the same, the total number of people using bus service 170 during morning peak hours should be around 33 towards Larkin, and 150 from Larkin.</p>
                      <p>Previously, I figured out that the cost of operating a public bus service is around $4 per kilometre. Considering a trip from Johor Bahru Checkpoint to Larkin Bus Terminal and back spans 14.2km, a trip like this costs around $56.80 to operate.</p>
                      <p>With an average of 16 people per trip, the amount of fare revenue generated is only $18.56. A loss of $38.24 is incurred per trip, which is equivalent to 67.32% of the operating cost. And this is during peak hours. Imagine the amount of loss incurred during other hours of the day, on usual days when very few holiday makers use Larkin Bus Terminal? The loss could be around 130% of the operating cost, which is obviously not sustainable.</p>
                      <p>In view of the other bus services that provide the connection between Larkin Bus Terminal and the Johor Bahru Checkpoint, it may be better to withdraw our bus service 170 from Larkin Bus Terminal, and shorten the route to Johor Bahru Checkpoint.</p>
                      <p>I do not know about the bus fare on the other bus routes, but considering the highest bus fare I paid for a ride on a local bus route was five Ringgit ($1.67), I am sure the price should be about the same as our bus service 170 ($1.16), or lower than that.</p>
                      <p>With regards to bus service CW1 operated by Causeway Link, there are also many people taking that bus to Singapore from the Johor Bahru Checkpoint. If there is less people taking the Causeway Link bus services as compared to bus service 160 and 170, it could be due to the lack of awareness of the Causeway Link services.</p>
                      <p>As for the congestion at the Causeway and Checkpoints, I know how it feels to get caught in a jam that is barely moving. Recently, our government announced that it will increase the capacity of the Woodlands Checkpoint. This is on top of the upcoming MRT line which will run between Woodlands North, Singapore and Bukit Chagar, Malaysia. The traffic congestion problem would be resolved once these projects are completed.</p>
                      <p>But for now, the only way to avoid the jam on the causeway is to travel during non-peak hours - either very early in the morning, very late at night, before 10am (to Johor Bahru), or 10am to 4pm (to Singapore).</p>
