            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand the good intentions behind such a move. Certainly we, as commuters, have benefitted much from it.<br><br>However, bus routes are subject to amendment at a moment's notice. Today, this stretch of road has one bus service. Tomorrow, it may be gone. This results in bus shelters falling into disuse. What's more, some of these shelters have already been upgraded, with fluorescent lights and illuminated advertising panels.<br><br>Three of them come to mind: Ex-103 bus stop @ Neil Rd, one @ BDK Sth Ave 2 and ex-3 bus stop @ PSR St 71. It is still possible for the second one to be put back to good use if 38 could ply the aforesaid stretch in the direction towards BDK (after all, 3 plies a different route towards TAM). As for the other highlighted stops, I don't know what is best for them.<br><br>It does make me question at times whether the cost of upgrading bus shelters is justified under such circumstances whereby bus services can be re-routed with such ease.<br><br>What do the rest think?</div>
