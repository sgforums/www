            <div class='col-md body'>i have noted from some of the members from sg bus forum that the waiting times for trans-island 852  is very long ,sometimes reaching to 30minutes at night. .i believed that there is a shortage of buses  for 852.that just one of the reasons probably.so anyone knows what could the reasons why the long wait for 852?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not sure if that's only pertaining to TIBS 852, or it is applicable to most TIBS services. I always feels that most TIBS services do not have high frequencies. At least for TIBS 75, 77, 970, 61 and 106 that ply along Holland Rd or Holland Ave. At times the waiting times can be unbearable.<br><br>The waiting times for SMRT trains are getting longer, I believe it is part of their cost cutting measures. Perhaps someone can tell me if that affects TIBS services as well?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i also have noticed that.. it has been so since long time ago.. actually i've taken down the arrival times of 852 at a certain bus stop along Bt Timah Rd cos i used to go there quite often and back home on 852.. i realised that most of the time it adhered to the 13-17 mins overhead at night towards last bus but on some weekdays one of the bus (except the last bus) would go missing so i ended up waiting for close to half an hour.. maybe they thought no ppl taking 852 so late.. i'm not sure if this is company policy or, worse still, drivers' policy..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think even if a certain bus route is not profitable,at least keep to the maximum 15mins.also,i find that sometimes a bus is waited more than 30mins is because the previous driver drive too fast ,resulting in the next bus waiting time longer.somemore so if the bus route has a at least 15mins per bus waiting times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For much of 2000-2002, i had to endure a 11mins wait each morning during morning peak hour while going to school, and when the train came it was packed like siao, but students still bang and crash in to further increase the pax density like siao.....<br><br>Now, the frequencies during non-peak hours is the same for both SMRT and SBST at 7 mins. In fact, SBST NEL frequency is fixed at 7mins for dunno how long, and SMRT can have frequencies of 8-9mins for the same time period.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, you are talking about my territory down here......852 is my service..i take it every day to school..<br><br>Yes, the frequency had gone from bad to worse after AMK got full control. At nights, it is very possible to wait for 30mins for a single svc 852. TIBS also luv to cram their buses during the student peak by deploying a bus only every 11-12mins in the morning.<br><br>In the afternoon, it is quite common to see buses leaving empty from Yishun, so maybe thats why the freq is so shitty at 17mins per bus!!!<br><br>Moreover, Svc 852 is a predominantly school service, hence TIBS also stinge on the frequency and the quality of the buses used. Now i even suspect they are stinging on the refrigerant for the airconditioners.............DAMN TIBS!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the NEL frequency i have done up a chart before to do estimated time of arrival (ETA) system but that was when it started not too long ago so it's about a year by now.. from my observations (DBG STN) it's 8 mins in the morning until about 6.15am then 6.5 mins all the way (very very accurate if there's no incidents cos it's computer-controlled) until about 10pm except morning peak (8am-9.15am) and evening peak (5pm-6.45pm) where it's 5mins.. after 10pm trains are slowly pulled out of service and frequency is lengthened to a max of 9.5 mins until the interval of second last train and last train is ~13mins.. so ppl hardly have to wait for more than 6.5mins for a train unless it's very early or very late..<br><br>and by the way, for the "Train Approaching" movie when the ETA is 1min, the train usually arrives within 30secs (not counting braking time cos SMRT trains brake slower)..<br><br>SMRT is much better than NEL from what i see.. for NSL where i stay along, it has achieved 2 mins headway in the morning peak (7.45am-9am) and evening peak (5pm-6.45pm) and for other normal times (before 10pm) a maximum of 7-8 mins.. the only complain is that morning school crowd peak (5.45am-7am) the freq. is still 7-8mins.. thus, for Orchard Stn (NSL) it is very common to see "7mins", but that means your train just left, pal..;-).. i'd be surprised to see anything "8mins" or more on NSL unless it's early morning or late night..</div>

You can try waiting in the aftrnoon from 1200-1600, and perhaps u will be very surprised that the NSL freq is 7 mins per train. On non-peak days like sunday, it is entirely possible to wait 8 mins for a train on average. In fact, the train freq during weekdays from 0630-0700 is about 7-9mins if u had observed at Yishun.<br><br>I just don't understand why people discriminate against SBST.....and well, just as many people love TIBS for dunnoe wad reason, i don't like TIBS . Just look at their shitty feeder service planning.</div>
