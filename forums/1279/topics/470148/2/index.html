              <p>the old 141 never go to toa payoh rise. and toa payoh rise road was in the 70s and 80s link to the toa payoh hospital which is history. so the road was a small one way road link to car park. and the old 141 before the old bus interchange was bulided, it  passed by kim keat ave which is now a small road link to hdb car park, rangoon road on the way to shenton way (CBD area). the NEW 141 has part of the older 141 route included. maybe due to poor demand the older 141 service was removed.</p>
              <p>when the interchange was bulid 141 come back and change to express service to serve toa payoh to robinson road (CBD area) before MRT started to operate.</p>
              <p>I do not try to play politics, I just said it is the transport system a bit mess up because of very poor planing by transport ministry under MR yeo and MR ma when MRT system first started. goverment force people to take MRT so that MRT can made profit and remove some bus service without thinking. express 141 was one of them. </p>
              <p>57 is not under the LTA plan but under SBST. SBST bring back some of the route by the old 146 and 141 to serve people. maybe to try to reduce MRT work load, but it is a good service as demand is good all the time and help 56 to reduce work load also. and at least mrt break down toa payoh and bishan has a direct service to CBD area.</p>
              <p>Maybe because of it past that why LTA name the new service 141 again so that old folks can take the new service without problem remembering the number.    </p>

              <p>It is numbered 141 because it just makes sense. It starts from Toa Payoh, where you have svc 139, 142, 143, 145. The options were either 140, 141 or 144. Considering that the route is parallel to 131 between Thomson and Farrer and 131 also goes to Owen / Kentish, 141 is the right choice.</p>

              <p>I am not too sure. If at all, 141 will help to relieve the load on 131 between Pei Ko Estate and Novena MRT. Just gives people another option to MRT.</p>

              31 this number came from MRT rationalisation.. w/ merger of Sv 149 into Sv 31. So the original bus Sv no is 149.
              
              Sv 8 was an entirely new service in 1989.
              
              Sv 88 came in 1998...
              
              14X, 15X era bus svs was from 1970s, 1980s era... 14X &amp; 15X number heading were allocated to Toa Payoh Svs originally...

              <p>Owen road along with Race course road used to be a continuous straight road until each road broke into 2 parts due to NEL Farrer Park MRT.</p>
