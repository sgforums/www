              <p>Yes.  The OM 447 hLA and OM 457 hLA engines have high torque output even at engine speeds close to idle.  High torque (pulling power) is critical for acceleration with a full bus load of passengers.</p>

              <p>The Scania DC9 engine has a very wide band of engine speeds where maximum torque is available.  Maximum torque of the base-model (DC9 16 230 Euro 4) engine is 1050Nm @ 1100-1500rpm.  The engine runs optimally at engine speeds between 1100rpm and 1700rpm although quite often the maximum engine speed is limited by transmission settings.</p>
              <p>In contrast, the engines in the Volvo B10Ms have a very narrow band of engine speeds where maximum torque is available.  The THD102KF has 1050Nm (same as the DC9 16 230) but maximum torque is available only at 1400rpm.  The torque curve drops substantially below and above 1400rpm.  In order to obtain the best acceleration from the THD102KF, the driver needs to use the power of the engine and allow engine revs to remain high.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply, Dave.</p>
              <p>I did not take note of the current B10M torque band when I was with SBS. Are you referring to the THD101GC instead? Because I do experience pretty good acceleration from 1200 rpm for the THD102KF. In fact many drivers hardly drive at higher revs, unless overtaking or overcoming steep slopes with heavy loads, or just to have some fun.</p>
              <p>The THD101GC engine of earlier B10M indeed require reving due to narrower power bands.</p>
              <p> According to the Scania website, the K230UB maximum power is attained at 1800rpm, which means that the ZF gearbox should upshift at 1800rpm at maximum acceleration. I think I can safely assume that the acceleration for the K230UB should be better than the B10M at narrower gear ratios and same torque ratings.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that city driving, power band should be wide. It makes driving more pleasurable.</p>
              <p>So the only thing that can get in the way of better acceleration is the unladen weight. Do you agree?</p>

              <p>At 220KW, it should be one of the most powerful engine to be used in a rigid single decker city bus, especially in SG roads. Wonder why the use of such a powerful engine.</p>
              <p>Usually high powered engines are used for long distance overland travelling whereby buses hit around 100km/h to 140km/h.</p>
              <p>I assume the unladen weight of the OC500LE is around 11 ton. Coupled the engine with the ZF gearbox, I believe the acceleration can be quite blistering.</p>

              <p>The OM 457 hLA (as well as the previous OM 447 hLA) is quite a good engine.  The 220kW version used on SMRT's OC 500 LEs develops a whopping 1000Nm already at 600rpm (idle speed) and over 1100Nm by 800rpm.  Mercedes-Benz diesel engine have traditionally featured very flat torque curves for the best driveability.</p>

              <p>At 220KW, it should be the most powerful engine to be used in a rigid single decker city bus, especially in SG roads. Wonder why the use of such a powerful engine.</p>
              <p>Usually high powered engines are used for long distance overland travelling whereby buses hit around 100km/h to 140km/h.</p>
              <p>I assume the unladen weight of the OC500LE is around 11 ton. Coupled the engine with the ZF gearbox, I believe the acceleration can be quite blistering.</p>

              <p>I did not take note of the current B10M torque band when I was
                  with SBS. Are you referring to the THD101GC instead? Because I do
                  experience pretty good acceleration from 1200 rpm for the THD102KF.
                  In fact many drivers hardly drive at higher revs, unless overtaking
                  or overcoming steep slopes with heavy loads, or just to have some
                  fun.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I have found that the THD102KF isn't as good as previous generations.  The THD100D (used on Volvo B58s, B59s and early model B10Ms) was the best.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p> According to the Scania website, the K230UB maximum power
                  is attained at 1800rpm, which means that the ZF gearbox should
                  upshift at 1800rpm at maximum acceleration. I think I can safely
                  assume that the acceleration for the K230UB should be better than
                  the B10M at narrower gear ratios and same torque ratings.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In normal everyday traffic, how often does one push a bus engine to 1,800rpm?  The answer is generally rarely ever unless the transmission is ill-suited to the task at hand.  An engine with high torque at low engine speeds as well as a suitable transmission with suitable programming are therefore required for good in-traffic acceleration characteristics.  In order to calculate the optimal up-shifting engine speed, it is necessary to investigate passenger comfort levels (read: shifting comfort) as well as specific fuel consumption of the engine at various speeds.  Up-shifting at 1,800rpm is unnecessary - operating an engine at or above it's 'rated' speed (yellow to red on the tachograph) results in high fuel consumption and unnecessary engine wear.  It is therefore wise to ensure that the engine operates within its 'green zone' as much as possible.  At the same time, it is also unwise to operate an engine at speeds below the 'green zone', as again fuel economy, performance, engine life and smoothness suffers.  Allowing an engine to run below the 'green zone' also promotes 'hunting' - where the transmission is constantly 'between gears' - resulting in poor passenger comfort levels.</p>
              <p>In order to understand why new buses may not perform the same as older buses, it is necessary to understand the concept of torque reduction.  Many new engines are fitted with OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) systems that monitor the health of the engine as well as the exhaust output.  In order to guarantee low emissions levels, some engines are 'cut back' at low speeds under full load.  If the OBD system detects an engine fault, the torque output of the engine is also reduced.  From experience, newer buses require more frequent servicing to ensure reliable operation.</p>
              <p> Remember, official engine power and torque figures are measured under ideal circumstances.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>So the only thing that can get in the way of better acceleration
                  is the unladen weight. Do you agree?</p>
              </blockquote></div>
              <p>As above, there are more variables than you think.  Modern buses, with all their creature comforts, safety and emissions control gear will almost always be significantly heavier than previous generations of buses.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p>After this explaination, I am sure there is a difference drawn clearly between that of a city bus and a sports car.</p>
              <p>Often I see a K230UB at 1000-1100 RPM+ when cruising on the sixth gear at 60 km/h as opposed to a OC500LE at 1200 RPM+ when also at the same speed. It may be also true to say that in comfort levels, on a Scania there would be this feeling that the gears are going to downshift any time, plus the tell-tale sign of low engine speed vibration/sound, while on the Mercedes, it seemed comfortable to think that the bus will be able to maintain at the 6th gear even with the same gradient both models encounter.</p>
              <p>Then again this may be a case to case basis as tuning of different vehicles count as well.</p>
