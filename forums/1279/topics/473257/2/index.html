              <p>as an outsider, i would like to say that it is clear as light who's the troublemakers causing all the drama rah rah time and again. thanks for the gesture to restore peace to this forum, although i have to remain sceptical. </p>
              <p>i believe that it takes 2 hands to clap (i'd prefer the chinese idiom å­¤æŽŒé›£é³´ though), ignoring the clones is the best policy forward. However we always have ignorant people taking the bait and propelling them forward by quoting, responding and even picking up fights with them. it's not hard to see that most longtimers simply do not fall into such traps. there will be no meaning in whatever whoever is trying to do if there is no audience - they can make merry and continue their monologues. </p>

              <p>SBS7485P, why is the apology <em>only</em> now and not much much earlier to the lot of the guys who were affected? It's apparently 3 years from what i gathered off the investigating. 3 years to realise that what you've done indirectly harmed the hobby and people whom were affected? You indirectly created enemies for one party in the past with your spur of the moment actins and now you wash your hands off? <br><br>Boycotting due to phtoography of buses. Whether true or not, i don't care but whoever who's intiating boycotts is pretty much chidlish to the core. Stupidly throwing them aside instead of respecting each and every photographer's unique abilities, forcing everybody to follow one fucking "standard". Later people became more successful in photos then realise you screwed up.<br><br>Both parties are at fault. At the spur of the moment. Harsh things. By finger pointing at one party, then badmouthing and causing the intial chaos because of defensive actions after the incident? Not to mention, your party did wrong, not respecting the company and degrading the hobby with that kind of usage. Why was the blame and claim of sabotage even exist? Then people hate that one party because of the belief he sabotaged the hobby, this already formed the basis of the hate that you are indirectly responsible for, SBS7485P.<br><br>All things have a chain effect. One party attack, the other party defend. Then the bigger party not happy still, brainwash people to boycott and dislike the smaller party, slowly eroding the support and friends away so as a way to gain back the support? Then slowly become a war.<br><br>Not to mention slowly a biasedness grow out and then causing more chaos because of the intial chaos. Honestly, I didn't see the point why people target here and there. Then create more conflicts.Then people get divided into more camps and from what i see, the person who was targetted actually lost his friends becaue of the "spur of the moment" actions.<br><br>And what is with those clone accounts happening that kept copying that party's facebook page content and posting it with nonsenical claim? Then later start to victimise that party's page and then later start to target his friends around him? What the fuck for?<br><br>Was these hate and anger even necessary? Was there benefit to attack and badmouth? Was retaliation neccessary? Wasn't it better to leave the party alone and do your own fucking things in the first place? End up today everybody hate, target and anger, and create all these bullshit. For what fuck?<br><br>I gathered that the party is seeing a doctor as well, and I do not see the point as well why people want to bring up his medical and life situation and badmouth as well, repeatedly. There's a limit to bullying as well, and i agree with many others, it has crossed the line. Not surprised why the other party retaliated as well. Even you don't respect people, respect the medical and life situation, STUPID, by leaving it out of the politics! <br><br><br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">All of you who had participated have to make amends and work things out each other. GO and think.<br><br>brainless group of youths, do actions don't think of consequences. </span></p>
