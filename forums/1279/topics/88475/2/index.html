Morning Off-Peak<br>2. Morning Meal Break<br>3. SBST Split Shift Duty E drivers go back depot. Duty S drivers go back after 10am or so.. Again it depends on individual timesheet.<br><br>After 1200 hrs/1300 hrs the Duty E drivers come back into action, giving the fleet a small boost to its freq by 1 or 2 min. At the same time it also supplements the loads during school dismissal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Duty S drivers kick into action after 1500 hrs or so for the same reason. Although u might find more buses in action with the same freq, there is only one reason why this is the case.<br><br>1. Evening Meal Break</span><br><br>Drivers have their evening meal breaks from 1630 - 1800 hrs, it coincides with the evening peak. As you noticed evening peak are never as freq as the morning peak for most services. This is the reason why.<br><br>And if u noticed trunk services stagger their freq again after 1800 hrs, again this timing would vary. Why? the split shift drivers are on their last trip and are ready to go back depot and pack up for the day. Generally, split shift drivers come back to the int between 1815 - 1930 hrs, before retiring to the depot after that...<br><br>so......... get the damn big picture?!?!?</strong></div>
