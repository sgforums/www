Take the VSO as an example(excluding SBS9888Y).  The engine revs so high at the first gear that the radiator noise becomes very loud. Think it has this problem because it has only 3 speeds, as compared to 4-speed in most ZFs and 6-speeds in some B9TLs, therefor requiring the bus to be engaged on the first gear longer than usual to help the bus pick up speed. This is the reason why i prefer ZFs over Voiths. I like buses with ZFs because it accelerates very well, although as described by SBSTransit the last gear is "wasted", since Voiths can achieve the same highest speed with just 3-speed. However i beg to differ.New ZFs have multi speeds, which allows heavier buses such as DDs to pick up speed easier, due to it allowing the engine's power to be used effectively at all speeds</div></blockquote>I beg to differ, I prefer voith equipped buses bcos their acceleration is more steady and the top speed tends to be higher bcos the gearbox is quite long-legged.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the preference of gearboxes is to each of its own. If you want fast acceleration and low engine rev while at cruising speed, then ZF is for you. If you want a smooth ride with less jerkings due to gear shifts and a higher top speed, then Voith is for you. Personally, I feel the ZF is more suitable for the urban city traffic where acceleration is crucial (you don't want to hog the guy behind) and there are lots of stop-and-go. Voith, meanwhile, is more suitable for less demanding sub-urban traffic, where the distance between stops are longer and there's ample time to gain speed without much jostling. Voith gearboxes have a 4th gear overdrive as an option for their gearbox but it seemed impractical for public buses here since it will only kick in at roughly 70 km/h. I believe the Causeway Link MAN 18.250 has a similar Voith gearbox as its S'pore counterparts but, without the yoke of the speed limiter, it is able to shift into overdrive and speed away.</div>

The engine is being overworked, very noisy and loud, and the bus is going nowhere faster. I think its a waste. I mean, you don't need to rev that much to maintain 60 km/h, especially when you have a 12-litre turbocharged power plant at the back.</div>

Just that the speed limiter doesn't allow it to reach that gear?</div></blockquote>The Voith gearbox can reach higher speeds because the determining factor of top speed is the spacing out of gears, and the number of gears. ZF gears tend to be spaced closer ( try the B9TL) to allow lower rpms at lower speeds. Voith ones are spaced further and this allows a higher speed despite 3 gears. In essence, it means that the difference in gear size is larger in the voith gearbox, while that of the ZF is smaller, giving greater opportunities for lower rpms to be possible.<br><br>The voiths here do not have overdrive bcos its pointless.</div>
