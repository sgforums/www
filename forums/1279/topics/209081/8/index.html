The Citaro L also nt bad as u said, but low floor artics nowdays wont bounce that much as the crazy o405G else it will start scraping the road. And yes, Citaro L can come in a 3 door version, but dont forget u will lose some seats for another door, so might nt be worth in the end.</div>

Found out from another website that the particular person had mentioned about the CitaroG moving up and down vigourously for a few seconds when it travelled over a bump at some speed. I think Volvo and Scania should learn from Mercedes, have a horizontally opposed engine for all of its city buses, Horizontally opposed engines permit full low-floor, unlike the B7RLE and the Lances, which have unusual steps at the rear due to the vertical engine. The B12BLE has a horizontal engine as well. Transverse engine placement also permits buses with vertical engines to have full low floor, so maybe Scania chose this arrangement rather than designing a new engine, but i still think that a horizontal engine best suits city buses, dont you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, SMRT should buy the CitaroL for those feeder services like those in Woodlands and Yishun, as well as other places. The version should have 3 doors, for rapid transfer of passengers. Anyway Citaro had just got a new facelift, it was the second generation of the Citaro family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Bump as in those like raised crossings? Try Svc 811 and see what u can get on a o405G. U can even lose balance if the driver just ignore the raised crossing and start acclerating over it.</div>

Vertical means that the engine is upright while horizontal means that the engine is lying on its side. Then there is transverse, which means that the engine is perpendicular to the chassis, and longitudinal, which is the conventional layout of having the engine in line the chassis. Having a horizontal engine doesn't mean you can get a full low floor. A good example is the B10M. To have a full low floor, the engine has to be at the rear. Doesn't matter if it is vertical or horizontal.<br><br>The Citaro's engine, although longitudinal, is displaced slightly to the left to allow the placement of a door at the rear. Mind you, this last door has 1 step. Volvo's equivalent is the B10L. Having a step to access the rear half is not unusual. Doesn't have anyhthing to do with the engine. You can always put an inclined platform. The B10BLE has a horizontal engine, so why does it have a step then? That's because, in Singapore, there are no doors at the rear, so the idea is to get the seats level with the gangway.</div>

Horizontal is whereby the engine is on its side, whereas transverse is the position of the engine, just like those found on front wheel drived cars. Actually i wrote wrongly. What im trying to say is that a good low floor bus should only have an inclined platform, because otherwise it is only low-entry. Go look at the Mercedes website, look for the 360 degree view, there isn't any steps from the front of the bus all the way to the rear, unlike the B7RLE, which has an unusual step at the rear. As for XiaoTaro, you've taken a CitaroG before? That's quite cool! Anyway may i know whether the CitaroG's engine is as noisy as the 0405G? Cause there's 2 engine option available, one is OM906hLa(6.4l) another is OM457hLa, the engine that have the same displacement as the OM447hLa.</div>

I'm not particularly fond of this bus because I feel awkward when sitting inside. The seats on the rear upper saloon is too far apart and you tend to slide all over wheeras it is cramped on the lower saloon. Its 2 safety bars are located on the inside and its not nice to knock into them as the bus moves. Also, it prevents me from resting my elbow on the window sill. And then it has a Voith gearbox. When the BC guns it, the engine revs so high it feels as if there is a missing gear.<br><br>The only good thing I can think of is that, being NAC, no power is being robbed from the engine and so it can gain speed quite well.</div>

When the BC guns it, the engine revs so high it feels as if there is a missing gear.<br></div></blockquote>I agree. Take the VSO as an example(excluding SBS9888Y).  The engine revs so high at the first gear that the radiator noise becomes very loud. Think it has this problem because it has only 3 speeds, as compared to 4-speed in most ZFs and 6-speeds in some B9TLs, therefor requiring the bus to be engaged on the first gear longer than usual to help the bus pick up speed. This is the reason why i prefer ZFs over Voiths. I like buses with ZFs because it accelerates very well, although as described by SBSTransit the last gear is "wasted", since Voiths can achieve the same highest speed with just 3-speed. However i beg to differ.New ZFs have multi speeds, which allows heavier buses such as DDs to pick up speed easier, due to it allowing the engine's power to be used effectively at all speeds</div>
