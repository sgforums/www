            <div class='col-md body'>Eh for example hor, LTA allows us to buy used buses from bus companies, which model will u choose? I will choose the NAC N113CRB, ELBO L113CRL, and also the WA Volvo MK2. If you ask me to choose one, i might choose the ELBO L113CRL, nice engine sound and quick acceleration! One time stop next to a Habit at a traffic light, then we move off hor, the Habit lag behind. 315bhp man ! But i dont think SMRT will sell any of its buses, so maybe will choose the CRBs! Anyone please place your opinions here! Please avoid comments such as " i dont think LTA will allow this!" It dampens our feelings! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey i found out that a group of bus fans in Hong Kong had preserved a Mercedes-benz 0305 double decker! Just hope that LTA allows this and we shall preserve those buses that we like. Look, preserving doesn't mean u can do illegal modifications such as converting it into a long-ranged bus and drive it to Malaysia or something. I think you are only allowed to repaint the bus or maybe do small modifications to the opening/closing of the doors(some CRBs and MK2s doors are in poor condition, very noising operation). I also intend to change their gearboxes, maybe from 4 speed into 5-6speeds from ZF. I may also change its fuel injector and air intake. As for paint, i intend to paint the doors black, while i paint the window brackets black, and will stretch until half of the bus body. This maybe look like wide windows and a low-floor bus. Then the buses alxes will be black but the rims will be silver.As far as i noe, LTA may permit changing of seating arragements, so i may change the seats to new,firmer Vogelsitze seats, Such as those on the Volgren bendies and Habits. The interior roof maybe painted with peach colour, handrails will be painted with orange/yellow colour. The side walls will be painted with white colour. What do you think?</div>

Especially the nut guard! Looks good on buses! I will also remove the TV mobile sets. So noisy n irritating! But i wouldn't put in coach seats. This is a city bus! Putting a coach seat on a CAC is abit too classy. But if put on the VO2x maybe can. I also like the Hispacold(not hispanold!) A/C, or the bendy Konveckta A/C. Tires are not from Scania, buy them from Michelin, they offer good long lasting tires!</div>

I know that SG's weather is hot like siow, but we had developed feelings fo this NAC buses! Cannot say dump then dump! Poor buses! But the Nissans dont deserve any sympathies! But if abit maybe can lah. Anyone can help me upload a pic of the CRB's NAC interiors? I want NAC ones! Tor long! I also like the MK2s WA , especially their funny gearbox lock-up noise. VO2x im not too sure, seldom take.</div>
