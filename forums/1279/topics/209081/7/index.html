I forgot to add in something, the bus(VO2x) was CRAWLING when it was going up a GENTLE slope! Maybe because only 245bhp. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But some voithed buses have this prob, the gears didn't downshift at all, always at top gear. ZF seldom have this prob. At fourth gear bus couldn't climb, downshift to 3rd gear, then can hear the engine rev up! Maybe the dennis tridents( with 335 or 355bhp, not the 305bhp in SG one) have the performance on slopes? Think 300+ bhp is the minimum power for DDs, dont you agree? Best is around 330-380bhp. I would really like to buy one VO2x and convert it to my style and also conforms to all LTA rules. The bus body i think is really simple, NAC means less/no maintainance with air-cons and such, only maintain the interiors and the chassis and engine, somemore the VO2x accelerate real quick, better than the VO3x, despite its downside on slopes. I immediately "fell in love" with it when i board it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I also enjoyed the speed!

I think SBSTransit should concentrate on buying some new low-floor 2x DDs, this buses can be used on medium demand services such as 93 and other services. The ALX400 is really a nice bus, if you wanna know more about the bus, go do some research or go to AlexanderDennis's website. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I think SBSTransit should concentrate on buying some new low-floor 2x DDs, this buses can be used on medium demand services such as 93 and other services. The ALX400 is really a nice bus, if you wanna know more about the bus, go do some research or go to AlexanderDennis's website. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>You think SBST will get them?

            <div class='col-md body'>Opps sorry, it is not ALX400, it is Enviro 400. ALX400 is an outdated body previously manufactured by Alexander. Ya hope SBSTransit will buy more 2 axle double decker such as the Volvo B7TL. But i dont think SBSTransit will buy that on time, since it is about to be replaced by the 2-axle version of the B9TL. I prefer 2x(2 axle) double deckers, since they have better acceleration and top speed, dont you think? If only the Volvo double deckers have an engine of the Volvo B12B, 340-380bhp, sufficient for a DD. 245 or 285bhp is puny for such a medium weight bus, it shld have at least MINIMUM only 300bhp like the new B9TL, best shld be 330 above! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Of course this is only for 3x DDs only, 2Xs 250+bhp enough liao.</div>

So, i believe that maybe we can completely rework the old buses and make them super modern. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But SBSTransit may consider buying a 10.3 or 10.8m 3 axle DD. Can support air-conditioning properly, but still able to accelerate properly maybe? Coming back to purchasing of used buses, anyone would like to preserve/convert the VO2x? Pls reply! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
