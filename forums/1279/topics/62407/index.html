E.g. "SENGKANG 80" instead of "80 SENGKANG". The first would enable passengers to see the service number without trouble even it there is a bus infront. I had numerous experience of unable to see the service number of Tibs buses as they are blocked off by the bus infront.<br><br>Next time, board the bus AFTER you see the license plate. =) This is what many bus fans do.</div>

The older flip dot signs are harder to make out the letters, like those on old Tibs buses. They use flourescent tubes that's (I think..) the yellow dots will reflect light so harder to see. The LEDs uses individual small bulbs to light up a certain "dot" and these "dots" will make up the digits or letters and hence less reflection and more precise.<br><br>I don't think the service 80 Superbus you saw is using the old flip dot technology but the colour is indeed hard to blend, unlike yellow or orange with black backgrounds.</div>
