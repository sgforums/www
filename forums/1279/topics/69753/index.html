I pity the 806 drivers for this reason.<br><br>Anyone noes the difference for SBST timetables?<br></div></blockquote>In general, SBST timetables are quite standardized. Their mealbreaks range from 22 - 26 min long on a weekday and 28-30 min long on a sunday.<br><br>Their meal break times is between 0900 - 1100 and between 1630 - 1900. Meal times differ from service to service. For example, 238 evening meal breaks are between 1640 - 1840, while one 26 meal break is at 1830.<br><br>Drivers in swing shift do not have 2 meal breaks. They either have one meal break or even a tea break. A tea break is about 13-16 min long. It is usually just after the meal breaks at around 10+ or 4+. Timings differ for every timesheet.<br><br>Correct me if i'm wrong because most of my views here is based on my 238 findings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
