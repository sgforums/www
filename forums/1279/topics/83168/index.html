It is not known what the quarrel was about.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Witnesses reported one youth running to a bus stop 300m away, and boarding the stationary bus. But gang members went after him and pressed the bus emergency stop button to prevent it from leaving. No one else was hurt in the attack, which lasted about five minutes.</span><br><br>The victim told Lianhe Wanbao that he was waiting for his bus with a friend when he looked at the group of rowdy youths.<br><br>Before he knew it, the group asked him what he was looking at.<br><br>He said he replied: 'Why can't I look?' and that provoked the attack.<br><br>i suppose tat's not a "bus emrgency stop button" but rather the emergency door cock button on the outside of the bus. pressing it opens the door, but at the same time enables the door-accelerator lock, preventing the bus from moving off until the door is properly closed again. thus, it appeared to most who do not know the real purpose of the button that this bus is used (solely) to stop the bus.</div>
