            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man Transport Tycoon was one of the first games I've played in my life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now I still play the sequel (1994) Transport Tycoon Deluxe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well it's not really concentrated in Buses, but more on trains...as they are faster, can carry bigger loads...you transport goods from one industry to another in the map, generated randomly...eg. Coal from Coal Mine to Power Station...But sometimes the production may fall...and sometimes Opponents (computer) will fight resources with you...<br><br>While all this is going on there will be new trains coming out that are faster...Towns will expand...and well, I won't have anymore opponents by then because I'll ram all their trucks by building tracks over their roads and waiting for them to cross so I can use my train and ram them over  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But a bus company...could be interesting but it has to focus more on the towns/cities, not so spread out like in TTD. You'll probably have to identify important structures in the town that many people will go to, so you'll have to put more services there, or increase the frequency of services. Civilian Cars may also have to be added (to add difficulty in the game) and to cause traffic jams sometimes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You'll have to satisfy your passengers...otherwise they might complain...and when there are opponents then they will earn more than you, because the computer always cheats  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As what Iveco has said, new roads etc. are determined by the computer (not the opponent). There could also be train lines that might hinder some of your services. It could be based on reputation, say, the happier your passengers are, the more reputation you'll have, and you could even take over the building of roads...well who knows. It's just a suggestion.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It is LTA or city councils that do so. It is better to leave it that way as I am all for realism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I have a feeling that a go at such a game might shut the complaint kings up (you guys know who you are).
