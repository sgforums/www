SBS 482T is very good now. You want to try the best bus from SLBP? Try taking SBS 3733A in svc 502. Wa.. I really lovin it! Gd air condition, no sticky gear problem and when it speed at PIE, it's speeding sound was quiet. Still got the Pss pss sound when braking. Like got ABS system equppied. Compared to SBS 432M, which also had the serious jerking problem. Today, I saw someone vomitted in svc 502. As the driver driving skills sucks too. He keep on stepping and releasing the accelerator. Already the bus was having a jerking problem, still the stupid driver still drive like that. After I get out of the bus, I also felt very dizzy..<br></div>

Why buy buses when it's only for the morning? (in the case of school-goers) Also, remember the CCL? When the CCL opens you'll be able to breathe easier, there's bound to be route amendment, and thus there will be buses freed up. If I am not wrong Service 74 has 48 buses on it (including morning CT28 cross-over. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The most interesting part? Go and see the number of DDs. They tried their best, but there is still literally nothing that can be done.<br><br>Superlong buses aren't quite suitable for Singapore's roads. That's why there's only 997A, and not other superlong buses. Besides, you will have to train BCs in driving a whole new different type of bus, I believe it isn't too worth it.<br><br>If I am not wrong to actually get a bus real full, according to the licenced carrying limit, you require 2 full rows of standing passengers and the standing pax bay be filled up. Then I'd consider that really full. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regarding replacement of buses, I really hope SBS Transit will consider testing Citaros. You can fit a rear door, encourages people to move to the back. Agreed?</div>

But however, the rear door wont be "stepless", there will be a small step due to the engine placement as well as due to underfloor equipment. Ya hope SBSTransit will introduce the Citaros, but i think that will go to SMRT since SMRT are Mercedes freaks.
