            <div class='col-md body'>Complaint against svc 109:<br><br>1) Extremely low frequency, especially during AM peak hour. What is worse is that the buses can arrive 10-15min earlier or later than what is should arrive, making it unpredictable and unreliable. True, the new svc has cut my travel time by 5min, excluding the fact that walking distance has also been cut, but the long wait easily negated this advantage. I've heard conversations on 109 that went something like this: Hello? Yah. I'm on 109, now in Sengkang. Yah I know! But I left home at 0800! Ok ok, coming coming. (Note that this conversation took place at 0840)<br><br>2) Bad bus conditions to match with lousy driving. 1825G, 1818C vibrates most violently on TPE and several times, I thought a screw would fall off the bus. 955X appears to have a faulty clutch which makes its gear switches abrupt, noisy and awkward, with plenty of gear-clashing sounds. 1825G broke down, and this caused pax and me to wait an additional half-an-hour for the next bus. So total waiting time? Easily 1 hr. Caused me to be late. And 109 BCs are a breed of their own. One sang cantonese hot numbers on TPE, and spat loudly out of the window. Many are cautious drivers who want to go fast, but are scared. Result: Jerking bus. Others are just sloooow, but most often rush, and I've been taken on wild-rides. Eg. Overtaking taxi, car, other buses on main road, and a trailer carrying concrete pipe.<br>But the most tokong BC I've seen was one who decided that TPE traffic flow was too heavy for him and promptly stopped at the road shoulder just after the slip-road and waited for traffic to thin before entering the expressway! Caused much honks.<br><br>3) Timetables that are just beyond comprehension. If a bus arrived half an hour later, you should expect the BC to be late, but strangely, there would be the high-pitched DEEE, and the BC would go slower than ever. This is no joke especially when I tell you that 2 161s will pass me by everyday while I wait, and for a svc with rather low rider-ship, the bus would arrive packed to the brim. If you think I should just leave home to pong the bus at the correct time, sorry. The bus schedule is so unpredictable, there's little choice. The bus can arrive between 0640-0710. Its just ridiculous.<br><br>So I've placed my faith with decidedly slower 89 which provides much better svc.</div>

MRT are faster.<br><br>Suggestion: I suggest SBS Transit to operate 502A and 502B in normal timing.<br>This is to shorten the time for the people who board in pioneer rd. It would be very tiring staying in a bus for more than an hour. Communters also paid a expensive fare for the "Express" service, I guess this should not be the service given to the communters staying in Jurong West St75 and Pionner Rd.<br><br></div>
