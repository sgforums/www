            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jetabt767400:</div><div class="quote_body">brotherchen1982, I am not trying to complain here. As indicated in my first sentence, I am trying to share this experience. I did not try to instigate the passengers into complaining with me, but rather I am just sharing my ideas with them. I have never thought of complaining at this jucture because I could simply wake up earlier and catch the 0723hrs bus. Neither did I miss it intentionally.<br>If you are trying to make me reflect on myself trying to complain, then you might be wrong. However, it is true that bus companies and all companies alike would like to 'save their face' and try to give vague feedbacks to passengers who merely wanted to comment, not complain, on their service. This 'save the face' replies are particularly persistent in Asians, as Westeners are more open in mind, however, racial and ethnical values do stand.<br>You would not be able to find a rego of a bus that crashed on that company's website, would you. Same case here, would a company truely and sincerely apologise to the customer and say that they are wrong? Definitely not! They would just utilise their public relations and say that they will improve, that such incidents/accidents would not happen again. Whether they happen again we all can see to that.<br>Hence I would apologise if I offended anyone, but I do truely mean what I write, for I do not stand in the point of a profit-making company.</div></blockquote>I am not making you to reflect yourself just sharing experiences from my friends, my uncle &amp; my friend father are bus driver &amp; me on bus svcs which have irregular timings, crowded buses... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Article from <strong><span style="color: red;">TODAY</span></strong> Voices, 3 Aug 2006.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">For a cleaner, spacious ride</span></strong><br>Commuters make known their choices<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yvonne Lim<br>Voices &amp; Commentary editor</span><br><br>AS the Public Transport Council (PTC) turned up the heat on SMRT and SBS Transit to meet defined service standards ("Getting buses shipshape", July 27), ahead of the impending fare hikes, commuters got down to dirty business.<br><br>That is to say, a fair number of readers asked for public transport operators to be taken to task also for the state of cleanliness on their buses.<br><br>As Diana Tan, who wrote in to agree with letter writer Graham McEune ("Flag down those bus bugbears", July 29), put it: "<span style="color: red;">Dirty floors and windows that look like they have never been cleaned Â— I don't know what tourists think, especially when the rest of Singapore is so clean. As any housewife will tell you, a mop, a bucket and a wet cloth are all you need. Could someone tell SBS this?</span>"<br><br>To be fair, the transport operator's efforts do go further than this. Referring to its previous response to similar complaints, See Leong Kit noted: "SBS Transit's reply, that buses are given a thorough cleaning and fumigation once a month, with the bus drivers doing a quick sweep daily with broom and dustpan, is unacceptable."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Harking back to perennial complaints about stuffy air-conditioning, mouldy air-con vents, cockroaches and mosquitoes, he asked if such "sloppy attention" to public hygiene could have contributed to the seasonal flu outbreak.</span>.<br><br>See suggested the PTC impose standards on maintenance and hygiene. "After the buses stop operating, bring in cleaning contractors with heavy-duty vacuum cleaners to thoroughly clean the buses daily. <span style="color: red;">Areas where many hands have touched, such as grab poles and pull handles, should be wiped with disinfectant</span>."<br><br>Other common bugbears included the advertisements pasted over bus windows and inadequate leg space.<br><br>Raymund Koh, for instance, complained to SMRT that he felt "particularly squeezed in the seat just behind the first exit door" of a "bendy bus".<br><br>He received <span style="color: red;">the response that seats were fitted by the manufacturer based on the regulated 23cm of space.<br><br>"People of the current generation are generally much taller. Our public buses have very little leg room between seats, which tall passengers like myself cannot squeeze into</span> on long journeys. We need to sit slanting," he said.<br><br>Soh Poh Huat was glad the PTC was "finally" proposing to lay down the law on bus frequencies and waiting times, among other things. But he wondered <span style="color: red;">when it would extend the service standards to "buses not stopping close to bus bays to facilitate boarding/alighting", and "bus captains who fail to ensure the elderly, expectant mothers or parents carrying children are seated prior to driving off</span>".<br><br>His suggestion: That PTC set up an automated system to which commuters can instantly SMS their feedback. The authorities could then generate monthly reports. "For example, if there are more than X number of complaints, fines can be imposed," he wrote.<br><br>Going down a somewhat tangential road, Seah Leong Khai wonders if the PTC can extend its purview to commuter behaviour as well.<br><br>"<span style="color: red;">We hear complaints about passengers not giving up their seats to those who need it. Why should we, full fare-paying adults, be made to stand, while able-bodied young people on concessionary fares sit to enjoy the ride?</span>"<br><br>What he wants: For PTC to make it compulsory for students and national servicemen to give up their seats to senior citizens, pregnant women and other adults when the bus is full. Inspectors could enforce this.<br><br>"This makes business sense. Full-fare paying passengers should have priority over those who pay discounted fares, except for senior citizens. In other businesses such as air travel, you get priority when you pay a premium," he argued.</div>

Hope the original write reads this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>1)Dirty floors and dirty windows eh? do you mean it looks dusty? Both companies do clean their bus but the amount of dirt created are generated much more faster that they could clean. I can assure you that if the BC cleans the floor everyday, after about 4hrs of service it would get dirty again.<br>2) not strong enough aircon eh? As the bus become older the aircon becomes weaker(same as you, the older you become the weaker you become) and if the bus operators were to change every unit of the airconditioning system, it will cause another fare hike and everybody will complain. FYI. bus opperators are doing their best to maintain the aircon.<br>3)want disinfectant ar? wah again, ask to clean everytime, buy lots of disinfectant will cause another fare hike. If you cannot tahan after every bus ride, go down and find yourself a toilet and wash your hand. The poles and grab handles arn't so dirty anyway. It is you having the "must be totally germs free" problem.<br>4)not enough space ar? i can fit wad although i'm about 1.8m high. It shouldn't be a major problem. If cannot tahan also, easy just stand; have a very big legroom.<br>5)got buses not doing their jobs properly? complain to the bus opperators and they'll take the necessary actions.<br>6)wah must pay full amount cannot sit also must be noisy ar? that's because you're too slow finding a seat.Young people get concessionary because they don't make their own income and those who make some arn't big anyway. It's a first come first served basis; who slow cannot get seats but if you're old or pregnant or very chio i'm sure somebody will give you a seat.<br><br>finish! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
