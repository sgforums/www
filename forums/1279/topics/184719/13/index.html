            <div class='col-md body'>OMG!! SBS 315T is getting from bad to worse!! This bus giv me the feeling that it cannot continue its duties anymore. Firstly, if u sit at the back of the sit, the engine is damm loud and noisy. The noise produced outside by the bus was unbearable. Secondly, the heat that produce from the back of the seat, I can feel it from the seat that is in front of the emergency exit. I remembered a few days ago, there was one passenger shouted loudly that the seats behind is very hot. Thirdly, this buses jerk hardly. I remembered that day, an old lady lost her control when the bus was leaving the bus- stop. It jerk hardly that causes her to fall.<br><br>Hope that the people in SLBP can pay more attention to this bus.</div>

The bus certainly looks old from the exterior. Painting should be done. The types look like they are worn off, even produce that kind "eeee" sound. Then, aircon leaking above the green seats infront of the standing place. Lastly, I hope the engine's sound of SBS 315T can be solved and of course the hard jerking problem.</div></blockquote>dun u noe slbp has one of the poorest standards of maintenance? thats why it gets all the old buses until now when the MK4DM3500 and b9tls came in and the CNG buses had no choice cause its nearest to cng pump</div>
