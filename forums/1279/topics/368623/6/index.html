              <h2>Boon Lay's new bus interchange set to open</h2>
              <div>
              <div style="color: #888;">Jul 29, 2009 - The Straits Times</div>
              <div><em>Yeo Ghim Lay</em></div>
              <br>
              <p>WORK on the new air-conditioned Boon Lay bus interchange has been completed and it is expected to open during the year-end school holidays.</p>
              <p>One of a new generation of transport hubs like the ones in Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh, the 32,000 sq m interchange will be linked to the Boon Lay MRT station and the Jurong Point 2 shopping centre.</p>
              <p>About 150,000 commuters are expected to use it daily, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA).</p>
              <p>Construction was completed recently and the LTA expects to hand over the interchange to SBS Transit next month, to train and familiarise its bus captains with the new facilities.</p>
              <p>The interchange will open during the year-end school holidays to minimise any confusion, said an LTA spokesman.</p>
              <p>The new interchange, which can hold up to 60 buses, has 31 boarding and alighting berths, said the LTA.</p>
              <p>Commuters will be able to transfer between trains and buses in air-conditioned comfort as well as shop at the stores at the interchange.</p>
              <p>The concourse of the interchange also leads directly to the first floor of the Jurong Point 2 shopping mall.</p>
              <p>Currently, Boon Lay residents use a temporary bus interchange located next to the MRT station.</p>
              <p>'The temporary interchange now is quite hot and the road leading to it is also very congested as there are only two lanes. Hopefully, the new interchange will solve these problems,' said Mr Joseph Foo, 58, chairman of the Pioneer Citizens Consultative Committee.</p>
              <p>With the new interchange, commuters will no longer have to cut through the MRT station to get to Jurong Point.</p>
              <p>Boon Lay resident Rachel Chew, 30, said: 'I sometimes just take a cab from Jurong Point back home to avoid walking back to the interchange. When the new interchange opens, I will probably take my feeder bus more frequently.'</p>
              <p>Businesses at Jurong Point are also hoping that the new bus interchange will bring in more customers.</p>
              <p>'We are looking forward to it. The crowds here are fairly okay, but I'm sure with the bus interchange opening, we will have more people walking in,' said Ms Nina Koh, supervisor at shoe store BeetleBug.</p>

              <p>I think maybe you are reading too much into the sentence.</p>
              <p>anyway 31 is correct. 22 end-on (B7 to B17), 6 boarding sawtooth (B1 to B6), 3 alighting sawtooth (though with 5 entrances so A1 to A5)</p>

              <p>i wonder what happened to the proposed joo koon ter?</p>
              <p>would be good to amend 79, 193, 252, 254, 255 and 257 to terminate there. probably 79 and 193 would do a loop system like what it does in boon lay but this time round 79 will extend to joo koon and loop inside 252's joo koon circle segment while 193 will go from tuas to joo koon, changing shift for 193 can be done at joo koon instead. i presume there are less than 15 lots at the joo koon ter which estimates 5 services (185, 252, 254, 255 and 257, 79 and 193 to loop there) being able to <strong>PARK</strong> <strong>at </strong>joo koon ter and so i presume 185 can probably extend to joo koon ter as well. 252 should ply from joo koon - boon lay mrt (loop) with out going into boon lay interchange.</p>
              <p>boon lay is currently overcrowded, my idea would increase joo koon's utilization and help ease boon lay's overcrowding.</p>
              <p>boon lay needs change. change is good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Cannot move so many svcs to joo koon's lor. I kinda presume a kind of (loop) for some svcs(due to limited parking at BNL). All these svcs need to serve from BNL cos of many factors like all feeders stop there. Those RC or wat would not allow them to move some of these svcs to Joo Koon. With the new int which is same as the former int, it should able to cope even better than the current temp one(cos more exits and bus parking split up).</p>
