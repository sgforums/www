It was transfered from AMDEP to HGDEP as it was terminating at Sengkang Int. But when 163 was amended to Sengkang Int, 159 became a loop service (maybe Sengkang Int no space), 163 moved to HGDEP and 159 moved back to AMDEP. </div></blockquote>But on the same day 163 was extended to SKG, 27 was extended to HGN. In essence, it was a 1 for 1 swap. Your argument that SKG Int had no space doesn't really hold much water. I think it's more to do with depot arrangements.</div>

Before the NEL Network Rationalisation, with 85, 501, 502, etc, Sengkang is already very cramp. Giving up 159 and 27 from terminating at the interchange was a wise move.<br><br>If 159 isn't being transfered back to AMDEP, tell me, what is going to happen to the mercz? AMDEP gets more SPs? Transfer them out? HGDEP will then run into a shortage of B10M to accomodate one more service. And what's more, HGDEP isn't keen on keeping mercz inside, looking at the example of S'goon svcs mercz going back to AMDEP one by one.</div>

When 81 joins HGDEP with 86, 136 and 159 (4 svcs), HGDEP already gives up 7 32 66 197 (4 svcs too). 11 and 64 go BRAM/AMDEP, it is only that 64 might  lose its entire B10M and Trident fleet.
