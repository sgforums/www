              <p>Personally I dont see much problem with 161 despite taking it 2-3 times a week to and fro from HG to WDL weekdays and weekends.</p>

              <p>And the frequency part certainly not as good as 168, but it is good enough. 10-15 min off-peak frequency is quite alright and 161 is considered very reliable and the driving is more or less predictable also (neither too slow nor too fast).</p>

              <p>Not a lot!</p>
              <p>I was a typical office worker which obviously excluded me from travelling around on weekdays. (If I take 161, it is to paktor, tektor, jalan-jalan, kia-kia etc etc)</p>
              <p>And I take 161 at night to go home from WDL. The weekend day trips are obviously towards WDL from where I take other buses to reach the northern areas. Therefore my trip profile should identify me with the majority of 161 weekend users.</p>
              <p>Nothing to complain about 161 at all, except the occasional SD.....but definitely not half the fleet is SD on weekends.</p>
              <p>Edit: I also forget to add that I take 161 from HG Int to my cosy abode many more times weekdays and weekends. You can take it from me that the 161 fleet is really nothing to complain about.</p>

              <p><br>Very simple - because 161 is so much more reliable than sv 161. And on weekdays you have a full fleet DD service. Who would want to stand in a 965 when you can go seated in a 161. Definitely, 161 has taken pax from sv 965.</p>

              <p>161 is faster.</p>
              <p>By a huge margin.</p>
              <p>The only time it makes sense to take 965 is when you are going to Yishun/Khatib, not Woodlands.</p>

              <p><br> Very simple - because 161 is so much more reliable than sv 161. And
              on weekdays you have a full fleet DD service. Who would want to
              stand in a 965 when you can go seated in a 161. Definitely, 161 has
              taken pax from sv 965.</p>

              <p>I agree with SBS2601D on this. Sv 161 is very reliable, quite good frequency around 10 mins peak, 15 mins off-peak and during weekdays full fleet DDs, even in off-peak.</p>
              <p>On weekends, you see more SDs but I think that is because of the loading. The typical loading whenever I have taken 161 DD on weekends is between 50-55 pax. Does not cross 60 pax on most occassions, very easily managed by SDs.</p>
              <p>Ofcourse given that it is a long distance route, DDs would be better and I think once they observe the loading on weekends, they might add more DDs. But so many SDs on weekends like last one is also not usual.</p>

              <p>I think SBST has taken note of sv 74 and made improvements to it. As per sources, few SDs are replaced by DDs.</p>
              <p>For sv 147, I think the SDs are supposed to trail behind a DD to take the excess pax that do not board a DD during peak. I feel sv 147 is pretty well managed (especially during peak hours) and also you have many alternatives along the route, unlike sv 74.</p>

              <p>Anyway, if 161's frequency is good/reliable, mind explaining to me why I've to wait about 15-25mins for the next bus after skipping the front DD? It's somewhat not consistent with the interval. Or even some drivers speeding on expressway and ended up bunching with a DD on Weekend morning?</p>

I go up his face black ..... Reach sengkang int , the bus in front just finished boarding .... So he drops me off and speeds to the boarding berth ( frequency 40 sec ) takes 2 pax and misses the light so the bus in front get head start to start 'sweeping ' in the end he is just gonna take that 2 pax to  the eway and drive at a ridiculous 40kph until lentor ........ Fun eh ? </p></div>
