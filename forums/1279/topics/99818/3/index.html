There are 2 refurbished A/C  Volvo Mk2s serving 115. Didn't remember the no. plate. If 115 route is enhanced to defu lane then it seems that those who lives in Ave 3 would not want to take 115 as it has long waiting time +  long route. It seems that all HG feeder bus services(112,113,115) are ridiculous!(except for 325). Perhaps should feedback to SBST...</div></blockquote>Yeah! Should feedback to SBST. Anyway, as SBST has said, 115 is on trial. For what? nobody knows... maybe to test out this "ridiculous" route, or maybe to see whether it is feasible to use HGS as a terminating "bus-stop"; in fact there are 4 bus parking slots in that area, not 3 as I had mentioned earlier, and they are just in front of the bus stop. At most buses just go out from one side and enter via the other lorz. Not very far lar, as some one had mentioned. Btw, dunno why SBST so special one, always put special bus onto "special" routes. First it was 84, then 115.... Mk4 DM3500 was even seen serving on 115 once...</div>

For example, at 1030, one person is at Hougang Ave 3 ( the 1st bus stop after 115 turn from Lor Ah Soo ) and he missed 115, from that place, he only needs less then 45 minutes to walk to Kovan. But he will have to take 45 minutes to wait for the next 115 to come, and from that bus stop, it will take some time for 115 to reach Kovan. 115 can be enhanced to Defu Ind. Est. and also Serangoon, to reduce the overcrowded 53 during peak hours. It can be treated as a convenient service to the workers in Defu Ind. Est.<br><br>Moreover, 115 drives very slow. How to serve the people? Don't forget about 112, 113 and 325, drivers drive too slow until ridiculous, 50km/h most of the time ( including big roads like Ave 2 ), sometimes not even 40km/h ( I thought 60 km/h is the speed limit? ). Don't tell us it's because of safety reasons? Volvo buses no power at all?</div>

Initially, 323 served ave 3 and 5, that was years and years ago before 327 was introduced. 329 was then serving defu ave 1 via tampines rd. A couple of months after 327 was introduced, 329 was merged into 323 to serve defu via upp serangoon road, ave 5 and ave 7. This was a service with not a bad demand. Then dont know what happened, SBS suddenly changed the route of that 323 to the former 329's route. Obviously, the former route was of a higher demand than the latter. This eventually led to the demise of 323.....duh</div>

Somemore Hougang is very 'linked' whereby you travel in any direction can bring you to an expressway(TPE via Tampines Road or via Sengkang), (CTE via Upp Serangoon Rd then Potong Pasir or via AMK). Even in very 'peaceful' road in the morning rush hour. The driver esp. feeder svcs like 112,113,115,325 and also 119(to sengkang) drives like anything but being in a rush. I even encountered a driver(325), while on my way to school, being overtaken by a cyclist. My friend and I simply couldn't stand but laugh. It makes people wonder whether the bus was having engine failure or Volvo MK2 has a 'no power' engine or SBST hire drivers who has phobia of speed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you think that is amazing, I saw 9848M overtake 9035S uphill. But it is true that the VSO cant go fast cos it is started to fall back. But the 161 driver kindly pulled back, phew! As the LO3X is already doing 60+km/h, the VSO must have been going in excess 65km/h to catch up and overtake! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
