            <div class='col-md body'>well... I have to agree they shouldn't close HG south terminal. Makes me feel uncomfortable since the terminal's there since I was born. Used to take service 328 to and from home all the time and it seems so sudden that 328 suddenly became 101. And worst still! bus service like 112, 113 and 115 are ridiculous! e.g. if i want to go to Kovan City(a.k.a Hougang South) from HG central. I would take 153 or 107 instead of 113 and 112 which make it's way to HG ave6/8 and HG st 92 respectively before going to Hougang south. It's about a 10 mins difference for 113 and a 25 mins difference for 112. And 115 even more ridiculous! there are already many buses(80,81,82,107,153,113,112,101) that ply between HG ave 3 and Kovan city. perhaps good for those who wants to take 115 from HG ave 3 to HG ave1 but i would rather take 62,113 than to wait for a 30 mins 115. I agree that 112 and 113 would be better if they are townlink services.<br><br>But on the contrary. 112 and 113 could be useful if you intend to travel from let's say HG ave 3(serangoon JC) to hougang st 92 or Paya Lebar Road.</div>

On the other hand, 101, 80, 62 and 82 also can, but not from HGN int. NEL also can but a bit expensive. Not many people will take 113 and 112 to Kovan. Going to Hougang St 92 by 112 from HGN will be a butt pain ride, take 72 and get down at Hougang Ave 9, then walk to Hougang St 92 will be the efficient way. Both 112 and 113 should not be terminated in HGN, instead in Kovan ( former HGS ), to serve as intratown routes, making loops at Hougang St 92, Upper Paya Lebar Rd, and also HGN int. ( don't terminate there, terminate at HGS ). Sounds like reversing back into the past, but by doing this, it will give HGN int more space for other buses to park ).<br><br>Based on 115's route, 45 mins is more than enough for the bus to go the whole route. Is 115's route used one bus only? That's too pathetic. 45 mins is enough for passengers to walk to Ave 3, so 115, is useless.<br><br>115's route should be enhanced, into Defu Ind. Park. Just like formal 323, because Defu Ind. Park has no links to Kovan. Previously, there were 151 and 51, so SBS ( former SBST ), can withdrawn 323. But currently, 51 and 151 are terminated in HGN, instead of HGS. Now, the people there have to wait for 115 along Ave 3. Alternatively, walk to Ave 1 for 113 and 62. Walk to Tampines Rd for 81 and 112.<br><br>HGS should not have closed down, just like other members have said. Now HGN bus park looks a bit overcrowded sometimes. Moreover, refer to the map of Hougang, HGN is not really situated in the centre of Hougang. HGN is some distance away from Lor Ah Soo.</div>

There are 2 refurbished A/C  Volvo Mk2s serving 115. Didn't remember the no. plate. If 115 route is enhanced to defu lane then it seems that those who lives in Ave 3 would not want to take 115 as it has long waiting time +  long route. It seems that all HG feeder bus services(112,113,115) are ridiculous!(except for 325). Perhaps should feedback to SBST...</div>
