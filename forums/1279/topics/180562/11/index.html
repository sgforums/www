Especially around 6-7pm, the 242 buses arrive after the schelduled time, so after all the passengers alight at the alighting berth from the previous trip, the BC immedately departs again, with no time for breaks. So they honk and tell the SBST people that they have arrived.<br>Another time I notice they do that is when they finished their duty and are going off service. In the old BNL, they just parked their buses at the alighting berth then went to tap their cards. Now, they honk to see if the SBST people will allow them to park at the limited space between the 198,etc &amp; 242, etc berth.</div>

If all the JIS services were taken out, Boon Lay will still have 20 services left. 20 services in not 'very few' if you ask me, unless SBST has other ideas. Still need big space for all that buses. Personally, I think it is impractical to make the JIS end at Joo Koon and all the other services at Boon Lay. If people need a bus connection, then how?</div>

You get excited seeing 179's queue and buses, something which I see everyday for so many chicken years and couldn't care less about. Many other people know about this for a long time too, so who is the one not updated? Like I said, lots of people, lots of buses, so what? Its not like the sky is going to fall or anything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

But I think it would be better if they place the normal 179 queue in front, like the old BNL interchange.<br><br>Anyway, I saw at least 5 different 179 buses parking in Row 1 at different times... They were not x-overing or anything... Probably not enough space now! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
