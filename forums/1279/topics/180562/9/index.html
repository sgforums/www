Some things I still could not accept with what you say.<br><br>If the most simple thing like solving the queue they cannot done well. How can they say they were giving world- class service transport. Just like boon lay int, all service had been squezze to this small int. I sometimes observe bus could merely crash into each other when they were coming out or into the parking lots. If one bus company was not able to handle so much svc. I suggest them to give up some and let other operators to do it. This would partly solve the problem. Services like travels around the neighbourhood should be priority to the commuters as this services also had a lot of communters going to the MRT station.<br><br>By the way, LTA would be coming out new measures. I think operaters which operates services which were always overcrowded and could let communters stand in the entrance of the door might get penalty from LTA. This reminds me the booking of the cab operators.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all, I think I should post this becos I read abt the displeasure in increased bus fares.<br><br>The increase in bus fares was largely due to the great increase in oil prices. Do you all have any idea how much was spent solely on fuel? I do not know the exact but the amount can fight with our profit.<br><br>At the same time, the reason to buy new buses are because many old buses are going to be scrapped. And before they are scrapped, new buses must be introduced. Otherwise there will be one day when suddenly not enough buses. And when new buses are introduced, we need to train the BC to learn how to operate these buses. And the 'engineering boys' (Ong BL likes to call us) are going to be the lot to suffer the most. We gotta learn how to maintain these new sophisticated buses correctly.<br><br>The increase in bus fares proportionally cannot be compared to the much higher increase in the average salaries of our fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>Also part of the increase was also due to some passengers who make cheap themselves; Vandalism, beh deh pretend by scanning the exit BXP immediately going on board the bus or within lesser stops. Last time still got the fare card that time everyone pay 60cents for a $1.00 ride. Now got terrorism, higher demand also.<br><br>We are a purely private company. That means every loss and profit we swallow ourselves. When we make profit, we thank the community and the employees for their efforts. When we make a loss, no one is going to sympathise with us.<br><br>And don't forget since we're completely a private company, <strong>why no one mention about the heavy subsidised bus fares for students and senior citizens and NSF that we dig out of our own pockets?</strong> Becos we've been doing it for so many years now people take it for granted?! To put it bluntly, even if SBST or SMRT is going to standardise fares to $2 per trip, no one can sue us. Not even MP can do anything if we dun want. But the transportation companies are not going to do that because we want to continue this tradition of helping the community.<br><br>I keep hearing '...before SBS going to increase bus fares again...' sacarstically. I find these people need to re-consider their pt of view and learn how the bus companies runs.<br><br>Cost savings is 1 of my KPI in the line of my work. I can guarantee you that SLWS is trying every bit to save on cost yet squeeze the best to put on the road. Lifespan extension of our equipments yet cannot breakdown. Use after market or self designed parts yet must put our heads on the chopping boards to take accountability to ensure no one dies or get hurt. Not even get hurt, if the bus got smoke case, we will make compensation then tender the resignation and make apology. In short, we say make the impossible become a reality.<br><br>How many people understand our pains. I must say many people understand. But yet there are still some minorities who keep ranting the unreasonable as though they are entitled to everything in the world taking all for granted.</div>

Some things I still could not accept with what you say.<br><br>If the most simple thing like solving the queue they cannot done well. How can they say they were giving world- class service transport. Just like boon lay int, all service had been squezze to this small int. I sometimes observe bus could merely crash into each other when they were coming out or into the parking lots. If one bus company was not able to handle so much svc. I suggest them to give up some and let other operators to do it. This would partly solve the problem. Services like travels around the neighbourhood should be priority to the commuters as this services also had a lot of communters going to the MRT station.<br><br>By the way, LTA would be coming out new measures. I think operaters which operates services which were always overcrowded and could let communters stand in the entrance of the door might get penalty from LTA. This reminds me the booking of the cab operators. </strong></blockquote>So u mean that there are simple too many bus services at Boon lay lah. Then suggst to SBST to remove all the feeder service such as SV 242/243 loh..<br><br>The temp interchange is small, cos there is no space available. This is what they can make use of the limited land. Maybe they should not built the temp int beside the MRT station. They should built it opposite the MRT Station. Then every bus service will get their boarding slot etc.. and the space will not be so squeeze. But then, those communters such as Chicken Little will complain, cos they have to cross the road to get to the interchange. very inconvenience lah.. no shelter lah etc..<br><br>Further, what u mean by if one company cant handle, then let the other company handle? So u mean that transfer SV242/243 and some others to SMRT? Do u think it will solve the problem? SMRT is having shortages of buses and later u see CAC/OAC Nissan,u will also complain.<br><br>And ur last paragraph, it is really weird. Ask LTA to give penalty to SBST and SMRT for overcrowding? It is the passengers who want to squeeze up the crowded buses. They can simply wait for the next bus if it is full. Imagine if LTA really give penalty, then u will see buses skipping bus stops when they are 3/4 full and then u will complain again...<br><br>PLS THINK BEFORE U POST LAH....</div>

Then when the 2nd one departs, the 3rd one comes and almost no one boards. Then you'll see the 3 buses (with 179 drivers) racing...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>SBS could try seperating the LOs, instead of 3 LOs together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, I had seen so much comments, but wat i still think that to keep some buses wit gd frequency like (svc 30, 242). Esp 242 at night, aft a single deck comes everytime, the queue still could not clear. (Esp night time(weedays &amp; night), as now Int moves and passengers had increases).I knew there was 1 non aircon DD cross over frm 255 serving 242. Only DD could not settle the problem. If they could change those SD to DD during those timings (8pm to 10.30pm) in the weekdays and (8pm to 11pm) weekends nights. If you say they would waste oil if uses air con DD in the night then i think non aircon DD could also be gd. Communters wants to go home quick, they dun want to wait and wait in the Int and wastes their time. You think is gd to stand in the hot INT to wait for 2 buses to get home? This problem could be solve. Why 179 and 199 could have DD to the night but 242 cannot. 199 sometimes spotted onli lower deck got pple. Why? cannot anyone answer me?</div>

Then you will know why things cannot happen like ideal. Too many things involve around that will tie everybody down. This is also applicable to your personal life. Get a degree or diploma so easily?! what abt my commitment to studying hard? my school fees? etc etc.</div>
