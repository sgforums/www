Do you all have any idea how much was spent solely on fuel? I do not know the exact but the amount can fight with our profit.<br><br>At the same time, the reason to buy new buses are because many old buses are going to be scrapped. And before they are scrapped, new buses must be introduced. Otherwise there will be one day when suddenly not enough buses. And when new buses are introduced, we need to train the BC to learn how to operate these buses. And the 'engineering boys' (Ong BL likes to call us) are going to be the lot to suffer the most. We gotta learn how to maintain these new sophisticated buses correctly.<br><br>The increase in bus fares proportionally cannot be compared to the much higher increase in the average salaries of our fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>Also part of the increase was also due to some passengers who make cheap themselves; Vandalism, beh deh pretend by scanning the exit BXP immediately going on board the bus or within lesser stops. Last time still got the fare card that time everyone pay 60cents for a $1.00 ride. Now got terrorism, higher demand also.<br><br>We are a purely private company. That means every loss and profit we swallow ourselves. When we make profit, we thank the community and the employees for their efforts. When we make a loss, no one is going to sympathise with us.<br><br>And don't forget since we're completely a private company, [b]why no one mention about the heavy subsidised bus fares for students and senior citizens and NSF that we dig out of our own pockets?</strong> Becos we've been doing it for so many years now people take it for granted?! To put it bluntly, even if SBST or SMRT is going to standardise fares to $2 per trip, no one can sue us. Not even MP can do anything if we dun want. But the transportation companies are not going to do that because we want to continue this tradition of helping the community.<br><br>I keep hearing '...before SBS going to increase bus fares again...' sacarstically. I find these people need to re-consider their pt of view and learn how the bus companies runs.<br><br>Cost savings is 1 of my KPI in the line of my work. I can guarantee you that SLWS is trying every bit to save on cost yet squeeze the best to put on the road. Lifespan extension of our equipments yet cannot breakdown. Use after market or self designed parts yet must put our heads on the chopping boards to take accountability to ensure no one dies or get hurt. Not even get hurt, if the bus got smoke case, we will make compensation then tender the resignation and make apology. In short, we say make the impossible become a reality.<br><br>How many people understand our pains. I must say many people understand. But yet there are still some minorities who keep ranting the unreasonable as though they are entitled to everything in the world taking all for granted.[/b]</blockquote>Allow me to add my two peas (don't like saying two cents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  ) to that. I personally feel that low fares and the overreacting public when it comes to issues like this has actually eaten into the service quality of public transportation here (taxis excluded). I can already see SBS Transit trying hard to provide quality service while cutting costs without cutting into corners - buses generally are well maintained, even older buses that should be long gone by now. Yet, also because of this, the finer details often get shoved into the back room, things such as the colour of the lights, mismatched seats and air-conditioning vents, and so on. We can demand better, yes, but are we prepared to pay the price? If you want beautiful, clean, and nice buses, with great bus drivers who are courteous and helpful, and where everything is almost perfection, like those in Hong Kong and Japan, then get ready to pay the fares they are paying (and I assure you that their fares are a few times above where we are right now). Bus companies need the money to buy these things, and they need the money to conduct training for new bus captains (and it's not just about driving buses). As for SMRT, I personally feel that they have decided to instead eat into quality and just care about profits. While I think they should sacrifice some profits for better service quality, however, I think this couldn't have happened if we are less sensitive to fare hikes and be more understanding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway , does the BC need to alert the passenger svc centre that he is going off - duty back to SLBP ?<br><br>cause , i noticed that when BC's are going of svc they honk a few times while making the turn before the 242/194/251 berth . and some green shirt lady/guy sitting in the passenger svc office will wave and the bus will drive off ! all of the buses do that ( i noticed )<br><br>if that is the procedure :<br><br>will the bus rego be recorded down ? &gt; in the peak hours the queue will be long and those sitting in the passenger svc centre would not be able to see the rego so how ?</div>
