People going to Boon Lay chose to take 198/240 (super long queue) over 174 (no. of pax 1 hand also can count) because the berth for 198/240 is right outside the MRT exit while the berth for 174 is at the opposite side of the int.<br><br>2. People going to Jurong West prefer taking 242 over 192/193 (Ave 4) or 243W (Ave 5) because of the same reason. 242 frequency is still the same 10mins interval at night. At the old int 242 DD is only half full, now 242 DD cannot even finish the queue. The queue being long is not because of the freq but because there are more people taking it.<br><br>-----<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">3rd: Bus services like (157,174,199,242) had to make a big round when they were returning to the bus Int.

This is to prevent too many buses from using the short right turning lane at Jurong West St 64 &amp; causing a jam. Currently services using it are 30, 79, 154, 182, 194, 240, 246, 249, 251, 252, 254.<br><br>2. Please note that all SMRT services are using the "big round" route.<br><br>3. This route is only temporary pending the signalisation of Jurong West Central 3 &amp; Jln Boon Lay. If the proposal is approved, these services will turn directly into Jurong West Central 3 from Jln Boon Lay instead of plying Boon Lay Way/Jurong West Central 2.</div>

The interchange looks so cheapskate with short rails unlike the old interchange . the marking on the floor &gt; not many people realise/ notice and even FOLLOW IT ! . what's SBST problem in extending the rail like the old int . look at the 179 berth so small and long queues.<br><br>with the markings it is so hard to identify which queue is for which svc . especially during peak hours  . when the queues are long . &gt; If SBST wants to use the markings and save money on the rails at least write the svc no of the queue on the floor . but the rails would be better and less messey . when the queues are long it is quite difficult to walk you have to cut through here and there .<br><br>at night yes , the 242 queue extends to the mrt exit . then they should use the long rails !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  there was once the 198 and 242 queues clashed as commuters did not queue properly !<br><br>svcs 242 , 199 , 174 , 198 etc could just go straight behind the New community centre like 502 does instead of making one big round . it is not necessary for most of these buses to call at the busstop after shell . not much commuters there . ! if they go by the new 502 busstop way it would be shorter ! .<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>previously, the long-haul services like 30 154 157 174 178 187 198 are placed nearer to the heart of the interchange.<br><br>some, like 157, 174 are so way to the far end that.. for the first time, the 157 i took only had me inside</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They seem to have temporary barriers, those which were used in the old BNL 405/507 days.<br>I see them at the first berth (30, etc), and the last 2 berths. They seem to be there during peak hours only though... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I feel they should swap 179 &amp; 405 berths if they want to make both berths 179 berths in morning peak. This is so that the 179 buses will always go to the berth furthest down, so the 2nd bus can arrive behind it.</div>
