            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I suffered a breakdown on TIB584P on service 804 ( cameo from Svc 811, the one with the svc 969 ad behind the driver's seat ), and I took 40 minutes to return home instead of 15 minutes from Yishun Interchange. The experience made me think that ZF buses tend to break down in a similar manner, and in the light of the numerous incidents, that TIBS Hispano 0405s could not stand the test of time as well as their SBST counterparts, or is it negligient and slip-shop maintainance?<br><br>Well, for those who dun know or unsure what I mean as a "Classic ZF breakdown", here is the last few minutes of TIB584P before it gave up, and the cause, which I'm damn certain, a very faulty ZF gearbox.<br><br>( Timings are approximate )<br>1800: Bus arrives at berth to pick up passengers. Nothing wrong, except after I realised that the usual high pitch whine of the gear in NBS is missing.<br><br>1803: 584 is packed to the brim with pax ( And BTW TIBS, where r the Bendys? Or why is low pax load still used as a reason for not extending svc 806 hours ?) First sign of trouble: The first gear was not caught, and the engine had to rev up for 2 seconds before the bus suddenly lurched forward and accelerated .<br><br>1804: Bus reaches junction, and the retarder came on, but it was very rough and felt like scraping metal from the noise.<br><br>Bus travels at first gear slowly<br><br>1806: Reaches the major junction, and the bus again, have to rev up and then lurch forward as it turned, throwing many off guard. the second gear kicked in later, not before the bus declerate quickly and then lurch with a loud whine. Pax start complianing that bus driver had no license.<br><br>1807: Pull into the bus stop along Yishun Ave 2, again the retarder sounded damn weird, no distinct kicking back of gears but a loud growl.<br><br>1808: Bus starts off again, but it took longer to rev up and "explode" into 1st gear, and the 2nd gear " exploded" into place about 10 seconds later. Pax are really complaining now, and I feel sorry for the driver.<br><br>1809: Reaches the Yishun Ring Junction, sailed through the light and met up with the slope at low speed and at first gear, and the trouble starts<br><br>The gear basically dropped into neutral as the bus could not generate enough power to cause the gear to hold ( It should not be the case in the first place )and the bus slid backwards. There were fortunately, no cars behind. Driver applies the brake and pulls the park brake.<br><br>Driver attempts to release the brake and get the bus to move, but it went back along the slope. The park brake was applied again<br><br>This went on for 4 more times, each time the bus sliding back about 1-2m along the road.<br><br>Finally, the bus driver got smart and held the parking brake while applying full throttle to the engine, and release the park brake ( I guess the needle was reaching red already ). The bus shot forward on the slope due to the forward momentum ( Lucky its 0405, cun imagine what if 584 was a Lance 211 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> But a Scania would do much better ) The gear caught on briefly  but it was enough to pull the bus out of the slope and cruise over the junction.<br><br>1815: The ac had stopped working and the bus vibrated and lurched in short hops towards the bus stop, and the gearbox noise was terrible, it was like coughing and died when the bus reached the bus stop.<br><br>1817: Driver attempts to open the doors, but all he got wwas the psst psst for the front and no response for the rear. He gets out of the seat and presses the emergency door release. The door refuses to bulge and he applied brute force, but it still remain closed (Damn it for the door stay closed feature ). Driver restarts the bus, and tried again. Failed. Pax get panicky, and he valiantly used all his force to pull one half of the front door to its open position, and announced that the bus had broken down, and asked pax to get down.<br><br>1824: Another packed 0405, TIB812G arrived at the scene and pax from 584 starts to fill it to the brim. Again, the bus was stuck there for 5 minutes as the front door of 812 could not close due to overloading. Some pax voluteered to get out and the bus started to speed away. By now, the driver of 584 had opened the rear hatch to ventilate the engine, though the real cause was the gearbox. Pax start to accuse the driver of 584 for not checking the bus, but how the heck do you expect the bus driver to know it will break down and how to check the gearbox ?!<br><br>This account is true, and the features, like a choking gearbox and the doors that could not open, are that of a ZF  breakdown. My experience with a breakdown in a Lance 211 early this year is also similar, but much less harrowing as the gearbox does not change gears and die explosively.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

FYI, I go through that U-turn every wkend and last Sunday, I still dun see the street coming on.

Thats why they could afford to cut some over to 520. Anyway bendies on 520 is quite a waste during that last week. Ridership in the evenings were pathetic.<br><br>The idea of a "supplementary" service to a main service seems to be dropping out of favour with TIBS. 520 was a supplementary to 851 which was dropped. And in this same way 806 is a supplementary to 804. To them, there are several disadvantages to operate high capacity routes in this way:<br><br>1. One extra service planning overhead<br>2. One extra set of service statistics to collate<br>3. One extra planner<br>4. One extra berth taken at the interchange<br>5. More planning efforts involved to direct buses away on days that the supplementary service dont operate<br>6. Other costs involved<br><br>The favoured way seems to be to saturate the high capacity service with buses during the day and remove some buses after dark. That is what is has been happening to service 190 all along and now with 851 too. If there really is going to be a Yishun St 41, that is probably going to be how 804 will turn out - the 4 bendies in current 806 plus the 6 or 7 O405's already in 804, making up 10 or 11 buses (for one feeder service) in all, with a headway of 2 to 4 minutes during peak hours.<br><br>This operation model was used extensively before in 804 during the 90's. Buses had been purposely bunched together. The probable reason why they decided to implement the 806 model was because 804 could not have bendies when the bendies were made available. Once 804 can hold bendies, their original plan (to use bendies on 804 to solve the load problem) will probably take over.</div>

Even today,it is an undisputable fact that during the peak hours, 806 had replaced svc 804 as the main feeder, judging from the load, and the frequency was further decreased this week to prevent situations where the buses had to skip stops as they were packed to full capacity.<br><br>It must be recognised that svc 806 (804A ) started out to "help" svc 804 back in 1997, and thus it was a peak hour service all along, but TIBS saw that 804A is here to stay because of its popularity, hence the renumbering to svc 806 on 1st January 1999. It continued to be a peak hour until 15 Feb 2000 ( I will always remember the date ! ) when an appeal by the principle of Huamin Primary, Mrs Marican through A/P Ho Peng Kee, forced TIBS to make 806 a partial full feeder and call at the bus stop outside Blk 349. That waqs a milestone, and admittedly, the pax during non-peak was pathetic.<br><br>However, the load picked up and a permanent bus stop was built at a god-forsaken location before the traffic light, and was called os. Huamin Primary cos the school can be seen, and students can cut through the field directly. However, as time goes by, TIBS realised that the main pax were not the students, but the residents in blocks 349, 350, 351 and 352. Thus, the bus stop was shifted to the present position early last year, and the shelter was the old orange type. The pax began to pick up and residents started to appreceiate a bus stop that is so convenient ( TropicalSQ744 would attest to that fact ).<br><br>The bus stop was confirmed and LTA started to replace the bus stop with the current grey type in September last year ( I remember it cos it was during my Prelims ).<br><br>Now, that you had the history clear, do you still think the few pathetic 0405s + 0405Gs would do the job? Don't forget the loading time, and bunching would inevitably occur with high freq + high load factor, and soon, pax would have TIBS on the coals again for bunching up buses.</div>

Or is it that you are too anxious to see bendys on svc 804? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
