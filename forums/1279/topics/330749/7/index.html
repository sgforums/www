              <p>YES, that was what he meant. You'd most probably had not done any homework by looking up at the map, which can actually help you plan where it's most feasible to take. Actually I think it doesn't kill to bring along a map for bus spottings.</p>

              <p><strong>f1 car photo taking?! @ Suntec Ctiy
                  bridge?!!<br></strong></p>
              <p>Wow, those cars are going at 330lm/h, so fast and its at night.
                  How do i get a pic of my Ferrari then? Heres how i did it.<br> <br> First of all, u'll need ear plugs. As most of the time you'll end
                  up be sticking your fingers into your ears and you can hardly snap
                  any pic. So Lets stuff those <strong>ear plugs</strong> into our
                  ears first.<br> <br> The follwing applies to DSLR camera users For those with DSLR,
                  you'll have absoultely no problems getting your shot. But u'd have
                  to have a fast finger for that DSLR shoot button. zoom tiak tiak
                  tiak ( three shot tap) is how it works. try a few shots to see how
                  fast ur DSLR can react. shd be dang fast. and u'll do fine 
                  Settings can refer below. Belwo is for compact camera users like
                  me,<br> <br> For compact camera users , first thing to do is go to your
                  <strong>shutter burst</strong> mode. At this mode, Your camera
                  essentially can shoot many pics at one go. Under M settings play
                  around with your ISO to get a highest shutter setting. At there u
                  can go up to shutter <strong>1/500</strong> with ISO
                  <strong>400</strong> (grainy pic is inevitable). I left my
                  aperature at <strong>F/2.6</strong><br> For DSLR users, i was advised that u shd try f stop 6 or 7 for
                  typial night shooting of fast moving objects.</p>
              <p>After that is a matter of using ur ears, detect the car coming
                  and just hold the shoot button for at last 5 seconds and the camera
                  will just go tiak tiak X14 shots  If u r lucky the F1 car u
                  want will appear in the middle of your shot. lol. its a game of
                  lottery for compact users. But good news is practice laps are
                  usually done many times so u'd have many many chances to get the
                  shot.</p>
              <p>And one shot shooting (normal shooting) will not work. because
                  compact cameras react slow. so the advice here is to use shutter
                  burst. I shoot at about 1 sec before F1 car appear. Watch ur
                  compact camera screen as u shutter burst, you can see the car
                  appear on screen if u success.</p>
              <p>yup thats how i did it. u guys try it too.</p>

              <p>i had mentioned turn 6 in my post. it was reported wrongly. it is turn 7. at turn 6 is where cars go around 280 km/h, urn 6 also mans near millenia walk there. I meant turn 7 at nicholl HW there.</p>
              <p>i went turn 7 to se the cars slow down and then pick up on speed. thats where u can hear the cars braking n acclerating. a good mix of sounds.</p>

              <p>It seems the same for buses as well. Do try a few shots before they remove the strucutres and lights. <br><br>I will make it a point on f1 season that when they test the lights a few days before hand the race, one should go down to the f1 circuit n shoot buses in the lights.</p>

              <p>Hahha want to comment on the race ehre huh..really OT but ok lah allow lor</p>
              <p>Anyhow the lollipop man and massa thing, is their problem.</p>
              <p>what is important is game theory and streategy that helped Renault win the race.</p>
              <p>this is Reanult's game.<br>Know: veryone is going to keep 2 the usual strategies. pit in at prob laps 15 or above. Also he is in 15th place start so he'd have to catch 15 cars. Some other constructor may put soft typres n pump less fuel for other fast strategies but these will worsen the case.<br><br>game solution? Do something out of the ordinary.</p>
              <p>First account that some folks will want to put soft tyre n pump lesser fuel so car can go faster. do that. jump a few cars in first 12 laps.</p>
              <p>Next come in ard lap 12 to pit n maybe chnage tyre n add fuel. first 12 laps see how the track is turnining out.</p>
              <p>I dun think " hope for accident n safety car b4 first 15 laps was in their plan" <br><br>If can after lap 12 use soft tyres and LOTS of fuel until lap 55 like that. Jump maybe 10 cars. but have a 30 sec lead  Cross fingers maybe jump 11 cars n end up in top 7 with 30 sec gap ...lol<br><br>at 55th lap go in pit stop do hard tyres n super low fuel load. Zip ard the track like a madman n hope for 4 or 5th place finish.</p>
              <p>thats my streategy.<br><br>anyhows the lap 13 wham bang action ...<br>Reanult's other car drivne by some young chap see to have some rear control problems. He comes out of this turns and the rear clips the wall. The cars does a 360 on the spot and rams its rear into the other wall as the guy jams brakes. Iornic this renault accident calls out the safety car and all is won for Renault n that Spainaird guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that was a stoke of luck and played into their overall game plan</p>

              <p>When  toyata came in to pit after some 50 laps, their fuel guy also dragged a bit. As he also almost din get the fuel thing out.  Was it a problem with the fuel rigs for some teams? Not sure if the lollipop man wd have much help here.</p>

              <p>they have to kan cheong as being in the pit stop very long will mean cars will overtake u in position on the track. generally pit ur car in if u see a 26 sec gap between places to ensure u dun lose ur lead.</p>
              <p>Of these 26 secs, the pit stop guys have to change tyre, add fuel , in 4 sec. Racers have to go a 60 miles an hour speed limit along pit lane for safety reasons. So gg to pit stop must be fast.If not u waste time there u lsoe the race.</p>

Actually, 1 stop streagy seems to work at singapore track given the lenght of the track and 3 stops are still fine, it seems that the old streagy will not work everytime. the red team need to improve on their stabilty seriously....</p></div>

              <p>I knew the cars will never go past 300km/h, they were running highest-downforce configurations. (less straight-line speed, more corner speed)</p>
              <p>By the way, it was Coulthard's Red Bull and not a Toyota. The lollipop man raised the lollipop.</p>
