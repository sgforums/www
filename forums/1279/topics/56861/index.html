            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, actually the emergency windows are made differently. They are far stiffer and more brittle. Go observe it, tap on the windows desginated as emergency and normal windows, you'll realize that the emergency window is much stiffer. Also, if you observe, when the bus is in motion, the normal windows actually flex while the emergency ones a lot less.<br><br>I think the normal windows are far tougher then the emergency windows, they won't break as easily as the escape ones.<br><br>And if you are a fit person who is normally agile, not obese, you should be able to jump from the second deck with no injuries at all. It's actually quite a short drop of only 2.8 meters, less if you hang off the edge before letting go.</div>

In fact, a normal person exerting a decent 50N of force on it can easily make a rather huge dent on the aluminium body, depending how much the hammer goes into the material and the struts.<br><br>Sorry to whoever it was i dun think your logic would hold water and shatter, the only and precise reason why it vibrates less is because it has a large sticker on it that binds the upper surface of the solid mixture of molecules of the glass together, hence, the movement of adjacent particles would be restricted or rather reduced as the vibration we observe is the temporary shifting of the molecules, thus the glass would appear to be "stiffer". As a result, as the glass pane is subjected to the same deformation force as the others, the energy that is not done to vibrate the molecules due to the restricted vibration is transferred to other parts or lost as very minute amounts of heat as the particles gain internal energy, according to the first and second law of thermodynamics<br><br>The elasticity constant of tempered glass is lower than that of the normal lead glass that we use normally, hence a large force would cause a minimal expansion of the glass and the force transmitted is sufficient to cause the resin or mixture the molecules are bonded to to shatter and crack, causing the resin, and the resin with the attached molecules and particles with fall collectively, thus there is no , or very minimal glass powder when broken, thus it is also known as safety glass.</div>
