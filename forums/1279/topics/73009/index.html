Many of us do not even bothered to look at the panel, and many of us do not bother to check our easilink transations. For me, I had checked only once.<br><br>Can you show us your last 3 transactions? I would like to know if it captured a complete (boarding and alightting time) 157 transation. And I would like to know if it captured a complete (boarding and alighting time, or none) of 88 transaction. And what is the boarding time of your 56 transaction?<br><br>I am not familiar with the operations easilink system, perhaps someone can tell me:<br>a. If a bus changed its services number, example if SBS9367H previously was operated on SBST 56 yesterday, and today it operate as SBST 88, did the bus captain need to configure/set anything on the easilink panel?<br><br>Perhaps the bus captain of SBS9367H did not reset the easilink system on his bus to Servie 88? And perhaps there is a time lap (bus captain  did not set the time) between the reall time and the time on the system, and that's explain your rebates?<br><br><span style="color: red;">[however I would feel the easilink system should be using its common system time, and not the time register on each easilink on each bus]</span><br><br>And you have to retap again while alighting from SBST88, could be because you had really mis (not intentionally, but the panel just not sensitive enough to register your tap) the tap while boarding.<br><br>If easilink system still require manual operations from bus captain to perform necessary settings/configurations, I must really check my easilink transactions more frequent.<br><br>Just a sideline question, do SBST and TIBS still have bus inspectors going round Singapore to check for bus leakages? I have seen none on TIBS buses, and I have only seen them on SBST buses many many months ago. Perhaps it's time for me to dig up all my coins......., what's the lowest fare to pay by cash???</div>
