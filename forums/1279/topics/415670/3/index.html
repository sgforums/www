              <p><br> This is my final post to this though, and I will not reply anymore
              because we are deviating away from the topic.</p>
              <p>KTPH to Sembawang takes about 4km+ if you walk straight from
              KTPH following the MRTs line, or you walk via the 969 way might be
              faster. KTPH to Sembawang alone doesnt take more than a few hundred
              meters, more than that, What I was referring to is those ppl whose
              homes are hundred meters away from the hub/shopping mall cannot
              walk but take buses. These are the ppl I call lazy. and yes I have
              no right to call ppl lazy but they complain about bus frequency and
              don't think of solutions don't call lazy what do I have to
              call?</p>
              <p>and also T1/T2 and T3, You judge yourself whether can walk or
              not, I won't go further.</p>

              <p>The problem with SMRT Buses currently is wrong timing at the wrong time.Always i notice 7-9 S67 buses passing with an average of 5 mins during 1700-1750hrs and sway2 the buses after 1800hrs always stucked with full loads and to worsen the problem only rigids when the crowds came in.Its true just look at 960,The deployment of the rigids on Weekdays is absurb,4 rigids at town area during PM peak towards WDL while the front bendies are not even fully seated!Certain services like 171,980 need huge improvement.171 need at least 2 perm bendies during peak and ditto for 980.</p>

              <p>Yeap if we follow by population all bus services in SG need high capacity buses but the truth is whether the bus co want it or not.As for me the real problem lies during peak and Weekends only.Ever saw Yis feeders nearly empty during off peak.There must be a balance.Its true bendies and DDs carry extra pax but when come to maintenance and parts they cost almost double as rigid does..</p>

              <p><strong>A little observations on SMB133K. Took from Changi Airport Terminal 3....</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&gt;</strong> Bus was 1/6 full before it pick up passengers to become 2/6.<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Bus was 4/6 full when it left Terminal 1 for Terminal 2...<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Bus left CGA Terminal 2 with 6/6 full...<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Bus reached Yishun and still managed to bring passengers to their destinations! </p>
              <p><strong>What did SMRT do?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&gt;</strong> 2 OCs gap were quite close...and 1 unknown OCs also did down route.<br><strong>&gt;</strong> After that 3 OCs @ CGA, the next bus was @ Yishun, TIB504X which were quite full. <br><strong>&gt;</strong> Behind 504X, SMB119C or SMB120Y was following up but never bunch up.</p>
              <p><strong>Other info...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&gt;</strong> SMB133K WAB logo doesn't use the card but stickers which stick to the corner of the bus. Please don't peal it ;)<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Height of the WAB is about the same as SMB1H WAB logo.<br><strong>&gt;</strong> Doors were stick to show that the bus is a WAB svc.<br><strong>&gt;</strong> No stickers to the person in wheelchair to press the WAB bell..</p>

              <p>Another suggestion is to give 3-4 duties to AMDEP,Useful for trips start at CGA(Ala 36 style) and also better for trips terminating at Yishun(858A).</p>
              <p>75 &amp; 960 another good candidate for AMDEP to control minority of the duties.</p>
