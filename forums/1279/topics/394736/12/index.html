                  <p>case-by-case. some routes will need more buses, and certainly for overlapping splits like you've said. other routes will require less as they're cutback due to duplication.</p>
              <p>for Phase I it does appear that fleet requirement will increase for most of the proposed services.</p>

              <p>as long as drivers need to park his driver somewhere, he needs a
              lot. additional routes mean more lots required as more buses need
              to park, unless you convert all of them to loop service, which
              defeats the purpose of shortening it in the first place. it'll be
              worse when their mealbreaks come. can you eat fast enough before
              the next guy comes? headway will be very huge then. :(</p>
              <p>of course, if you're still not convinced, sign up as a timetable
              scheduler in SBST or SMRT (but SMRT interchanges no parking issues)
              and try to produce schedules not requiring more than 1 lot for a
              service at each end (or 2 lots for a long route with jumpbus).</p>
              <p>sawtooth berths manage lots in a better manner by pooling them,
              jumpbus can reduce lots usage during mealbreak hours, but splitting
              services will not.</p>

              <p>True enough, I am not sure of this anyway, how to sign up as a timetable scheduler? Maybe I just simply thought of less amount of bus plying a particular route because it is shorten and there is no need to have the same amount of bus as before, which has a longer route distance in order to maintain the frequency = less use of number of berths which can be channelled into other services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Put it in this way, would one need like 8 buses to ply on Service 354? Do you think that plying 8 buses on Service 48 is enough? Maybe not so fair because one is loop and the other is 2 directional inter town service. But the total distance tells a lot.</p>

              <p><br>overlapping portion might see the same resources allocated. frequency and demand of the splitted portion will be a key factor here.</p>
              <p>Example say i cut 147 into 2 - Hougang to New Bridge Rd and Clementi to Sungei Rd(Loop). Current frequency is 7-9min peak using 33 buses. If its split up the former route may still retain the frequency of 7-9min using 18-20 buses. Current AM Peak run time is 76min to NBR and 65min to Hougang.</p>
              <p>The other portion, where demand is lower, can still operate at 10min freq (due to QoS) with 13 buses. Current run time is 58min to Clementi and 60min to Sungei Rd. If not bounded by QoS 11 buses will do.</p>
              <p>Whether resources will remain the same, reduce or added also depends on the regulations that the bus service needs to fulfill also.</p>

              <p>I personally think that the authorities should really collect feedbacks or even observe the demand patterns before they really make the cut.</p>
              <p>Take for example, if 147 is going to make the cut, where do you make the cut?</p>
              <p>New Bridge Road terminal or Queen Street terminal or even Serangoon Interchange as proposed.</p>
              <p>For this route, it is sure to affect many people especially the elderly.</p>

              <p>Terence, I don't think rail lines can achieve the kind of
                  dominance as people are less willing to walk further in the
                  tropical climate. Subways need to be perceived as efficient and
                  regular; a 6-minute off-peak headway is like Kaohsiung Metro, a
                  three-car two-line system relegated for "exceptional" users who do
                  not yet have the capability to commute by motorcycles or

              <p>That is why the hub-spoke system is effective in cities like Tokyo and European ones, because their rail network is fast, efficient and reliable.</p>
              <p>Although the local ones are fast, slightly reliable, but not too efficient. Hub damaged, spoke sure gets affected. The hub needs to be strengthened before the spokes can be placed.</p>
              <p>Why Tokyo so 'few' buses (which is not really few, there are other railway companies running bus routes like Keio, Keisei, Keikyu and Kokusai Kyogo) is mainly due to the effective rail network. It was once at over-saturation point (90s to mid 00s), presently just able to cope during rush hours.</p>
              <p>That is why they can afford sparse buses, Alan knows this as well haha~</p>

              nearest bus interchange.</p>

              <p>That is why the hub-spoke system is effective in cities like
              Tokyo and European ones, because their rail network is fast,
              efficient and reliable.</p>
              <p>Although the local ones are fast, slightly reliable, but not too
              efficient. Hub damaged, spoke sure gets affected. The hub needs to
              be strengthened before the spokes can be placed.</p>
              <p>Why Tokyo so 'few' buses (which is not really few, there are
              other railway companies running bus routes like Keio, Keisei,
              Keikyu and Kokusai Kyogo) is mainly due to the effective rail
              network. It was once at over-saturation point (90s to mid 00s),
              presently just able to cope during rush hours.</p>
              <p>That is why they can afford sparse buses, Alan knows this as
              well haha~</p>
              <p>Oh and there goes my 1000th post, spending an average of 1000

              <p>yes yes.... the people there can walk to the train stations because the distance is too short for spending a fare of like Â¥200 to take a bus (comparable to a rail fare of a longer distance), but the distance may not be short in our context.</p>
              <p>in fact, i also agree that because most buses do not come often there anyway, people would rather walk. dunno when will go back again.....</p>

              overlapping portion might see the same resources allocated.
              frequency and demand of the splitted portion will be a key factor
              here.</p>
              <p>Example say i cut 147 into 2 - Hougang to New Bridge Rd and
              Clementi to Sungei Rd(Loop). Current frequency is 7-9min peak using
              33 buses. If its split up the former route may still retain the
              frequency of 7-9min using 18-20 buses. Current AM Peak run time is
              76min to NBR and 65min to Hougang.</p>
              <p>The other portion, where demand is lower, can still operate at
              10min freq (due to QoS) with 13 buses. Current run time is
              58min to Clementi and 60min to Sungei Rd. If not bounded by QoS 11
              buses will do.</p>
              <p>Whether resources will remain the same, reduce or added also
              depends on the regulations that the bus service needs to fulfill
              also.</p>

              <p>bro, because west side cannot make use of New Bridge Rd going by inverted direction, what if it becomes Clementi - Marina Centre to boost ridership? :( sometimes there just isn't enough terminals in town to do anything nice.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, cutting a few of these services do indeed benefit the LTA. BUT the inconvenience they cause to the public is worse than their intended benefit. Let's take a few services for example and maybe some things I would suggest if necessary:</p>
              <p>If Service 16 were to be cut, it is impossible because though the people travelling to the east (meaning Bedok and Marine Parade) from Bukit Merah is not so demanding, there are indeed people from the Bedok, Marine Parade, Joo Chiat and Dunman stretch who have to travel to places like Nicoll Highway and Orchard. Unless they do shorten 16 to the Stadium Link OR split it into 2 services which terminate at Stadium Link and Marina Centre OR in an extent the commuters are forced to take the CCL.</p>
              <p>If Service 61 were to be cut, I wouldn't mind, as VERY FEW people actually bother to even take 61 from Bukit Batok to Kallang Bahru since 985 provides a faster link. For 61, at least splitting the service into 2 would not be as murderous, as the demand is acutally more in certain places than others. For 61, it can be split to terminate at Marina Centre for the Bukit Batok stretch and New Bridge Road for the other.</p>
              <p>858 was a service mentioned in the article. But for long-travel distance services like 39, 161, 168, 858, 965, 969 and maybe even 853C and 854, it is impossible to cut them. Because there are sure to be a considerable amount of people travelling from the Point A terminus to the Point B terminus. And for 858, if it were to be shortened, it defeats the purpose of the recent Sembawang amendment. The least they could do is actually allow the drivers to take a 10 minute break at CGA PTB 2 (which is what I saw on the 1st day) before leaving for WRI, thus, making the 170 minute run time actually seem shorter for the drivers. </p>
              <p>Lastly, if services were to be split or shortened, the LTA has to take into the consideration of the parking spaces allocated for the bus services as some interchanges are already faced with lack of enough parking space, like Marina Centre Terminal and New Bridge Road terminal to name a few. So the splitting of the services might cause a congestion at the terminals and delay the time even more.</p>
              <p>And what's more, what will happen to the drivers of these affected services? If 61 were to be affected, will some drivers be forced to be SMRT Standbys or will they have the alternative choice to go over to an SBST service that follows part of 61's route?</p>
