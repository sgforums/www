              <p>I'm saying is MRT capacity during peak hrs. Say the 30 min peak
              hr slot bet 0815 - 0845 (Based on RFP), the max EWL or
              NSL passengers is 16,800 per direction based on 2.5 mins &amp;
              max 1400 ppl.</p>
              <p>As for the station, I've a feeling CCL platform is built long
              enough for 6 carriage. Those who took e CCL standing in
              front might have noticed the straight lining of the platform is
              very long.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, the design of the station had never meant to be enough for even 4 carriage. Look at the station first, all PSD are filled with a door, not like LRT station where it is possible for up to 2 or 3 cars I think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, saying to that, it seemed to be a hint of more LRT lines in future? Seriously I wonder how MRT lines are going to be extended after North Shore (Coast) Line (The most famous rumoured line -- serving between CGA, PSR, PGL, Seletar and Sembawang) , Seletar Line (Rumoured line serving as NEL reliver, most likely covers Seletar - Jalan Kayu, Sengkang West, Serangoon Gardens, Geylang Bahru, and all the way down to CBD), Holland Line (Serve between Orchard, Ulu Pandan and BBT / CCK --- another rumoured line). By the way, Downtown Line, Thomson Line and Eastern Region Line are considered as the "3rd batch", where the earlier 3 mentioned are the upcoming "4th batch" MRT lines.</p>
              <p>The 1st batch MRT lines should go to EWL and NSL while 2nd batch MRT lines is NEL and Circle (Consider that the CCL phase 1, originally Marina Line, covers DBG to Stadium is planned to open at 2006, 3 ~ 4 years after NEL)</p>

              <p>Yes. You are partially right. The CCL frequency is not very great. The demand is usually the Stage 1 - 3 as they serve the CBD to the heartlands.</p>

              <p>But it's very subjective depending on people's travelling pattern.</p>
              <p>But for sure, CCL's demand might be very very low on weekend. Something SMRT might have to be mentally prepared.</p>

              <p>Cant be. Yes, it is a medium demand line because it was planned as Marina Line consist only 6 stations which is the now CCL 1, but the frequency cant be 4 mins as they can just simply buy more trains and possibly share depot in Gali Batu if DTL is under SMRT (Which is way bigger than Kim Chuan, for downtown ones) assuming lack of space in Kim Chuan. I remembered that when they built Botanic Gardens, they have also built a cut-box tunnel there for reserve Interchange. Maybe there is a connection there? Who knows!?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is certain is that this cannot be done in NEL even they buy extra 25 trains instead because the train signalling system is not that fast. The CCL one has a faster responsive system, AFAIK despite the real problem is the lack of trains, and consider the Marina Bay Extension, which is like ...???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also wonder who the hell had suggested the epic failure Marina Line because there seemed to be no space for depot? Share with NEL? Hell no who ask them use 3rd rail instead of pantographs used in NEL.</p>
