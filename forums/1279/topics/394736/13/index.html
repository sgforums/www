              feedbacks or even observe the demand patterns before they
              really make the cut.</p>
              <p>Take for example, if 147 is going to make the cut, where do you
              make the cut?</p>

              <p>In my opinion, cutting a few of these services do indeed benefit
                  the LTA. BUT the inconvenience they cause to the public is worse
                  than their intended benefit. Let's take a few services for example
                  and maybe some things I would suggest if necessary:</p>
              <p>If Service 16 were to be cut, it is impossible because though
                  the people travelling to the east (meaning Bedok and Marine Parade)
                  from Bukit Merah is not so demanding, there are indeed people from
                  the Bedok, Marine Parade, Joo Chiat and Dunman stretch who have to
                  travel to places like Nicoll Highway and Orchard. Unless they do
                  shorten 16 to the Stadium Link OR split it into 2 services which
                  terminate at Stadium Link and Marina Centre OR in an extent the
                  commuters are forced to take the CCL.</p>
              <p>And what's more, what will happen to the drivers of these
                  affected services? If 61 were to be affected, will some drivers be
                  forced to be SMRT Standbys or will they have the alternative choice
                  to go over to an SBST service that follows part of 61's route?</p>

              <p>1. Dont forget people in the Tiong Bahru area though, the only hope for them to MP and bedok is this bus, and the fastest link to town, cut this service off, people will complain, and judging by the way it goes, should be the fastest one to Mountbatten/TK area</p>
              <p>2) If 61 is affected, where is the place it will end at? </p>

                      I fully agree. I don't think LTA knows any better than SBST and SMRT in terms of identifying the current issues of public transport and to think of effective solutions to improve. Whatever decision made should strike a balance between commuter needs and companies viabilities - vs service, fares, concession and the company's economic viabilities.
                      
              
                      I believe our two public bus operators are currently doing fine though there's still room for improvement. The intro of Short-Working trips (SWT) is a good move by our bus operators to improve service during peak hours and deserves praise.

              <p>Usually people wont want and used to do such non-integrated interchanges, becuase this would be the first ever case of non - integrated interchange in MRT history. Well, not so, but actually technically is one such. Maybe the official first such example is at Bukit Panjang, which seriously, I wonder why the LRT station has 4 lifts for both sides (2 platforms), could not they just shutdown 1 from each side and renovate the lift to the basement transfer hall, and upon completetion, close down the remaining 2 lifts for such and ta da --- intergrated interchange, slightly better than CCK, but not as good as Sengkang / Punggol. Such a simple thing also cannot think, LTA you SUCK!</p>

              <p>- 1, because more money side is going to change soon, the fare structure is likely to have a big revamp, just that they should have announce the new fare structure before announcing such intentions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is an example of satisifed on current situation and did not bother to improve on existing products. Sigh......</p>

              <p>Do you think that the current service is perfect? No, I dont think so. So in fact I am happy to hear about changes, and that has nothing to do with my political affliation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But my main concern is they should not split for the sake of split. Those buses that are ultra long but mainly expressway should have remain as it is.</p>
              <p>I understand the fellow forumers concerned about the profitiblity and even if initally it looks cheaper fares (Or the same), but in the end shorter routes = profit not as before because a bus operator in per passenger theory is that a need to operate 2 buses or more (from 2 or more services)  in order to reach a ultra long destination (Each passenger got different destinations and so you roughly get my idea) compared to 1 if the "direct service" are cutted down or axed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the reason why I put "direct service" is that these services are direct as in no transfer involved and one can sleep in the bus peacefully etc but consider this:</p>
              <p>Service 81, Tampines, Pasir Ris, Serangoon. Seriously, do you think this way is direct towards Serangoon? Maybe for Tampines - Pasir Ris or Pasir Ris - Serangoon is direct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also understand that earlier someone pointed out that more new services = need of more bus berths in the interchanges despite the number of bus plying in a shorter route is likely to be reduced, in order to ply the other new services, and of course with the continuous buying of new buses is adding the problem as well which was stated of a formula of headway and such, and I tried to understand it as more new services with different frequencies due to different level of demands = more of the time where the buses coming in and out of the interchange instead of the current system where more buses are outside of the interchanges and thus = need of more berths to cater the services and it can be a problem as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe, someone should have created a more complete post regarding the proposed amendment's pros and cons, compared to current system pros and cons, if possible, just like other forumers, compare with their suggested alternatives based on their observation in anywhere else, such as Japan but not limited to. And from there, we can see the pros and cons of each approach and maybe if possible, suggest to LTA if this amendments is so suck...</p>
