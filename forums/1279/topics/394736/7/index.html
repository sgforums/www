              <p id="articlecontent"><span><br>SINGAPORE : The days of long distance bus services in Singapore may soon be a thing of the past. <br><br>Second Minister for Transport, Lim Hwee Hua, said commuters can expect to rely more on short-haul buses that connect to train stations. <br><br>She said this during a ministerial visit to the Kampong Ubi-Kembangan division on Sunday. <br><br>Mrs Lim spent Sunday morning meeting residents and participating in community activities, before fielding a slew of mostly transport-related questions during a dialogue with residents. <br><br>With the Land Transport Authority taking over central planning of bus routes, Mrs Lim took time to explain some key principles - including the need to for bus-train integration. <br><br>She said: "As we now build intensively a lot more rail lines, the 'hub and spoke' - in other words, working from the MRT stations and you have feeder bus services - becomes more viable, and it is a way that most of the other cities which have successful public transport systems have survived on." <br><br>Mrs Lim also told reporters that long bus routes - or what she calls "cross-country buses" - may no longer be needed. <br><br>She said: "We will not introduce new cross-country services, because those are really legacies of the past. But we will review every (existing) one to see whether they need to be sustained." <br><br>"Mrs Lim pointed out that as a bus journey gets longer, it becomes harder to accurately predict its arrival time. Small delays at each bus stop can snowball and lengthen the overall waiting time for passengers." <br><br>And with the Circle Line coming on board next month, even more commuters can be served by Singapore's MRT system. <br><br>Mrs Lim also addressed concerns on the new quota system for vehicles. <br><br>She explained: "If you have a drop in the number of cars that are de-registered, then the number of COEs available obviously goes down. So it is very difficult to say which way it will go. I would say it is driven more by economic conditions." <br><br>She cited two instances when the number of COEs dropped in the past, but prices did not shoot up. <br><br>From next month, the number of COEs available will be determined by the number of cars de-registered. - CNA/ms <br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1046452/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1046452/1/.html</a></span></p>

              <p>That's very true. Singapore is a small country and due to the small land space, stations have to be reduced in length which thus affects the train's car length. Unlike HK and Japan they have 8 cars(HKMTR), 12 cars, 16 cars and 20 cars (JR Narita Line).</p>

              <p><strong>New long distance bus services will no longer be introduced in S'pore<br></strong></p>
              <p><span><br>SINGAPORE : The days of long distance bus services in Singapore may soon be a thing of the past.<br><br>Second Minister for Transport, Lim Hwee Hua, said commuters can expect to rely more on short-haul buses that connect to train stations.<br><br>She said this during a ministerial visit to the Kampong Ubi-Kembangan division on Sunday.<br><br>Mrs Lim spent Sunday morning meeting residents and participating in community activities, before fielding a slew of mostly transport-related questions during a dialogue with residents.<br><br>With the Land Transport Authority taking over central planning of bus routes, Mrs Lim took time to explain some key principles - including the need to for bus-train integration.<br><br>She said: "As we now build intensively a lot more rail lines, the 'hub and spoke' - in other words, working from the MRT stations and you have feeder bus services - becomes more viable, and it is a way that most of the other cities which have successful public transport systems have survived on."<br><br>Mrs Lim also told reporters that long bus routes - or what she calls "cross-country buses" - may no longer be needed.<br><br>She said: "We will not introduce new cross-country services, because those are really legacies of the past. But we will review every (existing) one to see whether they need to be sustained."<br><br>"Mrs Lim pointed out that as a bus journey gets longer, it becomes harder to accurately predict its arrival time. Small delays at each bus stop can snowball and lengthen the overall waiting time for passengers."<br><br>And with the Circle Line coming on board next month, even more commuters can be served by Singapore's MRT system.<br><br>Mrs Lim also addressed concerns on the new quota system for vehicles.<br><br>She explained: "If you have a drop in the number of cars that are de-registered, then the number of COEs available obviously goes down. So it is very difficult to say which way it will go. I would say it is driven more by economic conditions."<br><br>She cited two instances when the number of COEs dropped in the past, but prices did not shoot up.<br><br>From next month, the number of COEs available will be determined by the number of cars de-registered. - CNA/ms<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1046452/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1046452/1/.html</a></span></p>

              <p>Good, I foresee more complaints from commuters in the future, regarding to limited choices, overcrowding and when the rail system came to a standstill. And more protests and complaints and unhappiness about our transport syaytems in future.</p>
              <p>And more people will turn to private transport because they do not have to squeeze with others and make numerous transfers just to get to one place. So to those younger people here, work hard and get your own transport here. And spread this message to your friends out there. The government don't serve for the people, they serve their own agendas to make themselves look good to others over the world.</p>
              <p>They are denying the affordability problems of HDB housing that Singaporeans are facing in future, now they are adding more woes in the public transport to make life harder for Singaporeans. So be wise in who to vote for in future.</p>

              <p>CCL1 stations build so close.</p>
              <p>1 at Bras Basah, another at Esplanade, another at Flyer
              there.</p>
              <p>I remembered which mini star says to build MRT station every
              400m. Come on, Mass Rapid Transit. He wants it to be Mass Tortise
              Transit si boh?</p>

              <p>The main idea of Stage 1 Circle Line is too link the whole of the commercial corridor. I really agree that the stations are really close.</p>
