              <p>If it is the start of sunrise, can forget it already, if you want to reach earlier, (should be about 6+ though) either take the 1st bus to 3rd bus from BM/Bedok, so you won't be late</p>

              <p>well you don't need luck for alternatives. and please read, the answer im replying to includes taking the train. so please stop diverting from the topic. and as you said, if you missed the earlier buses, the later trips will be affected by traffic jams. not to mention about the traffic jams, will the service 16 buses that are not affected by the traffic jams even reach the destination faster than the alternatives given? tell me how can 16 be faster than a train in the scenario given by SBS7485P then? i suggest you read his post over at page 13 again before replying me back via PM. keep posting about this and we're derailing from the topic.</p>

              <p>I believe that through the split of some of the services it will benefit the majority of the bus communters right here in Singapore. Although we are now being forced to make transfer from 1 bus service to the other or from one mode of transport to the other, but i feel that generally, our transport network will improve. Think about the through-fare system that they will be introduced from July onwards, this will help us to cut down our transport fares significantly.<br><br>IMO, it will benefit if they introduce transfer hubs around the city area. Over at these designated transfer hubs, there will have multiple bus berths (or bays) that buses can pull into. And for the buses, they will not be allowed to depart early from the "bus hubs". By doing so, they will then encourage more ppl to switch to public transport as we are now able to make seamless transfer between 2 services by waiting the shortest possible time. Communters who are taking train could also adjust their timings according to the timings provided.</p>
              <p>By doing so, they could also minimise the impact of cutting those ultra long routes. <br><br>Some of the possible bus hubs that i can think of. <br>- Shenton Way <br>- Marina Bay Sands <br>- Marina Center <br>- Outram <br>- Queens St <br>- Orchard (can make use of the CP behind wheelock). <br></p>

              <p>The 3rd point:</p>
              <p>For the elderly, it may (might) be do good for them IF the first bus kena no seat. Then alight at 5 stops later to transfer, and while doing so, they got a seat in bus-stop. The second bus is not as crowded, so got a seat for the next X number of stop..........</p>
              <p>Compared to the whole journey have no seat due to no give way, or there are other elderly as well and the remaining seats need to go up a stairs etc, not convinent mah.</p>
              <p>But the disabled can be a major issue. It may means asking 4 BC/SLs to get their passengers to make way for PIWs due to different buses.</p>

              from July onwards, this will help us to cut down our transport
              fares significantly.</p>

              <p>Hmm, regarding the cutting down of transport fares, i might not really agree... <br>Basically, as there wont be any major changes to the bus transit system other than switching to through-fare and cutting some long routes, the operation cost of the whole bus transit system will still be about the same.</p>
              <p>As mentioned before, the through-fare system is supposed to bring along cost savings to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passengers making transfers</span> by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not penalising</span> them when they make transfer(s).</p>
              <p>So, where does this cost savings come from, since the operation cost is still the same? Could it come from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passengers not making transfers</span>? Will they have to pay more in order to balance out?</p>
              <p>Also another point is for feeder and intratown/townlink services, will the passengers continue to pay a flat-fare or also change to a through-fare system? If its a through-fare system, wouldn't intratown/townlink services be useless since they tend to take a longer route to the other side of the town compared to trunk routes.</p>

              <p>If "transfer" is seen as a "cost", then there must be rebates/benefits to compensate for that....otherwise commuters suffer, or at least the majority will. Its almost impossible to please everyone, in which case, changing this current system might not be such a good idea.</p>

              <p>I believe that through the split of some of the services it will benefit the majority of the bus communters right here in Singapore. Although we are now being forced to make transfer from 1 bus service to the other or from one mode of transport to the other, but i feel that generally, our transport network will improve. <strong>Think about the through-fare system that they will be introduced from July onwards, this will help us to cut down our transport fares significantly.</strong></p>

              <p>I still feel that the North South Line and the East West Line are still most integrated lines. Transfers between these two lines looks efficient and convenient. In Dhoby Ghaut MRT, commuters have to walk a certain distance to make a transfer from North South Line to North East line and that also applies to Outram Park MRT. In City Hall MRT and Raffles Place MRT, East West Line and North South line ply just on top of one another. The order of lines in City Hall and Raffles Place is just the opposite and that is another add point for people to save the effort of climbing the stairs if they have a huge difficulty of doing so.</p>

              I'm against splitting of long routes, except converting long loop services to terminate at nearest bus interchange or terminal.
              Should deploy more mid-trip bus svcs to long routes at times of uneven frequency.
              Depending on situation, some bus trips should be made to bypass certain areas to avoid bottlenecks, so that commuters down the route is less affected by the frequency.

              <p>Now there are more and more articles about the splitting route problems. Below are some unhappiness that came out from the news after surveying:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Not visible for the elderly as mostly have the difficulty to climb the steps, furthermore no gurantee seatings if they have to transfer to either MRT or buses. Taxis are too expensive for them, so no need to say.</p>
              <p>2) More people think that having to transfer is a waste of time, not inclusive of waiting time as it varies. They would rather take the bus instead for some readings, sceneries, sleeps, which all these are hard to do when you are in a very packed train when transfering.</p>
              <p>3) Having asked about transfering from buses to MRT, more percentage of people think that they will still choose buses instead because trains were already so packed, not to even say about saving time. Transfering from a transport to another transport still need time to wait.</p>
