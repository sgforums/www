              <p>The only problem we citizen going to get is a very bad Transport Infrastructure.</p>
              <p>Imagine foreigner trying to travel to one side of singapore to another... take mrt,change bus then change bus then change mrt... by the time they reach the location,they wan to take taxi liao...</p>
              <p>so good for taxi service loh.</p>
              <p>Hope they dun implement this.If this goes,means i have to change 3-4 bus b4 i reach home.Worst then this is? some of the so call short range service is being used by ppl from so many places goin to one central area to take another bus or train.I wont even have time to pant my breath!</p>
              <p>They will say"we will put out more buses for that area".Then nothing will happen... Because they have to email 3 department,10 officers to confirm a meeting to change.Then have a meeting once a week.Then they will put out a "see how" on the situation for 3 months b4 deciding.When they decide,it will take 1 month to inform everyone.Another month for them to acknowledge.</p>
              <p>By the time they change,the bus captains got used to it alrdy.Still they stick to their old Shedule.Nobody knows or care actually.Hahaha</p>

              <p>heck w/ car issue. Even w/ green car, question comes how much
              cars can we have on the road? If there's jam the whole day, how
              'green' is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>As for cars vs public tpt, when u dun have space how is it u're
              going to get urself comfortable vs the bus or MRT when e road is
              jammed? It's like self denial. If you were to look at cities like
              KL, they dun have efficient LRT or bus and the roads are jammed, so
              how? tbh, road tax is dirt cheap there and petrol has to be
              subsidised, do they've $$ for flyover works or build more LRT
              lines?</p>
              <p>As for Hong Kong is because from the British times they've
              focused on it. Ironically did the British care for our
              infrastructure? Dun forget it was only after indepedence that we
              began cleaning everything up. Though I'll say the prev recent tpt
              mini star did no favour w/ their policy to improve anything as they
              allowed more ppl in.</p>
              <p>Over there in HK, you need to prove u've a parking lot before u
              can even own a car.</p>

              <p>1) Wants govt to control jam but not prepared to use high COE price as a deterrant. Use ERP also kpkb. The result? Bus running time esp during PM peak very long these days.</p>
              <p>2) Demand cheap petrol from Govt and scrap 3/4 tank rule. Then where the govt gets $$ to build infrastructure? The KPE &amp; MCE aren't cheap to construct. Subsidy only drains the coffers for development projects and more hardships when oil well dries up. Unless we tell e PAP, to transform Singapore back to 1970s.</p>

              <p>If long haul routes are affected by other traffic conditions and new bus services add more jams to the existing roads, then why not build a comprehensive guided bus system, which only allows for PUBLIC buses to use, and do not add to more traffic woes to the existing roads? Building such systems are more flexible and cheaper than light rail and public bus services can be almost uninterrupted by other traffic conditions.  </p>

              <p>They should build one for every expressway and major roads like Lornie, Lentor, Commonwealth Ave West, Jln Eunos and etc. Force the buses to drive at a constant speed and this can allow for better reliability in terms of frequency when you know that the bus will always travel at 60 or 70 km/h along these major roads.</p>

              <p><br>From the commuters pov, if the authorities want to sell the idea of transferring, the bus you are transferring to has to be reliable, on time, and have a variety of choices transferring.</p>
              <p>Example is I stay at Henderson Rd Blk 116. I have 2 choices to get to Raffles Place/Shenton Way. First is i cross road take 16/851 to Tiong Bahru MRT for a train down to Tg Pagar or Raffles Place. Another is I take 145 down to Harbourfront Ctr and change bus.</p>
              <p>Assuming that I only have the 145 option and I'm not working near Tg Pagar MRT (cos you can walk from Tg Pagar Rd over if you work near there and 145 would be deemed as a direct service). The services i can transfer to would be 10 57 97 100 131. If this option holds true after LTA Ctrl Planning, it would be successful. I have 5 services to choose from and the chances of missing all 5 is only...  say 7%?</p>
              <p>Now that LTA Bus Planning steps in. Assuming the following of the 5 routes were amended:<br>10 cut short to terminate at Shenton Way<br>57 got amended to ply Kg Bahru Rd, Neil Rd and Cantonment Rd<br>97 cut short to terminate at HarbourFront<br>131 got diverted to serve MBS via Marina Bay MRT.<br>You are left with 100. During peak hours if 100 comes within 10min and you didnt miss the bus and traffic is pretty normal, you will still benefit. However, if its off peak hours, and 100 comes every 12-15min, and just so happen the 145 timing never connects to 100, this transferring system would be flawed as your waiting time might be longer than your journey time. If the authorities are looking at peak period its likely that many commuters will benefit. If looking at off peak when demand is lower, there needs to be a timely connection for services at bus stop hubs.</p>
              <p>Under this option the variety of choices is greatly reduced. How to transfer efficiently?</p>
              <p>Another problem with more services around is the lack of parking space in the up and coming interchanges. But that I think we should not go into it as LTA themselves designed the interchange so you can say they are digging their own grave for it.</p>

              <p>I cannot remember the number of times my 168 just nice misses 39 at Jalan Kayu bus stop and the next 39 is like 17 mins away.</p>
              <p>iRIS is only good when the information they provide is accurate and don't have so many glitches from the IDFC. I can easily count at least 250 instances when I sent a SMS to iRIS and the next bus arrival timing as shown on the reply doesn't tally with reality. And I'm not talking about a 1-2 mins. E.g. iRIS says 3 mins but the bus arrives only after 10 mins. If the IDFC is deemed not very reliable then it's time to explore another alternative for the iRIS concept to apply on.</p>
              <p>Options currently look better than reliability. I always wait for less than 5 mins for a bus home from school, because there are 3 options to choose from.</p>

              <p>I think this issue had been pointed out by 
              many fellow forumer. But look things in this way:</p>
              <p>1: A bus 
              interchange typically has 15 to 20 services, while the most at Boon Lay 
              with 31 services inclusive of feeder bus.</p>
              <p>Now, each bus service 
              usually comes at about 10mins, peak hours is less and off peak time is 
              somewhat more than 10 or so.</p>
              <p>Assuming that the waiting frequency 
              had not been cut down drastically, such as off peak hours is every 5 ~ 7
               mins per bus, and peak hours is no more than 4 minutes etc (Like MRT) ,
               with a shorter route means less bus need to ply on the service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg:
               Service 21 is known to have about 29 bus to ply if I did not remember 
              wrongly. If that is shorten, it will not need that much bus, maybe can 
              reduce to no less than 15 bus, and the other no more than 14 bus can be 
              deployed to the new service.</p>
              <p>With a less number of bus plying on a
               particular route, then a usual interchange with 3 ~ 5 bus bays (For the
               one need reversing one, example: 30 on Bedok Interchange OR 31 in Toa 
              Payoh, but not Tampines) can be reduced to 2 and the other few can be 
              used for other services. The similar concept can be applied to other 
              side where having 3 buses or slightly more per "Bus berth / Stop" which 
              the bus have already reversed itself from the centre then come and pick 
              people up. Then, the interchange will be as it is without affecting much

              <p>as long as drivers need to park his driver somewhere, he needs a lot. additional routes mean more lots required as more buses need to park, unless you convert all of them to loop service, which defeats the purpose of shortening it in the first place. it'll be worse when their mealbreaks come. can you eat fast enough before the next guy comes? headway will be very huge then. :(</p>
              <p>of course, if you're still not convinced, sign up as a timetable scheduler in SBST or SMRT (but SMRT interchanges no parking issues) and try to produce schedules not requiring more than 1 lot for a service at each end (or 2 lots for a long route with jumpbus).</p>
              <p>sawtooth berths manage lots in a better manner by pooling them, jumpbus can reduce lots usage during mealbreak hours, but splitting services will not.</p>

              <p>As for cars vs public tpt, when u dun have space how is it u're going to get urself comfortable vs the bus or MRT when e road is jammed? It's like self denial. If you were to look at cities like KL, they dun have efficient LRT or bus and the roads are jammed, so how? tbh, road tax is dirt cheap there and petrol has to be subsidised, do they've $$ for flyover works or build more LRT lines?</p>

              <p>So the root of the problem:</p>
              <p>This city is too overcrowded, stop this population growth and sprunce up the current infrastruture. As simple as that. Everyday before and after work, buses and MRTs are fully packed with people, traffic jams, etc. If this is a scenario of what Singapore is going to be, where some people up there tell us to bear with all these overcrowding, sooner or later, you will see more frustrations within people using the transport system in future. And this is just about the transport system, there are so many aspects that things here are getting frustrating because of this unnecessary overcrowding.</p>
              <p>I rather get jammed within my own space in a car rather than get squeezed and jammed within packed bodies, especially when you are tired and need your own private space after work. Why must I be punished to stand and squeeze with so many people where the public transport structure is so screwed up?</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about history, I am gladly appreciate what was done in the 1970s and 1980s to build up Singapore as a strong and prosperous country. However the story is different after the 21st century.</p>
              <p>Please don't compare a fish and a durain because you are simply comparing two different things althogether. Singapore aims to have a world class transport system, but Malaysia has no intentions of becoming one, even as of the near future. If you want to compare, please compare those transport sysytems in the first world countries. As I have said earlier, if Hong Kong can provide a truly world class public transport system, then private transport there is not an issue. Unlike here, which claims to be "so called".</p>

              <p>VS is only a branch away from Sv 43 and demand is a small proportion of commuters travelling through the Paya Lebar-Tg Katong sector.

              <p>as long as drivers need to park his driver somewhere, he needs a
              lot. additional routes mean more lots required as more buses need
              to park, unless you convert all of them to loop service, which
              defeats the purpose of shortening it in the first place. it'll be
              worse when their mealbreaks come. can you eat fast enough before
              the next guy comes? headway will be very huge then. :(</p>
              <p>of course, if you're still not convinced, sign up as a timetable
              scheduler in SBST or SMRT (but SMRT interchanges no parking issues)
              and try to produce schedules not requiring more than 1 lot for a
              service at each end (or 2 lots for a long route with jumpbus).</p>
              <p>sawtooth berths manage lots in a better manner by pooling them,
              jumpbus can reduce lots usage during mealbreak hours, but splitting
              services will not.</p>

              <p>jumpbus would be good if implemented into every service...</p>
              <p>maybe LTA would want services to terminate at different MRT stations instead to reduce the overcrowding at interchange like some services that terminate a bedok can stop at kembangan...its just a thought...</p>

              <p><br>It is unclear if a direct spilt is made onto existing long bus routes or a certain "overlapping" route will be allowed during the spilt. If the latter option is taken, the resources consumed will actually be more and wasted in the overlapping.</p>
