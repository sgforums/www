              <p>If all these so called ministers are really that serious in listening and helping, public transport would have been longed improved many years back. They should have gone in person to see how badly managed the bus and rail network is being managed now. And the increasing population is adding pressure and woes to many aspects in the country's infrastructure, including public transport.</p>
              <p>Even if they expand the system in future, with the increasing of population in future, relying on one mode of system, will not only add to more overcrowding but more gridlocks as well. Not to mentioned more fare increases in order to recoup back the losses of building and maintaining such expensive systems.</p>
              <p>Seriously, they do only see the surface of every problem. Let's look at the bolded part for examples.</p>
              <p>Not enough bus captains. Have they ever wondered why not many Singaporeans wants to drive buses? Pay structure wise is low. Even if the working hours can be long, if the pay structure can be improved even further, more Singaporeans might be interested. And the recognition of such jobs like bus captains, waiters, cab drivers, etc, have the government done enough? All these are service lines which the service sector will be the main propellor of the Singapore economy in future.</p>
              <p>If long haul routes are affected by other traffic conditions and new bus services add more jams to the existing roads, then why not build a comprehensive guided bus system, which only allows for PUBLIC buses to use, and do not add to more traffic woes to the existing roads? Building such systems are more flexible and cheaper than light rail and public bus services can be almost uninterrupted by other traffic conditions.  </p>
              <p>Obviously, they are just side stepping problems, for their own agenda. And shifting from one problem to another problem to avoid solving the root problem.</p>

              <p><br>Gonna agree in certain aspects. Like this episode, everything also wants to be the best, but forget what is the thing that people really want. Why build such fanciful rail systems where the citizens are so unhappy about the annual fare hikes and the overpopulation right now? they should be focusing in reducing medical costs and other better methods to overcome problems of supporting the citizens of the aging population. Money spend on such systems can jolly well help to subsidise more for ever increasing medical bills, and more subsidies for the poor and elderly citizens.</p>
              <p>No wonder, Singaporeans keep on complaining and they can only complain because they cannot protest or being listened and provided what they wanted. Else those who are persistant in life are or will migrated.</p>

              <p>If Singapore's public transport system has been all along in this state of mess and will be in the future, why should Singaporeans be deprived of their choice to own their own transport?

Most Singaporeans have a lot of things to worry in life, such kind of worries are deemed unnecessary already. Owning a car is also a sense of achievement and ownership too, especially one which has a family and will want to bring the bondage of family ties further.

              <p>heck w/ car issue. Even w/ green car, question comes how much cars can we have on the road? If there's jam the whole day, how 'green' is it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>As for cars vs public tpt, when u dun have space how is it u're going to get urself comfortable vs the bus or MRT when e road is jammed? It's like self denial. If you were to look at cities like KL, they dun have efficient LRT or bus and the roads are jammed, so how? tbh, road tax is dirt cheap there and petrol has to be subsidised, do they've $$ for flyover works or build more LRT lines?</p>
              <p>As for Hong Kong is because from the British times they've focused on it. Ironically did the British care for our infrastructure? Dun forget it was only after indepedence that we began cleaning everything up. Though I'll say the prev recent tpt mini star did no favour w/ their policy to improve anything as they allowed more ppl in.</p>
              <p>Over there in HK, you need to prove u've a parking lot before u can even own a car.</p>

              <p>For the hub and spoke system, I would think that its efficiency depends on how its implemented here.</p>
              <p>Hub and spoke system may require large amount of space at train stations to bring commuters to their homes, the station acts as a 'hub'. Spokes are whereby buses bring commuters to their doorstep/close to their home.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong don't really have a comprehensive hub-spoke system. Long distance bus services still dominate the infrastructure and is necessary because rail lines are slow in progressing.</p>
              <p>I have chosen a town area in Tokyo called Kasai (è‘›è¥¿) for comparison of its spoke (bus) system. Its hub is Kasai Station (è‘›è¥¿é§…) of the Tokyo Metro Tosai Line (æ�±äº¬ãƒ¡ãƒˆãƒ­ æ�±è¥¿ç·š), 97118 passengers per day. One long distance service to Akihabara and others are feeder services, lets take a look at the frequency.</p>
              <p>Akihabara 26, to Akihabara Station (JR Yamanote/Chuo/Tsukuba Express), 14.661 km.<br>ç§‹ï¼’ï¼–<br>ç§‹è‘‰åŽŸé§…å‰�è¡Œ<br>å¹³æ—¥<br>05: <br>06: 15 25 36 47 55<br>07: 03W 10 17 24W 31<br> 39W 47 55<br>08: 06 22 39 56<br>09: 13W 29 47<br>10: 08 31<br>11: 00W 30W 59<br>12: 24 49<br>13: 14W 34W 54<br>14: 18W 40<br>15: 01 19 39 55W<br>16: 08 21 34 49W<br>17: 02W 17 32 47<br>18: 03 21W 40 58<br>19: 23W 49<br>20: 15W 45<br>21: <br>22: <br>23:</p>
              <p>The left column indicates hour, right minutes. Numbers with W indicates WAB bus.</p>
              <p>Now, a feeder service to Nagisa New Town, a short distance away.</p>
              <p>Kasai 24, to Nagisa New Town, 2.690 km.<br>è‘›è¥¿ï¼’ï¼”<br>ã�ªã�Žã�•ãƒ‹ãƒ¥ãƒ¼ã‚¿ã‚¦ãƒ³è¡Œ<br>05: <br>06: 44 59<br>07: 15 29 33 47<br> 55<br>08: 03 08 18 25<br> 35 43 48<br>09: 02 19 32 48<br>10: 04 15 28 43<br> 53<br>11: 08 25 43<br>12: 02 27 48<br>13: 12 37 59<br>14: 25 47<br>15: 04 18 34 47<br>16: 00 16 31 45<br> 57<br>17: 10 22 33 45<br> 57<br>18: 11 25 39 56<br>19: 08 20 37 51<br>20: 05 26 48<br>21: 10 31 55<br>22: 23 50<br>23:</p>
              <p>Almost every other bus in this service is WAB so I leave the W out.</p>
              <p>So what does this show? Feeder and trunk services have to be planned efficiently to avoid clogging up, plus, timings need to be accurate (as promoted, timings may be more accurate if bus services are short, we shall see to that). Townspeople in Japan do not fret when they see timings like above, because they are sure the bus will arrive, if not, apologies from the staff and a note for their employers that their are late because of a bus not appearing, practices that do not exist locally.</p>
              <p>One additional practice that Japan uses when it comes to train/bus frequency is called <strong>utilization</strong>. I doubt many here have thought of this when you cry for more trains and buses. For some peak hour trains yes we can see it being utilized fully, cramming on trains, hitting LTA rated capacity (which is about 250 - 280 percent capacity in Japan urban transport context). Buses wise there are slots in some services that can be reduced, time and money channeled to more useful areas and especially peak periods. One less empty/little utilized bus in off-peak translates to one more bus useful in peak hours. Money is not infinite and hence service needs to be adjusted.</p>
              <p>Oh, and you have not see one service from the same town I mentioned earlier, that has the most sparse frequency (and shows effectively the spirit of utilization), a bus service from the train station to the town's hospital (Tokyo Rinkai Hospital).</p>
              <p>Shinshyu 30, branch line to Tokyo Rinkai Hospital, total route 12.958 km.<br>æ–°å°�ï¼“ï¼�<br>æ�±äº¬è‡¨æµ·ç—…é™¢å‰�è¡Œ<br>å¹³æ—¥<br>05: <br>06: <br>07: <br>08: <br>09: 14W<br>10: 13<br>11: 10W<br>12: 03W 35<br>13: 11<br>14: <br>15: <br>16: 17W<br>17: 04W<br>18: <br>19: <br>20: <br>21: <br>22: <br>23:</p>
