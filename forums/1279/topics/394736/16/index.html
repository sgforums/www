            <div class='col-md body'><p>This is true.<br><br>Example would be Service 30. If Service 30 were to get amended elsewhere or withdrawn or even split up, possible scenarios are:<br><br>- Commuters living in West Coast, Pasir Panjang or Corporation Dr were either had to take alternative services or the nearest MRT to get into their destinations. Alternative services can be a hassle job to some, because transfers in bus and MRT is required to get to their desired destinations. As some had pointed out, the MRT would be fully packed during peak hours and no seats will be guaranteed for them (it means standing on the MRT throughout the journey).<br><br>- The Service would became disintegrated if the 2 routes are to be split up (Bedok - Harbourfront; and Harbourfront - Boon Lay), and at the end of its route, commuters will have to take another bus to continue the route, which will consume more time on travelling (inclusive of waiting time) and had to pay an extra fare. Thus with this kind of scheme to be proposed, regular commuters of service 30 will had to put up with inconveniences, on which it may affect their travelling time and fares.</p></div>

              <p>Dun think splitting of the long route will help also, if they
              dun bother to improve on others areas.<br> 1) illegal parking/waiting of car at bus stop. look at the bus stop
              outside Bishan Mrt.. even they put up barrier, still same
              situation. cars still park at the bus stops...<br> look at the bus stop along Toa Payoh Lor 2 (block 175), there is
              alway long line of taxis parking/waiting there.. treating the bus
              stop as taxi stands and where is the enforcement?</p>
              <p>4) blocking of yellow boxes at bus stops...look at the bus stop
              at AMK Ave 3 (opposite AMK MRT station).. Sv 25/73/261 have to
              filter 3 lanes to turn right to Ave 8/interchange.. but the
              vehicles just all stopped at the yellow boxes and dun give way at
              all.. this also happen at other junctions/bus stops..</p>
              <p>better for LTA to go work on these first, or else, no matter how
              many routes they split, in the end timing also wont be

              The "cat &amp; mouse" game is not effective at all. LTA should install CCTV to catch motorists blocking busy bus-stops or narrow busy streets such as Orchard Turn.

              <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is not splitting up or
              phasing out all long-distance bus services.<br> <br> It is relooking only long bus routes with known reliability issues,
              and where there are sensible midpoints to break, so that overall,
              more commuters will benefit.<br> <br> Making this point, an LTA spokesman said yesterday that there are
              also many long bus routes that do not face reliability problems and
              are not being considered for splitting.<br> <br> He cited those running along the Tampines Expressway corridor, or
              where the ridership is well distributed along a substantial portion
              of the entire route.</p>

              <p><strong>Coming to the end of the long route</strong><br>Existing cross-country bus routes to be reviewed, no new ones will be added<br>by Teo Xuanwei<br>TODAY<br>Mar 29, 2010</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - In time to come, those long bus services that traverse the island could become a thing of the past, giving way to shorter services and transfers that get commuters to their destination in the fastest way possible.<br><br>This is because there is a "really strong" correlation between unreliable bus arrival timings and long bus service routes, said Second Transport Minister Lim Hwee Hua at a community event yesterday.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA), which has taken over central planning of bus routes from the bus operators, is studying these existing "cross-country" bus services which pass through several constituencies to see whether they are really needed now that more rail lines are being added.<br><br>And no new cross-country services will be added as those are "really legacies of the past", said Ms Lim. "The longer the service, the more there will be uncertainty because of traffic conditions along the way that will be accumulated as you get towards the end of the service."<br><br>Ms Lim, who is also Second Finance Minister, touched on this during a ministerial dialogue yesterday at Kampong Kembangan Community Club.<br><br><span style="color: #000080;">To reduce congestion on SBS Service 63, one resident had suggested re-routing some existing bus services or allowing private bus operators to ply the route. The service - which runs from Eunos Interchange to Bukit Merah and back - is crowded with workers from Ubi Tech Park during peak hours, said Mr Wayne Soo.<br><br>In response, Ms Lim said the ideal solution could be to split up the route and have more connecting services.<br><br>The LTA had studied this with grassroots leaders for some time, she said, but those from Tanjong Pagar GRC and Marine Parade GRC had divided views about it.</span><br><br>Mr Soo also gave other suggestions to the Transport Ministry: Changing the displays on buses to make it easier for those with astigmatism and changing the location of bus information displays at bus stops.<br><br>Another resident asked if a new service could be added to take commuters from Kembangan MRT station to Parkway Parade. But Ms Lim said anecdotal demand may not always translate to real demand.<br><br>She related an example in her own constituency - Aljunied GRC - where private estate residents had asked for private-hire buses to ferry them to the main road. However, the service was terminated after three months because of a lack of patronage.<br><br>Ms Lim later told reporters that with more rail lines being added - part of the Circle Line will start operations from next month, for example - the hub-and-spoke model could be a more viable solution in future. Commuters would also be more receptive towards transfers if they could save on waiting time and costs, she noted.<br><br>She said: "The consideration for you would not be 'If I do two transfers, I have to pay so much more'. It would be 'Which is the fastest way to get me from Point A to Point B?' <br><br>"And it may not be the direct service anymore. Because the direct bus service cannot be faster than if you have a train service that can link the two using a feeder service."</p>

              <p>if they want to split bus routes, probably some new services or schemes has to be intro first before dealing w/ long haul rts.</p>
              <p>possibly easily located transfer bus stops, better semi express services and so on. For example Sv 99 from Jurong East Ave 1 to Clementi and transfer to a bigger network of bus svs.</p>
