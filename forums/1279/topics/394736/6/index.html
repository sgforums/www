              <p>Hopeless fool. Don't expect LTA to improve the bus services anyway. Adding new route will cause more jam in the road. What logic is that? The purpose of buses to to serve a large number of commuters. These people should be shot!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>Tat's why even w/ direct bus routes, some form of transfer points might have to be implemented.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, using distance 20km as a decision factor will only create more problems.</p>

              <p><br>Who knows they might come up with stupid idea of splitting 168 into 2 services - One from Woodlands to Jln Kayu whilst another is from Bedok to Jln Kayu?<br><br>Actually the current bus route system is good enough, there's no need to make a big revamp. While I might agree with the govt that there are more cons than pros having too many new bus services I am strongly against the cut of ultra long services.<br><br>PAP is indeed losing touch with the oridnary people.</p>

              <p>Although I feel that this can be quite selfish minded where do not wish to see the ultra long route ply outside my home / school / workplace kena cut and "practical" reason on higher fares due to transfer here and there, which if they live up to their promises, makes no difference like MRT fare structure or sort of, I am supportive of cutting all ultra long routes except those mainly highway ones (Such as 966, 985, 161, 168, 965, 969 etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is because:</p>
              <p>1: Who is gonna to drive such a long routes? People like to say driving can be quite tiring (Personally I disagree, due to an enthu on bus and MRT), but consider that many middle age people are prone to illness including but not limited to diabetes or kidney problem etc and women may need to go toilet often due to XXXX (Which is why female BC and SL are less common, but existant), these routes definitely cannot be ply by these drivers. With the shortage of drivers, they have to go overseas and import "FT" again (Speaker Corner will then complain here and there again, since these more like Labourers rather than Talent because most of us here also more or less know how to drive one such). Hey, this is not MRT where if the driver (Train Officer) is not feeling well, need to go toilet, can just talk to the next station manager to replace him / her and usually they have much less things to cope (Apart of sudden incidents, including but not limited to suicide in tracks or faulty train / system outta of nowhere.) than a BC / SL as they constantly looked around the roads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2: It will be better for needy people. The needy refers to the old, disabled (Especially on non-WAB), sicked and pregnant passengers.</p>
              <p>Firstly, shorter route = faster clean the damn vomit in the bus by the sick, if any such happened. (Even MRT also got lah).

              supportive of cutting all ultra long routes except those mainly

              female BC and SL are less common, but existant), these routes
              definitely cannot be ply by these drivers. With the shortage of
              drivers, they have to go overseas and import "FT" again (Speaker
              Corner will then complain here and there again, since these more
              like Labourers rather than Talent because most of us here also more
              or less know how to drive one such). Hey, this is not MRT where if
              the driver (Train Officer) is not feeling well, need to go toilet,
              can just talk to the next station manager to replace him / her and
              usually they have much less things to cope (Apart of sudden
              incidents, including but not limited to suicide in tracks or faulty
              train / system outta of nowhere.) than a BC / SL as they constantly

              <p>Full operation of DTL (Downtown Line)? Hell, that will be 2013 for Bugis - Chinatown area and Bukit Timah area by 2015. It is expected that Eastern Sector such as MacPherson, Bedok Reservoir, Tampines and Expo sector will only ready by 2016 ~ 2018, then it is considered a full operaton of DTL.</p>
