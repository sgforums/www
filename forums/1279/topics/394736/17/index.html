              Some suggestions to retaining long haul routes and improving its service is to provide more time for restover at bus interchanges. Probably about 2 to 3 buses resting at the bus interchange. If schedule and restover is too tight (hence no allowance), any congestion or bus breakdown along the route may affect the subsequent trips. With about 2-3 buses resting at bus interchanges, the timekeeper may have more flexibility to adjust the subsequent return bus trips timing to minimise any impact on frequency.
              
              How about introducing more Fast Forward svcs? This should not be restricted to weekday peak hours only.

              <p>Maybe spare buses could be utilised frm depots? Not only it gives us bus fans to spot more of these cameos appearing, but it also helps to minimise delays shld there be problems about traffic congestion = shorter queues</p>

              <p> Orange:</p>
              <p>With regards to this statement, the long-haul services to Woodlands should safely fall into this category (ie 161, 168). A breakdown of the stats. showed that:</p>
              <p>161: No. of fare stages = 32 = 25.6km</p>
              <p>168: No. of fare stages = 39 = 31.2km</p>
              <p>(where 1 stage = 0.8km)</p>
              <p>Both the loading upon entering TPE are above average, especially in peak hrs where 168 will have massive boarding along Tampines Ave 4. Travelling time for 168 taken down recently from Bedok - Woodlands is about 1h 5mins, from 10:37pm - 11:40pm, for the off-peak period. Not very sure about the peak though. Timing is quite reasonable. So I doubt that these services will be affected by the planning.</p>
              <p>Purple:</p>
              <p>lol, confirm they are pinpointing at service 30. I had experienced a few times travelling back to the east from HBF during peak hrs. From an iris check dated 25 Feb 2010 @ 7:15pm, the results showed that the bus is arriving, and subsequently 42 mins. The sub bus was very late that after 15mins, there was a SP bus doing downroute from HBF - Bedok.</p>

              LTA where possible should bring back some roadside bus terminals for svcs with long loop and to avoid overcrowding at existing bus terminals and interchanges.
              Roadside bus terminals may look something like an extended bus-stop bay for buses to park without causing obstruction to traffic. Roadside terminals may be unmanned. Of course these terminals should be located at roads where its not congested and roads are wide enough. 
              
              One way to address overcrowding at Boon Lay interchange, for example is to have roadside bus terminals/ stopovers for JIS services at Industrial estates and Tuas and it will loop at BNL Int instead of terminating there. Similarly, svc 179 &amp; 199 may have similar terminals at the campus compounds.

              <p>According to LTA, of the 260 bus routes in Singapore, special bus routes (with a full route of 20km and above) comprises 10% of the 260 bus routes here, mainly services 10, 30, 51, 63, 143, 147, 196 etc.</p>

              <p>63 a long route? 48 stage loop service is as good as 24+24 roundtrip.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>10 &amp; 51 are long indeed as both are at least 40 stages in each direction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, has anyone noticed very few loop services have more than 50 stages unless it plies long express sectors?</p>

              <p>Actually, putting the cut-off at 35 stages is fairer. I don't see how 7, 16, 33 &amp; 156 can be considered long routes. Don't forget 156 was extended to link SKG with the western region.</p>
