              <p>Yah, when more people complain about the MRT peak hour frequency, SMRT will feel stressed becos of the new plan, then in the end when SMRT can't cope with so many people, they will bound to intro new bus services again.</p>

              <p>Are you sure? Given their main focus is rail business and not buses. SMRT will rather take on more rail lines and future rail lines in future in order to maximize their profits. Even if SBST or SMRT wants to introduce new bus services, do you think that LTA will approve them, since LTA will be the central planner in future? I already foresee that this LTA bus central planning is going to eliminate commuters' choice to take public buses in future, forcing everyone to take the rail, in which the rail will become to congested and slow, because of more stations and people. The cycle goes back, commuters gets fed up and buy and drive their own transport.</p>
              <p>They have already planned ahead of what they want in future, do you think they will care about our pleas? So don't pin your hopes too high, study hard, work hard and get yourself your own car in future, instead of keep on worrying about such transport stuff all the time. You will have more important things to worry about when you grow up in future, don't let public transport woes be your burden in life.</p>

              <p>I have to no choice but to say that this isn't a political forum to post your political rants. This is a bus forum, I do not mind a bit of politics regarding the Land Transport but not rantings. There are political forums here in SGF to post your rants. Not to flame you but it's just a feedback.</p>

              <p>Firstly who are the ones that have been controlling and limiting all these aspects in public transport? Why does the public or the commuters do not have a say in improving public transport when such systems are to serve these people and they have to be forced to shallow the hard pill of "changing their mindsets"?</p>
              <p>Territory rules, paying ERP charges are the worst implementations for public transport systems. And who are the ones that are suffering? Commuters.</p>
              <p>Anyway I don't think I have not even gone into the extremes of being political yet, as compared to some of the posts in this forum, yet.</p>

              <p>The most effective way is to LTA, since they want to control.</p>

              <p><strong>End of long service buses?</strong></p>
              <p>LONG-DISTANCE bus routes taking commuters from one part of Singapore 
              to another could be a thing of the past.</p>
              <p>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second 
              Minister for Transport, said on Sunday that all such 'cross-country' 
              services will be up for review.</p>
              <p>No new cross-country bus services will be introduced either,
               she disclosed after a dialogue with residents from Kampong 
              Ubi-Kembangan Constituency, part of Marine Parade GRC.</p>
              <p>Describing such services as 'a legacy of the past', she 
              said: 'We will review every one to see whether they can be sustained, 
              because of the strong correlation between the lack of reliability in bus
               arrival timings and the length of the bus route.</p>
              <p>'As you can imagine, the longer the route, the more 
              uncertainty (in bus arrival timings) because of traffic conditions along
               the way that will accumulate as you get towards the end of the route.'</p>
              <p>The minister was speaking to reporters after a dialogue at 
              the Kampong Kembangan Community Club, during which transport matters 
              took centre stage.</p>

              <p>If all these so called ministers are really that serious in listening and helping, public transport would have been longed improved many years back. They should have gone in person to see how badly managed the bus and rail network is now. And the increasing population is adding pressure and woes to many aspects in the country's infrastructure, including public transport.</p>
              <p>Even if they expand the system in future, with the increasing of population in future, relying on one mode of system, will not only add to more overcrowding but more gridlocks as well. Not to mentioned more fare increases in order to recoup back the losses of building and maintaining such expensive systems.</p>
              <p>Seriously, they do only see the surface of every problem. Let's look at the bolded part for examples.</p>
              <p>Not enough bus captains. Have they ever wondered why not many Singaporeans wants to drive buses? Pay structure wise is low. Even if the working hours can be long, if the pay structure can be improved even further, more Singaporeans might be interested. And the recognition of such jobs like bus captains, waiters, cab drivers, etc, have the government done enough? All these are service lines which the service sector will be the main propellor of the Singapore economy in future.</p>
              <p>If long haul routes are affected by other traffic conditions and new bus services add more jams to the existing roads, then why not build a comprehensive guided bus system, which only allows for PUBLIC buses to use, and do not add to more traffic woes to the existing roads? Building such systems are more flexible and cheaper than light rail and public bus services can be almost uninterrupted by other traffic conditions.  </p>
              <p>Obviously, they are just side stepping problems, for their own agenda. And shifting from one problem to another problem to avoid solving the root problem. Like this was mentioned somewhere, these so called ministers have already lose touch with its people long ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And stop increasing the population. Singaporeans have enough of all these nonsense.</p>

              <p>I disagree. Bus services should remain. Dont cut long haul routes. I believe passengers, we have the right to choose. Okay amend a little bit, for eg, to serve as transferring points at new mrt stations. And not cutting them down completely.</p>
              <p>Remember when the NEL was built. They wanted to withdraw 147. I take 147 from time to time, and i observe that its a really useful bus service, and it would inconvinient everybody if its withdrawn. Same goes to other services.</p>
