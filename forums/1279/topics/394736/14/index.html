              <p>Okay let me see.</p>
              <p>What are the advantages of splitting long routes?</p>
              <p>1. If a direct split is done, perhaps less buses can be deployed or resources can be reallocated to a better use. However, the deployment of less buses is due to certain commuters switching to transfer journeys. I have observed two regular commuters at around 0700 hrs taking 147 from bus stops before my hse at YCK Rd Toho Green all the way to Jln Bukit Merah.</p>
              <p>2. Bus drivers can have more toilet breaks and there will be better reliability of bus arrivals. However, this is under the case whereby the split does not result to loop services. A loop service after a split will have to ply twice of the distance travelled which is almost equivalent to the entire route before the split.</p>
              <p>3. Reduce costs since buses will not have to travel long distances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What are the advantages of having direct long routes?</p>
              <p>1. Direct. Fewer total walking distance to make transfers. This is especially useful for the elderly and during heavy rains.</p>
              <p>2. Buses become a good alternative to train from point to point. With splitting, the role of buses is degraded to just a medium to transport commuters to the "hub" for boarding of the train. If I am not wrong, over 70% of the commuters make direct journeys.</p>
              <p>3. More parking lots available in interchanges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somehow, the only benefit of splitting is the saving of costs due to buses travelling shorter distances.</p>

              <p>1: Direct? "Direct long routes" does not equate to the route is a direct, because 14 is a direct no transfer needed service from Bedok - Clementi, but it is certainly taking loops everywhere.</p>

              <p>Some of my thoughts :</p>
              <p>If they dont enforce strictly to split all very-long routes, but instead to do it intelligently, maybe it would become like what 167 and 882 is now? Basically if few than a certain % of pax travel from start point to end point on the service, might be a wise decision to split instead of linking 2 different routes together when few pax uses it.</p>

              <p>Some of my thoughts :</p>
              <p>If they dont enforce strictly to split all very-long routes, but
              instead to do it intelligently, maybe it would become like what 167
              and 882 is now? Basically if few than a certain % of pax travel
              from start point to end point on the service, might be a wise
              decision to split instead of linking 2 different routes together
              when few pax uses it.</p>

              <p>agreed. but sadly the split is simply done to recoup the additional costs not needed under the throughfare regime. yes, if only the rationalisation focuses more on intelligent cuts that would have occured under the old fare regime as well.</p>
              <p>the plan for Sv 16 will likely be an interesting one. since it merged with Sv 390 in the late 1980s, a lot of changes have occured intending to find the best way to link City with Marine Parade, Joo Chiat &amp; Airport. we had Sv 16E, then came the present-day popular Sv 36 which was plagued by irregular headways &amp; operational issues due to the bus going non-stop the whole day. how to untangle all these mess?</p>

              <p>Bedok to Marine Parade loop is not like 15. 15 goes to Bedok Reservoir and Eunos area then Marine Parade Town Centre while 16 is Bedok Town Centre, Bedok South (Bit of), Marine Parade (Siglap), Marine Parade Estate (Blk 50s, Blk 10s, Blk 30s in Marine Parade Road, Terrace and Crescent -- Where 15 does not cover), then Marine Parade Town Centre. (If it is going to be like what you said)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, there are alternatives for this. 31, 197 generally can cover the stretch of Bedok - Marine Parade excluding the estate in the Blk 10s and Blk 30s, which is served by 196 again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I doubt this sector may be preserved, OR rather, Bedok - Geylang Lorong 1 where the existing Bedok - Stadium remains and detour to Geylang Lorong 1.</p>
              <p>This can be problematic where the portion of Dakota - Stadium is quite overlapping, where the possible 2 is:</p>
              <p>Bedok - Eunos (Via Marine Parade, Joo Chiat Road, Dunman Road, Tanjong Katong Road then follows 30 to Eunos). But there are many services that plys from Bedok - Eunos and the only main benefit seems to be on Joo Chiat Road and Dunman road because Marine Parade have 55 or 15 towards Eunos and Tanjong Katong road people can just use 30.</p>

              <p>S14 is a screwed route by itself. Extend and merge until present day. Splitting is a tough job i find.. One way is Bedok - Tomlinson Rd (Loop) / Bt Merah (even looping or terminating at these 2 places make the route feels long) and Clementi to Geylang Lor 1. Overlapping sector is Bt Merah till Nicoll Highway.</p>
              <p>Another idea is split them into 3 sections.<br>1: Bedok - Marine Parade (Loop) via East Coast Rd, Amber Rd, Marine Parade Rd, Still Rd, East Coast Rd (clockwise direction also can). This retains the links between Bedok Nth residents going to East Coast and Siglap areas, not to mention Temasek Sec and Tanah Merah. I personally feel under hub and spoke LTA will make the Bedok Nth residents take train from Tanah Merah/Bedok to Nicoll Highway/Suntec/Orchard areas.. and beyond.</p>
              <p>2: Upp East Coast - Bt Merah<br>At least this route doesnt feel long. Retains the links between the East Coast/Siglap corridor and Orchard. Bedok Rd ppl going to Orchard either take 10 change to this service or take a bus to Tanah Merah change train. It also retains the River Valley/Lower Delta corridor with Orchard (also covered by 65) as well as the Bt Merah &lt;-&gt; Lower Delta/River Valley corridor (partly covered by 5). Ppl living near Brickworks would have to take a bus down a few stops to transfer to this service to go Orchard, or take 123.</p>
              <p>3: Clementi - Marina Ctr/MBS<br>From Bt Merah turn Lower Delta then Tiong Bahru and follow 195 till Marina Ctr. Which means 195 can be amended and/or terminate elsewhere as the Tiong Bahru -&gt; Marina Ctr sector is pretty weak.</p>

              <p><br>Service 16 was originally plying from Bt Merah to Marine Parade in the past, it was extended to Changi Airport when service 390 was withdrawn in late 1993. I believe that the bus journey from Changi Airport to Orchard was rather long with the route passing through Marine Parade, Old Airport Rd and National Stadium areas.</p>
              <p>Service 16E was introduced as a peak-hour express service somewhere in mid 1995 and was renumbered to service 36 in late 1997. Somewhere in 1998 service 36's route was re-enhanced to its current route and converted to full day trunk service, with service 16 cutback to Marine Parade.</p>
