              <p>I agree, enough of all these nonsense. Rather have your own freedom to go where ever you want directly with much more convinence rather than have to always worry about the services you take being amended, withdrawn, or crowded without improvements and transfers and transfers. Worst is that you have no say over the services changes and you are forced to shallow the hard pill to "change your mindset" where instead the transport operators should adopt the needs of everyday commuters.The only drawback is the cost.</p>
              <p>And don't always blame on congestions and jams, because the overpopulation problem of this city is the root of all these problems.</p>

              <p>I feel that the 20km thing is just a rough gauge of long distance services. If its compulsory that all basic services above 20km has to be cut then Woodlands town can call JB their new orchard road already. No 161 168 858 960 961 963 966 969 to name a few.</p>
              <p>As said in parliament and earlier press releases, the LTA Bus Planning were and I think they still are collecting feedback from the grassroots committees on how they want to tweak or amend their current services in their area.</p>
              <p>Example is 63. One end is under Tg Pagar GRC and the other end is Marine Parade GRC. Proposal is to cut 63 into 2 somewhere in the CBD area. This is due to the no of routes running from Kallang down to city hall/chinatown along north/south bridge rds / victoria st. Tg Pagar GRC ppl were ok with cutting of the route as the proposed route still serves chinatown. However, Marine Parade GRC side oppose the changes as it will terminate at Geylang Lor 1, depriving the people from Macpherson Estate a direct bus to chinatown!</p>
              <p>So in a sense hope your grassroots ppl got do work if not you know who to vote for.. GE is coming... hahaha..</p>

              <p>or we can be more radical. follow your idea of Sv 147 from Hougang to Bt Merah, Sv 198 takes over Sv 147 sector from Buona Vista to Bt Merah, and we can have a CT28 kind of service that goes straight from Clementi to Chinatown using expressways? <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="image"></p>

              <p>Hard. 175 uses West Coast Highway.<br> 61 goes into the lonely and ulu roads inside Commonwealth estate.

              <p>I feel that the 20km thing is just a rough gauge of long distance services. If its compulsory that all basic services above 20km has to be cut then Woodlands town can call JB their new orchard road already. No 161 168 858 960 961 963 966 969 to name a few.</p>
              <p>As said in parliament and earlier press releases, the LTA Bus Planning were and I think they still are collecting feedback from the grassroots committees on how they want to tweak or amend their current services in their area.</p>
              <p>Example is 63. One end is under Tg Pagar GRC and the other end is Marine Parade GRC. Proposal is to cut 63 into 2 somewhere in the CBD area. This is due to the no of routes running from Kallang down to city hall/chinatown along north/south bridge rds / victoria st. Tg Pagar GRC ppl were ok with cutting of the route as the proposed route still serves chinatown. However, Marine Parade GRC side oppose the changes as it will terminate at Geylang Lor 1, depriving the people from Macpherson Estate a direct bus to chinatown!</p>
