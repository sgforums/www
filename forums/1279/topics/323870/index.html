              <p>WEll, I have to admit that the campaign itself is not working as it should. The problem now is that the bus companies have tried their best but it all comes to PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. Sometimes, people don't bother filling up seats and moving in which have cause discomfort for people. One case is on every Friday afternoon at around lunchtime in neighbourhoods. Services that serves 2 or more schools have this problem. We will use Service 962 as an example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>962 runs to Sembawang Drive, where it passes 3 schools with 1 000 odd pupils each. Most people from these schools take the bus to school and back home in Woodlands. The problem now is that School A would have the chance of boarding the bus first, then School B. By then, the bus is full of people; not full to capacity though. The students have left spaces at the rear for 'ghosts' to fill in and when people sees the gap. It really made tempers flare, including mine with some gangsters showing the middle finger and scolding the f$#% word.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, continue with story..</p>
              <p>The bus reaches the 1st alighting 'hot spot'; Sun Plaza and people from School C come onboard the bus, whereas 30% - 40% of passengers would alight. In fact, after the stop, there's no change of effect. Sometimes, it worsens the situation. When the bus passes school C, the bus driver thought that there's no space but there is really space available at the rear! When the bus passes infront of School C, the driver just passes by without stopping and this causes uproars. Students from School C will suffer the most here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A solution is still not suggested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are times where I politely ask the neigbouring school students to move in to the rear of the bus so that my other schoolmates could board and get back home with no delays. This earned me a nickname in school. But, what's with the nickname? My aim is to help. What wrong am I doing. Sometimes, it takes a bit of a quarrel to settle a friend of mine to fill in a seat so that other's could board.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I always wonder this; Am I being too much at helping? Nothing much can be said but I'll leave it up to you to discuss.</p>

              <p>People love to stand near the entrance/ exit, and sometimes they do not even notice the big obvious gaps when people moved back, hence making the SL think that there's already no space when there is space in the middle.</p>
              <p>Unless the SL shouts, the passenger will just block and probably notice nothing about the extra space that can allow more people a chance to board. I remember there's one lion cat wearing T-shirt "please move to the back campaign" in the past.</p>

              <p>Let the sardines, stop more from boarding the bus. Let those who could not board see the ample space at the rear of the bus. And leave it at that.</p>
              <p>There is a slight possibility that those in the bus, and those left at the bus-stop will collectively be educated about moving to the rear of the bus. But I doubt so.</p>
