              <p>Its not which is more suitable for Singapore, but more of which is suitable for which routes instead.</p>
              <p>If we still stick to the feeder and truck routes systems, then the better option is to just put bendies on high capacity routes that has a high turnover (e.g ppl only take a few stops and alight) such as feeders; while dds for high capacity routes that dont have a high turnover such as trunk routes and semi-express routes (such as 168, 969 and such).</p>
              <p>Not much people will go up the upper deck if just taking for a few stops for a dd, that capacity is wasted in that case. Feeders in towns w/bendies and dds for trucks is probably the way to go. Less bus stop spaces occupied in the city too.</p>

              <p><br>no point also, because many of the bus stops are just nice for 2x ADD or SD. You add bendies turnaround time is lengthened.</p>

              <p>Yes its very true there's going to be cost involved, but on the other hand, one type of vehicle are not suited for all kinds of jobs.</p>
              <p>Im not disagreeing that more space is needed at depots, interchanges, and bus stops when a bendy is utilized instead of an ADD. Its very true that it does take up more space, but in a case where a bendy and an ADD both needs to drop off 20 pax and pick up 20pax at a bus stop, the bendy would have the upper hand due to the better throughput and flow.</p>
              <p>The ADD will encounter a bottleneck between the entrance and stairs in this case when pax alighting from upper deck hold off the 20 pax whos boarding and waiting to go up to upper deck or lower deck.</p>
              <p>Of course, if there are 2 ADDs at one stop, both can board at the same time whereas its not possible for the bendy. It all sums up to the situation, and loading demands of each service.</p>
              <p>So its better to let the govt and transport co. watch the demands of their services and decide accordingly, utilization of space alone shouldnt be just the factor to not use bendies. Afterall, we are expecting more users to use the public transport network and throughput should also be a factor.</p>

              <p>well, it can be compensated like now 2 - 3 mins AM peak for 243.</p>
              <p>ADD can hold up whenever ppl are alighting, but say in a system at e bus stop all the buses are ADD.</p>
              <p>no diff le and 3rd bus can commence alighting to speed up boarding process (as in 1st bus wun hold up 2nd bus later on if a twist in turnaround time should occur).</p>
              <p>if it's a bendy, 2nd bus e most is commence alighting nia.</p>

              I agree with XiaoTaro.
              Bendy buses are still more suitable for the heartlands feeder routes, JIS routes and trunk routes where majority of passengers only travel for a short distance.
              For the rest, ADDs are the best option, except for routes with height restrictions.
              
              I think routes with bendy buses are still better than fully-dependent on single-deck buses. For instance, 5 bendy buses is needed for route X; but it may require 8 single-deck buses to meet this capacity, hence requiring more manpower per shift duty (not per bus!). And our bus operators are already facing problems recruiting drivers! Also, I believe its more fuel-saving to use bendy buses in this instance.

              That's why I think bendy buses are more suited for the heartlands feeder routes. Generally, the bus-stops that feeder routes call on have only a couple of routes, hence not that congested as other bus-stops. XiaoTaro also mentioned this point in the earlier post which I also agree.

              I don't really believe what's stated in the licenced standing capacity. In actual fact, does a fully packed bus (regardless of SD, ADD or bendies) really carry that many standing passengers? Some of the spaces along the aisle usually only accomodate one row of standing passengers due to various reasons (passengers carrying stuffs, bags, bigger size passengers, etc). We can't really blame them for not squeezing in because if that's so, passengers will find it very difficult to get off the bus, including the seated ones. 
                  
              Though I agree that in some cases, standing passengers are at fault for not moving in when there's plenty of space behind; but that's not always the case!  Instead of always asking people to squeeze like sardines and blaming them for not doing so, our bus operators ought to examine themselves whether they should provide more buses to cater to the overloaded demand. I personally feel that a double-decker still carry more passengers than a bendy.
              
              As I see SMRT Premium svc 599 with "No Standing" restriction using a bendy bus during the morning peak, I just find it a waste. Such a long bus can only seat far fewer passengers than a double-deck and the bus is almost fully seated at the first few stops. Indirectly, the regular trunk services are deprived of more bigger buses during the peak.
