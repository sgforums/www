              <p><br>That's why I think bendy buses are more suited for the heartlands feeder routes. Generally, the bus-stops that feeder routes call on have only a couple of routes, hence not that congested as other bus-stops.

              <p><br>I don't really believe what's stated in the licenced standing capacity. In actual fact, does a fully packed bus (regardless of SD, ADD or bendies) really carry that many standing passengers? Some of the spaces along the aisle usually only accomodate one row of standing passengers due to various reasons (passengers carrying stuffs, bags, bigger size passengers, etc). We can't really blame them for not squeezing in because if that's so, passengers will find it very difficult to get off the bus, including the seated ones. Though I agree that in some cases, standing passengers are at fault for not moving in when there's plenty of space behind; but that's not always the case! Instead of always asking people to squeeze like sardines and blaming them for not doing so, our bus operators ought to examine themselves whether they should provide more buses to cater to the overloaded demand. I personally feel that a double-decker still carry more passengers than a bendy. As I see SMRT Premium svc 599 with "No Standing" restriction using a bendy bus during the morning peak, I just find it a waste. Such a long bus can only seat far fewer passengers than a double-deck and the bus is almost fully seated at the first few stops. Indirectly, the regular trunk services are deprived of more bigger buses during the peak.</p>

              <p>Issue at interchange that the bus takes more spaces? compared to a dd, yes, compared to 1100 single decks, not really right? It all depends on how you view the issue, if dd is really so useful, why didnt sbstransit acquire 700 dds instead (thats approximately equivalent to the capacity the 1100 sd will carry)? the cost saved and spaces at interchange saved would also be significant. In that case, all sd will be replaced with dd, and routes can run more sparsely, which will also save spaces taken up by sd in the interchange!</p>
              <p>But we very well know thats not the case and it wont be feasible to do that. DD might be double the capacity of a sd, but consider the other views in terms of throughput. At the interchange, alighting at sawtooth berth, a DD can only alight with 1 door because the stairs is exactly at the door, ppl alighting from upper deck will block lower deck pax from alighting from front door. What about the bendy? 3 doors at once.</p>
              <p>Spaces at interchange such as saw tooth berths might be limited, but if u do put a bendy on a high capacity route, there can be ways to overcome this and even allow passengers to board more effectively. For e.g. parking can be done at nearby depots, instead of within the interchange, boarding can be done with 3 doors for high capacity routes w/ assistance of ticketing inspectors at interchange. The DD can only do 2 door at once, and as you can see with 179A its always a bottleneck.</p>
              <p>So back to the original point, if the feeders and intratowns could use bendys to improve efficiency, so be it, ways should be found to overcome the problems at int because afterall it will be more efficient for majority of the route (all the bus stops vs just the int)</p>

              <p>Precisely the point, If saving space is the key of all transport ops, then 700dd is the way to go, but as u have said, its not. QoS does matter too.</p>
              <p>Mealbreaks can be a problem, but it can also be solved by drivers switching vehicles during meal break (pass veh over to someone who ate finish and go to eat) or returing back to depot just for meals.</p>
              <p>All in all, the key point im trying to bring forward is that bendys are meant for certain ops, its not meant to replace every single route or service. Giving a single larger-sized berth in a int just for all feeders w/bendy wont take up much space, im in no way trying to imply that all berth should be upsized to fit bendys, that is indeed a waste of space.</p>
              <p>Yes, educating people to move in is important, but actually, do note theres another part to it. Educating people to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let others move in if you are alighting soon</span> is important too.

              <p><br>Interestingly if the govt is gonna play a role in intervening where bendies are concerned, then at least it should break the impasse over DDs by solving the coordination failure here in SMRT's case, on the grounds of intervention.</p>
              <p>Actually if we look at SMRT's fleet size, EOS plays a major role.</p>
              <p>1100 Scanias mean not only fuelling a spare parts market lowering unit cost, but experience in building the Scania bodies would mean lower costs also.</p>
              <p>Mixture of types as a problem was best exemplified by the USAF and USN's move towards having the same airframes do multitudes of roles.</p>
              <p>Arguably you are not wrong as well. Because flexibility is indeed an important component, although I'm also inclined to think more SDs could solve this and mitigate the loss in capacity in not having bendies.</p>

              One way to help solve the feeder routes woes is to use all SD but on high frequency, then free up the DDs for trunk routes. If a feeder bus route is heavily in use, perhaps can consider introducing another feeder route than runs similar to the 1st route (with only slight route differences), to help absorb the pax volume. In this way, can also help to better inter-connect the neighbourhood.

              <p>Precisely the point, If saving space is the key of all transport ops, then 700dd is the way to go, but as u have said, its not. QoS does matter too.</p>
              <p>Mealbreaks can be a problem, but it can also be solved by drivers switching vehicles during meal break (pass veh over to someone who ate finish and go to eat) or returing back to depot just for meals.</p>
              <p>All in all, the key point im trying to bring forward is that bendys are meant for certain ops, its not meant to replace every single route or service. Giving a single larger-sized berth in a int just for all feeders w/bendy wont take up much space, im in no way trying to imply that all berth should be upsized to fit bendys, that is indeed a waste of space.</p>
              <p>Yes, educating people to move in is important, but actually, do note theres another part to it. Educating people to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let others move in if you are alighting soon</span> is important too. That seems to be more of a problem from my observations, people trying to get off soon blocking the people trying to move to the rear.</p>

              <p>using double decks dun simply means I want to save space. It's to carry more ppl at 1 go with the same bus length - important for routes like 179A. Else I would end up needing 60 - 70 buses and it would flood the entire Jurong West Extn New Town.</p>
              <p>The space saving is vis a vis with bendy buses as they've same licensed capacity.</p>

              <p><br> One way to help solve the feeder routes woes is to use all SD but
              on high frequency, then free up the DDs for trunk routes. If a
              feeder bus route is heavily in use, perhaps can consider
              introducing another feeder route than runs similar to the 1st route
              (with only slight route differences), to help absorb the pax
              volume. In this way, can also help to better inter-connect the
              neighbourhood.</p>

              <p>but sometimes both services would come at the same time, after a long wait at the int...like 66 and 228...both services always have at least a 10 min wait...and they always reach the boarding berth abt the same time</p>
