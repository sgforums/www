              <p>Wow ok seems like is my mis-accuracy then haah hmm cos the only perm Wright in 197 w/o ad is 7578 from BN. Hmmm seems like maybe a cameo from either SL or BN.. maybe is the 76xx series??</p>
              <p>To make some clearer statement, the incident happend at 8 30am around thr. from bedok to parkway takes about 30 mins, so the bus should haf left Bedok int around 7 50 to 8am time.</p>

              <p>Well its really true that the brakes are not good for new buses as it still cant catch the wheels when it breaks. its not an excuse, u look at the previous post about the Wright bus hitting the K, it was by accident that the bus just "bam" into the K without even knowing. I have boarded alot of Wrights b4, those that just came out on svc like the 757x to the 76xx buses their breaks are still new. And everytime they "fly" up till 60 when they need slow down at bus stop they had to break quite hard to stop the bus. So its really the brake issue for all new vehicles. :)</p>

                      When I read your this sentence, I almost spilled my coffee ! What nonsense is this? Don't feed other members with your own assumptions. How can the bus be registered if the braking system has an issue. Whether its KUB or Wright, if the bus is registered, it means  the bus has no issues at all. This is clearly human error. By blaming on the bus, this driver showed lack of responsibility and deserved to get the sack. Period.

              <p>Well its really true that the brakes are not good for new buses as it still cant catch the wheels when it breaks. its not an excuse, u look at the previous post about the Wright bus hitting the K, it was by accident that the bus just "bam" into the K without even knowing. I have boarded alot of Wrights b4, those that just came out on svc like the 757x to the 76xx buses their breaks are still new. And everytime they "fly" up till 60 when they need slow down at bus stop they had to break quite hard to stop the bus. So its really the brake issue for all new vehicles. :)</p>

              <p>Hello, </p>
              <p>I wish to know, has the B9TL Wright been confirm to be 70 perm? Have seen them at TAS Receiving Station bus stop, Yio Chu Kang Road, in the direction of Shenton Way, at around 6:58am, for the past few days. One of the Wrights I have seen is 7670X... Been quite excited to see Wrights on Service 70 after having to take so many KUBs, Mark IVs and Olympians.... Hope this is not a cameo...</p>
              <p>Could anyone confirm for me whether 7670X and others will be AMDEP 70?</p>
              <p>Thanks...</p>
