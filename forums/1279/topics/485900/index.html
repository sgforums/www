              <p>Well, I suppose it is because the data from EZ link card shows that the number of people boarding/alighting bus 853 is quite minimal, that's why LTA approved this amendment.</p>
              <p>People staying at Yishun Street 72 and Avenue 3 will loss their direct bus connection to Marine Parade and East Coast areas. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Nonetheless, I think it is faster for them if they take MRT and bus, instead of direct bus. So I do not think the impact is significant for them.</span></p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that this will help to alleviate the traffic at Yishun Avenue 2 during peak hours.</p>

              <p>For the bolded part, sv 853 terminates at Lor 1 unless you are saying 853C. Also, 853 with its not-so-great frequency does not affect traffic on ave 2. The reason is simple as it is stated. To provide connectivity to Yishun polyclinic and didnt make sense  bus turning in for one stop from ave 2 and getting back on ave 2 again. </p>

              <p>Well, when you spoke of this point, it actually reminds me that there is something strange in the press release. It is impossible to make a right turn to Yishun Ave 2 from the current Yishun Bus Interchange from the end-on berths, the only way is for the bus from a sawtooth berth to exit from Yishun Ctrl 1 then turn right to Yishun Ctrl.</p>
              <p>Thus, 853/853C would only ply Yishun Ave 2 the second time in one direction, which is the return direction from Yishun Ctrl to Yishun Bus Interchange, and therefore there should be one more additional bus stop called at, either outside Northpoint or just along the empty plot of land slated for redevelopment of Northpoint (whichever it is we will know on the day of amendment).</p>
              <p>By the way I feel that there will be more services from Yishun Interchange to ply along the temporary Yishun Polyclinic once it is relocated to the temporary facility, most likely because it is more direct?</p>
