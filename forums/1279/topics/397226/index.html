              <p>anyway i think BNDEP is quite flexible with its B9... even services like 197 69 28 31 received B9 quite a few times. Definitely more flexible than AM/BR/SL</p>

              <p>for amdep side, preventive maintenance of brbp and amdep. the starter will try to deploy closest to the service.</p>
              <p>like for example sv 56 S shift drove in 9668R and sv 157 S shift drove in 9032A both for preventive maintenance. afternoon they still need further checks. there are sv139 merc 504P, sv 154 B10TL 9807G, sv 162 B10M 2804K and a sv186 leyland 9190B available. the starter will choose 9807G to be despatched on 157 and 9190B for 56. unless choices are limited then you see a big variation like if there was only the 162 B10M left, it would be despatched on 56 and 157 will have to wait for another bus available.</p>
              <p>this is to facillitate easier parking when they return after their runs as parking attendants have to drive around the depot or between amdep and brbp and repark the buses in order.</p>

              <p>trident on 147 is rather passe. 147 is part of the exclusive trident club. 87 was the last entrant I believe.</p>
              <p>The only other time I can think of where an anomaly in trident deployment occured was when a trident did 161.</p>

              <p>You forgot to add 858 in, 900 it is like twice in a year, just like how Lances on Yishun based feeder services (not sure if i am right).</p>
              <p>AMDEP restricting OCs? How many times did you see them on 853 and 855? should be about once or twice per month you see it right?</p>

              <p>But 178 gets from SP and 950, CAC wise should be from 856,859(if you are lucky enough to spot one),177/925*,961*** and 966***.</p>
              <p>And 500G did 853, along with 623K.</p>
              <p>*** means on Weekdays and Sundays</p>
              <p>* denotes on alternate months</p>
              <p>Anyway, hope 853 and 854 can come under Woodlands and AM though, even though they had a stint in the past.</p>
