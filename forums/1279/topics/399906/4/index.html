              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>The steering of the leyland is heavy but if a skilled BC knows how to "control" the stiffness of the steering, the BC can drive with less effort (eg. reversing and going off the end-on berth). Those BC who does are not skilled enough to "control" the stiffness will end up like pulling carrot from the ground while throwing his/her whole bodyweight into it. There are also cases where some leylands steering are slightly lighter while some are heavier.</p>

              <p>The steering of Leyland Olympian Superbus is indeed heavy, regardless of skill. Try turning 3 rounds to left and 3 rounds to the right. The reason is because it is a hydraulic power steering, not electric power steering like Mercs. On top of that, the steering handle is too thin for comfort.</p>
              <p>The only nice feature about the Leyland Olympian is D3 drive button which allow the driver to hold onto the 3rd gear longer. This is useful in maintaining the speed when taking up slopes on full load.</p>
              <p>The first Leyland aircon double deck SBS9000 used to have a CCTV in the upper saloon. The viewing screen was located just on the right of the dashboard.</p>

              really specific about rims, I am into bigger things :D But when the
              bus comes, it's blue circle, imprinted LEYLAND, if the centre thing
              not painted to red or silver.</p>

              <p><br>Trust me. I had driven one. I remember driving 190 when it was still operated by SBS. It was heavy even when the bus was moving.

              <p>The fuel pedal was not responsive and when you step on it, it takes 1 or 2 seconds before the bus starts moving, because it was an air actuated pump, unlike Volvo or Mercs.</p>
