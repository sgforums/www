              <p>SBS had a few Austin and Bedford buses before. Do they came
                  under the Leyland branding as well?</p>

              <p>Austin was brought under Leyland but not Bedford. The Leyland branding start to appear on the buses after the formation of the British Leyland Motor Company (BLMC). The BLMC logo was the infamous 'fan' with the 'L' in the centre. The Austins were acquired prior to that so they carry their own brand; just like the older Albion and Guy buses. I've seen from old photos that some Austins have the Perkins logo (a diamond with a circle on each corner) on the front as they have been re-engined with a Perkins Diesel.</p>
              <p>Here's an obscure 'Leyland' bus used in the 70s. The Morris FG.</p>

              <p>LO3x's steering maybe heavier but it all goes to whether this BC are used to it a not. Many times, I see the BC are turning the steering like what they do on LO3x.</p>

              <p>Powerful acceleration even with a loading of 100 over pax.<br>Sound of the engine is marvellous<br>Interior I think is the quietest in the AC DD fleet<br>The passenger's swear smell are as not strong as those compared to VO3x.<br>More seats in the lower deck (Everyones favourites)</p>

              <p>The steering of the leyland is heavy but if a skilled BC knows how to "control" the stiffness of the steering, the BC can drive with less effort (eg. reversing and going off the end-on berth). Those BC who does are not skilled enough to "control" the stiffness will end up like pulling carrot from the ground while throwing his/her whole bodyweight into it. There are also cases where some leylands steering are slightly lighter while some are heavier.</p>

              <p><br>The internal noise on the Atlantean is reduced thanks to the engine not being a part of the lower saloon. As you may note, the engine is placed behind the rear seat. Its not really that loud on the outside either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are still a number Atlanteans running around, especially in the UK. If you wish to ride one, the nearest running Atlantean can be found in Melaka. It is being used as a sightseeing bus on the Panorama Melaka route. However, it spends more time in the workshop than actual running.</p>
