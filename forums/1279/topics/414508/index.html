              <p>Hi, all.</p>
              <p>Just found out on SMRT's website a while ago that SMRT Buses is tendering for new 12m buses.</p>
              <p>Do you think they will choose Mercedes Benz again, or will they choose a different manufacturer this time round?</p>
              <p>Below is the simple tender put on the company's wesite:</p>

              <p>Wow, you must really hate SMRT Buses to the core, huh?</p>
              <p>The statutory lifespan of public buses in Singapore is 17 years. You can't simply scrap or sell the buses if they still can be operated. Similarly to the trains, they refurbished the first generation trains instead of buying new ones simply because it makes economic sense.</p>
              <p>Besides, who is going to buy the buses? Will they still be worth their original market value when it was first purchased?</p>
              <p>It's not as simple as selling off the old ones and using the money gained to buy new ones. There are rules to abide by. Procedures must be in place, otherwise, things will go haywire. Running a business isn't as simple as it looks.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit didn't sell off their old buses just because they're buying new ones. While still running the old buses, they bought new ones also. Take a HDB flat for an example. You want to make money and you sell off your HDB flat. You think the procedure takes one day only? No, it will drag on. There are papers to be filled up, you have to go down to HDB for appointment. This is Singapore. As you know, Singapore has an extensive system of doing things. There are laws we must abide by, otherwise, we'll land ourselves in hot soup.</p>
              <p>However, i do admit that SMRT Buses could have expedite on building a fourth depot or even expanding their current ones if they want to expand their fleet.</p>
              <p>If however, you feel that you can contribute greatly to the future of SMRT Buses, join them as a staff. Or even better, compile your thoughts and write to the top management and even the CEO herself.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, buyng of new buses are more costly than refurbishing the existing fleets. As long as they can still running on the road perfectly, why not refurb the buses and extend their lifespan extension.</p>
              <p>I am not siding SMRT, but SBST just killed off lots of 'precious life' of Merczs, MK3s and Leylands just to make way for new buses. This method might be too costly liao. Furthermore, they can be still running on the road unless they can't be saved due to engine problems etc....</p>

              <p>I agreed that SMRT bus services should be taken away from SMRT.</p>
              <p>I am terribly dissapointed with the SMRT bus services plying in my neighbourhood. For example SMRT 970, that provides the only link between Commonwealth MRT, Holland Ave, Holland Road and Sixth Ave, one has to wait patiently for that bus. And when it arrives it is always packed.</p>
              <p>My feedback to SMRT received a blant reply that current fleet of buses to SMRT970 is sufficent in meeting the demand, and the weekday evening peak at 17min, thus my previous wait for upt to 13min was not sufficiently long enough .., phew.</p>
              <p>SMRT just refuse to understand that the change to 'distance fare charges' has changed the habbit of many commuters, and people like me who use to walk from Buona Vista MRT now seek bus transfer from Commonwealth MRT instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>17 min, one can travel by train from Commonwealth to City Hall...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT should have noted that when buses are more packed, more time are wasted at each bus stops, besides affecting their own arrival timing, they affect those of other buses as well. For sake of the bus community, please give up your bus operations, anyway your heart is not in it.</p>

              Look at the way SMRT is running the buses, its so obvious they
              don't give a hoot about it, why? Look at the condition of the
              buses, black, dirty, dusty and horrible conditions. Instead of
              using the profits to invest in new buses, which TIBS would have
              done, they allowed these terrible condition buses to continue on
              the roads, and by refurblishing the current fleet of buses, does it
              solved the problem? LTA and PTC have already stated that there
              should more WAB buses by now, meeting a certain quota. But what has
              the company done late? They are slow in everything, and its only
              through severe complaints then they do something about. </p>
              <p>I agree with carbusbike and vicamour's view totally. </p>
              <p>Personally I feel, its either a new bus company take over SMRT
              or SBST's taking over SMRT's bus operation. SMRT should concentrate
              on only the trains. Btw, when are they going to upgrade the LRT at
              Bukit Panjang, its pathetic really. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents. </p>
              <p>The truth hurts, but that's life. </p>
              <p>A forum is where people express their views. Please respect one
              and another's view. </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is Not SMRT Decision Whether to Upgrade The LRT , Because The LRT Still Remains The Property of LTA. Even If SMRT Wants To Upgrade, LTA Sees No point in doing it. </p>
              <p>MY OPINION:</p>
              <p>I Do Agree however that SMRT Really needs To Improve their Bus Services, Their frequency just sucks and They aint doing anything about it. SBST Buses Actually is only slightly better, as they have better frequency because they have more Buses. SMRT Should Really work at it in buying more Buses to improve frequency. Yesterday, i waited for 40 Mins Just to See 2 Rigids and 1 Bendy Fully Packed. I Even Have to Push the door open To SQUEEZE mYself in so i don;t have to wait any longer. i felt that all SMRT services the frequency are pathetic with the Exception of Service 190. Even So if SMRT is doing badly in bus services, i dun feel theres a need for SMRT to give up its Bus Operations, in fact, i feel that a change of management in SMRT buses would be alot better. And i don;t think there will be any company more experienced then SMRT to run Bus services. If Only SBST Is running the Bus Operations in Singapore, Den theres no competition for SBST and this would let SBST Feel that since its the only operator, and .theres no other operator that can challenge it, thus it wont push itself to do better </p>
              <p>also its Not Just SMRT Refurbishing the Buses, Even SBST is doing it. Look at The Mark III Of SBST. Their Lifespan was suppose to expire TODAY, But it was extended For another year. </p>

              <p>Wow, you must really hate SMRT Buses to the core, huh?</p>
              <p>The statutory lifespan of public buses in Singapore is 17 years. You can't simply scrap or sell the buses if they still can be operated. Similarly to the trains, they refurbished the first generation trains instead of buying new ones simply because it makes economic sense.</p>
              <p>Besides, who is going to buy the buses? Will they still be worth their original market value when it was first purchased?</p>
              <p>It's not as simple as selling off the old ones and using the money gained to buy new ones. There are rules to abide by. Procedures must be in place, otherwise, things will go haywire. Running a business isn't as simple as it looks.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit didn't sell off their old buses just because they're buying new ones. While still running the old buses, they bought new ones also. Take a HDB flat for an example. You want to make money and you sell off your HDB flat. You think the procedure takes one day only? No, it will drag on. There are papers to be filled up, you have to go down to HDB for appointment. This is Singapore. As you know, Singapore has an extensive system of doing things. There are laws we must abide by, otherwise, we'll land ourselves in hot soup.</p>
              <p>However, i do admit that SMRT Buses could have expedite on building a fourth depot or even expanding their current ones if they want to expand their fleet.</p>
              <p>If however, you feel that you can contribute greatly to the future of SMRT Buses, join them as a staff. Or even better, compile your thoughts and write to the top management and even the CEO herself.</p>

              <p>U forgot the depreciation period is 12 yrs. Because buses in e past could only be used for 12 yrs until 1990s when they started to extend from 12 to 15, 15 to 17.</p>
              <p>Cannot compare w/ HDB flat, end of the day the flat DUN BELONG to you. It's govt's land.</p>

              <p>Just yesterday, I had a "wonderful" experience with SMRTB. That was almost midnight. Waited almost 30 minutes for bus 858 in Airport T3. One uncle waved goodbye to his friend who took bus 34, the second airport service with poor frequencies, but still much better than 858.  Heard his conversation with his auntie collegue that bus 858 is forever the hardest to wait there, happy come in 2 at a time, not happy then have to wait for a long time before he can even board the bus. Auntie keep on looking at her watch for at least 5 times, and looking out for 858 everytime a bus came, but to her dismay, all are SBST buses. </p>
              <p>The queue stretched all the way beyond bus 53 berth. Everyone wants to go home for the long weekend, so many people tried to squeeze into the bus. I pity those taking luggages trying to board the bus, so even tried to board from the rear door. The bus was filled to the brim, yes back of the bus is also squeezy. Spent the whole 10 mins trying to squeeze people in before moving off to T1.</p>
              <p>At T1, most people cannot board even some alighted. Queue almost touched the next berth. Wasted some time trying to squeeze people in, which in the end some gave up, unhappily waiting for the next bus.</p>
              <p>T2, queue was long too, many people tried to squeeze into the bus again while some alighted. Some just gave up and wait for the next bus. BC went for toilet break. Almost 15 mins! An old uncle shouted across the bus: "Wah, good service. Jia zhua (eat snake) good service" Many people are complaining and frustrated for all the long waits.</p>
              <p>And this service hardly improves even after years and years of such standards. Still extend to Sembawang to make things worse. Pity those Woodlands residents going to airport. Can't cope then don't extend. Or give up the service to others. Commuters don't pay bus fares for this kind of medicore service.</p>

              <p><br>If you thought of this way, then SBST must have done a very good job in maintaining these buses all these years. What they have done has already done, extending their operational services as long as they can. But it is LTA final decision to scrap all the above mentioned buses, as long as they do not pass the LTA inspections. If LTA say no, what can they do?</p>
              <p>And commuters are also complaining about these old buses, just look into service 138 fiasco. If there is still no newer buses on it, sooner or later, regular commuters again will complain about the old Merc buses again. As bus fans, we appreciate them but not to the general public. At the the very comfort we get is that they are still so well maintained all these years, even if it is not the best.</p>
              <p>Lastly, they have to meet the WAB status quota. So who to blame for killing off these buses? LTA.</p>

Some of their buses are already 17 years old, and in very bad condition because of their poor maintenance, yet they refuse to buy new ones to replace. Spend money refurnishing them and claim to be new. How ironic.</p>
