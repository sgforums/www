              <p>If that is the case, it is better for the top management to work in GIC or Temasek Holdings. <br>Oops, I have forgotten Temasek Holdings has stakes in SMRT, perhaps the top management are minimising on costs and focusing on profits through other means.</p>
              <p>I felt the priority for public transport should lean towards the public than leaning more towards attaining profit for the company. What is the purpose for setting up a public transport company?<br>But without the profit, they also can't invest much in new buses etc.</p>

              <p>Want service standards to improve?</p>
              <p>Can... Pay $1 for a 3.2km journey next time, which will happen within the next 25 years.</p>
              <p>After FY results are out for both PTOs you may see them wanting to jack up fares again as their profits are dipping due to "higher fuel costs, staff costs" and "distance fare revenue".</p>
              <p>The sentiment on the ground will largely be the same as previous times anyway.</p>
              <p>Both PTOs should look into other investment opportunities so that they no need to rely on fare revenue so much. Otherwise, we are the ones taking in all the fare increase and stuff like that..</p>
              <p>But of course shareholder's wealth is very important. If buses is the core business of SMRT I think no dividends will be paid in the first place. It is due to the difference in the business models of both PTOs which make SMRT a better choice for buying its shares..</p>

              <p><br>You make a point there, But the rule here is that, 19 years is up, and have to go means have to go, no matter how you want to extend it, it's useless, But if SBST has to lay the Leylands up, it definitley has to do with engines, even if an extension is given (for those who are still 'strong' enough aft. 17 years), issues will definitley arise, and it will still have to face being laid. Like the SMRT UDs itself I believe SMRT is really bo bian then they refurb the UDs, if the citaros were to come in, one by one will face being laid up, and de-registered swiftly, like SBS 478G on lay-up recently, it might get de-registered fast enough if the Wright B9s come in.</p>

              <p>In Australia, I believe, they have buses in use for over 20 years.</p>
              <p>I think a better system could be to give buses a life span of 20 years, with the option to be extended up to 25 years if they are given a comprehensive overhaul and refurbishment from it's 12th to 17th year, and being made to undergo mandatory maintenance checks for fitness to be on the roads every month from the 19th year onward.</p>

                  <p>The main problem come from the two depots itself namely Kranji
                  &amp; Ang Mo Kio beside their chief.If they move to a bigger depot
                  that can store more buses especially for the bendys then i think
                  most of the bus frequencies and deployment can be solved.My friend
                  once told me about the so called "Bus operation lose money" issue
                  is totally bullshit.How can you lose money when sv like
                  67,169,171,172,176,180,184,187,188,189,190.CCK Feeders,700,AMK

                  are ranked among the cash cow service?And how often my friend
                  proposal of buying a few WAB Bendys are rejected by the top
                  management saying cost is the main objective??How often the bus
                  profits all goes to cover the cost of the new rail projects?Do you
                  know how much revenue can 1 bendy on 190 make each day?Its more
                  than enough to cover the fuel,the SLs salary,the person who
                  maintain the bus and many more.What about sv like 854?I ever drove
                  a rigid on this service and even during off peak the load can be
                  scary..Even sv like 882 are enough to cover the cost of its
                  operation.</p>

              Its seriously time to add more competition to our local public bus operations to reduce complacency. 
              1) Allow rival bus operators to ply similar routes such as the above-mentioned services to increase competition and improve the bus service level. 
              2) Allow a couple more bus operators to join the market - how about KMB,Citybus,NWFB?
              3) LTA should lift up some more restrictions so that rival bus operators be able to operate on the same territories currently dominated by one operator.
                   
              In these ways, we may expect to see improvement of bus services and standards, such as improved bus frequencies and bigger buses such as ADDs.
