            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to add on another thing about SBST vs SMRT regarding its bus routes:-<br><br>I find that SBST connects the bus routes very well especially from North/Northeast areas like Woodlands/Yishun/Sengkang/Punggol areas towards the far east areas like Pasir Ris/Changi Airport/Changi Village areas via TPE. For example services 27, 34, 39, 59, 89, 109, 161 and 168.<br><br>Whereas SMRT areas like Sembawang only have buses connecting to city and nearby areas like Yishun/Woodlands.<br><br>In fact SMRT should also look into introducing newer bus routes to connect Sembawang to Tampines/Sengkang. If possible should also introduce more express routes to connect from Woodlands/Sembawang/Yishun areas to Changi Villages. Another thing to divert services 858, 965 anf 969 to serve Sembawang areas as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .<br></div>

The condition of the buses of SMRT are like shit, whereas the trains are in tip-top condition. Air-con blow like as if electricity is free. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . I couldn't even find a vandalism, not even a scratch! The reason why SMRT concentrate more on train services is simple, there are more ridership on trains than on buses, so concentrating more on train services is more profitable. I somehow think that all train services like the NEL , CCL and future MRT lines should be awarded to SMRT whereas SBSTransit should control all bus services, of course i hope SBSTransit will buy bendy buses and DDs in equal numbers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by choww:<br>[<strong>b]Hi..Which bus company do your prefer?..[/</strong>b]</blockquote>i prefer SBST. SBST may look "cheap" coz of their NAC buses , but dont forget , they have new CNG buses and WAB buses. Their buses were bought and launched newly. Not like SMRT , nowadays tey use those rebranded Nissans cant they buy more new buses , if they like Nissan Buses , ten go &amp; buy the newest Nissans. SBST dont have any/use rebranded buses.<br><br>2nd: SBST has better freq compared to SMRT , i took 161 before and it is always on time other svcs oso. So far , those SBST buses which i took is punctual , not like SMRT's erratic svcs like 187 , 188 , 307 wich as lousy freq.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>even now there are SBST services dominated in SMRT services like Yishun's 39 &amp; 85 , Woodland's 161 &amp; 168 , i hope that i can see a SBST service in CCK interchange , maybe from CCK to either Hougang , Sengkang or Punggol , it wil be the best to introduce a service like 161 &amp; 168 which takes long express , hope that SBST introduce a service from CCK to Pasir Ris via Bt Panjang , BKE and if possible serve W'lands before going to SLE to Pasir Ris.</div>
