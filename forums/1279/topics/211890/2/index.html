It duplicates the route of NEL from Serangoon MRT station all the way to Outram Park Station, skipping the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. Before the NEL, svc 103 runs along with 147 from serangoon to Chinatown. But svc 103 is amended. If I am not wrong, at that time many people protest against the withdrawal of this service because it provides a direct link for ppl living in Hougang to go to Chinatown and Si Ma Lu and Little India. Besides, there are quite a number of elderly utilising this service and thus they find taking a bus to Hougang and taking Hougang to Chinatown is ma fan.</div>

If you take a look more carefully, they don't even repaint their buses... They just use stickers and cover up the buses. You can see this if they forgot to pry out the Mercedes/Dennis badge from the rear of the bus. So the badges would be bulging out from the stickers. This is more obvious on the Hispano O405 and O405G and Lances.<br><br>But most SBST buses are repainted. Only some are stickered...

Some just have the front repainted (mainly those with ads). The same for merz as well. E.g. 3728R recently just had its front and end repainted but still carries SBSL livery. 3901G does not have full SBST livery too.</div>
