            <div class='col-md body'>I have been thinking and decided to invent this game. Hope you find it as fun as Cluedo.<br><br>The idea of this game is fairly simple. I will specify a boarding stop and an alighting stop. You must try to think of a combianation that can bring you from boarding to alighting stop. However, you are required to report at a specified stop once anywhere in the journey.<br>Whoever can pay the <span style="color: red;">least</span> fare wins. However, there are some rules you have to abide.<br><br>Restrictions:<br>1) You must take at least <span style="color: red;">10 buses</span> during the whole journey. No repeat taking of the same bus service is allowed.<br><br>2) You are allowed to take Express buses only once.<br><br>3)You cannot change buses on the same road twice. For example, you boarded Sv 10 from Tampines Int, you alighted along East Coast Rd to change sv 12. Then you change into Sv 32 on East Coast Rd itself. This move is not allowed . You need to wait until Mountbatten Road if you want to transfer sv 12 into sv 32.<br><br>4)You can be given only <span style="color: red;">1</span> chance to cross the road to transfer another service. No walking to a nearby stop is allowed.<br><br>5) Time is not important. There is no right or wrong answer, whoever can produce the least fare wins.<br><br>6) No trains or cabs or hitch hike is allowed.<br><br>7)Fare is calculated according to below:  * No rebates are qualified and all to be paid as adult fares in ezlink card. Only sv 11,35,90,91,191, 200 are counted as NAC fares. No price cap/concession is applied in this game.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trunk Services</span><br>Adult                     EZlink NAC($)                   AC($)<br>0 - 4                          0.58                              0.63<br>4.5 - 7                       0.68                              0.83<br>7.5 - 10                     0.78                              1.03<br>10.5 - 13                   0.88                              1.13<br>13.5 - 18                   0.98                              1.23<br>18.5 - 23                   1.08                              1.33<br>23.5 - 29                   1.18                              1.43<br>29.5 and more          1.28                               1.53<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feeder Services/Townlink</span> :$ 0.63<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong Industrial Services</span><br><br>0 - 4                        $0.58<br>4.5 - 7                     $0.68<br>7.5 - 10                   $0.78<br>10.5 - 13                 $0.88<br>13.5 &amp; above          $0.98<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Express Services</span><br><br>0 - 10                   $1.53<br>10.5 - 13               $1.68<br>13.5 - 18              $1.83<br>18.5 - 23              $1.98<br>23.5 - 29              $2.13<br>29.5 &amp; above        $2.28<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CSS services </span><br><br>0-4                       $0.55<br>4-7                       $0.70<br>7-10                     $0.85<br>10-13                  $1.00<br>13 &amp;above          $1.15<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An example</span><br><br>Specified boarding stop:Upp Serangoon Rd ( Blk 302)<br>Reporting stop:Tampines bus int<br>Specified alighting stop:Airline Rd (police pass ctr)<br><br>51: Upp Serangoon Rd to Hougang Ave 3 ( Blk1)   3 stages  $0.63<br>72:Hougang ave 3 to tampines rd (Blk 8 )                1 stage    $0.63<br>53:Tampines rd(blk 8 ) to Pasir Ris Dr 1 (Blk 738 )   9 stages $1.03<br>89: Pasir ris dr1 to pasir ris dr3 (Downtown east)     3 stages $0.63<br>3: pasir ris dr 3 to Tampines Int                               7 stages $0.83<br>292: int to Tampines Ave 5 (opp stad)                              $0.63<br>67: tampines ave 5 to bedok stn                          6 stages $0.83<br>24: Cross road take to singapore expo h4         4 stages $0.63<br>12: upp changi rd to simei rd (blk135)                2 stage  $0.63<br>9: simei rd to airline rd (police pass ctr)             15 stages $1.23<br><br>Total  fare: $6.24.
