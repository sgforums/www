            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm seem u all enjoying this. I think I need to give some more clues as promised yesterday. By now, some guys were close. The correct answer was not even out for A)boarding stop, B) service number C)destination stop.<br><br>Hint 6: I cannot take the SMRT service bus to my destination. The 2 buses I can take are SBST.As u all guess it, it's in the east region.<br><br>Hint 7:The boarding stop is 2 stops after a school. The stop is not outside a food court nor a coffee shop nor a restaurant.<br><br>Hint 8:This bus service drops me directly on a station on my left, it passes through another station ,but stops very far away from the latter.There is no shelter to the 2nd station.<br><br>Hint 9: Describe the alighted stop, it is near a "pool" where people can make bets. If u like KFC pizza Hut or Mcdonalds, U are in the right place.<br><br>Hint 10:I believe u will be full after looking out from the bus window at all the goodies selling along the street : Ngiang Tou Fu, Laksa, Perankan food...... on yr bus ride</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Zilchster:</div><div class="quote_body">Hint 1: Boarded at a stop with only 1 SMRT service but have around 9 SBST services.There are 2 services I can take directly to my destination.<br><br>Blk 79 at Circuit Road, Technically there are 8 SBST services, why 9, becoz 155 can head either towards Toa Payoh or Marine Parade, the TIBS service is 61.<br><br>Svc 40 and 155 goes to his destination<br><br>Hint 3: On my way in an air-con bus, i saw a MRT station on my left.<br><br>Aljunied MRT.<br><br>Hint 4: I passed a post office on my left.<br><br>Post office at Tanjong Katong Road<br><br>Hint 6: I cannot take the SMRT service bus to my destination. The 2 buses I can take are SBST.As u all guess it, it's in the east region.<br><br>Svc 61 does not bring him to the destination<br><br>Hint 7:The boarding stop is 2 stops after a school. The stop is not outside a food court nor a coffee shop nor a restaurant.<br><br>Neither food court/coffeeshop or restaurant...means hawker centre or food centre...<br><br>2 stops after a school...2 stops after ITE macpherson/or is it Macpherson Sec.<br><br>Hint 8:This bus service drops me directly on a station on my left, it passes through another station ,but stops very far away from the latter.There is no shelter to the 2nd station.<br><br>Direct station: Aljunied<br>the other 2nd station: Paya Lebar<br><br>Hint 9: Describe the alighted stop, it is near a "pool" where people can make bets. If u like KFC pizza Hut or Mcdonalds, U are in the right place.<br><br>This place is Siglap...<br>If i am not wrong the bus stop u alight is along East Coast Road...b4 Siglap Rd...155 calls at this bus stop<br><br>Hint 10:I believe u will be full after looking out from the bus window at all the goodies selling along the street : Ngiang Tou Fu, Laksa, Perankan food...... on yr bus ride<br><br>This is definitely East Coast Rd...<br><br>The bus service is Svc 40...am I rite <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div></blockquote><strong>CORRECT!I boarded at Blk 79 FC Circuit Road , took sv 40 and to East Coast Road near Siglap Ctr!</strong><br>Hint 1: one SMRT sv 61, around 9 SBST depends on whether u count sv 155 as 2 services!<br>Hint 2:Smell cooking food from FC directly behind the stop.<br>Hint 3: Aljunied MRT<br>Hint 4: Not Singapore Post but Katong Post office on Tanjong Katong Road<br>Hint 5: Mediacorp 7pm Happy Fish store is filmed at East Coast Road near Siglap Ctr . Thats why we can smell Happy Fish.<br>Hint 6: Can take sv 155/40 but not sv 61<br>Hint 7: 2 stops after ITE Macpherson, outside FC<br>Hint 8: Directly at Aljunied, far away from Paya Lebar as sv 40 is outside Tg Katong Complex!<br>Hint 9: At Siglap, there is a Turf Club betting ctr , Pizza Hut, KFC and Mcdonalds!<br>Hint 10: Laksa peranakan .... obvious wat...<br><br>Good job Zilchster.<br>Good for all those that tried, u guys are close.I will come up with a harder puzzle!I will post it later in this thread  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>PS dont answer sv 155 cos the mrt station is not on the left!<br><br></div>
