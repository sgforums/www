Of which i found both wrong.. but i hope its correct to a certain extent.<br><br>Today check back... u said one of my destination was right. I was thinking of winsland house. Then i thought 700A.. sounds weird..<br><br>Then i back track all the way from there according to the order of clues given. Bus 36. Left with 1390.. I assumed its between PTB2 and Mandarin Gdns... didnt know at first until i see 1390 on the st directory. laughers..<br><br>ula_man: care to solve mine in this thread before you post another one?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
