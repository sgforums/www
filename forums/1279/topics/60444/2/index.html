            <div class='col-md body'>But SBS treats 8 as if it has high demand so it is a high class service with guesto VSOs, newest B10M. I think service 8 may have to be resechulded as 2-3 buses brunched up and SD or DD have empty loading. I think 8 is actually an unprofitable rt as it duplicate with many inter-town services like 18, 38 and trunk services like 65, 66 which has better frequency. It is also completing with 23 (I think if you know that if you are going to TAM at Macpherson Kopitiam, if you walk further to Jalan Kolam Ayer, you may take 23 which is much faster than 8  to Temasek Poly areas)<br><br>While service 90 has very high demand but not a single AC DD.
