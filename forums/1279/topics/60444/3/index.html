Usually the upper and lower decks of 23 are almost filled when I board 23 from Siemens Centre towards Tampines each time. Alternatively, they could also introduce shortworking trips from Tampines to Bedok Reservoir Rd and then back to Tampines as 23A. These would be better alternatives in my opinion.</div>

And to add on to what foxtrot1985 has mentioned, not all sectors of Service 8's routes has the demand. Service 8, like any other bus services, though with a few exceptions, has high demands on certain sectors of its route and low demands on other sectors. But come to think again, there are certain odd hours during the day when Service 8 really does need Superbuses, apart from the peak hours.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if you take 8 at PM peak, the jouney time is longer than 23 as of the traffic jam at Paya Lebar. While 23 has smooth traffic along PIE thanks to the widen roads.<br><br>Service 8 does have brunched up buses very regularly, and SBS has noticed it to ensure service reliability.<br><br>Oh yes, I saw an LO 3x along Macpherson Road (East bound) at Noon today and loading is only less than 10%, it has an orange toshiba Ad, I think 8 does not even need a ADD at all, but maybe BNDEP has too many ADD to give away!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During off-peak the diff is not that great... I think at most 5 minutes slower in reaching the Macritchie Kopitiam bus-stop (for 23 means alight opp Siemens Centre Jln Kolam Ayer bus-stop and walk there). I took it thrice at around noon time... 1st 2 times I took 8 from Tampines Ave 1 to Temasek Poly to change to 23.<br>1st time by the time I walk there and the 8 had already passed that stop, &lt;5 minutes later, the next 8 had already reached. 2nd time I reached the stop and 1 minute later, the 8 reached the stop.<br>3rd time I decided to take 8 all the way to the Macpherson stop and saw 2 guys who alighted from 8 and taken 23 at Temasek Poly already there. However, they were waiting for 154 just like me, so there was still no significant difference in the end, except I just saved myself a long walk...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I know through replies from SBS, it is said that they would replace NAC buses within this 2 years as they have plans to use the buses before 17 years. This means another 149 NSDs would be off the road and another 98 VO 2x if they are not going to be converted within this 2 years.</div>

Be glad SBST put a/c buses on sv 90 during peak hours. They can take all of them off if they want it to for some reasons.<br><br>You also can't expect SBST to act on your suggestions alone.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for that advise,<br><br>However they are flouting PTC rules with inquire from them and LTA is investigating it as it is not supposed to be practiced at all.
