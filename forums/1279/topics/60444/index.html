            <div class='col-md body'>Yup.. SBS Transit did mention that they would want their fleet to be fully air-conditioned a few years later. However, by looking at this stage, whereby the LO 2 Axle are being phased off, SBST would almost have insufficient number of buses to cover the Jurong Industrial Svcs.

More elderly move to the rear of a Bendy Bus, compared to the number of elderly moving to the upper deck of a double decker bus.</div>

Yes, old folks indeed find it a hindrance to climb up and down steps, especially in double-decks where they have to clamber down before their stop when the bus is moving.</div>

As such, the tapered end helps to clear the traffic lights poles which are forced to be situated very near the kerb side, hence 997A, with a hge turning radius, may need that extra help to allow it to turn easily.</div>
