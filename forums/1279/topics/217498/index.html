            <div class='col-md body'>Recently about a few days back, I briefly heard from the news on TV that there is a decreasing number of people taking public buses these days....<br><br>I'm sure a lot of you will simply say that it's due to the ever-increasing bus fares...<br><br>Okay let's put that aside for now... Let's say they really have a problem with their revenue and were forced to increase the bus fares... But with the increase in bus fares, were we given better services?<br><br>1) Sometimes, being in an aircon bus can be a worse experience than being in a non-aircon bus... Simply because the aircon is not working and it's like an oven in the bus!<br><br>2) Sometimes during rainy days, you find that you are getting wet despite being indoors on a bus... Do not fret because it's just another leak in the bus... Leakages are so common in buses that no one bothers to complain anymore...<br><br>3) There was once when I was travelling in a bus, I heard a loud noise.. Sounds like something just dropped... When I turned around, I realised it was the cover of a lamp that had fallen down... and it actually hit the head of an old man... Why is this happening if there is regular maintenance?<br><br>4) Irregular bus arrival timings - leading to extremely long waits and empty buses trailing one another...<br><br>5)..........<br><br>Anyone has anything to add on to the list? Let us give them the answers they want... The bus companies will be shocked.... BUT I doubt they will do anything about it....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding Point (1), it's actually a case of fraud... Read the following analogy:<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Signboard:</strong> Coffee - 60 cents per cup<br><br><strong>You:</strong> Auntie, coffee one cup.<br><strong>Auntie:</strong> Okay... 60 cents please...<br><br>You hand over 60 cents to the auntie.<br>After a while, the auntie returns with a cup...<br><br><strong>Auntie:</strong> Here your coffee.<br><br>You take a look at what is in the cup...<br><br><strong>You:</strong> Auntie! I want coffee. Why you give me tea?!<br><strong>Auntie:</strong> No more coffee lah. Take it or leave it. You paid for it already.<br><strong>You:</strong>......<br><br>You are speechless. No refund for getting the wrong order. No other coffee stalls in sight. You either drink the tea or walk far away to another place to buy coffee and then pay for it again.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Is this a case of fraud? Pay for coffee which is more expensive and then get forced to accept tea... This is exactly the case for aircon buses with spoilt aircon! You pay the fares for an aircon ride but you don't get the aircon! Same scenario right?! In the end, you either finish the ride and suffer in silence or get down the bus and wait for another one, which means you have to waste time and money again....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, sometimes there are things which cannot be helped in life.<br>Maybe you wanted this, but cannot get it.<br>My experiences:<br>Lamp cover, got once on TIB592R, service 173. Did not hurt anyone, but was a freakish accident, the cover is damn heavy, although its 'light' plastic.<br>TIB917M, service 855, water tank exploded. This is more serious, luckily the old folks (two males) managed to 'siam' in time.<br>These are operational errors/faults, which happen time to time. No point thinking raised fares and not taking the bus.<br>Many still do take the bus.<br>Think everytime when the cars on the road try to squeeze through, and the bus just jut out, everyone stops, have to give way. I pay my 0.87+0.40 fare to school because of this reason.</div>

In those countries that you mentioned having poor public transport system, they pay lesser than peanuts for their rides lor... So they get shitty service... With the amount that we are paying for our bus rides today, those people can acutually use it to take taxis!<br><br>Fare increments are ok, ONLY if it comes together with better services.<br><br>Long time ago in Singapore, the bus companies' only source of income is the commuters, people like us. They managed to survive until now. However, right now they have quite a few sources of income eg. advertisements pasted all over the bus (from interior to exterior), TV mobile, and of course the much higher bus fares. Why is it then that they are still complaining of marginal profits? I think they should stop using this reason for increasing the bus fares... Instead, they should really promise commuters that they will get better services in future for paying more.. and I mean really much better services...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes during peak hours, the following scenarios really spoils my mood:<br><br>1) As usual, there are a lot of people waiting at the bus stop during peak hour. You see your bus coming. It is a common bus that many people are taking. <strong>Why must it be a single deck bus at this kind of time?!</strong> And then you board the bus and had to squeeze with so many other people and try your best to hang on for your life. And you start to wonder... <strong>I paid $1++ for this ride... </strong><br><br>2) During mornings when you are all dressed up and fresh, ready to go to school or work. You wait at the bus stop for a bus that many others are taking too. The bus comes and it is a non-aircon bus. You start to wonder... <strong>This bus is going on a long journey. It is not a feeder service. Why is it non-aircon?!...</strong> Well, after the ride, your hair gets messy, your face gets stained with all the road dust and grime and you feel sweaty all over.. What a way to start the day!</div>

In those countries that you mentioned having poor public transport system, they pay lesser than peanuts for their rides lor... So they get shitty service... With the amount that we are paying for our bus rides today, those people can acutually use it to take taxis!<br><br>Fare increments are ok, ONLY if it comes together with better services.<br><br>Long time ago in Singapore, the bus companies' only source of income is the commuters, people like us. They managed to survive until now. However, right now they have quite a few sources of income eg. advertisements pasted all over the bus (from interior to exterior), TV mobile, and of course the much higher bus fares. Why is it then that they are still complaining of marginal profits? I think they should stop using this reason for increasing the bus fares... Instead, they should really promise commuters that they will get better services in future for paying more.. and I mean really much better services...<br></div></blockquote>The problem is there's price hike on Taxis too mah,What i'm saying is the increase are quite reasonable if you look into the whole picture.I don't think our dear Gahmen will reduce the fuel price for now</div>
