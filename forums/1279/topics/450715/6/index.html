              I believe that there are much more cons still not listed, especially from the operators point of view. Maintanance, space to park, etc. 
              
              It also takes up too much space in the bus stops and delays the trips of other buses behind it. 
              
              
              Bendy buses although can carry more people than a double decker, however it is only about 10 more or so. With more services coming up and current services ramming u their frequencies, there are more and more bendy buses half full but takes up twice the space than a normal bus. This is not efficient and cost effective for the bus companies and the whole bus system in the long run. Moreover not many people like to move to the back of the bendy buses as well, a problem which is the same as normal buses, only it makes thing worse with its lenght. Faster off loading they can be, but at the expense of other buses behind which are delayed instead. And it gets even more problematic if the ezlink card readers or the 3rd doors malfunction. Not to mention rainy days, people prefer to alight using the 2nd door.
              
              As for safety records, actually bendy buses have the high rate of accidents. I don't think they are safe. And most bus burnt incidents are bendy buses as well.

              When DTL is up a few years later, I doubt 190 and 960 will need any more bendies. Some services might even get cut or even axed. 
              
              But I saw about your earlier posts. You are right about SMRT on their double decker plan. Actually there are many rumors that SMRT has already thinking of switching to double deckers for the past few years. LTA is also studying very carefully about the problems SMRT had brought up about these bendy buses in affecting its operations and its impact to the bus system now and in future. So most likely SMRT will stop getting bendy buses in future, even if LTA do not impose a ban on it.

                  It is not the fault of the bus at all. Rather it is caused by a irresponsible maintanace company.
                  But I am quite unhappy that SBST didn't repair it. Only the body structure is damaged, the chassis and engine still remains intact. And worst is that SBST needs more double deckers.
                  
                  But many bendy buses inflict their own flames to burn themselves down. That is one of the safety issues of bendy buses which should be concerned instead.

              fatal accident involving a SBS DD Sv 87 sometimes back. The
              passenger was instantly killed at the upper decked after the crane
              smashed through the window pane and hit him</p>

              However in this case, bus operator SMRT is also looking into switching to double deckers because the problems and potential future problems that bendies will give to its daily operations.  
              Of course. LTA decision will affect but in looking into the future bus systems plans, bendy buses are not the way to go.

              <p><br> It is not the fault of the bus at all. Rather it is caused by a
              irresponsible maintanace company. But I am quite unhappy that SBST
              didn't repair it. Only the body structure is damaged, the chassis
              and engine still remains intact. And worst is that SBST needs more
              double deckers. But many bendy buses inflict their own flames to
              burn themselves down. That is one of the safety issues of bendy
              buses which should be concerned instead.</p>
