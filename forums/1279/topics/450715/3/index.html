              <p>If you don't believe, then I won't give a damn. I post here on what was told to me. </p>
              <p>Official PR??? Who do you think the heck you are??? Need an official to address your concerns??? You think everything have to disclosed for you here???</p>
              <p>Decisions are already up to make. Highly likely they will be banned in future when Singapore bus fleets expands. The most you can expect is there will be very limited bendies bought in future. But it's pointless for SMRT anyway.</p>
              <p>But LTA don't like long queues of buses which cause delays, and now they want to add 800 more buses to the total bus fleet. Situations are already bad now in places with many of such long buses, what happens with 800 buses more??? Everyday every trip, I am delayed because of these bendies queues and jamming the bus stops and bus interchanges. Worse some even are half full but hog twice the space as compared to a normal bus. Same goes to depots. I can understand how much these buses have dragged down SMRT efficiency all these years. </p>
              <p>Use your brain and think. You still insist to accept the truth, that's your problem.<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></span></p>

              <p>If you don't believe, then I won't give a damn. I post here on
              what was told to me. </p>
              <p>Official PR??? Who do you think the heck you are??? Need an
              official to address your concerns??? You think everything have to
              disclosed for you here???</p>
              <p>Decisions are already up to make. Highly likely they will be
              banned in future when Singapore bus fleets expands. The most you
              can expect is there will be very limited bendies bought in future.
              But it's pointless for SMRT anyway.</p>
              <p>But LTA don't like long queues of buses which cause delays, and
              now they want to add 800 more buses to the total bus fleet.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Situations are already bad now in places with many of such long
              buses, what happens with 800 buses more??? Everyday every trip, I
              am delayed because of these bendies queues and jamming the bus
              stops and bus interchanges. Worse some even are half full but hog
              twice the space as compared to a normal bus. Same goes to depots. I
              can understand how much these buses have dragged down SMRT
              efficiency all these years. </span></p>
              <p>Use your brain and think. You still insist to accept the truth,

              <p>You are wrong.</p>
              <p>Moral of story is actually: To avoid jam, come out late.</p>
              <p>6+am jam is seriously atrocious.</p>
              <p>I definitely cannot take 151 during that period. Taking that = death sentence.</p>

              <p>Did SBST told the public that they sold their only 2 bendies to other countries???</p>

              <p>Did LTA gave an official statement saying the reasons why no more CNG buses are purchased???</p>
              <p>Did NTU/SBST/LTA ever give you a date on when the electric bus is going to be on public service or why hasn't it been on service for such a long time???</p>
              <p>Did SBST ever posted anything about the failed trial of the MAN demo bus in their website???</p>
              <p>Did SBST even told you why they choose Wright bus over Enviro 500 bodies for the new B9TLs???</p>
              <p>Did SBS/LTA even say why the superlong bus plan and trial had failed to replace all single deckers in the 90s and why SBS did not trial the bi-articulated bus???</p>
              <p>Did SMRT even give a damn about the deregistered Nissan Diesels and annouce to the public that it is gone???</p>
              <p>Did SMRT even say that they had rebuilt a burnt down bendy in the newspapers???</p>
