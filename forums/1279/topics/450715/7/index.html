              I think SBST should do a major overhaul for some of the CDGE B9TLs soon. Or at least install some silencer mechanisms to reduce the noise.

              Quieter, won't be. At most as quiet as when it was new, provided with the right maintance.
              
              The only pro I can point out for Scania buses is that they are quieter than other brands. Just look at the 19 year old N113CRBs. But the vibration is bad, especially the OACs. CACs still ok.
              Thus I can't imagine the KUBs 17 years down the road. Especially it has a less powerful engine and not so up to standard Gemilang bus body as compared to N113CRBs' Walter Alexander PS bodies. 
              Don't sound very good but true story.

              B10Ms are mid engined buses but more towards the front, that's way.
              If you have taken the front engined old SBS buses in the 1980s, it will be the loudest when you sat the front seats, especially the Leyland Victories and Albion Vikings. They canbeat the hell out of your eardrums. Hahaha...

              <p>All i can remember is the stupid loud prolonged (2-3 seconds) farting sound made by the doors when they opened/closed..</p>
              <p>those old days, the doors are controlled by a rotating lever (sort of resembling a T-tap)</p>
              <p>Not forgetting the bus stopping beeps, it sounded as loud as a horn</p>
              <p>and the buses were then manual geared</p>
              <p>then came the auto-gear Merc Hawke and B57, doors were controlled by on/off round toggle knobs (pulled up to open doors, pushed down to close doors if i'm not wrong)</p>
              <p>TIBS nissan diesel was surprising quiet at the front..even quieter than Volvo Mk 3</p>
