              <p>I'm a lazy guy, who has basically scanned through the replies in
              this thread.  This is the only reply which has hit the nail on
              the head.</p>
              <p>Think about it.  MOT, through LTA is paying SBST and SMRT
              Buses for the manual ramp.  They have make it a law that from
              now on (actually that day  a few years ago, amybe 2 or 1
              year??), all public bus purcahsed must be accessible to the
              pysically challenged people.  SBST and SMRT annouced that they
              would start replacing all old buses with this new type of buses
              progressively, until 2017.</p>
              <p>When SBST bought in the first B9TL, what did they do? 
              Annouce that this is a "Wheelchair Accessible Bus" in front of the
              media and public.  This was in cooperation with LTA.</p>
              <p>When SBST bought in the scania K230UB, they also did the same
              thing.</p>
              <p>This also happened to SMRTBuses when they annouced the OC500LE
              at NUS (or was it NTU??).</p>
              <p>If you are the public, what is your perception? These 200 B9TL
              and 500 scania K230UB are "WAB" buses, which physically challenged
              people are able to access.</p>
              <p>However, SBST and SMRTB, after feedback from the public and LTA,
              decided that until the infrastructure (interchanges, bus stops,
              terminals) are made BFA (Barrier Free Access under BCA code), the
              services not designated as "WAB" which uses the B9TL and K230UB
              would not be letting PIW board.</p>
              <p>But the public already know these buses as WAB, so when 1 comes
              round, which is NOT "WAB" certified, the BC / SL hands are
              tied.</p>
              <p>The posts above me has already had a great debate over whether
              the BC should / shuld not let the PIW board.  I don't want to
              add to it, as it is fruitless to debate it here, while the
              authorities have made a mistake in the publicity plans of this.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>People with disabilities are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PEOPLE</span> too,
              so why treat them as "second class"?</strong></span></p>
              <p>What difference does it make if a person with a disability is
              injured in an accident of whatever description as opposed to a
              person without a disability?  Everybody has equal liability
              (at least in Australia they do).<br> <br> In what way does a bus driver need to "handle" a person with a
              disability apart from deploying the ramp so that they can access
              the bus?  So long as any wheelchair is parked in the
              appropriate areas, that's all there is to it.</p>
              <p>From what I can see, most people's arguments in this thread are
              narrow-minded and selfish.  You need to wake up to the
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FACTS</strong></span> before
              making any sort of suggestion on this matter.  Picture
              yourself in the position of a person with a disability -
              particularly one who requires the use of a wheelchair, even if this
              requirement is temporary.</p>
              <p>Plus you people need to learn how not to offend others on
              sensitive matters such as this.</p>
              <p>Regards,<br> Dave - Your enthusiast with a disability for all those who actually
              care.</p>

              <p>they're not treated as second class, their situation actually requires them to receive better treatment compared to the rest of us. its just that the BC cannot afford to give that extra care. situation now is BC has to give that extra care at the expense of himself.</p>
              <p>if the previous posts are correct, he's not going to get praised by his company for that. he's going to actually get a scolding if his company finds out he helped a PIW.</p>
              <p>What australia does, does not concern singapore. there are countries where disabled are even abandoned. if equal liability is truely what you want, why should there be better treatment for the disabled?</p>
              <p>you have my sympathies if you really are a disabled but truth is there's a limit to what the society can do for the disabled in singapore.</p>

              <p>if u are a PIW who dun take public transport and have your own means of transportation, this thread will not surface in the first place.</p>
              <p>SBS n SMRT is telling us, that PIWs who wish to use public transport but the services are not fully developed at their areas, to approach MCYS for SUBSIDIZED Cab/PIW Enabled Van ride.</p>
              <p>If u dun need a subsidy then dun approach MCYS.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry but you too have missed the current gist of my replies
              - there needs to be an obvious way, such as a decal, of telling the
              uninitiated that the route is not wheelchair-ready yet although the
              WAB is plying it. Otherwise you'll continue to leave people like
              the rowdy kids and other passengers on the bus with a bad
              impression.</p>

              <p>suggest what can be done then. a decal with a "no wheelchair" sign to tell them that the particular service cannot allow PIWs to board the bus? isn't more done to show that the bus the service is on accepts PIWs onboard, like putting the WAB decal in front of the windscreen for certified WAB service? if PIWs is unsure of whether a particular service's WAB buses accepts PIWs onboard, they can ask someone else at the bus stop before boarding the bus itself. another method is that if that particular bus stop has a real time information panel of the bus arrival times, if there's a WAB sign there, it signifies that the service itself is certified ready to accept WAB.</p>
              <p>they can also check what services are certified WAB services before they go out. an example is via SBST website, which they list all of the officially certified WAB services there, this is a rather obvious way to tell the PIWs what services are catered to them. more methods can be done to tell the PIWs that a particular service is certified to accept PIWs onboard or not, but at least SBST tried to get the message across to the PIWs.</p>
