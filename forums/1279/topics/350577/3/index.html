              <p><br>SBST trying put across clearly which service can be taken as WAB. As in you are able to wait a reasonable timeframe for a WAB bus to come. If all WAB buses are scattered, it would be purely luck for PIW to get a WAB bus to their destination. And certified means safety measures are already done either to bus stop or even road. And people down here only think that WAB means can let PIW board which seems to me that they are thinking out of goodwill of themselves only. Anything happens, it is purely BC fault. No one DARE to defend BC. Show compassion to BC either rather than just PIWs.</p>

              <p>Ok let's say my sv62 got one perm k230 WAB. Fine. A PIW need to wait 2hrs maximum for tat k230? So is sv62 WAB service now? Interesting. Being a bus fan, there's no reason why you don't understand what's happening as to why not allowed for PIWs to board non-wab service. If all WAB buses are able to let them board, what's the big deal for WAB ceritified service? For what? Shame on you either.</p>

              <p>You guys are bus fanatics, and thus you know the difference. Other people who do not have to ferry around a wheelchair-bound person regularly or any interest don't. Some folks are wheeled around for only a while, say after surgery or some other treatment.</p>

              <p>From the driver's point of view i can understand that its a risk that a PIW is being taken on board, simply because he isn't train to do so yet. The driver do not want to cause any unneccesary harm to the person who has difficulties in mobility.</p>
              <p>Heres my point of view:</p>
              <p>The Scania KUBs do not have safety belts like those found on SMRT OCs. Hence, the driver who is not trained would not know where to park the person in the wheelchair properly to prevent the wheelchair from moving around when the bus is in motion. I've seen before an unsecured luggage shifting and crashing around the bus on 858. I cant imagine that happen to a PIW. As such, the driver chose not to take on the disabled passenger, to prevent such accidents.</p>
              <p>If the driver is trained to do so and he rejects such cases, then he should be given a warning/punishment.</p>

              <p>if BCs are not trained to allow PIWs onboard the WAB buses, it, as what was said, is dangerous. would you rather risk a BC being reprimanded/sacked than allowing a PIW on board? SBST and SMRT pay BCs to do their job, which is to drive buses and cater to passenger's needs when needed but when they say this service is not officially WAB, the BCs driving the WAB buses of this service cannot pick up PIWs, simply because its dangerous if the BCs are not trained to do so. if the BC (which shouldn't be the case) messes up, who is going to clear it up? its not up to the BCs to decide to allow PIWs onboard the WAB buses but rather SBST and SMRT to decide since there are safety regulations to adhere to. if the BCs was allowed to let PIWs onboard the WAB buses, won't any BCs give a helping hand to them, to help them board and alight the bus?</p>
              <p>and, if you are trying to fight for the PIWs, i already see more and more facilities (not buses) becoming wheelchair-friendly and even more coming up. im sure the government is already trying really hard to make more facilities cater to the wheelchair-bound population.</p>

              <p><br>Many BC on Non-WAB services are PHOEBIA of WAB buses because of such incidents. And all people just think BCs are at fault. What can they do? Just swallow all this anger? BC are humans too! Not only think of PIWs, think of BCs either please. Blame company for this policy and stop shifting all blames to BCs for rejecting. Getting complains would affect their bonus etc. Who give compassion to them?</p>
