              <p>DD with same amount of freq = not fully utilised, earn lesser, dun think they would wan that<br>DD exchange with more SDs = not enough manpower or costs too much<br>DD with lousier freq, but can cut cost = fully utilise, but end consumer won't be happy about the freq</p>

              <p>Of course, longer frequency = more pax boarding, if like that, those svcs with DD, I rather they take off DD and double the amount of buses (ie 1 DD = 2 SD) to boost the frequency</p>
              </div>
              <p>I don't agree taking away the DD idea. They should buy more DDs instead to cater our overpopulated population, just like HK.</p>
              <p>I'll rather they intorduce more DDs, having a standard 15 mins interval (5-12 mins for super high demand services), running on dedicated bus lanes and guided bus systems. Bus operators provide timetables for the services and commuters take the initaitive to plan their journeys before hand. Buses should of course be 99.9% punctual.</p>
              <p>This benefits both commuters and bus operators.</p>
              <p>Commuters:</p>
              <p>- know the exact timings of the bus coming to the bus stop (+/- 1 min)</p>
              <p>- faster and uninterrupted trips</p>
              <p>- more chances of getting a seat and board onto the bus. Comfort wise, a notch up.</p>
              <p>- allow them to plan their journey when they know the timings.</p>
              <p>Operators:</p>
              <p>- Require less drivers and thus lower operational costs</p>
              <p>- Less brunching. Imagine the number of buses brunching if intervals are 10 mins and wasting resources when there are empty buses. More operating costs??? Service 27 is a fine example.</p>
              <p>- Less space for depots, since there are lesser number of buses. Save costs for operators as well.</p>
              <p>- DDs takes up less space for our space limited roads while carrying more people.</p>
              <p>If you want to say that not all places are DD friendly, look at the airport services in HK and compare it with Singapore. It just depends whether the authorities wants to commit or just talk only.</p>

              <p>I already find some of the bus services improving their frequecies recently from our bus operators.</p>
              <p>But don't bank your  hopes too high when LTA takes over the bus planning next year. At the rate they are going, most likely they will be screwing up the bus system here more in future.</p>

              <p>Saw the entire thread on this topic. Just to share my view.</p>
              <p>So what is LTA doing??? Taking their own sweet time??? Wasting money on those useless digital timing panels in city bus stops which proved unreliable and inaccurate most of the times, instead of investing the money to improve WAB facilities on bus stops/interchanges first??? Think about it, bus operators are already buying so much WAB buses in bulk, and now they are still waiting for LTA to allow WAB buses to fully perform their intended purposes. Isn't LTA being very inefficient here???</p>
              <p>If LTA had planned earlier for public transport to cater disabled commuters, they should have done all these long time back, before allowing bus operators to bring in WAB buses in the first place. All these years, they just talk and talk only, but actually working on to bring in the facilities, what are they actually doing???</p>
              <p>All these should be done many years ago already, when LTA was upgrading the bus stops island wide many years back. Not just upgrading the bus shelters, sheltered walkways but also should have planned to make these bus stops more WAB friendly in the first place. Howvever, no. I am quite surprised that some of the new bus stops still have steps on sloped bus stops. If the terrain does not allow the WAB friendly access to the bus stop, surely they can build a ramp (like those found with the staircases of housing estates) to allow PIWs to access the bus stops easily while bus stops still can be WAB friendly. Slopes and uneven terrains are just excuses for their half hearted commitment to improve the accessibility of the disabled people to bus stops.</p>

              <p>just sidetrack a bit.. What if say LTA has problems finding contractors to do all these infrastructural upgrading? Construction industry fault? or still government's fault for concentrating too much on IR?</p>

              <p><br>Firstly, if LTA are able to find contractors to build new bus stops and upgrading bus stops in the first place, surely these contractors are able to build WAB facilities as well too during the mass bus stops upgrade, right??? And if LTA had planned all these WAB and PIW services better earlier on,  would they have problems in engaging contractors before the ultimate deadlines???</p>
              <p>Secondly, I am sure that LTA had partnerships with many contractors after so many years of existence and so many projects sourced to these contractors. So I don't really think they had problems in engaging a contractor in the first place unless they screwed up, etc, offering unreasonable prices for the projects.</p>
              <p>And please seperate the issue from IRs. IRs are big projects, most likely they will be taken up by very big construction companies. Fyi, most of the construction projects by the government are offered at low cut throat prices. Construction firms are not making huge profits for these projects. So they have to consider whether taking up the project is feasible or not. Smaller projects like this are more often taken up smaller construction firms which are more than the bigger firms in numbers. Bigger firms mostly won't take these projects as they are inprofitable. They actually make losses instead. Heard all these from my friend in Civil enginnering.</p>

              <p>Actually it might be more than that. Look back and see how many construction firms had gone bankrupted and how many projects got delayed because of all these for the past few years. Remember the Telok Blangah viaduct delay???</p>

              <p>I asked, I read the forum, the letter from SMRT says buses cant take in PIW users because they arent certified and there is no logo yet..</p>
              <p>So he said, Yeap, it's true. But I just let the PIW user to come in. Most passengers helped him to push the PIW up the ramp..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall: what i can say about this is that, they are not allowed to bring in PIW in non-certified WAB buses. But, it may depends on the driver..</p>
              <p>sorry if i had listed things that are wrong, but im trying to get some information abt WAB buses and PIW users...</p>

              <p><br> Firstly, if LTA are able to find contractors to build new bus stops
              and upgrading bus stops in the first place, surely these
              contractors are able to build WAB facilities as well too during the
              mass bus stops upgrade, right??? And if LTA had planned all these
              WAB and PIW services better earlier on,  would they have

              <p>is it even the ultimate deadline yet? i see in no way that it is reaching there yet, though they are slow in their works and could have started it earlier. you won't know if there's lack of contractors until they start to engage them before/after the WAB and PIW services have been implemented because they might all be taken up to do other projects.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, but some routes cannot utilise DDs at all.</p>
              <p><strong>Actually was the lifespan of the old buses also considered during this whole debate?</strong> The new buses have to replace the old buses after their <strong>17 years</strong>. I'm starting to think the debate have to consider this too, regarding infrastructures and stuffs.<strong> Only recently were there major retirements/fleet renewal</strong> to bring in B9TLs, K230UBs and OC500LEs with major technological and fuel advances with Zero Step over the B10Ms and N113s they are replacing. Unless SMRT and SBST had started to replace all their buses which are still roadworthy at 10/11 years where the first low-floor bus is making their debut, which most bus fans will also find it doesnt make sense...we'll already have most infrastructures and bus stops WAB accessible now.</p>
              <p>So during the 17/19 years,  mostly still having a fleet of high step buses, and saying that LTA can do tests with specifications and stuffs, i find it odd. Most infrastructures were built to accomodate high step buses in the past, including depots. They'll need a demonstrator anyway, because real world tests yeilds solid results that cannot be denied. Not just the tests at bus stops, there are various tests such as the climate and weather among others.</p>

              <p>there's always the red tape regarding the matter of whether PIW's can board or not. but this is a good way to circumvent the matter. in a sense, both parties are happy. the PIW gets on his way, and the bc  gets to keep his job.</p>

              <p>There should be at least something planned ahead so that things can get done before the services can actually fully rendered. Rejecting passengers onboard a bus because the infrastruture wasn't ready is certainly a joke. It shows that they are not ready for the service due to their poor planning.</p>
              <p>This is akin as saying for an example.</p>
              <p>SBST brings in a fleet of 100 B9TLs, but they do not have the parts for the staircases to the upper saloon yet, due to contractor's fault or whatsoever. Thus they can only build up the bus completely without the staircases. But they are in dire need for these new buses, so they are put onto service. But the upper deck was blockade because of lack of the stairs to the upper saloon. Passengers cannot go up, they can only stay in the lower saloon of the bus. What do you think as a commuter's point of view???</p>
