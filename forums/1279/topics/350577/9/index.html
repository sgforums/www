              <p>You dun really need the actual bus to test out the bus stops you
              know... There are specifications and dimensions... If the bus stop
              doesn't fit to the dimensions specified then work needs to be done,
              easy as that. No need for actual bus to go around to physically
              test it. Talking about bus stops here.</p>

              <p>Routing shouldn't be a problem. If there is, then even WAB buses

              True. They said they can accomplish practically anything and everything, and yet being on time for such a scenario is something they didn't accomplish. Isn't it the ministries' fault?

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Heres my 2 cents worth.<br><br>LTA has been converting many bus stops to PIW friendly ones already. (like widening the gap between the bollards). There are certain bus stops where it is not possible to convert, such as those on slopes (unless u want to repave the whole road?). Another type will be those that are on a narrow pavement beside some fence (like some LCK ones).<br><br>I believe there are several reasons why services are not WAB services:<br><br>1) The bus stops along its route are not PIW-friendly (some of the non-PIW friendly bus stops seems perfectly fine to me, dunno whats the reason behind it)<br><br>2) The route is not PIW friendly. (I dont really think 151 can be a WAB service cos the NUS roads are too steep. If PIW forget to lock wheelchair then they will get injured)<br><br>3) The BCs are not trained. Its not as simple as driving a bus. There are many small things to take note of. I saw a 198 BC undergoing training b4. The instructor was telling him to stop the bus in line with the 1st bollard or something so the wheelchair ramp will open up exactly between bollards. Some BCs may not be willing to take uo this extra responsibility.<br><br>4) Not enough WAB buses. I rmb last time someone complained to ST forums that he waited more than 1 hour for a Svc 7 WAB at Botanical Gardens bus stop. So if SBST cannot commit the required number of buses, it will not be a WAB service.</p></div>
