              <p>if a service was to be officially WAB, they will announce it in other means. the BC keeping the WAB decal which should be placed on the windscreen already meant that the service the bus is on is not certified to pick up the PIWs yet.  the BCs are paid to do their job, and when SBST and SMRT says they can't ferry such passengers, the BCs will have to follow what they say. not up to the BCs or even the PIWs to decide.</p>
              <p>having to carry a wheelchair-bound person is tiresome, but have any of the PIWs ever thought about the BCs? they, having to support their family with the amount of money they earn, having to endure such incidents that can be avoided, and yet i see or hear little PIWs (not referring to this case) who doesn't show a sense of gratitude to the BCs.</p>

              <p>Guys, just wanna make a point here that WAB buses that are brought in on non-WAB services can also mean that the buses are catering other types of passengers, e.g. the elderly, children and people with difficulty boarding the bus (e.g. people with slight injuries to their leg but still can walk) , not just PIWs.</p>
              <p>I view the WAB buses on non-certified routes as Super Low Floor/easy access buses instead, till they get certified properly to carry PIW. We all have a part to play and work hand in hand with SBST/SMRT and LTA. the "no PIW on WABs that are on non-certified routes" is only temporarily...not permanently.</p>

              <p>You got a point there. Is just a matter of conflict. The BCs are like the 'role models' of the company and the ambassador to the company. Some BCs would still accept PIWs onboard their buses even though they are on non-WAB services just simply they care about the service they give to the passengers. Some BCs would be strict to the rules while some just ignored them to go the extra mile for the need of their fellow men and i salute them for that.</p>

              <p><br>You are simply very naive in your thinking.</p>
              <p>I think i'll have to echo some of what the rest said earlier as i scanned thru their replies.</p>
              <p>Both scenarios will relate to a WAB on a non-PIW certified service and what happens for the BC after seeing  a PIW at a bus stop with even gradient.</p>
              <p>1. BC helps the PIW by letting him/her board the bus though its not certified &gt; PIW appreciative of the matter &gt; Fellow commuter ask newspaper/SBST directly about this &gt; SBST will reprimand BC &gt; BC <strong>MAY</strong> lose job due to this or educate BC to check WAB decal</p>
              <p>2. BC does not help PIW &gt; Friend of PIW complain &gt; driver insist not to ferry cos not certified &gt; PIW/friend complain to newspaper/SBST &gt; SBST will issue a reply saying its not a WAB service so cannot ferry any &gt; PIW/friend got arrowed again.</p>
              <p>It is because of the complain nature by us, as well as not wanting to incur more cases/manpower hours/paperwork because of this, it would be more advisable not to declare PIW friendly unless its done illegally.</p>
              <p>Life is complicated my boy. More like your life is too simple. Goes to show you haven't grown up yet. If you want compassion, be prepared for the arrows. If not, just follow law. You first day live in Singapore ah? Just as much as I hate certain procedures whenever I work, I have no choice sometimes but to work with it, work around it, or override the work. hahaha...</p>

              <p>I'm a lazy guy, who has basically scanned through the replies in this thread.  This is the only reply which has hit the nail on the head.</p>
              <p>Think about it.  MOT, through LTA is paying SBST and SMRT Buses for the manual ramp.  They have make it a law that from now on (actually that day  a few years ago, amybe 2 or 1 year??), all public bus purcahsed must be accessible to the pysically challenged people.  SBST and SMRT annouced that they would start replacing all old buses with this new type of buses progressively, until 2017.</p>
              <p>When SBST bought in the first B9TL, what did they do?  Annouce that this is a "Wheelchair Accessible Bus" in front of the media and public.  This was in cooperation with LTA.</p>
              <p>When SBST bought in the scania K230UB, they also did the same thing.</p>
              <p>This also happened to SMRTBuses when they annouced the OC500LE at NUS (or was it NTU??).</p>
              <p>If you are the public, what is your perception? These 200 B9TL and 500 scania K230UB are "WAB" buses, which physically challenged people are able to access.</p>
              <p>However, SBST and SMRTB, after feedback from the public and LTA, decided that until the infrastructure (interchanges, bus stops, terminals) are made BFA (Barrier Free Access under BCA code), the services not designated as "WAB" which uses the B9TL and K230UB would not be letting PIW board.</p>
              <p>But the public already know these buses as WAB, so when 1 comes round, which is NOT "WAB" certified, the BC / SL hands are tied.</p>
              <p>The posts above me has already had a great debate over whether the BC should / shuld not let the PIW board.  I don't want to add to it, as it is fruitless to debate it here, while the authorities have made a mistake in the publicity plans of this.</p>
