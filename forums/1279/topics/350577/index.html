              <p>I boarded SBS8371C (Service 54, towards Bishan), which was a wheelchair-friendly Scania. I apologise if I got the license number wrong.</p>
              <p>Halfway through the journey, there was a female passenger who had a wheelchair-bound son. They wanted to board the bus, having waited half an hour, but the driver said no, that the bus was either not meant to take wheelchairs or it had somehow become unable to. A group of teens at the bus stop started kicking up a fuss, and then the driver showed that he kept the wheelchair sign for the windscreen in the driver side to reiterate his point.</p>
              <p>The woman went to the rear exit of the bus, while I asked what the driver was saying in Malay to get himself out, and how he could say such a thing. The back doors were still open and another passenger deployed the ramp for her. All this time the driver argued with the teens but never moved more than a yard away from his seat.</p>
              <p>I don't approve of the verbal abuse and pounding that the group did, I was appalled by what the driver did. I spoke to the woman and she said (calmly but sadly) that drivers of the similar SMRT buses had also driven away when they saw her son. She received no reply when she asked for an explanation from the management. Another women muttered that the driver was probably "lazy".</p>
              <p>Without taking any of those words at face value, let me check with you guys:</p>
              <p>- if drivers of handicapped buses are allowed to remove the wheelchair graphic from the windscreen or refuse handicapped passengers (how could such a simple manual folding ramp fail anyway);</p>
              <p>- if they are taught to step out, deploy the ramp, and place the wheelchairs properly (facing the rear); and</p>
              <p>- if I got the license number right.</p>
              <p>(Edited for accuracy in second point in bold)</p>
              <p>Copied from my subsequent posts:</p>
              <p>So the route isn't WAB-certified. Then...</p>
              <p>- And what business has SBS in deploying such a bus on this route when it could be used for a real WAB route?<br><br>- Above all, where is the flexibility and compassion, or are we just following law?</p>
              <p>There's also an arrogant presumption on the part of the two bus companies that the message has been made sufficiently clear to everyone.</p>

              <p><br>1. If the bus arrived with the wheelchair sign still stuck to the windscreen and then the driver proceeded to remove it, then the driver or I should say the management is at fault.</p>
              <p>2. If not, then the driver has the right to refuse entry to the wheelchair-bound person because Svc 54 isn't a WAB service (and why the heck are they waiting for Svc 54 anyway since it isn't WAB).</p>
              <p>3. SMRT has no WAB services yet; which means they have the right to refuse entry to wheelchair personnel.</p>
              <p>4. The driver should have driven the bus away instead of letting the fuss continue.</p>
              <p>5. The teens as well as the woman who actually helped deploy the ramp are idiots. Screw them. The driver has a schedule to follow and these people are delaying travelling time for the rest of the people by creating unnecessary noise. Shame on them for being so inconsiderate. If they want to help jolly well help on a service that's certified WAB.</p>
              <p>6. I repeat; Svc 54 isn't a WAB service, so if the woman and her wheelchair-bound son are waiting and expecting a bus to pick them up, they can wait till the cows come home.</p>
              <p>7. You don't have the right to ask the driver why he said no, it's supposed to be no anyway, so what if he said no?</p>
              <p>8. You probably got the rego right.</p>
              <p>9. The woman who called the driver "lazy" is stupid herself. The driver isn't being lazy; he's only following specific protocol given to him when he drives the Scania buses.</p>
              <p>10. Drivers are allowed to remove the WAB decal if it was accidentally put on; the service isn't certified WAB so all the more the drivers should remove it.</p>
              <p>11. Yes they have been taught to deploy the ramps, but in the case of a non-WAB service, they cannot deploy unless given permission. No means no.</p>

              <p><strong>Oceane</strong>, I am totally appauled by your attitude towards this matter.</p>
              <p>In Australia, we have what is known as "Anti-Discrimination Policies".  People with disabilities (let's not use the derrogatory term "handicapped" please - this may offend some people) have equal rights where applicable and/or practicable as people without disabilities.</p>
              <p>In addition, the driver's actions of removing the International Disability sign from the windscreen of his bus is an act of vandalism and should be treated by the management of the bus company as such.  Refusing a passenger in a wheelchair should be a sackable offense.<br><br>While I don't condone the actions of the other passengers in this instant, I am at least happy that there are some people with the right attitude towards people with disabilities in Singapore.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p>Is there even any regulation that buses with the WAB sticker only can take wheelchair passengers? From another perspective, all the new buses have the Wheelchair Help button on the outside of the exit doors, thus since that thing is permanent, it is a certified wheelchair accessible bus.</p>
              <p>If the bus has the facilities: the ramp and the seat belts, there should be no problem in the bus carrying the wheelchair. The way you seem to worship the WAB sticker simply amazes me. I've personally seen several SMRT Buses carrying wheelchair bound passengers even though they are not "WAB Services" as i quote. <strong>Refusing a passenger onto the bus, especially in this case a child and his mother, is simply a repulsive act.</strong></p>
              <p>I do agree that the passenger should have known better, but the majority of your comments simply reflect this community and SBS Transit as one that is insensitive, discriminatory and inflexible - it is simply sad.</p>

              1. The wheelchair logo was not supposed to be on the windscreen of that bus because Service 54 is not cleared to carry passengers-in-wheelchair.
              
              2. The bus being permanent on a non-WAB service, it is the rule rather the exception that it will never be issued the wheelchair logo. If the driver had kept to his seat all the while, I assume he did not take out the wheelchair logo as you have asserted but merely shown that the wheelchair logo was not there.
              
              3. When the passengers took things onto their hands, the driver, without clearance from OCC, could be reprimanded for carrying a PIW, because he is not trained to handle a PIW at all and this can be dangerous for everyone involved.

              driver or I should say the management is at fault.</p>
              <p>2. If not, then the driver has the right to refuse entry to the
              wheelchair-bound person because Svc 54 isn't a WAB service (and why
              the heck are they waiting for Svc 54 anyway since it isn't
              WAB).</p>
              <p>3. SMRT has no WAB services yet; which means they have the right
              to refuse entry to wheelchair personnel.</p>
              <p>4. The driver should have driven the bus away instead of letting
              the fuss continue.</p>
              <p>5. The teens as well as the woman who actually helped deploy the
              ramp are idiots. Screw them. The driver has a schedule to follow
              and these people are delaying travelling time for the rest of the
              people by creating unnecessary noise. Shame on them for being so
              inconsiderate. If they want to help jolly well help on a service
              that's certified WAB.</p>
              <p>6. I repeat; Svc 54 isn't a WAB service, so if the woman and her
              wheelchair-bound son are waiting and expecting a bus to pick them
              up, they can wait till the cows come home.</p>
              <p>7. You don't have the right to ask the driver why he said no,
              it's supposed to be no anyway, so what if he said no?</p>
              <p>8. You probably got the rego right.</p>
              <p>9. The woman who called the driver "lazy" is stupid herself. The
              driver isn't being lazy; he's only following specific protocol
              given to him when he drives the Scania buses.</p>
              <p>10. Drivers are allowed to remove the WAB decal if it was
              accidentally put on; the service isn't certified WAB so all the
              more the drivers should remove it.</p>
              <p>11. Yes they have been taught to deploy the ramps, but in the
              case of a non-WAB service, they cannot deploy unless given
              permission. No means no.</p>
              <p>Need I say more?</p>

              <p>I have seen bus captains of non-WAB services take on wheelchair persons. Personally I feel glad that these bus captains offer the extra mile in transporting the passenger.</p>
              <p>I am quite sure that this is a <strong>grey area</strong> in Singapore. WAB service or not, always argued here, but I am sure to note this point that <strong>there is no point in denoting a service WAB or not</strong>. Thinking of it, its quite waste of time. But company have regulations, country has its laws. I don't want to go against those.</p>
              <p>Once, upon witnessing a SMRT bus captain having problem deploying the ramp, I offered my, perhaps extra and unnecessary help, depending on viewpoint, to open the ramp for him and for a similar passenger, a woman and her son who is in a wheelchair, to board the bus. He got the hang of deploying the ramp, which he previously thought was automatic, and the lady and son got on the way to their destination.</p>

              <p>You guys can show compassion to the person in wheelchair, but I think why not you be a driver yourself to find out how stressful it is?</p>
              <p>Firstly, you have to try to explain ever so fruitlessly to the passengers who might not even listen that you cannot accept a passenger in wheelchair.</p>
              <p>Then if you allow the passenger on board, you are 1) infringing the laws set by the company; 2) delaying you own schedule and increasing the run time for the remaining passengers on board.</p>
              <p>So you can emphatise with the passenger in wheelchair for all I care - I'm not condoning them much, except maybe for the fact that they didn't do their homework before hand. If they had done so, they would have known that Svc 54 isn't certified WAB.</p>

              <p>Yes. The certification requirement for WAB is important. A WAB service has a minimum 50% fleet of WAB buses, and scheduled WAB headway of 30 mins during peak and 60 mins during off-peak.
                  <br><br>
              Imagine any PIW expects to take any bus service which he has knowledge that it has a few WAB buses running, and unfortunately none came for an hour or longer, then he/she writes in to complain. Who's fault will it be?
                  <br><br>
              The driver also needs to be trained in WAB. If an incident involving a PIW occured on a bus on a non-WAB service and it's due to negligence on the part of the driver as he have not been trained to handle that incident, it will once again be the fault of the bus company. Safety is an utmost concern for any PTO in Singapore, and they will rather be safe than sorry.
                  <br><br>
              SMRT may have a different protocol of handling PIW's, but I'm waiting for a PIW to "spoil market" by writing in to complain that a bus with WAB buses running made him/her wait for an hour, then probably they will tighten their regulations too.</p>

              <p>WAB - Wheelchair Accessible Bus. Drivers can <strong>try</strong> to explain but if they don't listen there's not much the driver can do.</p>
              <p>Other than cyberspace? A simple phone call will do. By right the woman should have had her own database of which services are WAB and which not.</p>
              <p>If it can ONLY be used on WAB routes, then what is the exact rationale for buying them in the first place? It takes time to modify certain bus stops and certify a service WAB. I'm sorry but you just got to wait.</p>
              <p>You can draw your own line between flexibility and compassion, at the end of the day it's YOUR job that matters. If you would like to be reprimanded by the management because of your compassion, then by all means go ahead.</p>

              <p>Hi, as long as the WABs did not display PIW accessible logo on the LHF windscreen, it means that it's not a WAB service. As explained by Tamago, some bus-stops are still not certified PIW friendly, so even if it's a WAB service, PIW still unable to board the bus. Though there's already quite a few WAB on 851, SMRT WABs are not yet PIW certified.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Having a WAB bus on a route does not mean it can take WAB buses. Imagine if having just 1 WAB bus in a service's fleet means it must be WAB, so there's no choice but to deploy half of the fleet at one go, and letting them rot in the depots when the time is not up for them to be used. Then someone will soon write in to ask why our fares are so high and there are so many brand new buses rotting inside depots.
              <br><br>
              A bus company will not commit to declaring a service as a WAB service if it is not ready to do so, for whatever reasons it may have.
              <br><br>
              A driver is not required to explain this as it can get lengthy, as we can see in this thread. Any PIW is welcome to write in to SBS Transit on this if the driver refuses to take him/her on grounds that it is not a WAB service, but to accept a PIW on a non-WAB is a no-no.
              <br><br>
              It may look to you as an ideal situation that every driver driving a WAB-ready bus can take in PIW's, but this is not the case. If the bus did not arrive within an hour because the a few non-WAB buses came in succession, does all of them have to explain why he had to wait so long too? No matter what happens, the blame will always be on the PTO. Then the bus companies are really shooting themselves in the foot for buying WAB buses and they should just revert them to low floor and abandon this whole effort to equip these new buses to be WAB-ready.
              <br><br>
              And based on the current fleet situation of Service 54 and its controlling depot, it does not qualify as a WAB service. As for Service 851, it will be up to SMRT.</p>
