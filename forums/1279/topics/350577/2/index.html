              <p>but 54 is not a WAB route. and regarding WAB buses, if tat is being e case (i.e. WAB buses must not be on non WAB routes) then we'll be seeing SBS replacing 1000 buses at 1 go instead of it being gradual. meaning to say, you'll see all e buses currently on e road to be used up to 17 - 25 years bef being replaced together for total WAB fleet</p>

              <p>In Australia, we have what is known as "Anti-Discrimination Policies".  People with disabilities (let's not use the derrogatory term "handicapped" please - this may offend some people) have equal rights where applicable and/or practicable as people without disabilities.</p>

              <p>The reality is, the purchase of wheelchair accessible buses has nothing to do with a company's stance on people with disabilities.  Just because SBST/SMRT are purchasing these low-entry buses doesn't mean that they are in support of people with disabilities (particularly those who require wheelchairs) using their services.<br><br>There will always be the occasion where certain stops restrict the amount of accessibility and this even occurs in countries where discrimination of people with disabilities is illegal.  This can be due to older infrastructure, the lay of the land, and other factors.</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is, and this is something that Singaporeans need to be more supportive of, is that people with disabilities are at the end of the day still people, and derserve the same respect that everybody else deserves.  They are not "different" apart from the fact that they MAY require addition assistance.</p>
              <p>In the majority of cases, I have found that bus drivers inflict stress upon themselves.  They are paid to perform certain duties, and catering for the population is one of these duties.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p>no... i think the first post misrepresented the driver's intention with regards to that. there was no wheelchair logo on the windscreen, if you would read posts down the thread.

              if there were, then the CCTV would be put to good use.</p>

              <p><br>SBST trying put across clearly which service can be taken as WAB. As in you are able to wait a reasonable timeframe for a WAB bus to come. If all WAB buses are scattered, it would be purely luck for PIW to get a WAB bus to their destination. And certified means safety measures are already done either to bus stop or even road. And people down here only think that WAB means can let PIW board which seems to me that they are thinking out of goodwill of themselves only. Anything happens, it is purely BC fault. No one DARE to defend BC. Show compassion to BC either rather than just PIWs.</p>

              <p>Let me just ask you 1 simple question here. We all know that the BC is most likely not training to handle PIW. Don't forget that handling PIW don't only meet knowing how to operate the ram. The question is:</p>
              <p>If the PIW somehow gets injured in the bus, who will be responsible? You?</p>
