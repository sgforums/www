              <p>This one is 100% agreed. However I think the main problem is the thing about the PIW unfriendly bus stops. The government was the one that came out with this rule, and should have pre-empted the situation by modifying or doing whatsoever was needed with them. It looks like the transport ministry has stepped on its own toes on this one.</p>

What I am talking rite now has NOTHING, NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the transport companies. Oh btw if you didn't know, bringing a PIW on/off a bus is easy. You dun even need the ramp.

              <p>This one is 100% agreed. However I think the main problem is the
              thing about the PIW unfriendly bus stops. The government was the
              one that came out with this rule, and should have pre-empted the
              situation by modifying or doing whatsoever was needed with them. It
              looks like the transport ministry has stepped on its own toes on

              <p>you expect them to have finish modifying all the bus stops before they came out with the ruling? even if they started when they came out with the ruling, do think of manpower. there are so many bus stops in Singapore, manpower is needed for them to retrofit the bus stops, but at the same time, manpower is also needed for other things as well. doesn't building MRT stations and lines/infrastructure, building structures need manpower?</p>
