              <p>Like what i've emphasized before,Give it a rest.We just wait and see how long they can go like this.Thats show that the woman doesnt have any experience in transport sector at all.I understand your feeling and yes i too was so dissapointed they deploy the OCs for the RWS service which i think should let the private operators the chance.If i'm the CFO or CEO,First thing shift Kranji to a new depot ie at CCK or Bt Batok Ind estate and AMK to a new 3 storey depot and buy more buses for fleet addition and new service for Sembawang area.</p>

              <p>From the posts I see in the previous pages, what I want to say is that this society has forgotten most of its roots and fundamentals, everything now is just about profits and money. Why blame the citizens for being too materialistic when the country's upper management is the one who lead such a trend in the first place???</p>
              <p>Our transport authorities has already forgotten the roots and the basics of a flexible and efficent public transport system, which we started off with the bus system. A bus system can be more efficent and profitable to start with and maintain and more flexible to keep track and changes with the commuters travel patterns, than an inflexible and expensive rail system. However in Singapore, the transport authorities would rather purposely make bus systems less attractive by ignoring and delaying whatever possible improvements can be done on the system. Look at Hong Kong, despite a small but highly populated city like Singapore, bus system standards are way on first class standards. Despite plans making Singapore public transport system world class in 1996 in the White Paper, after 14 years of "big talk and promises", many still disregards it as a highly efficient first class world class system.</p>
              <p>Another point to note, ever since the MRT line is being opened in the late 1980s, fare increases has been occuring every year, till now. And ironically, despite building facilities and private housing around the train station premises which causes land prices and property prices to increase, fares still increase every year. Either rails are really too expensive to build, maintain and recoup losses in Singapore or else this means that the citizens are being overcharged in fare increases or overtaxed in acquring properties near these areas, be it residential or commercial, through the "money generating" tool called the MRT station.</p>
              <p>Lastly to share, if Singapore can stop all these senseless population increase from now onwards, and focus more in nation building and society well being with only the 5 million population in Singapore in the next few decades, we will not need to build so many expensive MRT lines, and the funds can be channelled to other more meaningful areas like education,  health care, and even solving our own water issues without Malaysia help. No wonder more Singaporeans are migrating and more and more Singaporeans are thinking of migrating. </p>
              <p>So just work hard and earn more money in future to fund your own transport. A rigid, inflexible system that practise double standards and unwillingly to improve based on feedbacks and only place more and more emphasis on money rather than the human factor is doomed to be ruined. Rely on yourself instead, rather than to rely and suffer under silence with an inflexible system that doesn't want to listen and improve. Take MRT everyday and get squeezed in a sardine can travelling in a dark and noisy tunnel??? I rather drive my own car, take a bus/cab.</p>

SMRT's 190 is earning alot of money , every 2 -5 mins , at least a 190 will come ! i doubt SBST beat the fast frequency . Both companies have their good and bad .</p>

              <p>Freq, bus itself is one thing, how one arranges e schedule, running time matters also.</p>
              <p>Like I've mentioned abt e Sv 966 running time, somemore I remembered the driver was only given 9 mins break.</p>
              <p>Running buses or public tpt needs a lot of effort and time to plan everything nicely. If one thinks of just making lots of profits from it, e output to commuters would be equal.</p>
              <p>If SMRT can plan RWS88's running time w/ 90 mins (foreplan), I dun see why they can't for obglied svs. Even 963R was travelling at 50kph along BKE somemore BC still had long break at RWS. So profits to be made, do kilat. Nothing much to earn, just dun care?</p>
              <p>SMRT has to remember who it's operated for esp from a stat board background.</p>
              <p>Dun say ppl condemn them, it's they dun want to committ themselves when they've shown on RWS they could.</p>

              <p>I have done through 2010 Bus Rationalisation. that means SMRT Buses will be gone. all these cases they are 16 bus operators to be present in Singapore. 2010 bus rationalisation will meant that they will do tendering and competition. in singapore, transport authority do centralised planning now. Everything is about to suffer, withdrawing the VO3X (Batch 1), LO3X have been begun and complete in 2011. VO2X are withdrawn already.</p>
              <p>That means that NX Northern became North Coast and is bus company operated by Transport for Singapore, which also includes Southern Buses, unless the Southern Buses is now part of Govia, and either that they might integrate CT Plus, or Blue Triangle or both.</p>
              <p>All that means Arriva, First, Govia, Transdev are happy. ComfortDelGro and SMRT is still unhappy.</p>

              <p>I'm not talking about Malaysia. I don't know why are you so critical about Malaysia. Every country has its own problems. At least in Malaysia, you can pay for a bunglow for a price of a small 4 room HDB flat here. Where people want to migrate is their own personal choice. At least they voted themselves out using their own feet. Well, that happens when the citizens gets so fed up and tired of a country that is so unique. Anywhere they go is just better than living here forever.<br>Well, stop complaining about the place where others prefer.</p>
