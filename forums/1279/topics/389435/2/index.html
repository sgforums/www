              <p>I think it is quite unfair to blame SMRT in any way. Well, if they think the outlook for bus operations is bleak and afraid of losing bus tenders, I don't see why they can't. It's the company forecast and things like these are often mentioned during financial reports.</p>
              <p>Anyway, many decisions regarding our transport system have already left many bemused over them. In fact, the latest QoS doesn't seem to even serve its purpose. I still see 20 mins frequency getting scot-free from any potential fines and all the talk and no walk seems to have gotten even more cars on the roads.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is quite obvious that u condemning SMRTB. Till this day , don't you see an improvement ? SMRTB standard may not be better than SBST , but look at their MRT Lines . EW Line + NS Line + Circle Line vs NE Line ..SMRT earn big bucks , with the strong foundation of high demand for it's train . SMRT's 190 is earning alot of money , every 2 -5 mins , at least a 190 will come ! i doubt SBST beat the fast frequency . Both companies have their good and bad .</p></div>

              <p>improvement is not simply buying OC and Citaro. That's just face looks.</p>
              <p>I still see ppl fuming w/ overloaded Sv 966 during PM peak. but wat's e freq? 15 mins? somemore running time given from CJC to Bt Panjang Rd/ Blk 270 is only given 15 mins, even at 70kph needs 18 mins. Yet for RWS8, short journey can be given 34 mins to travel. Tat day e bus I was onboard travelled at 30kph at e bridge en-route Vivo. Maybe because more profitable so put in heart and soul on it. isn't it double standard? our own ppl can't even be given reasonable sv on basic svs.</p>
              <p>It's always all these small details tat makes whether is do or break.</p>
