              <p>In the strictest sense, SMRT Corp is still a GLC.</p>
              <p>We have already known that the moment the rebranding was announced. They should just divest off the bus operations and sell it to another MNC (e.g. KMB/MTR/FirstGroup) or by management buyout who knows how to run it better. It makes finanical sense, too.</p>
              <p>Better still rename it back to TIBS. De-mergers have happened before, just look at the auto industry.</p>
              <p>BTW today's papers have again announced the possible rationalisation of bus routes with the opening of the Stage One/Two Circle Line.</p>

              <p>Defensive, are you sure?</p>
              <p>- The corp top management previously hails from a business that demands aggressive marketing to survive. They constantly ran promotions, full-body ads on win free travel and go green, while SBST only have gone as far as Moove Media.</p>
              <p>- While keeping fixed operating assets (other than retail) at constant they have increased their variable operating costs in the recent years. They have hired so many platform staff and drivers than ever before.</p>
              <p>- Increasing reliance on chartered services. Bus-Plus is probably the most profitable. SMB contracted services next. Look at how much they have devoted into RWS services.</p>

              <p><br>Flats bo bian. Now HDB is simply left w/ 120,000 to 150,000 new units to build forever. It's unless SAF trg ground in e northern corridor are cleared for housing devt.</p>
              <p>Land usage intensity would only get intensed as e yr goes. Even Jurong Island has problems of storing chemicals/ oil products alrdy</p>
              <p>But price of flats still has to be reasonable. But 1 thing abt ex flats is it'll make ppl think twice of buying cars.</p>

              <p>Well, SMRT is improving their passenger service a little too much. They invested in new PIS systems, bought new buses that aren't cheap, eventhough they are reliable and economical and unnecessary mobitec Electronic Display Signs. Also, their bendies are quite fuel hungry. It requires $500 worth of diesel to fill the fuel tank which would run out by the end of a regular AM/PM slot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To make things more worse, the drivers are wasting the fuel by not sticking to schedule. One good example is Service 912. The buses bunch up very often, even during off-peak with even both buses with little or worst, no passengers. This is wasting precious money on precious diesel. Sorry if my reply turned into somesort of a rant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, i fear LTA building more MRT lines because of inadequate land mass and the vast enviromental destruction involved. The downtown line depot at Kranji is already a clear example. They had to dig up quite alot of earth and cut vast amounts of forest and even exhumed a few graves which made me quite cross. It's better LTA improve our current lines and not build somemore. Also, if you depend too much on trains and one day a big disruption happens, Singapore's transport system would just stop like a snap of a rope.</p>

              <p>The scholars are hedging a hell lot on the MRT lines. It had better work out although I dont think it would cos there's no way we can just suka suka shift the lines. Even expanding or contracting the capacity is next to impossible. It is possible actually. But for some reasons "costs" keep coming up as the main factor.</p>
              <p>We've got our CPF and yet we're being held hostage by profits. Which part of that makes sense?</p>

              <p>Thing is tat we can't be forever building MRT lines being very costly for one and looking at the DTL, new lines wun be tat convenient either (like buliding for e sake just for MRT to serve smaller neighbourhood and likely to take longer travelling distance mileage for transfer and to destination, resulting in even more expensive fares than current direct bus system).</p>
              <p>Anyway they can tell me replacing ez-link single trip ticket w/ RFID chip technology (end up e chip no need to queue up again and return as the returning slot is located at the exit gantry) ish too costly. They dun even get it why there's long queues at GTM for stations like Orchard on weekends and they blindy tell me they're going to control e queue length <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>Funny, they can be so willing to spend millions that e scholars themselves will never get to earn in their lifetime on MRT, yet small investment to improve our current quality of life they get scared over cost <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Rent seekers they're</p>
              <p>SMRT's CFO says she expect stiff competition on e tendering public bus sv system. Pls la, the output they give to commuters currently would really end up like CMB in no time.</p>
