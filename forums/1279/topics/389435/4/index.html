              <p>I'm not talking about Malaysia. I don't know why are you so
              critical about Malaysia. Every country has its own problems. At
              least in Malaysia, you can pay for a bunglow for a price of a small
              4 room HDB flat here. Where people want to migrate is their own
              personal choice. At least they voted themselves out using their own
              feet. Well, that happens when the citizens gets so fed up and tired
              of a country that is so unique. Anywhere they go is just better
              than living here forever.<br> Well, stop complaining about the place where others prefer.</p>

              <p>So in translating to Singapore's context, it looked almost like it is a "North South Line" where Asakusa is "Jurong East" and Ueno is "Yishun" sort of . (Due to the time availability, it does not fit into Aljunied - Outram Park trains or Marina Bay - Ang Mo Kio trains)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, how does the video above where link was provided by E5, where the person who took the video knows that this was the train has the 40 sec lead (I mean there might be many similar rolling stock what)</p>

              <p>So in translating to Singapore's context, it looked almost like it is a "North South Line" where Asakusa is "Jurong East" and Ueno is "Yishun" sort of . (Due to the time availability, it does not fit into Aljunied - Outram Park trains or Marina Bay - Ang Mo Kio trains)</p>

              <p>It's more of demand rather than time availibility. The limitation of this line is that unlike NSL and EWL during morning peak where only a direction on a certain portion of the line is in high demand, the whole of this line in both direction is in high demand.</p>

                              isn't it. Too bad the 200 series (C651) does not have this

              <p>The C651 technically can too. It's the same family of propulsion system supplied by Siemens.

              <p>Keikyu is on standard gauge (1435 mm) while JR is on Japanese Narrow gauge (1067 mm).</p>
              <p>What I would like to add on to folks who are in awe at the Ginza Line timetable, I must remind that there are areas in Japan where there are only one or two trains (for example, Iwazumi Line in Iwate Prefecture) per day on the line. Why so few? It all down to <strong>utilization</strong>.</p>
              <p>I believe that its not the first time I brought up this topic when it comes to transportation. Places where there are a lot of commuters, service have to be upped. But this does not mean upping the entire network's frequency. How about up s975's frequency when adding buses to s190? Not sensible right.</p>
              <p>Japan has a network of strict utilization and hence where its busy, trains run frequent, where it is less utilized, services will be cut.</p>
              <p>How does it relate here? Well, you gotta weigh out the places that are running empty buses and trains and places where its packed like sardines. Frequency is one thing; the amount of people taking them is another. However it is in responsible systems that we see tight schedules coupled with packed trains, loose schedules with well, a fully seated transport.</p>
