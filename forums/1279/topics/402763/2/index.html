              <p>what makes you think that SBST is that broke just because they chose Scania over MB? indeed the OC500LE is more expensive, and if an alternative product delivers the same overall benefit (ie conveying passengers from one point to another reliably) and costs less, which would you go for?</p>

              <p>Why SBST cant afford to buy 1100 mercedes buses? The OC's cost is not much higher than KUB and is MUCH cheaper than the B9TL. If SBST can afford to buy B9TL, why cant they afford to buy 1100 mercedes. it all depend on whether they want or not.</p>

              <p>If some of fanboys can complain the KUBs like shit everyday, why can't others complain about SMRT lousy bus services?</p>
              <p>I don't think KUBs are that bad that will kill you in a journey, neither did I even complain about the OCs or even the ELBOS and UDs, as buses themselves. You want to support that irresponsible company then it is your business, don't come and make so much noise and type long paragraphs scolding people everytime other people disagrees with you. SMRT destroys and disgraces bus services in Singapore,  a reputation that TIBS and CCS have built up for decades, particularly in the segment of commuters in the north, almost overnight. Since they don't see the focus in the bus operations, get out of the market and focus on their rail business.</p>
              <p>I didn't say that KUBs are very good, but at least SBST modifies them time to time to keep them better, and most of them are well maintained, despite being inferior quality. And I don't think the KUBs are that bad too, just that SBST has tied up their potential by locking up their gears for safety reasons, which is a lesson learnt from the string of accidents occurred in the 1990s. For the K310UD, I think it is fast, despite being a double decker, but it's gearbox is not locked as far as I know.</p>
              <p>As for China buses, I don't like both of them, the Yutong and this King Long and I do hope no more China buses from both operators in future. And I don't even bother to complain the Yutong bus, unlike you, complaining this and that after taking the bus. Don't blame Yutong for the bus, ask why SMRT want to buy it anyway since it is lousy.  I think even one day SMRT buy horse carriages as buses, people like you will say good, nice bus. SBS buses are still shit.</p>

              <p>Look who's barking here all the time. Since you are so busy, you can still reply these load of nonsense after that? Childish kid trying to act like an adult. If this, if that... Well, continue living in your fantasies in comparing rats with elephants, no wonder our public transport is still a laughing stock with this kind of standards, and still wanting to be world class. I say if only KMB comes and kick SMRT out of the market, then we can see world class bus services here. And same here for your complains about the KUBs or whatever, be glad that SBST is still buying European buses for now, not like the buses in India which you claim is so terrible that SMRT buses are so great. (FYI, some India bus companies are buying Volvo buses.) We don't know whether there will be a mass purchase for China buses in future, which I hope no.</p>
              <p>I'll don't post to entertain people here, especially to bunch of clowns like you. Want to read or not, is your own business. I post to create awareness because clowns like you like to screw up nonsense on things that do not actually happen, be it intentionally or unintentionally.
