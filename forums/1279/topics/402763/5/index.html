              <p>YOG. something the gahman took pride in bidding for, but yet the ppl dont support it. Whats the point then, its like inviting neighbors for cny but give a black face. Might as well dont invite? How will the world look at this.</p>

              <p><br>People do not look down on MIC products for no good reason. CCP knew that when they began their encouragment of consumerism in China. </p>
              <p>Higer is a bus. But to put it crudely, "just because you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you have to do porn". Period.</p>
              <p>Why YOG is something people are not particularly interested in and even resent to a certain degree? Because we don't feel we have a stake in it, even if we actually do.  ( face! ) And its not something without its inconveniences.</p>

              <p>@sbs2601d: so would u kindly enlighten the reason why MIC products are being looked down? and, although i do agree that YOG could be something not interested in, why so? If u dont have a stake in it, put in a stake, volunteer to do something. Most ppl in beijing are enthusiastic about it, yet not everyone have a stake. and yet most here dont even know the opening ceremony date?</p>

              <p>Its not to say no other country is guilty of fraud, greed etc, but China is particularly susceptible because of the way CCP was driving the country economically.</p>
              <p>People do not feel for YOG. Simply because of this: Were we consulted over whether we should bid for the hosting? If decisions were made unilaterally, wouldnt it be natural for people to lose interest?</p>

              <p>Its pretty saddening to know that 1. ppl look down on MIC products and 2. ppl do not get enthusiastic for the YOG.</p>
              <p>Whats worse, is that the higer is also a bus. Bus enthusiast while disliking a bus? Thats pretty ironic issnt it. Its similar to saying that to liking the library but dislike books. Furthermore, Hybrid Fuel Cell technology is something new. Mercedes-Benz only came into the market recently last november with their Mercedes-Benz Citaro FuelCELL-Hybrid. This makes sg one of the few cities with buses running on this tech and yet as bus enthusiast some look down on this bus.</p>
              <p>YOG. something the gahman took pride in bidding for, but yet the ppl dont support it. Whats the point then, its like inviting neighbors for cny but give a black face. Might as well dont invite? How will the world look at this.</p>
