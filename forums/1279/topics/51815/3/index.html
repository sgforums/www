Service 985 is a much faster link than service 106 for Bt Batok passengers to get to and fro Bendemeer Rd.

Although it's a short-distance service connecting the national/indoor stadiums area and Kallang MRT station, but is useful for those transferring to/from MRT trains.<br></div>

HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH Yes Geylang is by no means TIBS territory as a town... but Geylang Lor 1 Terminal IS WELL AND TRULY TIBS Property. Geylang Lor 1 Terminal is actually the THIRD TIBS depot after Kranji and AMK.. while Woodlands is the fourth. Unlike all other terminal and interchages, Geylang Lor 1 Terminal has refueling facilities and underground fuel reservoirs. Plus Geylang Lor 1 is the main SSB/CSS Depot. The other one is AMK. And certain TIBS service buses esp svc 853 sometimes are stored in Geylang Lor 1 like in other depots.<br><br>The actual reason why SBST shun Geylang Lor 1 is because the terminal is TIBS territory. The terminal is actually very strategically placed to spring short working trips into the city area during peak hours and if SBST owns it they would surely have made very good use of it.</div>
