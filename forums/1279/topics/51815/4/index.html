Geylang is not TIBS territory and there are no neighbouring TIBS towns for a TIBS service to pass through before going to the stadium area.. but Geylang Lor 1 is the most suitable staging place because people would likely want to change to the service from Kallang MRT....so the only non-policy-compromising solution would be for SBST to operate the service and perhaps pay TIBS the parking rights??</div>
