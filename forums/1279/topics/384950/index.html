              <p>G'day all,</p>
              <p>It is with much sadness that I announce that Transperth Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE CNG demonstrator TP.1854 has been destroyed in a fire in Perth today.</p>
              <p>It was burnt beyond repair in a fire whilst on the road earlier today.  The cause of the fire is so far unknown.</p>
              <p>Following a short stint in service in Perth for evaluation, TP.1854 was shipped to Singapore for evaluation and then onto Malaysia for display.  It was then shipped back to Australia where it underwent extensive modifications at Volgren in Melbourne and then rentered service in Perth.</p>
              <p><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p><em>"Mr Clementson said the fire started at the back of the bus where
              the motor was and it took four fire trucks about half an hour to
              extinguish the flames."</em></p>

              <p>Oh dear, terrible news...Will our new OCs explode without warning too?</p>
              <p>In hindsight, it might not be a bad idea to choose Scanias after all ... I think any chance of SBST ordering OCs in the future would have gone up in flames with this news.</p>

              <p><br>It depens on how the individual company takes care of the buses.</p>
              <p>Also to add on for Tibs/SMRT, there have been a number of Lances and bendies that caught fire and were scrapped. Eg. TIB675K, TIB900K, TIB936H, TIB1110S.</p>

              <p>Not necessary. It may not be the single deciding factor, but it will influence potential buyers' evaluation, particularly so if the product is still new. Mcdonnell Douglas went bust because after the Turkish Airlines DC10 crash, the news scared many airlines into not choosing it.</p>
              <p>And London did decide to get rid of all their bendy buses.</p>

              <p>McDonnell Douglas did not go bust after the TK DC10 crash, it was the cancellation of SQ's MD11s over range deflicit(it couldn't fly Singapore to Paris Nonstop without severe fuel, cargo and weight penalties) that many other airlines followed and killed the MD11 programme, which MDD sunk a lot of capital into.</p>

              to occur.  I suspect that the fires wouldn't have occured if
              this oil supply line was rerouted so that any leaking fluids would
              leak directly onto the road.<br> <br> Regards,<br> Dave</p>

              <p>Perhaps because of the old engine block design? If im not wrong, re routing the turbo oil supply will result in changing ur engine block design, because ur oil is fed from the engine via a gear pump attached to the engine casing. Hence you will notice why sometimes the turbo is placed only at a certain area and not anywhere on the engine(altho turbocharging pipe length that affects engine performance also play a role).</p>
              <p><br>From the trend i noticed, seems like most turbo failure occured on the OM447 engine block. From a little info i saw from documentaries, different engine block and series are assembled on completely different plant lines. It is possible that the line that produces the OM447 block could have some problems resulting in the poor quality weld.</p>

              <p>there are many factors that lead to a bus catching fire...one of it is like what Dave mentioned above...and since most of these fires occur on the OM447 engine platforms. let's hope that there's not much of a problem in the OM457 engine platform.</p>
