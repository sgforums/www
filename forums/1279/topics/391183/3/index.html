              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Since you shield so much over SMRT I would like to hear
              what you have to offer. Let's make it a constructive discussion
              between you and me.</p>
              <p>From my personal opinion. And fact is if you were to observe.
              SMRT loses out in many areas, they profit big cos they own much of
              the rail network which has close to no alternatives and if you were
              to ask me, they aren't doing a good job with their rail service.
              Their lunchtime express is under utilised,
              practically only 10 people in the car with me from Toa
              Payoh to City Hall. During peak hours, I often see sudden 5min
              frequencies in the middle of peak hours den a continuous
              1min bunching for the next few trains. At peak hours, you
              practically have to either squeeze or wait for the second train to
              board on the NSL, EWL.</p>
              <p>CCL is only a few months old and underutilised, is that fair
              judgment?</p>
              <p>Currently, SBST and SMRT arent really competing. cos you have
              take either to get to where you want most of the time. and usually
              whichever comes first, you naturally choose to board cos
              Singaporeans are always chasing up for lost time.</p>
              <p>Firstly, for buses, what's the SMRT and SBST territory for if
              they really are competing? If you were to tear down the
              current territories which is clearly in favour of SMRTB, SMRTB
              wouldn't stand a chance.</p>
              <p>When LTA issued the 10-min ruling for peak hours last year, I
              would say SBS Transit was proactive in making fleet additions since
              late 08 all the way to 3rd Qtr 09, practically every week different
              services were getting fleet additions, sometimes more
              than 5 at a go. SMRT waited till they very last minute and only
              added about 20 splits just before the "ruling" which I would say
              isnt really abided by? a few to 970 and some of the city
              area serving services.</p>
              <p>for SMRTB, the only thing i really observe improved was for
              190 and 970, the improvements after thousands of
              complaints to the extent they couldnt sit on it already, that they
              went to do smth and made a difference. i have to say now 190 and
              970 are much better but it could have been done much earlier, and
              till now still can be improved esp AM Peak. i belive they did smth
              cos these are their cashcows. SMRTB interior and exteriors arent as
              clean as SBST ones, and SMRTB ones often have lots of pests (esp
              AMDEP). SMRT's 1209S of 190 livery is like all brownish
              already and it plies the heart of Orchard Rd, if its SBST's 402 or
              SMRT's 925 where its really dusty, it is still forgiveable.</p>
              <p>a ponit to infer tho, SMRTB do have less breakdowns (their
              Mercedes are solid) than SBST (B10Ms and
              doubledecks ahve alot of technical problems) but
              SMRT has more accidents and more fatal ones. for me, i rather be
              caught in a breakdown than an accident. what about you?</p>
              <p>for SLRT, BPLRT has broken down so many times within 3
              years of operations from 1999-2002 remembering the accident
              which caused injuries. while SK/PGLLRT hasnt really broken down
              much since 2003.</p>

              <p>I suggest you look at things at the big picture, the amount of money given may be small, but it means a lot to bus drivers, to a bus driver, it shows that the bus company is appreciative of his efforts/work. Yes, he is serving his notice, but serving notices means his name is still on the company's payroll, so in a sense, the company is discriminating against a certain group of employees (luckily this wasn't Europe, the unions would have had a class action against the company for that), and ethically, a company should extend the same level of goodwill to the employees belonging to this group.</p>
              <p>Pardon me, but it just seems that we are heading into an uncaring society.</p>

              <p>the whole issue is NOT about how much money the angpow contains, its about FAIRNESS and ACCOUNTABILITY. if he was promised the angpow, he has every right to request for it. </p>
              <p>since its no big deal to you, remind me to notify your employer when you actually start working to withhold your bonus or goodwill offering which has been promised to you. you can say the premise of a bonus or goodwill gift is different, but the PRINCIPLE is the same. we'll see what you have to say about that.</p>
