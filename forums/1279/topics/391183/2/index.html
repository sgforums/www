              <p>Maintenance is an unprofitable part for any transport company. Buses should not require so much of maintenance , from what I know mostly they just change the black oil and  wash the a/c filter. From my point of view, most of the buses which breakdown seems to be overheated.</p>

They are just sliding doors... not plug doors. It is inevitable that the doors will shake a little. Besides SMRT doesn't design their own trains, they order Electric Multiple Units from other companies. I thought you knew that.</p>

              <p>I think this is a rather irresponsible statement to say. When the trains were new, there are no signs of shaking or loose doors.

              <p>I do think that we need to look on the big picture, what is irrelevant to you may not be totally irrelevant from this forum. There is too much emphasis on the physical aspect of transportation in this forum, like cameos (for some unknown reasons) . The transportation industry itself, has much more to be explored, some of which are strikingly similar to everyday life/other industries.</p>
              <p>In this case, what seems like a rant to many brings us insight in some of the HR processes of a company in the industry, and I do see that having sensible discussion (hopefully there is) on the topic will be fruitful.</p>

              <p>No point siding on one company's side. If you like to compare Outram Park station. I can say that Serangoon station too. I can say that SMRT's CCL is much cleaner than SBST's NEL in Serangoon. Come on, we all know that you are just pointing out bad points from other company just to show support of the company that you side.</p>
              <p>Every company has its good and bad points. Both beneficial and non-beneficial to different types of perception. No point throwing bad insults at other company when both companies have good and bad points. It just showing that you just want to gain support for your sided company. No doubt SBST is currently the leading transport operator with ComfortDelgro as its backup, but would it be good if SBST runs a monopoly within Singapore? Think before posting.</p>

              <p>No point siding on one company's side. If you like to compare Outram Park station. I can say that Serangoon station too. I can say that SMRT's CCL is much cleaner than SBST's NEL in Serangoon. Come on, we all know that you are just pointing out bad points from other company just to show support of the company that you side.</p>
              <p>Every company has its good and bad points. Both beneficial and non-beneficial to different types of perception. No point throwing bad insults at other company when both companies have good and bad points. It just showing that you just want to gain support for your sided company. No doubt SBST is currently the leading transport operator with ComfortDelgro as its backup, but would it be good if SBST runs a monopoly within Singapore? Think before posting.</p>

              <p>Since you shield so much over SMRT I would like to hear what you have to offer. Let's make it a constructive discussion between you and me.</p>
              <p>From my personal opinion. And fact is if you were to observe. SMRT loses out in many areas, they profit big cos they own much of the rail network which has close to no alternatives and if you were to ask me, they aren't doing a good job with their rail service. Their lunchtime express is under utilised, practically only 10 people in the car with me from Toa Payoh to City Hall. During peak hours, I often see sudden 5min frequencies in the middle of peak hours den a continuous 1min bunching for the next few trains. At peak hours, you practically have to either squeeze or wait for the second train to board on the NSL, EWL.</p>
              <p>CCL is only a few months old and underutilised, is that fair judgment?</p>
              <p>Currently, SBST and SMRT arent really competing. cos you have take either to get to where you want most of the time. and usually whichever comes first, you naturally choose to board cos Singaporeans are always chasing up for lost time.</p>
              <p>Firstly, for buses, what's the SMRT and SBST territory for if they really are competing? If you were to tear down the current territories which is clearly in favour of SMRTB, SMRTB wouldn't stand a chance.</p>
              <p>When LTA issued the 10-min ruling for peak hours last year, I would say SBS Transit was proactive in making fleet additions since late 08 all the way to 3rd Qtr 09, practically every week different services were getting fleet additions, sometimes more than 5 at a go. SMRT waited till they very last minute and only added about 20 splits just before the "ruling" which I would say isnt really abided by? a few to 970 and some of the city area serving services.</p>
              <p>for SMRTB, the only thing i really observe improved was for 190 and 970, the improvements after thousands of complaints to the extent they couldnt sit on it already, that they went to do smth and made a difference. i have to say now 190 and 970 are much better but it could have been done much earlier, and till now still can be improved esp AM Peak. i belive they did smth cos these are their cashcows. SMRTB interior and exteriors arent as clean as SBST ones, and SMRTB ones often have lots of pests (esp AMDEP). SMRT's 1209S of 190 livery is like all brownish already and it plies the heart of Orchard Rd, if its SBST's 402 or SMRT's 925 where its really dusty, it is still forgiveable.</p>
              <p>a ponit to infer tho, SMRTB do have less breakdowns (their Mercedes are solid) than SBST (B10Ms and doubledecks ahve alot of technical problems) but SMRT has more accidents and more fatal ones. for me, i rather be caught in a breakdown than an accident. what about you?</p>
              <p>for SLRT, BPLRT has broken down so many times within 3 years of operations from 1999-2002 remembering the accident which caused injuries. while SK/PGLLRT hasnt really broken down much since 2003.</p>
