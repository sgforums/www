              <p>decent photo, but try to centralise your object more (i can see it leaning more towards the top).</p>
              <p>and if possible, maybe can slower the shutter speed so as not to have the annoying flash rate spoil the eds. 1/100 is ideal for a full eds if you have manual control over the settings.</p>

              <p><br>hmm my advice to you is try to get used to familiarise with functions of a DSLR first. different brands have different settings and functions. sometimes you have to compare between cameras in order to decide what you really need.</p>
              <p>For eg between a canon EOS1000 and a nikon D70, the colour setting for EOS1000 is better in a sense that it captures real colours. a D70 with sunny settings have colours which tend more to red and i have to set it to flash lightings in order to capture the colours closest to reality.</p>
              <p>and i wonder if you know that its better to get DSLRs with remote control functions. personally, i prefer those with remote shutters because i need not set any timer in order to capture images when using a tripod. this is especially useful when you are taking shots of buses at night which only stop for a couple of seconds, or taking shots of fireworks.</p>
              <p>ISO wise, try not to whack ISOs at a max because of the noise in the image tends to be more when taking photos in a dark place. and normally for sunlight shots, ISO of 200-500 is managable, but avoid using ISO1600 since the dark parts of your shots will be sparsely scattered with some noise (unless you are telling me that you are using nikon D3X which has a high ISO of  6400 max and for that, ISO1000 can be reasonable still)</p>
              <p>one more tip - normally for buses with EDS of a slow flash rate (i.e 1/50-1/200) i will manually control my settings. if you cant really gauge whats the shutter and aperture to use at that instant, either use shutter or aperture priority so that you know how fast the shutter is going to be like in variable conditions when a picture of reasonable exposure is taken.</p>
