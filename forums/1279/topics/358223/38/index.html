              <p><br>If you are getting married and taking photos with nice bacjkground scenery. Do you want yr face to be bright or BLACK?</p>
              <p>Sunlight is just added on to the photos, not necessary you need to have that.</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to argue my way out with you. But if you are able to get better photos with nice lightings on that particular day, why not use it rather than waste it? It isn't difficult to get good sunlight direction.</p>
              <p>Example Serangoon Garden, 360degree you will be able to get nice sunlight. It just depends on whether you want to use it as a complimentary to your photos or not.</p>

              <p><br>That's out of context.</p>
              <p>And it depends on individuals. If they don't consider it wasted I don't see why I should be complaining.</p>
              <p>What merely happens is that the subject becomes under-exposed, or over-exposed. And it need not be sunlight to "ruin" a picture.</p>
              <p>And there are times you intentionally under-expose the subject to get a better view of the background, that you must surely know.</p>
              <p>I'm not arguing for the sake of doing so here. What I'm saying is that there's a thin line between "good" and "bad" pictures and that line varies according to individuals and their intentions.</p>

              <p>I don't know why you guys like to nit-pick at him. You say you try to teach him fail, unless you taught him by PM, then I don't know how you did it. I am someone who doesn't know how to use sunlight at all in my pics, and I still don't know how. Giving examples doesn't help if you don't know the fundamentals or the basics. Stop giving bad comments and stop making fun of him. What kind of culture is this? Same went for TTS, why continue to make fun of him?Why are you guys doing this? Both have, in my opinion, 'given up'. Bus555 doesn't want to post pics anymore, even though it is only 1 week. TTS, he isn't as active as he used to be anymore. </p>

              <p>btw, after comparing with my fren's W910 with mine (C510), ive learnt that a HP cam (W910), which records up to 15 FPS, there would be distortion in the pix due to speed (produces jelly-like pic) while my C510, which records up to 120 FPS, would not distort the pic, but it would only show bluriness on the pic.
