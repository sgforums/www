            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hseochin:</div><div class="quote_body">Upon checking the engineering drawing @ their website, i notice they now use the same citybus dashboard which was used on the SL252 (similar as on O 405) on the 18.280 as well !<br><br>But i sense something's not quite 'right' in that they pass off the 18.280 shown in the website photo as 'chassis' only because the bodywork certainly does appear to me to be of 'sufficient' quality in design &amp; finish to pass off as original MAN citybus body instead !?! The 'themes' in the styling is certainly consistent with MAN integrally constructed CBU OEM bodywork which 'flows smoothly' from their bus to coach to truck product lines, i observe. Most unlikely therefore they should say it's 'chassi' only as such ? Maybe the body shown only used as 'model' for illustration purposes ?? As such i find it somewhat confusing because looking @ the complete bus purely on looks it would likely be though to be a SL252 or SL262 instead ?!?<br><br>In conclusion, i'll say that what's currently shown @ the MAN website is probably only their current product line-up for the Malaysian market i.e. they don't show the older models like those SL252 used by Intrakota &amp; these are the ones my 'engine perception' instincts (based on perceived levels of 'soildness' &amp; 'sound power') tells me that the 12-litre was ever used on their citybus model like the SL252 &amp; in view of the larger physical dimensions of a 12-litre (compared to say a much smaller 7-litre unit) it's most certain in the SL252 that the 12-litre engine was horizontally mounted like on O 405. If it's a coach body then maybe they'll consider vertical mounting as well in view of the lesser need to ensure a low floor level compared to in the case for a citybus body.<br><br>I note there's no 18.250 mentioned @ the MAN website, so that'll mean one can't be too sure yet that the engine on the 18.250 is vertically mounted ??<br>Why i don't think the engine is vertical is because in order for it to be vertically mounted onto a citybus body (with the emphasis on as low as possible as floor height) the engine would have to a 'small' cc engine (like 7-litre instead of a much bigger 12-litre unit) so that the longitudinal protrusion is not too 'long' that they need to raise the rear section of the body too high &amp; long. If the 18.250 uses the 7-litre engine then possible it's vertically mounted since the protrusion into the body is minimal. BUT having actually 'heard' the 18.250 on my rides taken, the sound characteristics simply tell me the engine used cannot be as small as 7-litre, which means to me the next larger known engine they use is the older noisier 12-litre unit, which for citybus body mounting would most certainly have to be horizontally mounted.<br><br>So, you could be right that the 18.250 has vertically mounted engine but i think the best way to be sure is to flip open the bonnet to find out...but for the reasons mentioned above, i'm still doubtful.<br><br>As for the MAN models used in HI's fleet, assuming they use only the current models available on CW2, i then expect it to be 18.313 instead of 18.280, as earlier though, unless MAN offers 2 versions of the 18.280 i.e. citybus &amp; coach versions ?? But if it's the 18.313 the engine doesn't sound like a MAN 12-litre engine to me, more like a 7-litre instead ?!<br></div></blockquote>The picture of the bus on the 18.280 HOCLR page is actually an SL252 with HICOM bodywork. There was another page (closed) in the HICOM website which showcases the SL252 (with the same picture) and I remember it stated its engine capacity at roughly 7 litres with 250 hp. I'm pretty sure the 18.280 (on the webpage) and the 18.250 (HI's bus) is the same but with different engines only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 12-litre engine used on the 16.240 used by SJE sounds exactly like the engine used on the SL252, only noticiable difference to me being that SJE uses manual while Intrakota uses automatic. From actually taking rides on both models i notice both are equally 'lethagic' in acceleration &amp; speed etc. Both are very loud but smooth running engines, like BMW car in-line 6-cylinder engines !!<br>From the SJE engine capacity declaration on the bodywork, the cc is stated either as 11970 cc or 11967 cc i.e. 12-litres.<br><br>Therefore knowing how the 12-litre engine 'feels' like, it then becomes logically difficult to think that the SL252 used a 7-litre engine only as then the sound characteristics expected to be quite different ? Unless MAN replaced the older 12-litre with the newer 7-litre in later versions of the SL252 ??<br><br>Based on the engineering drawings @ the MAN website, i'll agree the 18.280 &amp; 18.250 both use the entry-level 3-step citybus chassi &amp; dashboard but with physically different engines.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The picture of the bus on the 18.280 HOCLR page is actually an SL252 with HICOM bodywork.

            <div class='col-md body'>This shuttle service, does it circle around Bukit Indah estate before heading for the expressway towards Gelang Patah station ?

On the bus signage is written as such &amp; they also state the price as RM3.<br><br>I don't know what's the frequency &amp; timing of the shuttle bus and I wonder if this is a worthwhile effort since most people from Bkt Indah tend to wait at the main road leading to the highway to board the Kotaraya-local route CW3 during peak hours. During off-peak, there doesn't seem to be any passengers taking the shuttle service.<br><br>But I wld say the shuttle service would certainly benefit more residences of Bkt Indah if it takes on the route usually taken by Triton 501/ HI 111, picking up passengers from within the housing estates (invisible bus stops in front of the houses) instead of just from the main road, which is what CW3 is currently doing. And it wld be also good if the pick-up point includes Bestmart.<br><br>Therefore, if HI wants to provide the shuttle bus for the long-run, then perhaps it's good to use the "midibuses"?</div></blockquote></div>

From actually taking rides on both models i notice both are equally 'lethagic' in acceleration &amp; speed etc. Both are very loud but smooth running engines, like BMW car in-line 6-cylinder engines !!<br>From the SJE engine capacity declaration on the bodywork, the cc is stated either as 11970 cc or 11967 cc i.e. 12-litres.<br><br>Therefore knowing how the 12-litre engine 'feels' like, it then becomes logically difficult to think that the SL252 used a 7-litre engine only as then the sound characteristics expected to be quite different ? Unless MAN replaced the older 12-litre with the newer 7-litre in later versions of the SL252 ??<br><br>Based on the engineering drawings @ the MAN website, i'll agree the 18.280 &amp; 18.250 both use the entry-level 3-step citybus chassi &amp; dashboard but with physically different engines.<br></div></blockquote>I have an engine shot of an Intrakota MAN SL252.
