The off areas like Muar still gets older buses for the future. Even they are able to get better buses, you sure other problems wun rise with their resources?</div></blockquote>Like I said, they don't need more buses. The operator can make the bus licensed to carry 80 passengers if they want. Its just a matter of putting more seats and more hand straps. The issue is the GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) or the maximum laden weight the bus could carry which, in the case of the MAN 18.250 (18 000 kg), is similar to that of the B10M, N113 and O405. Hence, the 18.250 is able to carry as much weight as the S'pore buses.<br><br>If the bus is licensed for 67 it doesn't neccessary have to carry 67. A bus packed from end to end will roughly have about 100 people inside. In fact, the provision of a lager standing area in the forward section of the MAN 18.250 is intended to pack in more passengers, at the expense of having fewer seats. Therefore, if the 18.250, in its HI config, is indeed put on 151 for example, I think it will be able to carry more passengers at one go given the extra standing space, as compared to the B10M with its narrow aisle.<br><br>I admit Malaysia IS getting better buses. Don't talk about 'cowboy' towns like Muar lah. The current breed of high floor, front engine bus is good enough for them. These buses go through winding country roads which is usually battered and could be even prone to flooding. So, it is not wise to use such expensive machinery. Even so, you would still see at least one new rear-engined model.<br><br>However, the outlook of buses in the big cities like KL and JB have changed. Now we see more European marks such as MAN, Mercedes, Dennis and Scania. Although the city buses are getting there, the express buses have improved vastly. Now we see big, powerful buses such as MAN 18.310, Scania K124IB and others ruling the highways.</div>

From what I understand, the higher capacity for the S'pore buses are due to the higher number of standees. Seating wise, it's roughly the same: CRB (51), MK 2 (51), MK3 (50) MK4 (50). Please note that there are single seats on the MAN 18.250 which accouts for a lower seating capacity. If a S'pore operator were to buy a similar bus as HI, it's not neccessary for them to buy more buses. Instead, the operator would tailor the bus to suit its needs.</div></blockquote>That's true,Believe it or not SBST O 405 can take slightly more pax than the "Coach" B10Ms due to its standing areas.I've seen a fully loaded(more than 100)MAN 18.280 before and it's truly amazing how this machine can handle it's speed well with that kind of loads!</div>

BTW, anyone also taken photos of it so far ? Would appreciate if i could see them &amp; i could e-mail you mine in return ? Reason why i ask is because my camera's resolution not high enough to show more detail.<br><br>Besides this model i'm also keen on any dashboard photo of the higher end model they use on JB-KL route if anyone have ? I 've also taken photo of it but under night lighting so i could 'swap' photos with those who have the daylight photos which show more detail ! I'm curious to find out the functions of the big LCD panel between the speedometer &amp; tachometer &amp; why the inverted L-shape orange light comes on during certain times even when the road speed &amp; engine speed, hence engine temperature drops ??

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on their current road conditions &amp; the fact that they are building more new roads (like inner-ring highway around JB city etc.) which are actually becoming as good if not slightly better than those in SGP, i see no reason why articulated low-floor citybuses can't be used.<br><br>As for double-deckers, they need to ensure the routes it uses have enough height clearances.

            <div class='col-md body'>I notice there's no other model in Singapore that's as similar to the MAN 18.250 as the M-B O 405 here. Whether it be the GVW, chassi dimensions, dashboard, rear axle hub designs &amp; even the closeness of the engine capacities.<br><br>Over the past decade in Malaysia, there's indeed been an enormous amount of 'upgrading' done on the outstation coach sector there. In terms of hardware &amp; service. In hardware, many higher end new bus-chassi were introduced in Malaysia either the same time or ahead of Singapore. The quality of Malaysian coach bodies also improved noticably such that they now on par if not superior to bodies from Singapore coach body builders &amp; some like MTrans known to export to UK. In service, nowadays you have '1st class' whereby the driver &amp; attendant, somewhat over-dressed i'll say, in suit &amp; tie to serve food onboard to passengers &amp; greet them while standing by the door when they get down etc. You don't get much chance to use such service within Singapore though !<br>Of course ticket fares for coaches are far more expensive than on short distance citybuses.<br><br>In the shorter distance urban bus sector, understandbly Malaysia has 'traditionally' lagged behind Singapore in both hardware &amp; service, in quite sharp contrast to the long distance coach sector mentioned above.<br>I attribute that mainly due to the cheap fares which doesn't give much incentive &amp;/or makes it impossible for operators to upgrade both hardware &amp; service levels to match Singapore's levels. BUT the good news is that, judging from operators like Handal Indah being around now, the hardware especially &amp; slowly even the service standards are gradually being jacked up.<br>It seems to me that HI has the financial reserves to withstand somewhat more risks than some of the other 'poorer' operators around such that they can afford to charge fares not very much higher than the others in the short distance urban routes despite their quite big fleet of new or brand-new vehicles of newer generation models which Singapore has largely still not upgraded to !<br><br>Of course, the bigger cities in Malaysia like KL &amp; JB would be the most likely places to have any new citybuses being deployed while the out-lying &amp; more backward smaller towns would continue to have the lousier junks for the forseeable time being.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">Like I said, they don't need more buses. The operator can make the bus licensed to carry 80 passengers if they want. Its just a matter of putting more seats and more hand straps. The issue is the GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) or the maximum laden weight the bus could carry which, in the case of the MAN 18.250 (18 000 kg), is similar to that of the B10M, N113 and O405. Hence, the 18.250 is able to carry as much weight as the S'pore buses.<br><br>If the bus is licensed for 67 it doesn't neccessary have to carry 67. A bus packed from end to end will roughly have about 100 people inside. In fact, the provision of a lager standing area in the forward section of the MAN 18.250 is intended to pack in more passengers, at the expense of having fewer seats. Therefore, if the 18.250, in its HI config, is indeed put on 151 for example, I think it will be able to carry more passengers at one go given the extra standing space, as compared to the B10M with its narrow aisle.<br><br>I admit Malaysia IS getting better buses. Don't talk about 'cowboy' towns like Muar lah. The current breed of high floor, front engine bus is good enough for them. These buses go through winding country roads which is usually battered and could be even prone to flooding. So, it is not wise to use such expensive machinery. Even so, you would still see at least one new rear-engined model.<br><br>However, the outlook of buses in the big cities like KL and JB have changed. Now we see more European marks such as MAN, Mercedes, Dennis and Scania. Although the city buses are getting there, the express buses have improved vastly. Now we see big, powerful buses such as MAN 18.310, Scania K124IB and others ruling the highways. </div></blockquote></div>

The coach is the 18.310. The 18.250 has a 7 litre engine but packs more power, 250 hp as compared with the O405 (SBST) with just 220 hp.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm quite sure 18.250 is the entry-level low-floor chassi with 3 steps as per O 405 but 18.280 has &gt;= 4 steps to get onto the seat level, including the raised platform on the left &amp; right sides of the bodywork. Plus the dashboard, axle hub looks totally different (bigger as for 18.250 like on O 405) &amp; 18.250 uses the older noisier most certainly 12-litre horizontally mounted engine etc., so implying not possible to consider the chassi the same but with output differences since so many key features are different ??<br><br>18.280 uses the newer quieter 7-litre engine with MAN truck derived dashboard<br>instead &amp; 'normal' manual gearbox since it's high floor chassi more suited for coach use.<br><br>O 405 (in naturally aspirated version with Euro 0 emissions) is 250 BHP, roughly on par hence with 18.250 while the SL252 (due to its age) expected to use the much noisier naturally aspirated 12-litre engine of 240 BHP, same as on the old MAN's used by SJE. SL252 is meant to be a 'parallel' model from MAN to compete with O 405, hence the same 3-step floor with horizontally mounted engine, citybus dashboard &amp; similar axle hubs.<br><br>18.280, 18.310, 18.370 etc. are higher output &amp; high floor chassi more suited for coach than citybus use.<br><br>The most i'll say 18.250 is largely based on SL252 but with Euro-1 or Euro-2 charged-cooled 12-litre horizontally mounted engine of 250 BHP like on the later generation O 405 with unchanged power output despite having been raised to Euro-1 emission levels. 18.280 of course cannot be the chassi version of SL 252 since the chassi design is fundamentally different.<br><br>I haven't noticed much differences in the extreme rear seat heights between 18.250 &amp; 18.280 but note the low sloping waistline on the body of the 18.250 which suggests a lower engine height more consistent with that of a horizontally mounted engine ?? But on 18.280 it's the same high waistline all the way from front to extreme rear, not surprising since i expect the engine to be vertically mounted instead ?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The 18.250 and the 18.280 are the same citybus chassis.

            <div class='col-md body'>Upon checking the engineering drawing @ their website, i notice they now use the same citybus dashboard which was used on the SL252 (similar as on O 405) on the 18.280 as well !<br><br>But i sense something's not quite 'right' in that they pass off the 18.280 shown in the website photo as 'chassis' only because the bodywork certainly does appear to me to be of 'sufficient' quality in design &amp; finish to pass off as original MAN citybus body instead !?! The 'themes' in the styling is certainly consistent with MAN integrally constructed CBU OEM bodywork which 'flows smoothly' from their bus to coach to truck product lines, i observe. Most unlikely therefore they should say it's 'chassi' only as such ? Maybe the body shown only used as 'model' for illustration purposes ?? As such i find it somewhat confusing because looking @ the complete bus purely on looks it would likely be though to be a SL252 or SL262 instead ?!?<br><br>For the 18.313 i note the 12-litre engine is vertically mounted, which i do believe is similar to that used on the earlier 16.240 (also vertically mounted) used by SJE except that SJE's is the normally aspirated noisier version with lower output &amp; exhaust emission standards. I also note the truck derived dashboard used instead of the citybus dashboard, not surprising since they target the 18.313 for coach use.<br><br>In conclusion, i'll say that what's currently shown @ the MAN website is probably only their current product line-up for the Malaysian market i.e. they don't show the older models like those SL252 used by Intrakota &amp; these are the ones my 'engine perception' instincts (based on perceived levels of 'soildness' &amp; 'sound power') tells me that the 12-litre was ever used on their citybus model like the SL252 &amp; in view of the larger physical dimensions of a 12-litre (compared to say a much smaller 7-litre unit) it's most certain in the SL252 that the 12-litre engine was horizontally mounted like on O 405. If it's a coach body then maybe they'll consider vertical mounting as well in view of the lesser need to ensure a low floor level compared to in the case for a citybus body.<br><br>I note there's no 18.250 mentioned @ the MAN website, so that'll mean one can't be too sure yet that the engine on the 18.250 is vertically mounted ??<br>Why i don't think the engine is vertical is because in order for it to be vertically mounted onto a citybus body (with the emphasis on as low as possible as floor height) the engine would have to a 'small' cc engine (like 7-litre instead of a much bigger 12-litre unit) so that the longitudinal protrusion is not too 'long' that they need to raise the rear section of the body too high &amp; long. If the 18.250 uses the 7-litre engine then possible it's vertically mounted since the protrusion into the body is minimal. BUT having actually 'heard' the 18.250 on my rides taken, the sound characteristics simply tell me the engine used cannot be as small as 7-litre, which means to me the next larger known engine they use is the older noisier 12-litre unit, which for citybus body mounting would most certainly have to be horizontally mounted.<br><br>So, you could be right that the 18.250 has vertically mounted engine but i think the best way to be sure is to flip open the bonnet to find out...but for the reasons mentioned above, i'm still doubtful.<br><br>As for the MAN models used in HI's fleet, assuming they use only the current models available on CW2, i then expect it to be 18.313 instead of 18.280, as earlier though, unless MAN offers 2 versions of the 18.280 i.e. citybus &amp; coach versions ?? But if it's the 18.313 the engine doesn't sound like a MAN 12-litre engine to me, more like a 7-litre instead ?!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">These 2 links would shed some light.<br><br><a href="http://www.mtbm.com.my/bus/city/18280hoclr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtbm.com.my/bus/city/18280hoclr.htm</a><br><a href="http://www.mtbm.com.my/bus/intercity/18313hoclr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtbm.com.my/bus/intercity/18313hoclr.htm</a></div></blockquote></div>

For low demand routes maybe it's worthwhile because resources are then more efficiently used. If they have enough such routes i suppose they may then find it attractive to buy more midibuses, provided such routes don't duplicate too much ?<br><br></div></blockquote>I dun know anything abt bus type/make/model, but I noticed recently that one of their usual, big/full-size CW3 bus has been turned into a SHUTTLE BUS between Bkt Indah-Gelang Patah. On the bus signage is written as such &amp; they also state the price as RM3.<br><br>I don't know what's the frequency &amp; timing of the shuttle bus and I wonder if this is a worthwhile effort since most people from Bkt Indah tend to wait at the main road leading to the highway to board the Kotaraya-local route CW3 during peak hours. During off-peak, there doesn't seem to be any passengers taking the shuttle service.<br><br>But I wld say the shuttle service would certainly benefit more residences of Bkt Indah if it takes on the route usually taken by Triton 501/ HI 111, picking up passengers from within the housing estates (invisible bus stops in front of the houses) instead of just from the main road, which is what CW3 is currently doing. And it wld be also good if the pick-up point includes Bestmart.<br><br>Therefore, if HI wants to provide the shuttle bus for the long-run, then perhaps it's good to use the "midibuses"?</div>
