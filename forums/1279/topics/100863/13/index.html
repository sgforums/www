            <div class='col-md body'>As for driving with care, i ever noted 1 driver on CW2 with such sharp eye that he complained about the driver of a van in front who read newspaper while driving ! That van had a Singapore plate which didn't seem to impress this CW2 driver, likely because there seems this perception that non-Singaporean drivers drive with less care, which in that incident clearly showed the reverse to be true !!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sbst275:</div><div class="quote_body">Because they are new bus co mah...<br><br>Respect?

            <div class='col-md body'>From my personal observations, of course there's ample room for improvement in service quality not just on HI but many others as well.<br><br>But on my trips on CW3, i've noted the driver slowing down &amp; even stopping briefly @ bustops with people, irregardless whether anyone flagged the bus.<br>I see that as good business sense because the drivers know the need to generate as much fare revenue as possible &amp; maximising passenger load.<br>But i've also seen the more flexible side of their service which frankly i'll NOT expect to encounter in Singapore's 'non-premium' i.e. standard bus services, unfortunately. Such as offering a more door-step like drop-off point tailored to suit the passenger like as if it's a taxi or a premium class minibus here, but on a regular service bus !<br><br>Then there was a passenger who wanted to go to Kota Raya who boarded CW3 opposite JBCS &amp; as expected offered to pay the fare &amp; asked how much. The driver instead declined to accept his fare &amp; drove him to Kota Raya again eventhough the bus just left there. The driver could have i suppose told the quite well dressed man to walk there but instead likely wanted to reduce his inconvinence so ended up making a slight detour there for free. I could see that passenger found this driver most helpful. Not likely a similar situation would ever arise in Singapore where people tend to be too calculative &amp; don't tend to bother to 'go the extra mile' for someone in need of assistance, unless perhaps if the passenger is taking some premium class taxi or minibus transport service here ?!? So from that incident i can sense HI's drivers do have some common sense still in them in that they know when to help out a passenger more in need of help in going somewhere instead of telling the fellor to get down &amp; ask other people how to go about.<br><br>As a passenger, that sort of 'JB svs' i won't mind having more of.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sbst275:</div><div class="quote_body">In the 1st place,<br><br>CW svs quality are like JB svs</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suspect HI is trying to expand too fast &amp; don't have enough vehicles to spread around. They started out over the last 2 or so years ago only &amp; now have so many routes within Johor itself + 3 CW routes + JB-KL &amp; soon even SGP-KL as well. Even with light passenger loading, there must still be enough vehicles to be distributed among the routes so that passengers are not more inconvinenced than absolutely necessary !<br><br>Definitely there must be improvements in the operational service aspects such that e.g. no waiting @ Gelang Patah station inside the bus ! If transfers from 1 CW3 to another CW3 bus has to take place, then they need to ensure such transfers are quick involving getting down &amp; going up &amp; going off with no additional waiting on board !!<br><br>Maybe they find the stupid license too expensive so only limit a few vehicles with it as they might have under-estimated the overall demand for their CW3 passenger loading from Singapore, thinking of CW3 more as a complementary service to their other within-JB routes mainly &amp; only expecting 'marginal' passengers actually taking CW3 all the way to/from Singapore ??<br><br>On my trip on CW3 from Singapore, there was waiting onboard for 10 mins. @ Gelang Patah station but still i find that unacceptable because the other CW3 vehicle we transferred to was already waiting @ Gelang Patah when our vehicle arrived there ! So i'll logically expect that whoever wanted to board a CW3 from Gelang Patah towards JB bandar would done so already &amp; be sitting inside the bus &amp; no further waiting necessary once all passengers were transferred onto that next CW3 there !<br><br>HI needs to be aware that as CW3 is long route service, travel times are basically long enough so they are expected to schedule the departure times of the connecting buses such that the journey for passengers to or from Singapore is 'continous' &amp; with minimum or none of such idle waiting times !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purplecrazed:</div><div class="quote_body">Just an extra info on CW3.<br><br>I was told by the driver that if you see the SIDE SIGNAGE BACKGROUND of the bus is BLUE (against yellow wording), then that bus is licensed to enter S'PORE.<br><br>If it's black background (also against yellow wording), that one travels in JB, picking up passengers from their usual route up to Gelang Patah only.<br><br>At the moment, CW3 is still having teething problems. Ever since they made Gelang Patah their swapping base, passengers have been "quarelling" with the Handal Indah staff every morning because of the uncertainty of their departure time.<br><br>Internally, they themselves are confused abt their own scheduling, so the timing is all very messed-up. We're also driven crazy not knowing exactly what is the best time to board the bus from our residential area. If we take an early bus, we ended up having to wait @ GP for the next buses to fill up the S'pore bus. But if we decide to take a slightly later bus, we missed the S'pore bus and had to wait for the next one. So far, many has experienced an average 30mins of waiting time @ GP.<br><br>This morning one of the driver dialled his superior's no. and passed the mobile phone to one of the passenger to "scold" him directly. So it's not that we have not spoken to the Management of Handal Indah. Those people at the top have received as much complaints from us as those from the lower rung. But they're not listening to the passengers nor the suggestions &amp; feedback given by their staff.<br><br>I can only say that for now, if you want to board the CW3, be prepared to have your blood pressure raised.</div></blockquote></div>

I was quite angry and asked the Coordinator "But doesn't this bus has the license??!!! What's all these papers sticking on the window??"

In such systems all such trucks accelerate &amp; brake precisely @ the same time via the centralised electronic automatic control, thereby making it as if it's like a truck-train on the expressway.<br><br>Also BTW, i consider it 'basic understanding' &amp; even common sense to ensure that the type of goods transported &amp; means of anchoring them to the truck body etc. are taken into account before deciding if a truck with such cargo can be driven with adequete active safety margins @ 100 km/h on an expressway anywhere ! Nowhere am i saying just blindly drive a truck @ 100 km/h since it's implictly understood that a truck (or even van) when with cargo can have very different safety margins if blindly driven @ any same road speed compared to when without cargo !<br><br>The cargo type &amp; means of securing the cargo to the vehicle can be a very BIG determinant on the sort of driving speeds to use !
