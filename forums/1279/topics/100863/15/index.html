It's all because of Gelang Patah..... some more the bus interchange is located so far in..... right into the "kampong".<br><br>Can't they erect a new interchange or have another switching base nearer to the GP exit before the highway?

Looks like it is more comfortable to drive to Gelang Patah, park in front of the shops near the Petronas gas station, and board and alight at the two bus stops nearby.  Will be good if there are people collecting 2 MYR and take care of the cars for a day...........  Lot's of such "private car parks" in Kuala Lumpur.<br></div>

From what I understand, the higher capacity for the S'pore buses are due to the higher number of standees. Seating wise, it's roughly the same: CRB (51), MK 2 (51), MK3 (50) MK4 (50). Please note that there are single seats on the MAN 18.250 which accouts for a lower seating capacity.

The overall cost levels are determined (in part) by aggregate of the various tax components, or lack of some of them in the case of public buses. Therefore even if road tax on SBST bus is higher in absolute terms it does NOT have to mean that overall tax per SBST bus has to be higher than say a bus or coach used by a private operator !!

Maybe in the distant future even articulated double-deckers or double-articulated single-deckers using track guided steering may appear here. But i won't be surprised if Malaysia would also use these (ahead of Singapore) although more likely only within the city-centre in the big Malaysian cities like KL or JB.

Articulated single-deckers &amp; rigid double-deckers would see more demand here to supplement the rigid single-deckers. Maybe in the distant future even articulated double-deckers or double-articulated single-deckers using track guided steering may appear here. But i won't be surprised if Malaysia would also use these (ahead of Singapore) although more likely only within the city-centre in the big Malaysian cities like KL or JB. As Malaysia becomes more developed towards 2020, it no longer needs to 'blindly follow' or take 'hand-me-downs' on the cheap from Singapore. HI's choice of bus i see it as a good 1st step in that direction.<br><br></div></blockquote>Are there more international readers than local readers here?<br><br>You dun understand... The higher road tax buses pay are by right to cover the COE. Who dun know SG govt type? You think they so nice tell you public buses dun need to pay COE? Even the road toll, they wun bother, because that $9 is to their gain, they dun see any need to reduce aft you start biz. Unless buses pay lower road taxes than cars. Lots of things are done off from your eye sight. Historically, SG buses have to pay more road usage cost, incl ERP and sort.<br><br>Anyway, next, 67 capacity buses are not suitable for SG... If they are deployed on Svs like 238, they need more buses to run, adding to maintenance cost. You can have fancy buses, but if they cannot carry enough passengers, you have to buy more. Svs like 151 are already facing shortage of buse as well.<br><br>Like for Sv 151, there are 22 buses... If using HI type, it needs 27 buses. I need more buses yet my number of passengers remains fixed. Also with the inccuring cost of running 5 add buses. You can have HI type of better buses, but if they are not practical in terms of loading, it can be a killer. Already, many buses that uses SD carry more than 100 ppl onboard during peak hrs.<br><br>You may say as MY progress, they get better buses? Are you sure? The off areas like Muar still gets older buses for the future. Even they are able to get better buses, you sure other problems wun rise with their resources?</div>
