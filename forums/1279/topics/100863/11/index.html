            <div class='col-md body'>CW3 sucks! The idea of stopping at Gelang Patah ruins their whole service. GP is a total waste of time. 10 minutes to drive in from the highway, 20-30 minutes to wait for the bus to get to S'pore, another 10 minutes to drive back to the highway. Coming home in the evening is the same, if not a worse scenario. The bus left Jurong East at 6pm, reached GP at around 6.40pm but I only got to reached home at Tmn Perling at 8pm!

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Gelang Patah is very developed now but the interchange is right into the "kampung".<br><br>You have to drive straight in until you passed the 2 schools, the chinese Chinese school called Ming Terk will be on your right and the other Malay school on your left. After you passed the schools, you'll come to a traffic light and the interchange will be right in front of you.<br><br>CW3 has no problems picking up passengers punctually from Larkin, Tmn Perling or Tun Aminah but their major weak point is not knowing how to coordinate the buses so that upon reaching GP, the bus that has the permit to enter S'pore is already there waiting for us, instead of us wasting our precious time hanging around or "stoning" in the bus.<br><br>Many times we ended up having to wait very long at GP for the S'pore bus to arrive OR waiting for the next bus coming from Tmn Perling/Tun Aminah so that more passengers can fill-up the S'pore bus. The same goes with going home. Eventhough we're already in our respective buses (whether it's Tmn Perling/Tun Aminah or 666), yet we have to wait for the next S'pore bus to arrive in order to fill up our current bus. If it's 15mins wait it's still forgiveable, but sometimes we wait 30-45min. Then another 10mins to hit back the highway. They cheat us of our time and money.<br><br>But since 2nd Link has no crowd and jam, you might as well make GP your very own pick-up point, arrange for someone to drive you there and also fetch you home from the interchange.<br><br>I think Johor cab drivers should start making Gelang Patah interchange their next hunting place.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by surfbabe:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi purplecrazed,<br><br>Where exactly does the bus stop at Gelang Patah?

CW3 actually dump their passengers there. It's a place of unpredictable torture before they finally bring you to CIQ or back to your residential area.</div>

May be the passengers should just ask it to increase the ticket price by 1 MYR and skip Gelang Patah....<br></div>

The arrangement &amp; timing was pretty good.<br><br>The whole of last week I was able to reach S'pore within an hour of departure from Tmn Perling &amp; vice versa but my happiness was shortlived.
