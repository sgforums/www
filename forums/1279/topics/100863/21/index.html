            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, i'll agree, basing on knowing their intended target market i.e. tourists when they launched the service. BUT, i've come to notice, based on actual market using it, it seems to me the majority of those using it are NOT tourists &amp; ended up being largely locals instead !!<br><br>That, i find, becomes the BIG difference between SBST's Citybuzz (relative failure !!) &amp; HI's (relative success) with their kampong-roof service !<br><br>Someone mentioned about HI's lack of 'thinking out of the box' in the context of their CW3 service in this forum. But, basing on what can be observed here on their kampong-roof service, i find it NOT to be so, therefore.<br><br>Because i do believe HI started this kampong-roof service mainly to serve the non-local i.e. tourist market, basing on the sort of promotional material distributed which mentioned of JB city tour round trips etc. sort of stuff which local Malaysians not likely to bother to take. BUT sensing the demand from the tourist crowd being not as high as anticipated, HI then seem to tailor it more to the (business bringing) local crowd by offering competitive fares (quite close to what the other operators using older/lousier buses there offering) to various popular areas like Angsana, Tun Aminah etc. while hardly altering the original service routes. As such, it becomes a win-win situation, for (the few) tourists who use it as well as for the (majority) local regular crowd who use it.<br><br>In Singapore, i observe they do things too 'rigidly' i.e. not being flexible enough to suit the changing market &amp; situation etc. so they lose out ! So nothing surprising to me to see those double-deck Volvos used on Citybuzz with typically only 0 to 5 passengers yet they 'blindly' just continue to operate seemingly 'ignoring the market' as if they hoping for some sudden windfall which seems most not likely as they've been operating this for many months already !<br>Not much 'thinking out of box' here from this e.g. !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cck_190:</div><div class="quote_body">If i'm not mistaken, this bus service is supposed to be like our City Buzz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't find the design of the body 'modern' but it definitely is very uniquely Malaysian, as can be seen from the Islamic theme on the wheel-arches &amp; above the doors. Of course the kampong shaped roof is another Malaysian touch probably not found on buses elsewhere. This certainly is a 'true' Malaysian bus, of course only as far as the bus body is concerned.<br><br>This bus is a combination of German-Brazilian (bus-chassi) &amp; Malaysian technologies (bus body) i'll say.<br>Notice they use German Vogel Sitze structures for the tram-like seats which seem to look so 'local' if looking only from the surface. But the seat's cushion not up to the usual German standard of firmness though. I suppose they sourced this part of the seat not from Vogel Sitze, only using their structures.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Apex-LW'21:</div><div class="quote_body">The front body looks modern and unique. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Anyway, Handal Indah is spelt wrongly.</div></blockquote></div>

As such, it becomes a win-win situation, for (the few) tourists who use it as well as for the (majority) local regular crowd who use it.<br><br>In Singapore, i observe they do things too 'rigidly' i.e. not being flexible enough to suit the changing market &amp; situation etc. so they lose out !

            <div class='col-md body'>this isnt suprising.. in Penang, which i went 2 years ago F&amp;E, and travelled by their buses (all are OMO), it was a very tiring experience..<br><br>except 2 services which crosses the penag bridge, all services will stop/end at the Jetty/ Ferry Terminal -&gt; KOMTAR -&gt; respective destinations<br><br>At the Jetty, the buses parked for 10-20mins, then drive a short distance to KOMTAR, another "bus terminal" and park for 10-30mins again, then leave for their destinations.. some more if you miss a bus, then you have to wait the 10-30mins before the bus leave the terminals. you only miss this practise when you go towards the KOMTAR/Jetty, and not the other way round.<br><br>some buses used are super old and broken mercedes bus, and AC and NAC buses charged the same fares  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> , however, fares are super cheap<br><br>theres the <span style="font-style: italic;">bas mini</span>, which charges a flat fare of 70sen.. so imagine when you take a hour long ride for only SGD0.32  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Taking a regular Transit-link or "Hin-Bas" fare can go up to a maximum of only RM2.00 for one-hour long rides.<br><br>and of course, like JB, there is also route duplications.. the route Jeti to Air Hitam has Transitlink 101, 130, Bas Mini 21 etc..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PJ_Quek:</div><div class="quote_body">Yup, by waiting for the buses to be fully load, it will also resulted long waiting time for the passengers at the remaining part of the journey.</div></blockquote>for Penang case, the above is true.. when the bus reaches its looping point in Jetty, or KOMTAR, it parked there very very long (can be up to 30mins) then when the bus has a "reasonable" amount of passengers, it departs. Also because there will be very few people boarding the bus halfway along the route. (same as JB Bandaraya case?), so have to maximise fare collected. no need for passengers in intermediate stops to worry because each service has a rough fixed frequency, those boarding at Jeti has to wait the most..<br><br>i do believe the drivers own the bus themselves (unlikely), but that they keep most of the fares for those small companies (except Transitlink). these "small operators" dont have any inspectors or tickets issued. Once i took the bus all the way to its end point (TG Belungkuh), got questioned, and then alighted and the driver alighted to go and buy some kueh. then the next bus behind came but loop back and did not park at the end point.<br><br>One think i noticed about the drivers there is that they will stop the bus any where, no bus stops, in front of house or in front of you unhesitatingly.. this "extra" service is even better than in Johor Bahru, and is unthinkable in Singapore.. and yes, the drivers also remembers to alert you if you want him to tell you where you alight... not like HI sv22  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>
