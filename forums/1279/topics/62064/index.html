            <div class='col-md body'>Do note that passengers are not allowed to board service 966 at the bus stop outside Parkway Parade, and all passengers onboard have to alight at this bus stop. Passengers outside Parkway Parade are to cross the road to board the service.<br><br>However, the bus captain of 455D allowed me and other passengers to board outside Parkway Parade, but he did explain to us to board the bus next time at the bus stop opposite. We were unable to scan our ez-link card during that time which shown "Farestage: 37". The bus captain stopped at the roadside before the round-about for a few minutes rest. Then he reset the ez-link system to "Farestage: 1" and asked us to scan our cards.<br><br>Another interesting thing is that the bus (towards Woodlands) should goes on the Thomson flyover after stopping opposite Trellis Towers, but instead it used the slip road to Thomson Rd (like services 56 and 143), when along Thomson Rd, he immediately drove the bus to the extreme right and turn into Whitley Rd (like services 132 and 156). But the fact is, that bus stop along Whitley Rd opposite Police Academy is not served by service 966.<br><br>Also, service 966 skips the stop along Serangoon Rd.<br></div>
