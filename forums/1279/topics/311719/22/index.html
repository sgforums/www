              confused by the use of blue Wheelchair-Accessible Bus (WAB) decals on
              buses not running on WAB routes. SBS Transit has taken immediate action
              to remove them to avoid further confusion and will ensure that only

              We were also sorry to learn of
              the incident where Mr Thomas Teo was denied entry on Service 14, and
              conducted an immediate investigation. We found that the incident had
              taken place on April 14 this year — before Service 14 was declared a
              WAB service. We have since pointed this out to the reporter.

              SBS Transit would like to

              <p>Well... it could have been better if they have prevented the blunder in the first place, but their admission of a blunder and apologising for it is something that is definitely getting a thumbs-up from me. Not many Singaporeans, it seems, can make a mistake and then admit it was a mistake, apologise, and make amends. Their competitors is one fine example, among the countless others.</p>

              <p>Ah yes... you reminded me of the time when I took route 882 for free when I told the driver I had not enough cash on me and my ez-link card was emptied of value.</p>

              <p><br>I believe SMRT knows how to be more flexible when it comes to paying cash fares... They understand that as a passenger, no-one can be so free to take so many coins out on a day just to take a bus.</p>
              <p>I've seen many cases of "bullying" by SBS Transit BCs, students with uniforms are requested to show their EZ-Link card and etc. There was once when I wanted to retain the value in my EZ-Link card to take MRT home and hence I had to pay cash on a S130 bus. The driver asked me to show him my EZ-Link card and that was exactly what I did. However, he still asked me to tap my EZ-Link card on the card reader and when it showed that it still had value, he questioned me on why I still had to pay cash. I felt like telling him off at the right instant, on that spot (and with my school uniform) that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bus drivers have no right to tell passengers which mode of payment they wish to use on board the bus</span>. That's my key point. And I could easily just complain to the Customer Relations Centre with every single bit of details I can find from the bus, the BC. Why are passengers always subjected to some moronic BC's <em>kaopeh </em>style?</p>
              <p>And I've seen too many cases on board SBS Transit buses to know that they are very <em>niao</em> or stringent in making sure that people pay the correct fare. I understand their stand, but, come on? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who would be so free to wear other people's school uniform out just to pay the lesser amount?</span> A student in school uniform (and still looks like a student) is still required to display his pass?</p>
              <p>So <a href="/users/168365"><span style="color: #000000;">eX.A.K.R.</span></a>, I believe there is no need to compare SBS Transit with SMRT. This case of dropping a passenger off on the expressway is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">isolated</span> one, you don't see people walking down the expressway everyday, do you? And I see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely</span> no reason why you need to mention that "When did SBS Transit resort to SMRT's low?" Simple reason because, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there has been no complains yet stemming from the same scenario as what we see in this isolated case</span>. And I don't know where you got that idea that SMRT is always lower than SBS Transit, and let me say here that they are both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equal</span>. Both have their pros and cons, their goods and their bads. You don't need to relate everything to SMRT even when it's SBS Transit's matter, do you?</p>
              <p>This has caused my respect for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">such a person like you who has been in the bus community for so long</span>, to drop by a significant amount. Sorry to say so, I just <strong>hate</strong> people who only know how to pinpoint at SMRT for everything they do, and everything they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not</span>, because that means they don't know how to differentiate the two companies, or rather, everything related to SBS Transit is always seen as a reason stemming from SMRT, for which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I don't see</span>.</p>
              <p>If you still persist on such one-sided biasness (and even pinpointing the wrong party) which obviously is not needed here, I can only say that I leave you to be. I have other commitments to attend to, and I won't be bothered with your unconstructive replies. You on one hand can be constructive, but on the other hand, you are just always biased.</p>

              <p>I have always tried to be impartial to SMRT, but it still cannot erase the fact that I have experienced a <strong>LOT</strong> of consistent nastiness from them, not to mention the way they are running their bus business in general - neglected routes, neglected towns, the killing of CSS (when at least route 608 still had pretty high loads during peak hours), etc.</p>
              <p>When I said "When did SBS Transit resort to SMRT's low?", I did not literally mean it to say that SMRT also throws their commuters off the expressway too; what I was referring to was SMRT's sometimes callous regard for the safety and welfare of their commuters. Let me just mention that I have been thrown off at a police centre by a route 962 bus driver (who used to drive TIB 1125A) just because I accidentally tapped by ez-link card on the entry reader while it's still on entry mode, and the bus driver decided to blow things over - and the police centre was at least a kilometre's walk away from my home. I overpaid for a longer walk home - tell me where's the logic in this. I did manage to claim back the fare afterward - but I sometimes think of that as a lucky break, as I had tried to claim back some fares from them previously, only for them to make sure it was virtually impossible for me to do so by obfuscating the entire procedure and kept directing me all over Woodlands Interchange and MRT station - I eventually gave up. That, plus with all the stories I hear and experiences I have on SMRT buses (a Nissan Diesel speeding down Upper Thomson Road at 80km/h with a full load of passengers, or hard braking to a stop just millimetres shy of a taxi in front, anyone?), does not leave me with a good impression.</p>
              <p>As for SBS Transit, let me surprise you with this little fact. There was a time when I hated SBS Transit and preferred SMRT (then known as Trans Island). It was only with the increasing nasty experiences I have with SMRT, coupled with how SBS Transit was at that time truly trying to improve their standard of service by investing in new routes and buses, that made me dart for SBS Transit. However, with this incident, plus with many of the stories I have been hearing from them as of late, is forcing me to start reviewing my respect for their company. I admit, I'm biased in favour of SBS Transit - at least before, but hearing about this incident is really forcing me to look at both SBS Transit and SMRT again. Hence, the SMRT's low remark: SMRT, I felt, was already quite bad on this regard, and I used it as a comparison to what I can see is SBS Transit's dropping standard; if you put the remark the other way, you can see it as that I'm actually insulting SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>I hope I have done enough explanations regarding this subject. Let's be brutually honest here: Singapore's public transit system <em>sucks</em> (and that applies to everyone involved in the system, not just SMRT or LTA or such), and there's a lot everyone - companies, authorities, commuters - <em>must</em> do lest our public transit system degrades into a shameful orgy.</p>

              <p>Encountered before too - was made to pay adult fare because I was not in uniform, and aw someone who he wanted to pay cash instead of tap his ezlink (like your case). But I would say that they're probably the minority whom are new to the company, so much so that they don't dare to bend the rules yet, or maybe they're just following the rules. It's a little bit like, bringing food/drinks up on the bus - although explicitly stated disallowed on trains/buses - some of the staff (not to an extent on trains, but more on buses) would <em>close one eye</em>, trusting that you will have the moral values to be more careful and not litter/spill the drink on the bus/train :), however, stompers are another case (let's not get on that...I now look out for people who start fliming/taking pictures on the bus and wouldn't hesitate to ask him why is he doing so if I think it's specially targetted at me...bloody hell).</p>
              <p>Most of the drivers are quite nice, probably because they have their tinge of humanity - I've ever gotten a free ride because I didn't have any coins and my EZLink didn't have cash, and I too, got a free ride because of a stupid mistake I made on the bus while tapping my EZLink (this was when they just updated the software to show "green" when a concession pass has no money...I didn't know and just walked in, thinking they had made a new sound for concession holders - driver didn't care less either).</p>

              <p>I understand what you are saying - and I have also heard of another reason why some bus drivers speed. Apparently, some routes (169 and 856 in particular, I heard) have very tight schedules, which menas the bus driver has to rush whenever possible to meet the timetable; this sort of things really have to be blamed on the people who draw up the timetables without understanding the situation on the ground.</p>
              <p>I really don't mind buses going a bit too fast, especially on expressways; what worries me is when they do it on narrow roads, or they seem to be losing control of the bus at times. On my aforementioned Nissan Diesel ride, there were times when the steering of the bus felt really "sudden" and "jerky" - not sure how to explain it - and it really felt like the driver needed to make one tiny error for bad things to happen.</p>

Let's be brutually honest here: Singapore's public transit system <em>sucks</em> (and that applies to everyone involved in the system, not just SMRT or LTA or such), and there's a lot everyone - companies, authorities, commuters - <em>must</em> do lest our public transit system degrades into a shameful orgy.</p>

              <p><br>I know you are being honest. Let's face it. Many of us have had good and bad encounters on both companies. No company is perfect, but no company is also as worse as what we can think of it to be.</p>
              <p>I don't mind if you are being biased - it's human nature to be, but a reminder that you need to select your words carefully. Or not it makes your whole viewpoint ugly. And finally, it's one thing to be biased and just voice out viewpoints of your own, and its another thing to be biased and try to make people have the same biased views as you. Not directing this to you - I'm confident you are of no such character.</p>

              <p>852 has relatively tight schedules too - save for the 10:30pm trip. All Nissans are about the same when they speed - or actually all buses.</p>
              <p>But the people who draw timetables need to wake up. They do it in theory, but I honestly doubt they see it in practice.</p>
