              <p>This morning's Lian He Zao Bao and Straits Times all have media coverage of the horrific accident. Both took pictures of the front of the bus after the bendy was separated from the K230UB. Straits Times from the front-right, Zao Bao from the Front-Left. So probably you can have a look at it since the real one, which is in AMDEP now is covered with canvas and cannot be seen.</p>

              This is what I called "Bullshitting"!
              
              June 10, 2008   
              Current bus services serve diverse needs of commuters: SMRT  
              I REFER to the letter, 'Buck Up, SMRT' (ST Online Forum, June 4) by Mr Vincent Kessler on SMRT bus services. 
              SMRT Buses operates a fleet of over 860 buses. Besides trunk, feeder and intra-town services, SMRT also operates Premium Bus Services which offers residents living in areas such as River Valley, Pasir Ris and Geylang Bahru comfortable, fast and direct connections to their workplace in the Central Business District.
              
              For residents living in areas such as Yishun, Sembawang and Bukit Batok who are out late on Fridays, Saturdays and the eve of public holidays, SMRT operates NightRider Services, providing them with safe and affordable alternative transport.
              
              We would also like to share that we operate SMRT Link, the first regular free shuttle service by a public transport operator. SMRT Link services, which run on weekends and public holidays from Dhoby Ghaut and Outram Park MRT stations, make it cheaper and more convenient for commuters to travel to Chinatown and Little India.
              
              More information about the various bus services offered by SMRT can be found at www.smrt.com.sg/buses/buses.asp
              
              We thank Mr Kessler for his feedback and will continue to enhance our services to commuters.

              <p>Talk about standing at doorsteps, take a look at the damage of the Scania K230UB and TIB666L that crashed. Thankfully both buses werent packed. But what would happen if these buses were packed to the doorsteps? I wouldnt be surprised if someone died. The heavier weight of the fully laden bus would also mean more damage since more energy is absorbed. Hope someone rectify this issue before some gets seriously hurt or killed.</p>

              <p><br>SMRT and lorry, SMRT and SBST are different things. Maybe SMRT driver was wrong for cutting lane without signalling, therefore hitting the lorry. Then of course he has to jam brake lah.</p>
              <p>SBST driver, if <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he kept a safe distance away</span></span> </strong>and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">maintained a lesser speed such that he can brake with no problems</span></span> </strong>from the SMRT bus, still can brake in time. Question is, the whole front of the SBST bus is gone, how far does it prove that SMRT is at fault for the crashed front of the SBST? Obviously 1) The K230 was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">too close</span></span></strong> to the bendy and 2) It was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">speeding</span></span></strong>. It's no doubt <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arguable that when buses are Off Service, the BCs tend to speed faster because they don't have to call at bus stops and there are no passengers inside.</span> And obviously, the K230's bodywork was too weak to withstand force and crumbled upon impact. From pictures shown from yesterday's newspaper, the bendy was still intact.</p>
