              <p>A bit OT here, but just wanna ask if anyone of you here kena
                  this one before...</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/viewContent.jsp?id=33962">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/viewContent.jsp?id=33962</a></p>
              <p>I kena it twice. Once was when I took Service 180 (TIB894U iirc
                  at that point of time which is about 1 month ++ back) from
                  Boon Lay Temp Int.. SL of that bus super buay tahan (cannot take
                  it) that old lady, and stopped the bus along Boon Lay Way (1 stop
                  before opp Chinese Garden bus stop), got off from his SL seat to
                  walk towards her, shouted her and ask her to get out of the bus..
                  After that, she still stayed inside the bus and SL drove his bus
                  off. While he's driving, he called the "OCC" through the microphone
                  whether to declare the bus "off service" &amp; called police, or
                  just continued his trip back to Bt Panjang. The "OCC" people asked
                  him to continue his trip instead.</p>
              <p>The most disgusting this is that (what the SL told me is very
                  true) when she got off at Bt Panjang Int, she would go off to
                  nearby grass patch/bushes, took off her pants, and just do her
                  business there, and I felt so disgusted about it!! The SL even
                  asked me to take photo pf the disgusted act from her and post it to
                  STOMP or anywhere in the internet, but quite sinful for me to do
                  that, hence I never snap it..</p>
              <p>The other one was when I took Service 242 (forgot what rego, a
                  merz) back to Boon Lay Int from Jurong West St 91 there. That same
                  old lady boarded the bus again. This time, she just tapped my hand,
                  stretch 1 of her hand towards me, and said "$2" in chinese in a
                  very demanding tone..</p>
              <p>Especially those staying in Boon Lay area, care to share your
                  "disgusted" experience here if you encountered the same old lady
                  that is mentioned in the STOMP? Wanna hear from you guys here!</p>
              <p>P.S: Btw both my encounters happened in the morning.. and the SL
                  of Service 180 told me the story about this old lady there..
                  Lolx..</p>

Keep asking for money onboard at spit in the bus. Some BC called her but eventually she ignored and the BC also dun care. I met her many times. On Svc 99,174,180,198,242.</p>

              <p>SMRT go where investigate? i dun think there are so many SBST buses services which start at 5 am also.  Sv 2 start at 5.45 (NBR),  Sv 12 - 6am (NBR), Sv 54 - 6.15 am (NBR). that mean the display should show the timing for Sv 2 as 50 min? Sv 12 as 65 min? really crap reply from SMRT.</p>
