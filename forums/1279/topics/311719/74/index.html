              <p>The smell of the noodles of coz good la.. but really it 'stinks' when 'exposed' in the bus.. I recalled one incident when i took svc 307 to sch during the sch holidays.. Heres their story:</p>
              <p>Uncle entered &amp; tapped inside the bus with food (at Teck Whye Lane). He sat at the front seat and he opened the plastic bag to eat his chicken rice (just when he opened the container, the chicken smell drifted around the bus sooo damn quickly...) At the next stop of Teck Whye Lane, the bus suddenly went into a halt. I was like 'Where the hell is the passenger boarding?!' as i looked around outside the bus. Suddenly, the BC opened the rear doors of the bus and their conversation was like this:</p>
              <p>BC: Oi uncle.. (points at door) if u want to eat, EAT later. U continue eating; U GET OUT OF THE BUS! Never read the sign izit?! (points at sign)<br>Uncle: Huh? (bits of rice sprawling down floor)<br>The damn uncle refused to budge after got scolded byy the BC.. &gt;:(<br>The BC was like pissed off &amp; he got out of his seat.<br>BC: Eh uncle, u better get out of the bus or u have to pay the fine u know! <br>The uncle sheepishly walked to the rear doors &amp; tapped the card with his mouth chewing &amp; me, BC &amp; the other passengers looked at him in 'a-kind-of-a-pissed-off-look.'</p>
              <p>Then the BC got into his seat &amp; moved off, then he closed the doors. If im nt wrong, its a 307 cameo (TIB514S (KJDEP 190)) full day &amp; BC is pro good! :)</p>

              <p>Like this I need to Stomp whenever a bus is full or when a bus skips bus stops. I seriously don't understand. By being a bus fan, you should help the bus company operators to keep up their good image. By posting all these, you are disgracing the whole bus fans committee. Bus fans should know why buses are crowded at certains times. You know more than normal commuters know. Why can't be more understanding to the bus companies? You like buses, you take their buses, yet you don't like their service and complain. Very contradicting.</p>
