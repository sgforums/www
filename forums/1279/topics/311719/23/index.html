              <p>Most of the drivers are quite nice, probably because they have
              their <strong>tinge of humanity</strong> - I've ever gotten a free ride because I
              didn't have any coins and my EZLink didn't have cash, and I too,
              got a free ride because of a stupid mistake I made on the bus while
              tapping my EZLink (this was when they just updated the software to
              show "green" when a concession pass has no money...I didn't know
              and just walked in, thinking they had made a new sound for
              concession holders - driver didn't care less either).</p>

              <p>I think is is what is sorely missing in our public transit system - the <em>human</em> factor. Sometimes, I feel our public transit system has grown to be too systematic, faceless, clockwork-like, robotic, and Stalinist - and while I can understand the reason why there has to be systematic clockwork-like deployment of our buses and trains, I feel that many of the human interactions between commuter and public transit company has fallen victim to this same clockwork mechanism. Like all these bus fare incidents, I can't help but feel that these people are robots programmed to insist on only one thing and is incapable of looking at things another way - simply because for them, it doesn't exist.</p>
              <p>This, I have always felt, is the <strong>real</strong> reason behind why our public transit system is such a mess.</p>

              <p>Too much humanity doesn't work too. Singaporeans being Singaporeans, in particular those with the kiasu-ness, will abuse it.</p>
              <p>I don't blame the companies for being so stiff - after all, they are answerable to shareholders on profits and they have to make profits in our corporate environment to survive. I doubt the Government gives them any cash/aid - for gods sake, they even have to pay PTC/Govt to run a route I think, and with all the ridiculous restrictions restricting them (such as the territory rule which imo, needs to be abolished), it doesn't make things any better.</p>

              <p>Well... it's really not too strange, but that message is indeed a bit weird if you think about it. The Chinese message did say that the hammer is used to break the glass window in an emergency, but it's not explicitly stated in the English message.</p>

              <br> <br> PublicTransport@SG is a one-stop public transport portal that provides information covering all public transport operators. 
              <br> <br> Another initiative is a real-time Short Message Service (SMS) bus arrival information service.
              <br> <br> The SMS service will be on trial for six months beginning October 10,
              2008, and will cover 166 bus stops along the Western academic belt,
              which includes National University of Singapore and Singapore

              <p>I've seen many cases of "bullying" by SBS Transit BCs, students with uniforms are requested to show their EZ-Link card and etc. There was once when I wanted to retain the value in my EZ-Link card to take MRT home and hence I had to pay cash on a S130 bus. The driver asked me to show him my EZ-Link card and that was exactly what I did. However, he still asked me to tap my EZ-Link card on the card reader and when it showed that it still had value, he questioned me on why I still had to pay cash. I felt like telling him off at the right instant, on that spot (and with my school uniform) that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bus drivers have no right to tell passengers which mode of payment they wish to use on board the bus</span>.</p>

              <p>Is there a reason why they need to check? Because I saw a sign at the BC's lefthandside mini door saying smth about needing to check. The knn driver that day waste my money.

"Where is your ez-link?" reply&gt; "If I got bring I still put cash for what?!" then she like nothing to say and let me go. Somemore she still drive wrong route in th end.. Act da pai?

              <p>the BC ask you to tap is to check whether ur card is vaild for concession. No money is deducted. Even if value is being deducted from ur card, u can always request the BC to cancel ur trip.</p>
