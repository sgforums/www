              <p><br>SMRT and lorry, SMRT and SBST are different things. Maybe SMRT driver was wrong for cutting lane without signalling, therefore hitting the lorry. Then of course he has to jam brake lah.</p>
              <p>SBST driver, if <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he kept a safe distance away</span></span></strong> and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">maintained a lesser speed such that he can brake with no problems</span></span></strong> from the SMRT bus, still can brake in time. Question is, the whole front of the SBST bus is gone, how far does it prove that SMRT is at fault for the crashed front of the SBST? Obviously 1) The K230 was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">too close</span></span></strong> to the bendy and 2) It was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">speeding</span></span></strong>. It's no doubt <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arguable that when buses are Off Service, the BCs tend to speed faster because they don't have to call at bus stops and there are no passengers inside.</span> And obviously, the K230's bodywork was too weak to withstand force and crumbled upon impact. From pictures shown from yesterday's newspaper, the bendy was still intact.</p>
              <p>Don't everything SMRT SMRT SMRT...</p>

              <p><br>It seemed clearly that both buses were in motion when the accident occur. Assuming both buses were travelling at 55km/h and the buses are just 40m apart. Do you think there's enough distance for the K230 to brake in time? For every 10km/h increase in speed you need to keep an increasingly appropriate distance away from the vehicle in front.</p>

              <p>Yes, since the events happening in front that face the driver right smack in the face are more important, these events are something that could have been foreseen in advance. Rather than knowing about the situation and trying to pull stunt at the last minute.</p>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but in such a situation there is absolutely no time for anyone to look at their rear mirror and check if there are any vehicles behind.

              <p><br>My last reply before I knock off.</p>
              <p>Moving off yes, I know must look at the mirrors. Same for overtaking. Braking of course need to. But no for emergency braking. My father doesn't do that, yet he has been driving for 34 years without anything happening to him.</p>
              <p>And true enough, ensure safety of yourself as well as others. But you come first. Others come next.</p>
              <p>For the media part: Different drivers have different reactions mah. But still, I would say the SMRT driver has been negligent on driving his bendy, therefore resulting in a hit with the lorry. I don't want to comment about the SBST driver though.</p>
              <p>Any replies, drop it in my mailbox.</p>
