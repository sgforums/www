              <p>With this kind of crappy reply on a BUS GUIDE website, what better kind of service this hopeless company can provide??? Obviously they are not interested in providing a decent service to commuters, their main agenda is just twisting facts and providing nonsense just to make more profits, not providing better and decent services.</p>
              <p>Why not SMRTB just wind up and allow a better bus service provider to take over its bus operations, instead of just wasting the commuters' time and money to put up with their crappy and uninterested service standards??? Since they are not a bit interested in providing and improving their bus services.</p>
              <p>And the stomper should have provided this feedback to PTC and LTA instead of just posting in STOMP website. And also in the forum page in the Straits Times. Let everyone know SMRTB is not deem fit to provide a proper bus service to commuters. SMRT is really hopeless.</p>

              <p>With this kind of crappy reply on a BUS GUIDE website, what better kind of service this hopeless company can provide??? Obviously they are not interested in providing a decent service to commuters, their main agenda is just twisting facts and providing nonsense just to make more profits, not providing better and decent services.<br><br>Why not SBST just wind up and allow a better bus service provider to take over its bus operations, instead of just wasting the commuters' time and money to put up with their crappy and uninterested service standards??? Since they are not a bit interested in providing and improving their bus services.<br><br>And the stomper should have provided this feedback to PTC and LTA instead of just posting in STOMP website. And also in the forum page in the Straits Times. Let everyone know SBST is not deem fit to provide a proper bus service to commuters. SMRT is really hopeless.</p>

              <p>"Dear commuter,</p>
              <p>You could take a bus from Yio Chu Kang to Yishun Bus Interchange. From Yishun Bus Interchange, you can take SMRTB svc 171 to Bukit Panjang Rd and transfer to SMRTB svc 190 to Chua Chu Kang Bus Interchange. As for the services from Yio Chu Kang to Yishun Bus Interchange, you can check out the details with the respective bus operator.</p>
              <p>Thank you for travelling with SMRT"</p>
              <p>Else just say. there is no direct solutions through SMRTB.</p>
              <p>So isn't this very hard to relay to a commuter who wants to take a bus to his/her destination??? Is there so much effort just to provide a simple service to a commuter who wants to save money and take a bus while rather than just simply state take a cab??? So if there are more than 2 bus transfers, then tell people to take a cab, isn't this rubbish???</p>
              <p>By looking at the thread on "how to go???" in this forum, might as well tell all the people asking directions to take a cab???</p>
              <p>Lastly, I want to emphasize again. If you people wants to praise/crticise a bus company, go ahead, but in a objective manner rather in silly comparisons, etc using buses, depots. I compare using service standards in a commuter point of view. I critcise using facts and from what I hear and experience. I never say that you people here cannot critise.</p>
              <p>*Anyway, thank you for updating your post.</p>
              <p>It has shown me your level of intelligence or ignorance in this forum, by trying to twist my words into something else that makes them happy.</p>
              <p>At least they show no solutions that they can reach there. Not posting crap like take taxi lor...</p>
              <p>*To all, hope that this had shown to you how screwed up our public transport is. By seperating "territories" among different companies, it seems that one to two parts of Singapore is almost isolated from the rest of the island. There is no way to get to these places and you can only take a cab. Irony.</p>

              <p>Wow, seems like you like to engage a flame war by continously branding people negatively by calling people names and scolding people.</p>
              <p>I never say SBST website is good or perfect. At least don't tell people to take a cab when they want to take a bus.</p>
              <p>And firstly, if there are SMRTB services serving all the way for the journey, then why not provide the details??? If the website cannot state the details, why not ask the email of the commuter to provide a proper feedback???</p>
              <p>Secondly, if the computer cannot computate more than 2 transfers, then is there a need to post nonsense to tell that commuter to take a cab when they want to take a bus??? Is this rubbish??? Then might as well don't put anything. Don't piss people off by stating rubbish.</p>
              <p>You don't even know the basics of providing a proper customer service. When customers want A, then give them A. If cannot give them A, then give them a satisfying answer why A cannot be achieved, and not give nonsensical replies and give B. You can say that humans are alive and technology is dead. So why can't manipulate the technology to serve the people better in another way rather than just giving nonsense and then full stop???</p>
              <p>I am not going to engage in a flame war with you further. You don't agree with me then too bad for you. Like what I've said, the people here cannot take criticisms. If you think that you are right, then continue to believe what you think that suits to what you want to hear. Continue to believe what you people want to believe.</p>
              <p>Lastly, this forum doesn't belong to you. If you do not like to hear what is not pleasant to your ears, then don't engage in a conversation or even look at the topic. I had engage with such kind of arguments on SMRTB with other members in this forum and so far quite a few had a healthy and peaceful arguement with me. They state their point of views in a proper manner, so I engage the conversation well with them, agreed with them in some way and stop whenever it seems to. Unlike people like you, who wants to talk back by criticising others in a way of starting a flame war anytime, it had convinced me that such kind of forumers are just trying to win in conversations by continously preparing their "ammo" and insulting others. If you think that your answer suits you so well, then I let you win. No point keep on derailing from the topic since you want to win.</p>
              <p>And with all the recent flame wars in many topics and people like you, I am even more convinced that this forum is getting from worse to worst.</p>
              <p>It is not that I like to degrade the company, I am so fed up with their lack of service improvements, even I had been feedbacking for the past few years before I gave up around 2 years ago. 2 years later, still nonsense going on from the company. Many people are complaining, and fed up, but some people choose to be ignorant.  </p>
