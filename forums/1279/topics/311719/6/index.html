              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An update on this morning's YCK crash</span></p>
              <p>Shin Min Daily News has a rather brief report on this morning's accident. Can be found at Page 2, towards the bottom left. Waiting for some kind soul to scan it because my scanner has some problems. Anyway...</p>
              <p>From the report, both buses were <strong>not carrying passengers </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">when the accident took place near ST Engineering at YCK Road, towards AMK</span>. Which means either the buses were completely empty or they were off service. Bendy is confirmed TIB 1138M because of the advert. Scania K230UB still unsure.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the Indian BC driving the K230UB was stuck for 1 hour in his seat while firefighters tried to extricate him. He suffered multiple fractures to his both legs and was sent together with the Bendy driver to hospital. Below are the current reports on damages as seen from 1) The photo from STOMP and 2) The photo from Shin Min Daily News:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scania K230UB</span><br>1) Front EDS gone<br>2) Front door totally smashed<br>3) Windscreen damaged<br>4) Bodywork damaged<br>5) Driver's compartment totally gone (Even the door controls were seen hanging outside... steering wheel was twisted)<br><em>And many more...</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mercedes Benz O405G Hispano Habit</span><br>1) Rear roof caved in (framework at the rear was bent down)<br>2) Engine *most likely* smashed (Sad case...)<br>3) Bodywork damaged<br>4) In short... everything that can be found at the rear was damaged</p>
              <p>It somehow reminds me of the incident of SBS 9357M and SBS 9424C on PIE... just that SBS 9357M is related to the K230UB here, while SBS 9424C is related to the Bendy. So who knows what might happen to the bendy?</p>

              <p>I think the scania bus might have started the movement too fast and maybe the SMRT bus suddenly apply brake. then, might have caused the scania driver dun have time to apply brake (since we know that K230UB buses started the movement so jerky till everyone who stands on the bus moves)</p>
