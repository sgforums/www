              <p>I kena it twice. Once was when I took Service 180 (TIB894U iirc at that point of time which is about 1 month ++ back) from Boon Lay Temp Int.. SL of that bus super buay tahan (cannot take it) that old lady, and stopped the bus along Boon Lay Way (1 stop before opp Chinese Garden bus stop), got off from his SL seat to walk towards her, shouted her and ask her to get out of the bus.. After that, she still stayed inside the bus and SL drove his bus off. While he's driving, he called the "OCC" through the microphone whether to declare the bus "off service" &amp; called police, or just continued his trip back to Bt Panjang. The "OCC" people asked him to continue his trip instead.</p>
              <p>The most disgusting this is that (what the SL told me is very true) when she got off at Bt Panjang Int, she would go off to nearby grass patch/bushes, took off her pants, and just do her business there, and I felt so disgusted about it!! The SL even asked me to take photo pf the disgusted act from her and post it to STOMP or anywhere in the internet, but quite sinful for me to do that, hence I never snap it..</p>
              <p>The other one was when I took Service 242 (forgot what rego, a merz) back to Boon Lay Int from Jurong West St 91 there. That same old lady boarded the bus again. This time, she just tapped my hand, stretch 1 of her hand towards me, and said "$2" in chinese in a very demanding tone..</p>
              <p>Especially those staying in Boon Lay area, care to share your "disgusted" experience here if you encountered the same old lady that is mentioned in the STOMP? Wanna hear from you guys here!</p>
              <p>P.S: Btw both my encounters happened in the morning.. and the SL of Service 180 told me the story about this old lady there.. Lolx..</p>

              <p>Wow... if that lady's not flipping mental, then she's definitely trying her hardest to be a complete nuisance to every single person she sees. She's basically being a parasite to the society if she's not insane.</p>
              <p>That TIB 894U's bus driver should really have called the police, and those guys at the control centre really should have let him take the bus off service so he can do so. That lady needs to be kept away from the society at large.</p>
