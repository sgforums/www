              <p>Brief translation:</p>
              <p>A pizza delivery motorcycle had an accident with a bus and was thrown 4 metres away from the vehicle. The motorcyclist was sent to A&amp;E but died because of bleeding at the head.</p>
              <p>The windscreen of the bus had shattered. According to witness, the accident happened at around 6pm, at the junction of Sin Ming Drive &amp; Upper Thomson Road towards City.</p>
              <p>The motorcyclist was heading towards Sembawang Road. When he reached the junction, he was knocked down and a bus from the opposite direction when he tried to turn right into Sin Ming Drive. The deceased is 25 years old and is still a student. Eye-witnesses please call 1800 547 1818.</p>

              <p>Hmph. WIth SMRT bus drivers speeding and driving so recklessly, I'm surprised that fatal accidents involving SMRT buses don't happen more often. Three seperate personal occasions, thre seperate days (including one today), three seperate bus routes - 851, 855, and 960 - and three seperate buses (respectively, TIB 1023K, TIB 932T, and TIB 1242U), all were driven by mad speeding bus drivers. The one driving route 851 did several other things that made me go straight up to the passenger service centre to complain once I got off at Yishun Interchange, the one driving route 855 made at least three near-misses, and the one driving route 960 just flew straight through Woodlands Road, jamming the brakes at bus stops and red lights.</p>
              <p>If this continues, SMRT is really going to live up to it's name - if you understand some Slavic languages (i.e. languages spoken in eastern Europe, generally) - according to Wikipedia, "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">smrt</span></strong>" means "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">death</span></strong>" in many Slavic languages.</p>
              <p>By then, the only guranteed safe roads in Singapore will be in Punggol (I hope people get this one)...</p>

Three seperate personal occasions, thre seperate days (including one today), three seperate bus routes - 851, 855, and 960 - and three seperate buses (respectively, TIB 1023K, TIB 932T, and TIB 1242U), all were driven by mad speeding bus drivers. The one driving route 851 did several other things that made me go straight up to the passenger service centre to complain once I got off at Yishun Interchange, the one driving route 855 made at least three near-misses, and the one driving route 960 just flew straight through Woodlands Road, jamming the brakes at bus stops and red lights.</p>
              <p>If this continues, SMRT is really going to live up to it's name - if you understand some Slavic languages (i.e. languages spoken in eastern Europe, generally) - according to Wikipedia, "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">smrt</span></strong>" means "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">death</span></strong>" in many Slavic languages.</p>
              <p>By then, the only guranteed safe roads in Singapore will be in Punggol (I hope people get this one)...</p>

              Speaking of it, there's another public transport operator in the world called SMRT also!! It stands for Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation, and it operates some of the subway lines in Seoul.

              Looks like both SMRTs need to change their name... haha

              <p>Well...</p>
              <p>Proportionally speaking, SMRT does seem to get involved in fatal accidents more often, quite likely because they have a higher proportion of such bus drivers in relative to the size of their company (remember that SMRT is much smaller than SBS Transit in the bus business).</p>
              <p>Though, I cannot say there aren't any reckless bus captains with SBS Transit, nor can I say that there aren't any careful, good bus captains with SMRT - I have rode SBS Transit buses that beat the lights and speed on the expressway, and I have rode SMRT buses driven by careful bus drivers.</p>

              <p>My suggestion:</p>
              <p>Entire company: MRTC Holdings (MRTC = Mass Rapid Transit Corporation). MRTC is the old name of SMRT, by the way.</p>
              <p>Train division: MRTC.</p>
              <p>Bus and taxi division: MRTC Trans Island ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> ). Revives the old Trans Island branding while keeping the fact that it's under another company.</p>
