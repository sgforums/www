              <p>Relax lah, treat STOMP.SG as your source of jokes and you would be okay.</p>
              <p>With regard to the desto of 72 inverted, drivers do not care a damm for the rear destos sometimes, if front or side destos inverted was fun but rear one was ok in most instances and somemore, the 72 could also be seen anyway, not a need for a big fuss and I think somebody in STOMP do not even know the art of reading inverted.</p>
              <p>With regard to the plate removing incident. Maybe the bus is late and OCC instructed it to go off service and someone in STOMP even post that that is a 'tactic' which really is a instruction. Or the bus may be damaged in some way(i.e. AC not working).</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Private bus operators seek ways to cope with higher oil prices</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Many private bus companies are looking for ways to cope with the increasing oil prices.</p>
              <p>In the last five months, oil prices have shot up 40 percent due to
              strong global demand. The situation is further aggravated by a
              weakening US dollar.</p>
              <p>Private bus operators said pump prices have
              been increased 10 times in the last 12 months. And they are feeling the
              pinch, especially those who are bound by contractual terms and are
              hence unable to revise their fees.</p>
              <p>So some operators have resorted to cutting down on unnecessary trips and restricting personal use of vehicles by their staff.</p>
              <p>The
              Singapore School Transportation Association said operators who are
              charging lower fees will have to bear with the higher cost, at least
              until the end of the year when the association looks into a fee
              revision. â CNA /ls</p>

              <h1 class="clr">LTA considers implementing more fullâday bus lanes</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Eleven new fullâday bus lanes came into operation in the
              central business district on Monday, and the Land Transport Authority
              (LTA) is planning to implement more such lanes in various parts of
              Singapore to cut travel times for bus commuters.</p>
              <p>Serangoon Road is one of the areas being considered as it has high
              bus volume and traffic throughout the day, making it an ideal candidate
              for a fullâday bus lane.</p>
              <p>Tan Tee Nee, deputy director of traffic
              management at LTA, said: "The surrounding amenities... the high
              commercial activities â these are likely to generate more traffic along
              the road and of course, (higher) bus frequency."</p>
              <p>Some welcomed such prospects.</p>
              <p>R
              Selvam from Moulmein Tekka Residents Committee said: "Most of my
              residents travel by buses, so it is more of an advantage for them to
              come back early, then they can spend more time with their family and
              the school children."</p>
              <p>S Gokulabalam, secretary of the Little
              India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association, also said: "We will get
              more people coming to Little India and by that we will benefit."</p>
              <p>Many
              shops along Serangoon Road use back lanes and side streets to load and
              unload their goods. But a few shopkeepers do not have such access, so
              deliveries are dropped off outside the shop during offâpeak hours, when
              the bus lane is not in operation.</p>
              <p>A merchant on Serangoon Road,
              Rani Kumar, said: "Fullâday bus lane will obstruct a bit of our loading
              and unloading... Itâs convenient to load and unload at the main road...
              otherwise we have to go to the side road, itâs going to be a little
              inconvenient."</p>
              <p>Currently, the closest legal loading and unloading site to Mrs Raniâs shop is about 50 metres away.</p>
              <p>LTA
              officers are gathering feedback from shopkeepers so that issues like
              Mrs Raniâs can be resolved before the fullâday bus lane scheme is
              implemented in the area. â CNA/ac</p>

              <p><br>buses are always seen in yellow boxes mah. turn out of bus stop, will definitely stop in yellow boxes. want to filter right also will stop in yellow boxes. If want to catch, should catch those vehicles who stop in the yellow boxes, preventing the buses from turning out/turning left.</p>
              <p>One fine example, is at the bus stop opposite AMK Mrt, during peak hours. Vehicles just stop in the yellow boxes and those Sv 73/25/261 buses all having difficulties to filter right in order to turn right into Ave 8, thus causing delay to other buses behind to get out of the bus stop, then other buses such as 74/88/132/76/165 get delay and then got complains again.Â  One problem lead to another. LTA should station someone on the overhead bridge there and take photos of those violating vehicles and summon them. think can easily catch a lot everyday.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed. SBST should not have just installed CCTV cameras on buses that ply the city area. Should put them on those problematic ones so as to catch inconsiderate car drivers.</p>
