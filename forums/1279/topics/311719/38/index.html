              <p>In regards to the accident at Toa Payoh, I just spoke with my dad (I have a lot of parternal relatives living there - my late grandmother used to live there, and I have a few uncles and an aunt and their families up there in the neighbourhood where the accident occurred too, so my dad is familar with the people and surroundings there), and he says the victim was someone known to my relatives living there; my dad says he doesn't know her well personally, but she used to live in the same kampung (village) as my dad.</p>
              <p>Listening to the reports, and being familar myself with the area too, I can theorise that it was most likely the victim's fault; she was riding out of the carpark onto the side road, and I find it unlikely that she could have missed seeing something as big as a bus unless she was not paying attention and was riding at speed. There's a good reason why there are stop signs at intersections without traffic lights, like the one where the accident occurred; it's to get motorists (I consider cyclists who cycle on the roads to be a motorist) to slow down and stop, and to look for and avoid collision with oncoming traffic on the main road. Quite likely, she was:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>not paying attention to the road, and was also riding quickly out of the carpark without slowing or stopping,</li>
              <li>paying attention, but was cycling too quickly out of the carpark to notice and avoid the bus in time, or</li>
              <li>riding slowly out, but was not paying enough attention to the road and missed seeing the bus until it was too late.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Of course, as I'm not a witness and an investigator, these are only at best intelligent guesses.</p>
              <p>Even then, no matter what exactly happened, I hope this can serve as an important reminder to other motorists out there (especially cyclists and motorcyclists) to obey the Stop sign and stop at the intersection to check if the coast is clear before continuing. Personally, whenever I cycle and come across a Stop sign, I always at least slow to a crawl - and if I know I'm coming onto a busy road or a road whose traffic conditions I'm unfamilar with, I stop, even if the coast seems clear. Rushing through the sign might bring fatal consequences, as it happened to the poor woman here.</p>
              <p>I hope she can rest in peace. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/rose.png" alt="rose.png"></p>

              <p>Its also quite hard for a Scania to chiong there, the Mercs can do so, but drivers driving Scanias tend to be slower, due to the slope of the bridge, the bridge walls also pose a blind spot for drivers driving there.</p>

              <p>Well, remember that SBS Transit may be starting to run of registration numbers in the SBS range, thanks to a not-very-efficient use of blocks of registration numbers in the past. Unless they are willing to use the odd gaps left in some blocks, or unless they are allowed to recycle registration numbers (the latter being unlikely), skipping registration numbers will only hasten the exhaustion.</p>
              <p>The only significantly largely-free blocks left that I'm aware of are mostly in the 9700's, 9900's, and 7500's to 7900's. SBS Transit probably has about 600 (not using gaps) to perhaps about 700 to 900 (using gaps - hazard guess) spaces left in the SBS registration for them to use - not enough for them if they are going to carry out a large-scale bus fleet replacement.</p>

              <p>Hmph. WIth SMRT bus drivers speeding and driving so recklessly, I'm surprised that fatal accidents involving SMRT buses don't happen more often. Three seperate personal occasions, thre seperate days (including one today), three seperate bus routes - 851, 855, and 960 - and three seperate buses (respectively, TIB 1023K, TIB 932T, and TIB 1242U), all were driven by mad speeding bus drivers. The one driving route 851 did several other things that made me go straight up to the passenger service centre to complain once I got off at Yishun Interchange, the one driving route 855 made at least three near-misses, and the one driving route 960 just flew straight through Woodlands Road, jamming the brakes at bus stops and red lights.</p>
              <p>If this continues, SMRT is really going to live up to it's name - if you understand some Slavic languages (i.e. languages spoken in eastern Europe, generally) - according to Wikipedia, "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">smrt</span></strong>" means "<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">death</span></strong>" in many Slavic languages.</p>
              <p>By then, the only guranteed safe roads in Singapore will be in Punggol (I hope people get this one)...</p>

              <p>Likely a habit carried over from the old days, when some bus drivers will open the door while the bus is still approaching the bus stop from several tens or hundreds of metres away, and then close the door long after the bus had left the stop.</p>
              <p>At least they do keep the door closed at other times - in the old days, some didn't even bother to close the front door.</p>

Is the problem due to a lower grade of diesel being used? Or could it be that the maintenance standards for public buses have dropped? <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also, why are buses not using compressed natural gas</span></span>?</p>

              <p>Well, remember that SBS Transit may be starting to run of registration numbers in the SBS range, thanks to a not-very-efficient use of blocks of registration numbers in the past. Unless they are willing to use the odd gaps left in some blocks, or unless they are allowed to recycle registration numbers (the latter being unlikely), skipping registration numbers will only hasten the exhaustion.</p>
              <p>The only significantly largely-free blocks left that I'm aware of are mostly in the 9700's, 9900's, and 7500's to 7900's. SBS Transit probably has about 600 (not using gaps) to perhaps about 700 to 900 (using gaps - hazard guess) spaces left in the SBS registration for them to use - not enough for them if they are going to carry out a large-scale bus fleet replacement.</p>
