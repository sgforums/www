              <p>STOMPER could have asked the driver or heard OCC say that and thus included that. I don't see it as acting pro. A passenger asking the driver why he continued driving when the windshield has broken is perfectly normal, because who would continue driving based on the aspect of safety? Also, there's no reason why the driver would not explain to him the OCC had told him to continue because (Quoted verbatim) <span>'they could not hear what the bus captain was saying

              <p><strong>Wheelchair friendly, but you can't board</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The message of the little blue sticker seems obvious:
              We’re a wheelchair-friendly bus. But, as disabled commuters have found
              out the hard way, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re welcome aboard. <br> <br> Mr Lee Jun Hui, flagged down SBS Service No 57 outside One Raffles Quay
              three weeks ago. Though the decal declaring it a wheelchair accessible
              bus (WAB) was displayed on the windscreen, the driver refused to let
              him on. <br> <br> “He said he was not authorised to do so. I’d understand if the bus was
              crowded, but it wasn’t,” said the puzzled 27-year-old, who works as an
              auditor at KPMG. <br> <br> To ensure this was no fluke, Mr Lee, in the company of this TODAY
              reporter, recently tried to board services 128 and 130 at Robinson Road
              after 6.20pm. The drivers of all four buses were apologetic. <br> <br> Despite displaying the blue decal, they told him they did not have
              approval from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SBS Transit to
              ferry wheelchair-users. <br> <br> Nonetheless, 20 minutes later at Cecil Street, he flagged down service
              57. The bus driver got down, laid the ramp on the kerb and wheeled Mr
              Lee aboard. At Novena, Mr Lee alighted and went the rest of the way
              home by train – as confused as ever about WAB services. <br> <br> While there are just 16 official WAB routes, buses on other service
              routes, such as the three above, do also carry the wheelchair-friendly
              decal. <br> <br> “I wished the authorities would be more consistent,” said Mr Lee.
              “What’s the point of displaying the decal when the bus drivers are not
              authorised to take users like myself? It gives the wrong impression
              that there are many more WABs on the roads, when effectively, there
              aren’t.” <br> <br> He is not the only one confounded. In June, student Thomas Teo, 19,
              faced similar rejection by service 14 – in this case, one of the 16
              approved WAB routes - at a Lower Delta Road bus stop. <br> <br> “I was very upset. That experience put me off totally; I prefer to use the MRT,” said Mr Teo. 
              <br> <br> </span><strong>SBS Transit's explanation</strong><span> <br> <br> Their frustrations follow expectations that were heightened when it was
              announced, earlier this year, that 40 per cent of public buses here
              would be wheelchair-accessible by 2010, and all of them by 2020. <br> <br> Recently, SBS Transit revealed it is spending S$147 million on 400 new
              WABs next year, which would come with low floors, wheelchair lots and
              retractable ramps at the doors. A quarter of SBS’ 2,800-strong fleet
              now has such features. <br> <br> Said Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit’s vice president of corporate
              communications: “Although we only have 16 WAB services, we have many
              more wheelchair-accessible buses that ply the roads on other routes.” <br> <br> She added: “Not all routes can be designated WAB routes because of the infrastructure along the way.” 
              <br> <br> For one to be so designated, 80 per cent of the bus stops along the
              route must be wheelchair-friendly, or such passengers would have
              difficulties getting on, off or around the bus-stop. <br> <br> For these passengers’ safety, said Ms Tan, “bus captains will not allow
              them to board if they are not plying wheelchair-accessible routes. This
              was what happened in the incidents cited by Mr Lee.” <br> <br> As for the bus captain of Service 57 who allowed him on board, SBS
              Transit said this was “actually not allowed due to safety reasons and
              will remind all Bus Captains to comply with guidelines”. <br> <br> Still, Mr Lee’s point is: If the buses are not on designated WAB
              routes, why display the wheelchair-friendly sticker in the first place?
              <br> <br> SBS Transit said this was “for deployment issues”. It is “reviewing
              what can be done to distinguish” WABs on designated routes from those
              that are not. <br> <br> Introduced in 2006, WAB services are gradually: replacing existing
              fleets. The LTA said: “These services are rolled out by bus operators
              based on the available pool of WABs and are subject to scheduling and
              operational considerations.” - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/ra<br> </span></p>

              <p><br>I believe the main problem is KUB cross-cameoing around both WAB and non-WAB Services. For example, sometimes I see Service 66 KUB with the WAB sticker when Service 66 is not a WAB Service. This meant that the KUB with the WAB sticker was probably a cameo from a WAB Service. I hope that to solve this conflict, SBST should remind the BCs of non-WAB Services with perm KUB that they should temporary remover the WAB sticker if then are using a KUB cameo from a WAB Service for that day. In fact the same goes for B9TLs, example, Service 7 B9TLs cameo on Service 30 with the WAB sticker.</p>

              <p><br>I believe the main problem is KUB cross-cameoing around both WAB and non-WAB Services. For example, sometimes I see Service 66 KUB with the WAB sticker when Service 66 is not a WAB Service. This meant that the KUB with the WAB sticker was probably a cameo from a WAB Service. I hope that to solve this conflict, SBST should remind the BCs of non-WAB Services with perm KUB that they should temporary remover the WAB sticker if then are using a KUB cameo from a WAB Service for that day. In fact the same goes for B9TLs, example, Service 7 B9TLs cameo on Service 30 with the WAB sticker.</p>

              <p>Are you sure it's cross-cameoing or whatever terminology used?</p>
              <p>Almost <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> of the Scania K230UBs under AMDEP (Not BRBP) have the WAB sticker. How can it be "cross-cameoing" then?</p>
              <p>This trend was pointed out about a month ago when they suddenly started pasting the blue WAB logos on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perm buses</span> that are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-WAB services</span>.</p>
              <p>OK next, the BCs are not free to keep removing and re-pasting the sticker everytime they want to drive. In fact, their job scope is to drive and deliver passengers to their destinations, not to peel stickers. -____-"</p>

              <p>I guess for the wheelchair-accessible service deployment problem, SBS Transit should consider putting a mini-placard (desto) holder in front of accessible buses to hold an easily-removable wheelchair-accessible logo, rather than using a sticker to display it. When the bus is on an accessible route, the bus must display the logo there; when deployed on a non-accessible route, the logo must be removed to avoid any potential confusion.</p>
              <p>This method should allow for more flexibility, and shouldn't cost much to implement.</p>

              <p>IMO its quite stupid deploying WABs on non- WAB services... eg svc 88 which has got B9TLs for nearly a year but still not officially WAB service... either get the bus stops fixed so that they can be accessible by wheelchairs or just dont deploly WABs on the service and put them somewhere else instead...</p>
              <p>just my thoughts, though i have a feeling that some people here will flame me for this post</p>

              <p>I don't think OCC/HQ would be very happy about this as they more than likely wouldn't recognize this fact.</p>
              <p>I applaud the fact that the bus driver was being nice/flexible, but the guy went to write to forums - almost (albeit unknowingly) sabotaging him. Most drivers I believe, would just go by the book...I don't think it's a choice of flexibility in this scenario since when HQ does't permit PIWs onboard on certain services, they would definitely have their reasons....</p>

              <p>yes.. the logo were removed. But recently 7481/7483 got the logo back. Not so sure about other Sv 25 B9.</p>
              <p>Really do not understand what is the point of deploying WAB buses but cant make them WAB services after more than one year for Sv 88. Sv 25 also got B9 for quite long alrd. maybe it is the difficulty of providing e-timetable.</p>

              <p>Do not understand why sbs transit reply the logo is due to "deployment issues" ? Never see any K230 from AMDEP cameo on those AMDEP B9 WAB services yet..None of the K230 services in AMDEP are WAB service also.</p>
              <p>btw refer to <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/doyouknow/facts_wab.aspx">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/doyouknow/facts_wab.aspx</a>, it seem like SBST did not bother to update which bus stops are WAB accessible.. See under Sv 2 and Sv 21.  For Sv 21, B06/B12/B14 geyland rd are not accessible for PIW, but for Sv 2, these bus stops are accessible? Likewise for Sv 51/143. The bus stop outside haw par villa is accessilbe to Sv 143 B9 but, not Sv 51 B9? weird right?</p>

              <p>i feel that SBST and LTA should start testing out every stop it operates and mark each stop whether they are able to board PIWs. once they have that data, it would  clear one obstacle when SBST and LTA approve a particular service to a WAB one.</p>
              <p>if they really want to go for it, work with LTA. for every bus sotp that is WAB friendly stick a wheelchair logo on the bus stop pole or something. this way it would really speed up the process and show the public they are really placing keen interest to help PIWs.</p>
              <p>the reason "deployment issues" by sbst gave to argue about why the sticker was put up was clearly a riduclous excuse because for AMDEP/BRBP KUBs have never touched AMDEP/BRBP WAB serivces yet.</p>
