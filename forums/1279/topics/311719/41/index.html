              <p>I suppose we have to understand that there are still lots of people out there who still identify SMRT buses as TIBS. Even my aunt who works with SMRT also find tibs pretty easy to rmb and distinguish. Faster to say "TIBS" with 1 syllabus than "SMRT buses" with 6 syllabus.</p>

              <p><em>Letter from Richard Chua</em></p>
              <p>   </p>
              </div>
              <div>AFTER a visit to Gleneagles Hospital, I decided to take bus No 7, a Wheelchair-Accessible Bus (WAB) service, to Dhoby Ghaut.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>It turned out to be a big mistake — going to Orchard MRT by the footpath would have been faster for my caregiver and myself.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>I waited for more than an hour for aNo 7 bus with the WAB decal. Four non-WAB No 7 buses came within that hour.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>While waiting for the WAB bus, I noticed that, ironically, other services not on the WAB shortlist were using wheelchair-accessible buses.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>Where’s the logic in assigning WAB buses to serve the able-bodied while assigning non-WAB buses on routes meant to help the disabled?</div>
              <div>.</div>

              <p><strong>Looking at the big picture </strong></p>
              <p>Transport fares not directly linked to fuel prices even if operators' costs are</p>
              <p>Phua Hooi Boon
              <br>Director (Land Transport Division)
              <br>Ministry of Transport</p>
              <p>WE REFER to the report, "Subsidies a tripping point"(Dec 22). Some members of the public have written to the Ministry seeking clarification on the Transport Minister's remarks that public transport fares are pegged to national inflation and wage levels, and not oil prices.</p>
              <p>As they pointed out that this contradicts the reasons being given by public transport operators (PTOs) when they apply for fare increases, we would like to take this opportunity to explain how the public transport fare review process works.</p>
              <p>Adjustments to public transport fares each year are based on a formula that is pegged to changes in two overall economic indicators, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wage Index (WI, which measures national average monthly earnings) over the preceding year.</p>
              <p>We explicitly decided not to allow PTOs to pass through their direct costs, such as fuel and wage costs, or to base their fares on these costs. This is to give PTOs every incentive to operate efficiently, and keep their costs as low as possible. Eventhough the PTOs have sought to justify fare increases based on rising fuel prices, the Public Transport Council (PTC) will only adjust fares according to this prescribed formula.</p>
              <p>This is why, despite a 40-per-cent increase in diesel prices last year, the increase in CPI and WI were only 2.1 per cent and6.9 per cent respectively, leading to an allowable fare adjustment of 3 per cent. As the PTC also made the operators absorb a large part of the increase in transfer rebate, fares only went up by 0.7 per cent last October.</p>
              <p>In assessing the fare applications, the PTC takes into consideration extenuating circumstances, such as adverse economic conditions and significant deterioration in the affordability of fares. Furthermore, as a reality check on the fares, the PTC compares the PTO's return-on-total-assets (ROTA) values against that of other industries with similar risk. The PTC has used these powers before.</p>
              <p>In 2001, it rejected applications to raise fares, in view of the economic climate then. In
              2007, the PTC turned down the application to raise train fares after assessing that the rail industry had done very well the year before.</p>
              <p>We understand commuters' concerns about the affordability of public transport. Early last year, the LTA announced the plan to introduce distance-based through fares this year. As we have seen in last year's fare revision exercise, this initiative has helped to reduce fares for the majority of commuters, particularly those who make frequent transfers. When the PTC next deliberates the fare adjustment for this year, we can expect it to move further towards distance-based through fares.</p>
              <p>The fare review process is detailed at http://www.ptc.gov.sg/publi&amp;papers.asp.</p>

              <p>If this is the case, they should have said so much earlier. The mess the (now I know is a truly idiotic) transport minister left after spewing his garbage at the Q&amp;A session is probably going to take a long time and real action to clean up.</p>
