              <p>They could use back the old regos since they are deregistered
                  and are free, like SBS 1 or something. (i don't know LTA ruling so
                  pardon me). If not they really may need to change the first 3
                  letters to SBT.</p>
              <p>@8033D STB ==&gt; Singapore Tourism Board have this acronym,

              <div class="top_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="top_headline">
              <p>A 52-YEAR-OLD man who was ferrying students and teachers in his
              private coach lost his cool when another bus cut into his lane along
              Farrer Road last May.</p>
              <p>He trailed the bus, SMRT service no. 961, to a nearby bus
              stop, where he confronted and later punched driver Mr Wong Kam Weng,
              36, before driving off.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Yeo Teck Kiang showed no expression when he was
              jailed for five weeks in a district court for voluntarily hurting Mr
              Wong.</p>
              <p>The court heard that after the incident, Mr Wong, who
              suffered from a swelling on his head, sought treatment at a polyclinic
              and was given three days' medical leave.</p>
              <p>Pleading for leniency, Yeo's lawyer Mr Shashi Nathan said
              that the court must distinguish between a case where a member of the
              public attacks a public transport worker and one where an altercation
              occurs between two such workers.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Moreover, the injuries sustained were very minor.'</p>
              <p>However Assistant Public Prosecutor Nicholas Ngoh retorted that
              Yeo's actions would have been seen by young impressionable students who
              were on board the coach.</p>
              <p>Calling Yeo the 'sole aggressor', Mr Ngoh added that it would
              send the wrong message that violence on the road is condoned.</p>
              <p>According to court documents, Yeo had driven onto a flyover
              along Lornie Road on May 14, 2007, ferrying students and teachers to
              Dunman High School from Tampines MRT Station.</p>
              <p>But when his coach entered Farrer Road, the traffic lanes merged and Yeo noticed that Mr Wong had cut into his lane.</p>
              <p>Enraged, he followed behind Mr Wong's bus until it stopped at a
              bus stop opposite Queens Road Wet Market to pick up and allow
              passengers to alight.</p>
              <p>As Mr Wong pulled out of the bus stop, Yeo overtook his bus
              and stopped alongside it. Opening the passenger door of his coach, Yeo
              confronted Mr Wong as he had been unhappy that the bus had blocked him
              at the bus stop.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong wound down the driver's window of the bus and a
              heated dispute ensued, ending in Yeo throwing him a punch on his left
              cheek.</p>
              <p>When a bus passenger, who had seen what had happened, shouted at the two men, Yeo returned to his seat and drove off. --ST</p>

              <p>Eh, I think the only one who can use that is SMRT Bus, since they have brought over TIBS, and most probably holds the right to use the TIB regos, just that they forgone it for their new rego series, SMB.</p>
