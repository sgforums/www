              <p><br>This is because for many years SBST side destos have been in English and Chinese. The malays and tamils have already gotten used to side destos not in their language. Do you think it is possible to have 4 languages on the side desto? Please use some common sense. What do you mean by the stomper has no sense? Use your brains. However I believe the above mentioned elderly folks have been looking at the COLOUR of the desto for many many years. Therefore those folks might not understand what G or W on the EDS means and this is the main problem of the elderly folks. The stomper might have just thought that some chinese elderly folks may need to sometimes look at the chinese words of the desto for route info but I believe is not the main problem as these elderly folks have been living with the almost the same bus routes for many many years. Therefore, I do suggest that all SBST feeder KUBs involving G/W displays the side desto of the service at the KUB's windscreen for the sake of these folks.</p>
              <p>A word of caution to those posting crap in the route suggestions thread: It may be a little off topic, but please NEVER suggest to ammend routes with a long history or high elderly demand. It is never easy for these elderly folks to get used to route ammendments if they have problems getting used to seeing "G" or "W" on the EDS display. I can even remember someone posting major ammendment to Service 25 in that thread. If you would like to know why the PTC/LTA allows Services 25 and 854 to duplicate each other from Bedok all the way to Hougang Ave 2 until TODAY, the above mentioned might be a possible reason.</p>

              <p><br>Remember what I said and think about the situation. If it had been possible for the EDS to display in green and white colour, SBST would have done so already. Use your common sense please. Unless SBST gets LCD displays at the side of the KUBs which are capable of doing so but then that might be too expensive.</p>

              I'd say posts on STOMP usually have 0% substance and 100% sensationalism.
              
              As for chinese words on EDS.... i'd say it's as good as impossible because current EDS details are stored as text... logos like "SBS Transit", "Fast Forward" and æ�­å–œå�‘è´¢ are few and hard to come by.

              <p><br>Please think about the cost involved to do so and if it is really efficient or necessary. To solve the problem for now, SBST can simply put the green or while side destos at the windscreen of the KUB. Simple and saves cost, elderly folks get to see the desto they are used to except that it is at the windscreen.</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I agree - STOMP is pretty much nothing but junk food news and yellow journalism.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic on destos, I have floated this idea around in my mind for a while now. It might not be implemented anytime soon, if ever, but  do hear me out.</p>
              <p>In the 1970's and 1980's, buses had a front small desto in addition to a side desto and the main front desto. This system was discontinued a long time ago but persists on a few exceptional bus routes (those that ply Bukit Purmei Avenue, for example). What I'm thinking of is to have a small desto, either in the form of a small plastic sign or an LCD/OLED screen, that indicates the type of bus route, whether it's terminating, green/white plate, and so on. To do this, Singapore's bus system will have to adopt the "Local/Express" nomenclature - "Local" buses referring to basic bus routes in our system (i.e. trunks, basic plus, feeders, and intra-towns), and "Express" referring to our express and Fast Forward routes. The destos will be of different colours for different situations, which I will list below:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>For Local routes, the desto will be white-on-black, with the word "Local" on it. </li>
              <li>For Express and Fast Forward routes, the desto will be white-one-blue, with the word "Express" on it. This is done for Fast-Forward routes mainly to avoud confusion and mix-up between the local and Fast Forward (Express) version of the route, with the latter charging higher fares.</li>
              <li>Premium routes will bear a white-on-purple desto, with the word "Premium" on it. Underneath it, the fare for the route and the notice stating that standing on buses on such routes is prohibited will also be stated.</li>
              <li>Shortworking trips and alternate "M"routes will have a black-on-yellow desto, with the destination of the trip or the extra/different areas served stated on the desto. For example, the desto for shortworking trip 27A will indicate "Blk 147 Tampines" on it's travel towards Tampines, while the desto for route 182M will indicate "Skipping Tuas Checkpoint" (or it could read "Tuas Checkpoint" with a diagnoal bar over it to visually indicate that the route will not be going there). This is to avoid any confusion between the full and shortworking/alternate version of the bus route.</li>
              <li>Green/white plate routes will obviously each get their respective green and white desto. The desto will indicate - in travel order - one road or landmark it will pass by before it's looping point, which will also be indicated. For example, route 410G may have...</li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Bishan St 11</p>
              <p>Sin Ming Ave</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>...on it's desto, while route 410W may have something like...</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Bishan St 22</p>
              <p>Sin Ming Avenue</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>...on it's desto.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Terminating intra-town and Premium routes will have a white-on-red desto that reads "Terminating" for terminating intra-town and premium routes. This system is already being used on such premium routes, and intra-town routes use a similar "T" plate system; These two systems should be standardised to maintain consistency. </li>
              <li>For routes that serve the same bus stops in both directions (eg. the Serangoon Gardens and Bukit Purmei routes), the destination of the direction could be indicated on the desto. Two colours - red and white - for each respective different direction could be used. So, for example, route 136 heading to Punggol could use a black-on-white desto that reads "Punggol", while the Ang Mo Kio ones could have white-on-red destos that read "Ang Mo Kio".</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The system may sound complicated, but is actually quite simple to understand and could help lower or prevent cases of route mix-ups. Note how I used colours to indicate the type of bus route, as well as it's directionality and status in some cases, which could help the illiterate or partially-literate (for example, those who understand only Chinese) to help better differentiate the bus routes.</p>

              <p><br>This is because for many years SBST side destos have been in English and Chinese. The malays and tamils have already gotten used to side destos not in their language. Do you think it is possible to have 4 languages on the side desto? Please use some common sense. What do you mean by the stomper has no sense? Use your brains. However I believe the above mentioned elderly folks have been looking at the COLOUR of the desto for many many years. Therefore those folks might not understand what G or W on the EDS means and this is the main problem of the elderly folks. The stomper might have just thought that some chinese elderly folks may need to sometimes look at the chinese words of the desto for route info but I believe is not the main problem as these elderly folks have been living with the almost the same bus routes for many many years. Therefore, I do suggest that all SBST feeder KUBs involving G/W displays the side desto of the service at the KUB's windscreen for the sake of these folks.</p>
              <p>A word of caution to those posting crap in the route suggestions thread: It may be a little off topic, but please NEVER suggest to ammend routes with a long history or high elderly demand. It is never easy for these elderly folks to get used to route ammendments if they have problems getting used to seeing "G" or "W" on the EDS display. I can even remember someone posting major ammendment to Service 25 in that thread. If you would like to know why the PTC/LTA allows Services 25 and 854 to duplicate each other from Bedok all the way to Hougang Ave 2 until TODAY, the above mentioned might be a possible reason.</p>

              <p>Do you even know that after 410 started using KUBs, many elderly who do not understand english take the wrong direction? They do not know what does G and W stand for. Even if you put green for G, white for W, they still end up taking the wrong plate because they STILL do not know what does G and W stand for.</p>
              <p>Dual language on our EDS is possible. Just look at HK buses.</p>
              <p>And hello, route suggestions is for ANYONE to suggest ANY route. It's not limited to whether the demand is high or not. We are not members of the PTC, so why should we follow a certain criteria on suggesting routes?</p>
