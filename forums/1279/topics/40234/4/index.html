But now since the MRT goes to the airport, I don't think Svc 989 need to go to the airport anymore. (Like SBST 506 which is shortened from the airport to Bedok). I think the most it can go to is Jln Toa Payoh, then amended to other places, since the demand after Jln Toa Payoh and along Jln Kolam Ayer is low.  Another service which may be affected is 858. If Svc 858 can terminate at Pasir Ris, that will be good.<br><br>I think the non-air-con fleet of Svc 186 has been changed from LO to VO.

Do you mean shortening it to end at Pasir Ris instead, or to Changi and then back to Pasir Ris. If you mean the first one, I can assure you that both SATS, CAAS, TIBS, PTC would not allow that to happen. Perhaps you should try the early morning services, or evening services, and you will probably notice that the pax traffic is actually quite high, especially it is the only direct service connecting the North region and Changi Airport, and many airport workers do rely heavily on it.<br></div>
