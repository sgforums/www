            <div class='col-md body'>i think for that converted air-con MKII, the buses actually had extra grilles at the sides in between the front n rear tires. Can anyone shed some light on whether the compressor was actually installed there? Or did the two buses have no compressor? I believe they are meant for retirement soon together with the other MKIIs rite? So sad to see the MKII go. I prefer the MKII (oso MKIV) than the MKIII.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think there's such a thing as a bus or coach with air-con compressor ABOVE on the roof ??!!??<br><br>If so then how to transfer the engine power from the engine (which is underneath the floorboard below) to such a compressor above on top of the roof ??!!?<br><br>However i do know that the air-con compressors are typically mounted near to the vehicle's engine so that power can be transferred via belt to drive the compressor !<br><br>What's on the roof are the evaporator-condenser blower units &amp; no compressor is ever located there.<br><br>If there's no such unit on the roof, then they place the condenser unit underneath the floor instead while the evaporator units below the ceiling inside the interior.
