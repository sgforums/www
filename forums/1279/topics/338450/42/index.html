              <p>No offense intended, but having heard so much nasty news about their products, and that their quality control is often so inferior, I don't exactly trust anything China-branded. I <em>do</em> use products made in China (the very Logitech keyboard that I'm typing this post on is made in China), but only if it's a non-China branded product - I trust that the overseas companies that have manufacturing operations in China oversee their production lines more stringently than the Chinese companies themselves. Even then, there had been problems - who could forget those lead-tainted toy trains and those melamine-added milk products from China? Much of those aren't even China-branded products! Also, I often find China-branded products to be rather inferior in quality to non-China-branded products, even if both of them were made in China!</p>
              <p>Plus, I detest Chinese products because I often find they lack originality. In China, everything has been ripped off -  clothes, shoes, cars, computers, MP3 players, mobile shows, anime merchandise, and practically everything in between had been shamelessly ripped off, and let's not mention that shameless and disgusting Zonda ripoff bus that was discussed a long time ago here. Even their original products has elements that seem lifted from other similar products, which are often subsequently desecrated horribly in a shameless effort to make it look "original". Worse still, there's even now a culture in China in which they take pride in such ripped-off designs and products! As an aspiring designer and artist, and having experienced first-hand the effort needed to develop an original design, I am disgusted by the alarming and utter disrespect they have for the hard work and sweat of the original designers whose designs have been copied by them, and no self-respecting designer could ever support such products.</p>

              <p>do not want to pick up arguments. but if MB open a factory in China and make OC and sell to SmRT, then no issue with you right as this is consider as non-china-branded product right? But everything at the factory is still run by China workers (except for some top management). I dun see any difference at all.</p>

If not, I will show this thread to my PRC friends and then if they decide to sue you, good luck to you. Perhaps it's better if you get sued , why? Then you wake up your f***ing idea.

              <p>do not want to pick up arguments. but if MB open a factory in
                  China and make OC and sell to SmRT, then no issue with you right as
                  this is consider as non-china-branded product right? But everything
                  at the factory is still run by China workers (except for some top
                  management). I dun see any difference at all.</p>

              <p>As I said, the issue I have is not China or their workers <em>per se</em>, but rather, <em>who designs the product and supervises the quality </em>(emphasis added). China is well known as the factory of the world, but their reputation as being original or having good quality control themselves is known to be terrible generally.</p>
              <p>As for your example: yes, I don't mind if Mercedes opens a factory in China and build buses there for sale to Singapore; to me, it doesn't matter <em>where</em> the product is made (mostly), it's about <em>who </em>designed it and is supervising the production.</p>

              <p>   You better mind your words, this is a public forum.
              There are many kinds of people who browse this forum. I will give
              you 2 days to remove this distasteful immature post of yours. If
              not, I will show this thread to my PRC friends and then if they
              decide to sue you, good luck to you. Perhaps it's better
              if you get sued , why? Then you wake up your f***ing idea.
              Meanwhile, I will save this post for evidence.</p>

              <p>Just as you have the right to support China products, I have the right to criticise them. It's my personal freedom of speech here, and you will have to learn to accept opposing arguments. Mob violence and suing won't get you anywhere.</p>
              <p>I know there's a difference between libel/slander and voicing out your opinions; unlike the last time when I spilled fire over SMRT in the other thread (which I subsequently deleted as an act of taking responsibility over the mess it caused), my post here maturely pointed out my arguments supporting my point of view. Threatening me rather than intelligently arguing back with your point of view is going to get you nowhere, and is basically a form of trolling and flame-baiting.</p>
              <p>And, really, do you even have the money to sue me? Or know where I live? Do you have my real name, my exact address, and such, which are needed to serve me a lawyer's letter? Sure, you can go to my ISP, but do you think they will turn over my personal data so I can be sued over rightfully expressing my opinions rationally over the internet?</p>
              <p>This is the internet, pal, and you do know that this is a public forum - and a public forum is for voicing out all kinds of opinions, including those that you will not like hearing. Either accept that, or go somewhere else where everyone agrees with you. Trust me, that kind of place gets boring after a while - it's like playing a computer game with all the challenges and achievements already unlocked and completed.</p>
