              <p><br>Agreed.. Yknow Weiteck, it's up to them to decide, not you.. They, SMRT are the owners of the OC's. Not you. If you were the owner of the OC's, you wouldn't want some person to be kpkbing that I want xxx to have OC and xxx to have OC also. Might as well all SMRT buses have OC's? Or SBST have full fleet KUB's? Then I don't think there will be as much bus-fans already..</p>

              <p>You're so <strong>wrong</strong> - LOL. 851 is so packed nowadays with the OC deployments that it's even hard to get on the bus during certain periods - talk about getting a seat on 851? Dream on.</p>
              <p>When you're <em>coming back from the city</em>, now the situation is:</p>
              <p>- Want a seat? Board from Outram Park MRT, or before that. If you can even get one, you're lucky.</p>
              <p>- Want to even board the bus? Board from Little India MRT, or before that. There's a good chance that the driver will just skip your stop if you're boarding after that stop.</p>
              <p>And before someone gets onto the fact that passengers refuse to move to the back, let's just say the driver already did a very good job getting everyone to the back and people are moving.</p>
              <p>Considering that 99.5% of the passengers on 851 aren't bus fans, this isn't so <em>lucky</em>. And, this is without WAB passengers on board the bus yet...makes me wonder what'll happen if a WAB passenger tries to board the bus at Little India.</p>
              <p><em>Dear passengers, please disembark from the bus! I need to push this passenger to the WAB area...okay okay wait i go off service first and give u all complimentary tickets~ </em> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>1. Troublesome to move up.</p>
              <p>2. But the main reason is because....The exit is in the middle. And if you're at the back and the bus is packed, you will find it very very troublesome to get off...and if you take too long because people refuse to move, the driver might just close the door and vroooom.</p>
              <p>Typical Singaporean selfish mentality lah. Although I'm guilty of this sometimes too...it happens on all models of buses, not just the OCs.</p>
              <p>Btw, I find that standing at the rear of the OCs is a mental torture sometimes - your CG is simply not there and you feel like as if you're going to fall anytime despite holding onto the handrails. Design flaw with the bus body ):</p>

              <p>I for one, don't want to be put through another mental test at the back after a long and tiresome day at work...even though getting on the bus nowadays is also a mental test.</p>
              <p>But one thing about the OCs that SMRT has failed to do, unlike SBST, is the warning stickers at the front, telling passengers not to hold the poles. I feel like writing in to inform them about it. I always see passengers holding onto the front door's poles (the back doors ones are still okay...because they don't fold in and swing out instead). The natural thing to do for humans when you stand is to want to find something to hold. 851 being so packed, passengers usually stand right to the front door.</p>
              <p>Being at the front, they don't realise that the door actually opens inwards and hold onto the entrance door's "poles" where SBST on their KUBs have stickered. The drivers do not realise that this is happening when I asked some of them and they'd just open the doors. When this happens, the hands get clipped and bent backwards, creating a huge possilibity of breaking the wrist. It's a scary thought, but I've seen near cases happening..including myself personally because I didn't notice passengers wanting to board at the bus stop.</p>

              <p>You know, I agree with almost everyone. Please, wait for news and think before you post. We here do not like useless questions or one-liners with absolutely no meaning. You could take a leaf out of SBS8033D's book. I can still remember not too long ago, he was like you, worse still 'stealing' pics. Now I can see his behaviour on the forums has improved and he has started posting more intelligently. I believe this is not the first time, or the second, or third for that matter, that you have shown not-that-acceptable behavior on the forums. So, I hope you can have a better sense of judgement and thinking in your posts and have a nice user experience on SgForums.</p>

              <p><br>Including those SMRT bus services that passes through Upp Thomson Road near Thomson Plaza area too, no OC500LEs as yet (unless got cameo). SBST bus services like 52, 162, 163, 165 and 410 are now with Scania K230UB fleets already.</p>
              <p>Sembawang areas especially those which only has service 980 plying on those certain parts... AMDEP still deploying those old Nissan buses on service 980 instead of introducing the new OC500LEs.</p>
              <p>As for Woodlands areas, I think that service 178 is still the worst one off among all. Just wait for all the Nissan UDs to be phased out, perhaps WLDEP might put their remaining ex AMDEP/KJDEP SP CAC Mercs there too, just like what they did to service 852.</p>
