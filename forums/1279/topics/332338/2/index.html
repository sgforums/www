              <p>Agreeable. But the problem is... Without walking up the step,
              the new bus has only 4 seats! 5 elderly would mean one has to
              either stand or walk up the stair. The rest of them are accessible
              through a small step, which is quite dangerous for the elderly
              especially when the bus has already started moving by the time they
              reach there. Don't the older DM3500 and Striders serve better the
              elderly? My Thought...</p>

              <p>there are actually 5 or 6 seats. there is an extra seat (which may be able to fit 2 passengers) behind the driver's cabin for later k230s. if there are 5 elderly, they should be enough seats for them. otherwise if there's more, then the elderly have no choice, they just have to walk up the stairs to reach the seats.</p>

              <p>On your first point, I guess I concede, more or less .Looking closely at SBS Transit's press releases, I feel they have done well on this point, but SMRT's press releases still need to be less formal and "government-like". Still, I could appreciate if some of the press releases use more casual language rather than sticking to neologisms that baffles us commuters.</p>
              <p>I think I missed the chance to elaborate on this point: when I asked for press and media releases to be less formal, I wasn't calling for a blanket de-formalisation of all press releases; bad news (eg. service disruptions, withdrawals, etc.) should be carried in a formal and serious tone - that can't be argued against. However, for good news (eg. route introductions, new bus fleets, etc.), a somewhat less formal and more casual language could be appropriate. SBS Transit has done well on this point, but SMRT's press releases on such things, I feel, are still rather formal and monotonous in tone.</p>

              <p><br>Care to elaborate with examples how SBST PRs are less formal and casual which SMRT PRs lack?</p>
              <p>I personally dont have issues with the PRs. But formality is a safe standard across-the-board thing, especially if you are communicating serious issues with the public, and it depends on how the respective companies wish to define themselves through their PRs.</p>
              <p>What can be improved though, is to increase the reach of the current PRs. Instead of just board posters at bus stops and the websites, go publish in the newspapers. TIBS did it once when they advertised service 969's introduction in the ST. This way, more people can grab hold of the news, faster.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I feel that you should
              elaborate more on your points and be more specific in your views
              about how the public transport system should be improved. For
              example, you said "maintain their bus better". You need to
              elaborate on which points of</span> <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">maintenance</span> <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">should be improved, be it the
              engine condition or cleanliness of the buses. Next, you said
              "remove buses tt are uncomfortable". I would like to know which
              model you think is/are uncomfortable. Followed by you
              saying "fit in more WAB buses with many seats too..", the word
              "fit in" is not the proper word to use. Probably you are trying to
              suggest for SBST and SMRT to purchase more WAB Buses with more
              seats fitted. You should also not use the word "many
              seats" as it just does not sound right. With "SMRT&gt;to clean up
              their bus regularly ,SBS&gt;increase of speed", you are probably
              trying to suggest for SMRT to improve the cleanliness of their
              buses and SBS Transit to remove the speed regulators on their buses
              for improved speed. So please phrase your thoughts correctly.
              Lastly, you said "suggest tvm to be on all buses". Please explain
              why you feel that there should be TVM on all
              buses.</span></span></p>
