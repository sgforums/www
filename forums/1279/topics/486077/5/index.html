              <p>It is an admirable effort by SMRT, yes.</p>
              <p>But I would disagree that "it wouldn't be any more complex than
              what a taxi driver is currently doing". There are lots more systems
              for a BC to pick up, there is the scheduling aspect to follow, and
              the customer service aspect of the BC's job is more complicated
              than that of a taxi driver - many more possible situation when your
              vehicle carries 80 - 90 passengers instead of 4.</p>

              <p>I was referring mainly to technology, though a rejoinder to the issue of customer service is that bus drivers in Singapore get easier access to direct assistance (via depot) as compared to their taxi counterparts.</p>

              <p>But I would see this as a more solid attempt to hire more
              drivers locally. Even the usual import sources are starting to dry
              up, so operators need new and very different ways to get
              drivers.</p>
              <p>I think it wouldn't be any more complex than what a taxi driver
              is currently doing, but I do agree that it will be hard for some to
              pick up the knowledge. It may sound like a surprise to you but in
              different parts of the world where I have experienced, it is very
              common to hear drivers making a wrong turn or struggling to set the
              fare device because it is their first week or even day at work.</p>

              <p>Fortunately (or unfortunately), the training for flexi hour BC is still 6 - 8 weeks, even if you are an existing pte bus driver (with CL4 and BDVL).</p>
              <p>This makes the cost of entering this job too high even for pte bus drivers who wishes to spend more time with their family as they get older. It is however good for new entrants since they would have ample time to learn the systems.</p>

              <p>I personally think this move suggests that SMRT has no idea
                          where the bus industry is heading towards......either that or they
                          dont care. Or they think that the bus pax flow is too peakish to
                          handle with current pool of full-time drivers.</p>
              <p>Personally, I can't imagine a part-timer bothering to learn
                          everything about how to use the complicated new systems like the
                          IBMS, the fare systems etc etc. Industry insiders might wish to
                          correct me at this point however if they disagree.</p>
