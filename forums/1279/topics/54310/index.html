It is a 15m 3 axle B10M. It is not a rebuilt artic. I doubt any chassis or bodyworks can be rebuilt in such a way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About these superlong bus....<br><br>Its quite common in Melbourne, Australia. Those of you who had stayed in Melbourne may notice that National Bus is deploying some superlong buses on its routes. Also, the new re-branded red colour Skybus-an airport express bus from Tullamarine Airport via CityLink to Spencer Street station also uses some of these buses.<br><br>During the trail of SBS 997A in Singapore, many commuters complained of difficulties alighting when the bus is crowded, because there is only one exit door. The bus is not long enough for a 2nd exit door. Therefore, SBST decided not to buy such buses anymore and concentrated only on double-deckers.??</div>
