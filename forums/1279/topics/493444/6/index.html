              <p>You're taking things to the extreme. Nobody said that ppl will
                  purposely avoid buses without a PIS or USB charging. But ppl will
                  certainly appreciate it when they have these things.</p>
              <p>I'm tired of ppl saying a bus is just a bus. We're not saying we
                  can't live without it. But if there is an OPTION for it i.e. stop
                  buying SBST spec and start buying more A95 etc, then we shouldn't
                  use the excuse of settling for the lesser by comparing with the
                  minimal. </p>
              <p>Besides by your logic, why are we even procuring European bus
                  models? Won't PRC buses do the job too? Or better still, bangla
                  buses without aircon and has bamboo seats? Bus what.</p>

              <p>am i taking it to the extreme? no... i tot you are the one who are taking to the extreme by bashing those citaro/B9..... </p>
              <p>will pax appreciate these PIS/USB ports or some other fancy items in the buses? dun think so..  it is not a necessity..... do not need these fancy items to push up the bus fares...  maybe some tourist need the PIS.. but really is it useful?  how many paxes bother to see the PIS inside SMRT buses when it put "Opposite Blk 214 market"  what on earth is this? which road? </p>
              <p>as for SBST spec, these are old purchases. not sure why you keep on complaining on this?  </p>
              <p>well, maybe you will see MIC buses or made in india buses in the coming futures. who know?  with LTA doing the purchasing, anything is possible esp if they are doing competitive bidding. (right now, it seem like they are not really in doing competitive bidding for those A95orders) .but for the upcoming electric/hybrid buses trial, dun be surprise to see MIC buses...</p>

              <p>Thats it if LTA decided to retired all those Volvo B10TL,Volvo B9TL CDGE,Dennis Trident &amp; the Volvo B10BLE.If they kee siao and really keen about emissions then those Euro IV K230UB also in trouble.</p>
              <p>There is also Euro VI MAN A22 with 280/320hp option.</p>

              <p>most of the paxes just wan the buses/trains to come on time and
              can board... so if the buses/trains that come does not have PIS,
              you dun board? or the bus come is old non-wab bus, you also dun
              board? maybe if you are a studend and have plenty of time after
              school, you can do that. but if you are working and rushing to
              work/going home, you will just be happy to be able to board the
              first bus/train that come...</p>

              <p>no, you cannot make such a $2 minimum bus fare. Whether or not, fares must be "affordable". Anyway, oil prices were happy to be lowering down, so the bus fare will be lowered by 1 cent for students, 2 to 4 cents for adults and 2 cents for old man.</p>
