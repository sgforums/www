              <p>ur not wrong</p>
              <p>but in replacing every bendy with 2 rigids, doesnt that give them even more excuse, or at the best, a valid logical excuse to raise fares?</p>
              <p>not that their past fare raises have been completely invalid</p>
              <p>would u, as a transport company, not raise fares if your fuel and operating costs double? so u just absorb the millions and millions of dollars extra coming from fuel/operating into your pocket and not apply for fare raise?</p>

              <p>Who can accept we can see for ourselves. We aren't blind and there is a line to draw between 'common issues of society' and unacceptable standards. From what I see this is the 'common issues of society' which you failed to accept.</p>
              <p>This is the bus forum, It's for the public. He made up his own club wanting to find like-minded people which child-like passion for bendies, not for pathetic illiterates like you crashing and whacking other people who likes to share the same stuff as him. It is people like you who bring this thread and society down. COI? What a joke really, Sadly some people likes to 'use small facts' and just assume bendies are out, which isn't the case here. You want to win the case as prosecutor, You need prove why beyond reasonable doubt that this person should be punished, All I see here are just people making 'small facts' and ask for it to be banned, Which sadly doesn't apply here in SG.</p>
              <p>Sadly there is no perfect stuff in our society here. Mistakes and accidents do happen. It is not in our control whether or not we want it to happen. If you want to nit-pick on stuffs like litter,lane hogging or nonsense like why is svc xxx's frequency so long and stuff, That's beyond their control. They can only try their best to reduce and add depending on the demand. The SMRT trains saga caused a huge uproar, But most of us has already moved on. It is you who keeps nit-picking on such issues, and can't move on.</p>
              <p>Uh-uh, You are wrong. I can accept facts and live with it but I can't stand wreckers like you wanting to wreck other peoples club. If you share his passion, join. If you don't, Scram. The person I feel for is the TS because all his efforts to promote like minded people to join his club has been nullified.</p>

              <p>You want to live in your own world then it's your problem. By twisting facts in favor of what you want to hear makes you very desperate just to show what you want to hear.</p>
              <p>You don't know how the industry work, how the authorities work yet wants to paint a story to deceive the public. LTA COI meetings are not for fun, not just come and talk and go. They are discussing things on what has to be done and highlight what has to be done in the future to improve.</p>
              <p>You don't bother to go and do your own research further, even when some of these small facts has shown you what will be happening and yet keep on insisting that your point of view is right.</p>
              <p>I am not like you trying to hide the facts to deceive these kids here. Yes, he opened a thread here about bendy buses but he has also accept what is going to happen in the future. Sometimes truth hurts but it is better than deceiving people with their own fantasies.</p>

              <p> What is pathetic is that many people here can't read. It already states that no hate comments are allowed. I can say that it is pathetic that you think no bendies will be coming into Singapore,and so what if the creator of this "club" is childish (not me).</p>
              <p>We are aware on the bendy situation,but that doesn't mean some people can just say decide that no bendies will be coming in anymore. Even so,it's fine,I have nothing to prove,but some people will just rub in our faces,won't they?</p>
              <p>Im not taking sides here even though I feel that bendies are awesome,I'm just a 13 year old kid with a passion for bendies,but if this argument continues,then it is just disappointing.</p>

              </p><p><strong>1. Electronic Destination Sign</strong></p>
              <p>The bus is equipped with the highly visible electronically-programmable destination signs on the front, the side and the rear of the bus to indicate the service number, intermediate points as well as destination. Bus routes can now be conveniently displayed at the front and side panels by touch buttons and drivers need not carry the bulky side route plates and do not have to manually change the front route signs.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Operation Console Stand</strong></p>
              <p>The Operation Console stand has 3-degree of movements and can be tailored to the individual driver's preference.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Ergonomic Driver's Seat</strong></p>
              <p>Fully adjustable seats with air suspension provide added comfort.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Blinds</strong></p>
              <p>Blinds are installed to reduce glare to drivers.</p>

              <p>The transmission is equipped with variable shifts that change gear with the load in the bus. This gives our drivers the extra torque (power) needed when the bus is fully loaded.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Two Validators For Each Bus</strong></p>
              <p>With two validators, usage of Fare Card is encouraged. This will help to reduce workload of our drivers operating the OCDU. </p>
              <p><strong>9. Wide Entrance and Exit Doors</strong></p>
              <p>With the wide doors, passengers can board and alight faster, reducing the dwell time at the bus stops. </p>

              <p><strong>Press Release in 1997:</strong><br><br>
              </p><p><strong>SIX MORE BENDY BUSES HIT THE ROAD ON FRIDAY, 18 JULY 1997</strong></p>
              <p>Passengers of Tibs’ services 851 and 82 will get to see "more" of their buses from Friday, 18 July 1997.</p>
              <p>Five of Tibs’ new super-long Bendy Buses will be deployed on Service 851 and one on Service 82. Service 851 plies from Yishun Interchange to Bukit Merah Interchange whilst Service 82 operates between Punggol and Shenton Way.</p>
              <p>Four other new Bendy Buses will be deployed on Services 103, 176, 179, 180, 187, 811, 812, 854, 856, 911 and 913. Tibs currently has 11 Bendy Buses in its fleet. Another 46 units will join the fleet by year end.</p>
              <p>Tibs’ Bendy Bus, a 17.5-metre long bus, can accommodate 142 passengers. It is as flexible and manoeuverable as the normal 12-metre bus and can take corners as easily as its shorter counterpart. The Bendy Bus is equipped with many passenger-friendly features such as three extremely wide doors for faster boarding and alighting and 90 horizontal handstraps and 13 stanchions which allow standing passengers to have a better grip and better body control while standing in the buses.</p>
              <p>Many safety features can also be found on the buses, including the accelerator interlock device that prevents the accelerator from being depressed when the doors are not fully closed and intra-red sensors which prevents the doors from closing when there are passengers standing on the steps at the exit. Another additional safety feature is the CCTV cameras - one for the rear door and the other for the rear view. The video monitor is normally focused on the rear door, working on an auto-switch basis. The video monitor will auto-switch to the rear view when the bus is in reverse. </p>

              <p>For everyone's knowledge, London retired ALL their MB Citaro
              bendies in early 2012 and half or more are Euro V facelifted, RHD,
              quite new i must admit, so it depends on whether the regulator
              allows NEW bendy to be imported.<br> Besides MB, there are other makes, IVECO, FIAT, MAN, Scania
              so...<br> All low floor<br> <br> ACx</p>

              <p>That only applies to London, which does not apply to all countries which imported Citaro Gs</p>

              <p><br><strong>LAUNCH OF WORLD'S FIRST ARTICULATED BUS BY RENOWNED DESIGNER, PNINFARINA AND THE CELEBRATION OF Tibs' 100TH BENDY BUS </strong></p>
              <p>Tibs has always strived to look for ways to provide good customer service for its customers. This includes buying buses with customer-friendly features. The Bendy Bus with its distinct features have served Tibs' and its customers well since the first bus was brought in on Singapore road in 1996. </p>
              <p>12 June 2000 marks a significant milestone in Tibs' history as it launches the world's first Bendy Bus by renowned designer, Pininfarina. Mr Pininfarina is well known for his design of Ferrari and other sports cars. Tibs is honoured to operate the world's first articulated bus ever designed by him. </p>
              <p>Tibs latest Pininfarina-designed Habit Bus comes with further comfortable features for its passengers. The features include more legroom with Cantilever seats, easier passenger movements in the bus with more vertical support poles, a brighter atmosphere with parallel lighting on both sides of the aisle. Safety features include acoustic warning at exit doors to warn passengers that the doors are closing and close circuit monitors for drivers to check that passengers are alighting safely from the second exit door and double check for traffic at the rear whilst reversing. </p>
              <p>On the same day, Tibs is celebrating the delivery of its 100th Bendy Bus. Encouraged by the good response from both passengers and drivers as well as the higher carrying capacity of the Bendy Bus, Trans-Island Bus Services Ltd has since placed order for more Bendy Buses. There are currently 86 Bendy Buses on the road. By the end of the year, the total number of Bendy Buses will reach 215. </p>
              <p>In order to give passengers a preview of its new designer bus, Tibs has arranged for the buses to be displayed at its five interchanges, namely, Woodlands, Yishun, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang on Sunday, 18 June 2000 from 10 am to 3 pm. <br><br><em>Taken from TIBS Website..</em></p>
