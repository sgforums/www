              It is not about fast or slow. It is more of the scheduling and
              timing of the buses. If bus is too ahead of its timing, it will be
              slow. If bus is late, they will speed.</p>
              <p>I have taken 168 double deckers along TPE at 65km/h before and
              there are times double deckers along Orchard Road overtake the
              bendy bus. And sometimes it is even more frustrsting that a bendy
              bus being stuck in a junction and bus stop.</p>

              Okay since its like what you say scheduling of the buses then I would say that some of the SBS bus services scheduling is not very good, cause most of the time this screwed up scheduling causes their bus services to crawl so slowly on the road. Or is it because they are fully aware that their buses (like DDs and KuBs) do not have the capacity to travel on the road at a greater speed? If this is the reason then it have to do with the fact that the buses that they use do not have the capacity to travel quickly isn't it? Hence greater time allowance are given to them to travel from one place to another. 
              
              I am speaking from a passenger's point of view and what does a passenger expect when he/she travels from one place to another? Efficiency.
              
              Whatever the reason, in my opinion and from my experience, most SBST buses travel slower than SMRT buses, and to me, that is a problem. I expect efficiency from our own public transport.

People would have no case of argument for that since its the law given by the LTA.

              <p><br>Okay since its like what you say scheduling of the buses then I would say that some of the SBS bus services scheduling is not very good, cause most of the time this screwed up scheduling causes their bus services to crawl so slowly on the road. Or is it because they are fully aware that their buses (like DDs and KuBs) do not have the capacity to travel on the road at a greater speed? If this is the reason then it have to do with the fact that the buses that they use do not have the capacity to travel quickly isn't it? Hence greater time allowance are given to them to travel from one place to another. I am speaking from a passenger's point of view and what does a passenger expect when he/she travels from one place to another? Efficiency. Whatever the reason, in my opinion and from my experience, most SBST buses travel slower than SMRT buses, and to me, that is a problem. I expect efficiency from our own public transport.</p>

              <p>At least most of the scheduling of SBST services are good, as compared to most of SMRT buses which are worse. A big company can handle so many bus services well, while a small company can't even handle a small pool of bus services well. It show how much the culture of the company is.</p>
              <p>Go look at the speedometers of SBST buses before you comment. They can reach up to speeds of 90km/h. It is just that LTA wants to install speed limiters to limit the speed of buses, firstly is about safety. If you know the history of Singapore buses, SBS had a continous spite of accidents in the 1990s. Accidents became higher and thus LTA and SBS have to install speed limiters for safety concerns of bus services to commuters. Everyone wants to have a faster bus trip but I will not compromise fast for safety reasons. Better late than never.</p>
              <p>Having greater allowance of time is because of the number of buses available and the readiness to prepare for situations like traffic jams, busy roads and very high frequencies. 72 is slow at certain parts of the route because it has good frequencies to cater the crowds for Tampines residents within Tampines. 72 has many buses, and thus they have to run at frequent trips in order to ensure all BCs have a fair share of trips daily and also not to the extend of screwing up the frequencies. But I agree that SBST should do something about the Tampines Rd part, which they should consider it as a semi-express road instead so that run time for the road can be shorten by at least 5 mins.</p>
              <p>If you want to talk about efficiency about SMRT, they are hardly efficient. Poor and eccentric frequencies, long waiting times, overcrowding to the state that commuters can't even board the bus many times, e.g. 190, 960, 980. They can be fast but some services are actually slower now due to better frequencies, e,g 851. Despite so many years, they still fail to improve their bus services. Efficient, hardly.</p>
              <p>However for SBST, they can be slower generally, but some services are actaully faster than years back.</p>
