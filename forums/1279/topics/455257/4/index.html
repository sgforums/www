              <p><br>190 was better served under SBS with many double deckers. Then too bad it was transfered to SMRT and I see lesser bendy buses which are not friendly to busy roads in the city. Overcrowding happens and more and more complains came in about not able to board the buses for 190.</p>
              <p>But anyway DTL will be up in 2017. By then 190 will only need full single deckers to sufficiently cater the lower demand.</p>

              <p><br>Don't believe, you can go ask around. You can ask carbikebus about this. The internal operations have been discussing this as one of the options for years. But recently there have been a talk about using double deckers here, I'm not sure about this but I feel the original plan full single deckers seems more suitable.</p>
              <p>You want the proof, go look for the proof when hints are given to you. Don't expect people to lay out everything for you just for your sake of convenience. Some things are also not meant to post here. Don't try to act smart to get people spoonfeed you here.</p>
              <p>Again want to hear the good things here only, not happy about the things that are really happening, then leave the discussion. You don't own the forum.  </p>

              <p><br> Deployment of Wrights doesn't mean they can't drive fast. What kind
              of logic is that? As long as the BCs have to meet the target of the
              planned time for the trip, they have to adjust the speed. Being on
              time and safety are the priority for BCs, they won't care
              whether bus new or not. New bus doesn't mean they cannot speed. I
              have taken Citaros on 24 speeding on TPE before, even overtaking
              another 858 O405.</p>
              <p>969 schedule only bothers to improve a bit after they have added
              many single deckers recently. But 168 is still better.</p>
              <p>If you noticed, SBST fire incident is caused by one bus and
              spread to other buses parked beside it. So the sole culprit is
              the Leyland Olympian while the other buses are innocent parties. I
              think Leyland Olympians are prone to fires probably on their fuel
              tank designs. In the early years of services, I can smell fuel
              while inside the bus. And the first Ang Mo Kio depot fire incident
              in the 90s was also caused by a Leyland Olympian.</p>
              <p>Bendy buses fires are much different. All of them are isolated
              cases whereby the buses started the fire by themselves. Mainly the
              cause is overworking and easily overheated engines of these bendy
              buses. All thanks to SMRT terrible bus maintanance regime as
              well.</p>

              <p>Then can I ask you, out of so many bendy buses deployments how many of them had caught fire?</p>
