              <p>True worst part for 851 when previously got 4 crossover bendies
              to 856 during AM peak.Already struggling with loads yet the
              deployment side anyhow whack put 4 851 bendies from WDL to YIS.969
              due to complains from public and they are being pressurise so Bo
              pian put extra bendies.Put extra bendies on 806 at the expense on
              some trunk svc with high loading,61 from BBT to NP during Am peak
              CMI,Last time there used to have 2-4 bendies run this block but
              now,Cheeterok and Osi struggle like mad..154A with DDs ardy

              <p>or that smrt made a huge mistake increasing the peak freq of 806 from 5 min to 2 min, fleet add 5 times in the past yr? introducing 2 more crossovers during peak of peak?</p>
              <p>its all a waste of resources?? </p>
              <p>dude..even 969 at 3 min headway along sbw rd stretch also cannot win 806 high loading.</p>
              <p>really, pls do some research bef u speak.. if ppl cannot even get on their feeder bus to bring them to the interchange,how u expect them to then get on their trunk connection or the mrt?</p>

              <p><br>You still fail to understand the balance. Public transport cannot solve all the problem, it can only offset partially the problems of traffic jams in long run. Lesser cars means they have to roll out more bus services and so more buses on the roads. It also makes no sense to use bendy buses in this case with much more buses on the roads, which cause more long queues and unwanted bottlenecks and bus jams caused by longer buses. All the more they want to use normal single decker buses and double deckers and standardise to the same length for flexibility and higher efficiencies for a more crowded bus lanes and bus intertchanges. More buses means bus companies even need more spaces to park more buses and they will not want to park longer bendy buses to waste the space meant for more normal buses which can contribute to better frequencies and more services.</p>
              <p>I guess kids like you people still fail the need of using cars for many groups of people. Some need for work purposes (like delivery and sales), some have big families with many children and elderly. And when you reach to a point of growing up and being in a working life (which is so demanding and stressful), you need something to motivate and reward yourself and also give your family and friends a better life. That's where a car and a house comes in. You will come to a point of life that you can't always rely on buses and trains everyday because there is nothing much to motivate you to move on in life and in work. I know cars have their problems like traffic jams and thus it is better to take bus to work and use your own transport for other purposes. And I certainly do support the use of green cars.</p>
              <p>You want bendy buses then I guess the only way is to cut down the number of bus services in Singapore, and also drastically reduce the population of Singapore back to 3 million which translates to lower density living in Singapore. But do you think your govt is sensable enough to do this, even in future?</p>

              <p>in any case, where else u wan to pluck a bendy from? 169? with so enormous crowd going to senoko in the morning?</p>
              <p>or 67? little india crowd too small?</p>
              <p>969? not enough ppl going tampines?</p>
              <p>or 854? </p>
              <p>if they must have to get a bendy from somewhere, isnt it obvious they have to get it from some place where the loading is not as high as the above mentioned svcs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh and, of course i know u did work as an smrt standby sl before</p>
              <p>but that was way long long ago</p>
              <p>when 806 still wasnt that prosperous</p>
              <p>u shld have seen its change in loading... increase by 200% within 18 mths</p>

              <p>That is when the bus stop is big, how about small bus stops? 2 bendy bus and 1 single decker can save more space for 5 single deckers at least.</p>
              <p>Without bendy buses, these buses can cater more single deckers in the bus stop and allow more bus services to stop at the same time to allow commuters to board and alight at the same time. LTA can even save the space for other purposes if there are no bendy buses. Singapore land is limited, not like big countries.</p>
              <p>You only talk about the bus stop outside. How about the queues they formed inside the bus interchanges and the chaos they made for parking woes in depots? And no private vehicles involved.</p>

              <p>That is when the bus stop is big, how about small bus stops? 2

              <p>Without bendy buses, these buses can cater more single deckers
              in the bus stop and allow more bus services to stop at the same
              time to allow commuters to board and alight at the same time. LTA
              can even save the space for other purposes if there are no bendy
              buses. Singapore land is limited, not like big countries.</p>
              <p>You only talk about the bus stop outside. How about the queues

              <p>the SD come from 169/965/969/858... they all usually come with packed buses and take almost the same time to unload... 3 doors vs 2 doors, abt same loading %.</p>

              <p>what my point is, that trunk svcs shld use double deckers instead of bendies. im all with double deck serving trunk routes, but feeder shld continue using bendies, esp short routes with high loading at the ending stops, no one would want to go on the upper deck and waste 1-2min waiting for lower deck ppl to alight bef they alight. 1-2min makes a lot of diff when ur trying to rush for work in the morning</p>
              <p>besides, certain smrt feeder or intratown routes arent passable to double deck cos of their wider turning radius into the small and narrow roads which bendies can negotiate</p>

              <p>Your last paragraph makes no sense. Bendy buses are 18 meters long while a double decker is only 12 metres long. If bendy buses can drive at these turns, then it's no problem for normal buses as well. But fact is bendy takes up to much road space and they need more space to move out just to negotiate a sharp turn.</p>
              <p>Someone here have mentioned about the problems caused by bendy buses along Yishun Northpoint in the earlier pages. I myself have several encounters during peak hours as well. The queue of buses can go all the way up to Yishun 10, including bendy buses. Imagine if there are no bendy buses, the queues will be shorter, less bottleneck to other buses and vehicles. And these propblems are mainly caused by bendy buses at most extents.</p>
              <p>In future with better frequencies, there is no need for bendy buses in future. Feeder services can achieve the same purpose. There is a possibility of extending an existing trunk service or introducing a new feeder service to Yishun East in future. 806 problem is only temporary.</p>

              <p>This is the bus forum, It's for the public. He made up his own club wanting to find like-minded people which child-like passion for bendies, not for pathetic illiterates like you crashing and whacking other people who likes to share the same stuff as him. It is people like you who bring this thread and society down. COI? What a joke really, Sadly some people likes to 'use small facts' and just assume bendies are out, which isn't the case here. You want to win the case as prosecutor, You need prove why beyond reasonable doubt that this person should be punished, All I see here are just people making 'small facts' and ask for it to be banned, Which sadly doesn't apply here in SG.</p>
              <p>Sadly there is no perfect stuff in our society here. Mistakes and accidents do happen. It is not in our control whether or not we want it to happen. If you want to nit-pick on stuffs like litter,lane hogging or nonsense like why is svc xxx's frequency so long and stuff, That's beyond their control. They can only try their best to reduce and add depending on the demand. The SMRT trains saga caused a huge uproar, But most of us has already moved on. It is you who keeps nit-picking on such issues, and can't move on.</p>
              <p>Uh-uh, You are wrong. I can accept facts and live with it but I can't stand wreckers like you wanting to wreck other peoples club. If you share his passion, join.
