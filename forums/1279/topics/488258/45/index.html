              <p>Today (monday) still see SBS DD running DTL paralle service. Anyway, here is the articles published in Today Voice</p>
              <p>SMRT still suitable operator to run new Thomson-East Coast Line?<br>From<br>Richmond Lee<br>Published: 9:25 PM, October 23, 2017</p>
              <p>The new Thomson-East Coast Line, set to open in stages from 2019, will be operated by SMRT for a nine-year period. <br>With the series of service breakdowns along the North-South Line, it seems like a good time to review if SMRT is really up for the task.</p>
              <p>When announcing the winning bidder to operate the Thomson-East Coast Line on Sept 15, the Land Transport Authority said this in its press release: “...we have assessed that SMRT Trains will be able to offer a higher level of service, as it has committed to invest heavily in predictive maintenance and manpower training”.<br>Questions will inevitably be raised now on how committed SMRT is towards preventive maintenance, given the historical baggage it has with breakdowns on the older MRT lines. <br>On account of this, public sentiments will be directed towards how SMRT can cope with a new line on top of running three heavy-usage lines while perfectly maintaining them all. <br>Given the age of the East-West Line and North-South Line, it means that SMRT will definitely have to put in more effort in maintaining these lines to undo the neglect from past management teams. <br>It will be wise for SMRT to strongly focus, for now, on improving this area and tackling those “deep-seated” internal organisational issues it has while striving to improve and upgrade the two oldest lines to regain public trust and confidence, without taking a new MRT line under its wing.</p>

              <p>Another letter to Today Voice. Pengkang SMRT management<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><strong></strong><em></em></p>
              <p>If poor leadership is an issue, consider a change of management</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has blamed the team in charge of maintaining the anti-flooding system at Bishan MRT Station for the Oct 7 incident that affected the North-South Line. <br>Similarly, SMRT’s chairman Seah Moon Ming and group chief executive Desmond Kuek acted against the maintenance team by removing the team leader and cutting their bonuses.</p>
              <p>But in light of repeated train disruptions, it is fair to ask: What actions will be taken against the management team itself?<br>Finger-pointing is never a good idea. Nor is silence. There was no word from Mr Kuek when the breakdowns were happening, and it took several days before he appeared before Singaporeans to explain what had happened.<br>One wonders if the “deep-seated cultural issues” Mr Kuek brought up have anything to do with poor leadership? If so, an overhaul is needed for change to happen. Perhaps the company should consider getting leaders with experience to run a rail network.</p>

              <p>Technically the TEL is under such a contract. If u refer to earlier news release, they allow SMRT to run TEL for 9 years before it has to be recontracted again.</p>
              <p>IIRC the JB-SG RTS does not run such a model, but is still being awared to SMRT</p>

              <p>Back in the SBS/SMRT duopoly days, the bus industry used to have some serious deep-seated cultural issues. Thanks to the SMRT bus driver strike in 2012, we now see more players in the bus industry. While there are debates on whether bus services actually improve, we can agree that bus drivers are paid more and treated better now.</p>
              <p>As for the bus community, I do observe some "politics" between bus fans in a Facebook group and bus fans in a society. I don't know the history of the politics between these 2 camps so I can't comment on that. (I'm just observing the politics as an outsider.) In this forum, we occasionally see trolls who keep seeking attention, but at least the politics here (if any) are milder, and most of the time I feel more amused than irritated.</p>

              <p>Back in the SBS/SMRT duopoly days, the bus industry used to have
                  some serious deep-seated cultural issues. Thanks to the SMRT bus
                  driver strike in 2012, we now see more players in the bus industry.
                  While there are debates on whether bus services actually improve,
                  we can agree that bus drivers are paid more and treated better
                  now.</p>
              <p>As for the bus community, I do observe some "politics" between
                  bus fans in a Facebook group and bus fans in a society. I don't
                  know the history of the politics between these 2 camps so I can't
                  comment on that. (I'm just observing the politics as an outsider.)
                  In this forum, we occasionally see trolls who keep seeking
                  attention, but at least the politics here (if any) are milder, and
                  most of the time I feel more amused than irritated.</p>

              <p>obviously there is a trade off... right now, it is the gov who is subsidy the bus operations.. so BC get more pays which are indirectly subsiize by those tax payers..  so in the end , you should know the outcome for the bus fares next few year down the road.</p>
              <p>as for the troll that you mention, there is obviously one guy who is too free here....alway spamming with new accounts.. </p>

              <p>BPS1 is Weekday Peak Period Shuttle Service, special case of PPSS. Is the BPLRT a white elephant? just because DTL is there doesn't mean that LTA can screw BPLRT and leave it as it is.</p>

              <p>Before the arrival of Tower Transit and Go Ahead, there are only
                  2 public bus operators: SBS Transit and SMRT. Being in a duopoly,
                  the 2 companies became complacent and paid their drivers poorly,
                  resulting in the SMRT bus driver strike in 2012. The strike "woke
                  up" the government, prompting them to end the decades-old bus
                  duopoly and switch to the Bus Contracting Model (BCM), in order to
                  bring in new players to improve service level and employee

              <p>KTM has full monopoly of Malaysia's railways and yet nobody complained. SMRT should have retained the subway monopoly (ie all lines) and kept their hands off Tibs. WTS should have got a third PTO license and the contracts for the South and West (corresponding roughly to Bukit Merah, Clementi and Jurong West paclages). All these should have been done 18 years ago. Unfortunately the Transport Minister at that time was a shithead. Hence i call him Marbok Tan.</p>

              <p>Are you sure no one complained abt KTM? Or u just nvr hear abt it? Im pretty sure they have their own faults too. And KTM doenst have <em>full </em>monopoly. Their monopoly is for their long-distance networks only. Rapid Malaysia still has their part to play in running most of the klang valley rail networks. KTM doesnt run the kelana jaya lines etc. Rapid Malaysia runs them. So in some sense KTM is a bit like SMRT which controls <em>most </em>rail lines (and maybe even hands off buses (what abt taxis why SMRT everything also want)), and Rapid Malaysia runs a handful of Rail lines and some important bus networks</p>
