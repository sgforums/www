              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Well, DTL is a medium capacity Rapid Transit System ("MRT" and
                  "LRT" are only terms for public consumption). Each train has the
                  capacity for 931 people - equivalent to around seven double decker
                  buses (931 / 130).</p>
              <p>During peak hours, if the frequency is four minutes, that's
                  fifteen trains per hour with a total capacity of 13,965 people (931
                  x 15) - equivalent to around one hundred and seven double decker
                  buses (13965 / 130).</p>
              <p>The frequency of bus services along Bukit Timah Road (Dunearn
                  Road) is around four minutes and around ten minutes. Currently,
                  there are fiveteen bus services. During peak hours, if all bus
                  services use only High-Capacity (130 pax) buses and operate at a
                  frequency of seven minutes (8.6 buses/hr), it would mean that the
                  buses have a total frequency of 16,770 people per hour (8.6 x 130 x
                  15).</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">While the Downtown Line stage 2 capacity (around
                  13,965 people/hour during peak hours) may not be able to completely
                  replace the capacity of the existing bus services (around 16,770
                  people/hour during peak hours), it could replace 83.2737% of it
                  (13965/16770 x 100%).</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>As there are currently fifteen bus services at Bukit Timah Road
                  (Dunearn Road), this means up to 12.491055 bus services (0.832737 x
                  15) do not have to ply Bukit Timah Road (Dunean Road) when the
                  Downtown Line stage 2 opens.</p>
              <p>However, it appears that except bus service 170, none of the
                  fifteen bus services have their routes follow the alignment of the
                  Downtown Line stage 2 completely.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, bus route 66 can be split into around two separate
                  bus routes. Bus route 67 can be shortened to loop at around
                  Rocher-LittleIndia-Newton.</p>
              <p>Bus route 171 can be shortened to loop at Newton. The section
                  between Bukit Panjang and Yishun can become a separate new bus
                  route.</p>
              <p>Bus routes 74, 77, 151, 154, 157, 174, 563, 852, 961, 961C and
                  970 do not duplicate much of Downtown Line stage two, so I think
                  they should remain the same.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, bus route 960 can be shortened to ply only between
                  Woodlands and Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>Bus services 190 and 972 should remain the same because they
                  serve a different area (Orchard Road) than the Downtown Line.</p>
              <p>In short, I think <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">(only
                  four)</span></span></strong> bus routes 66, 67, 170 and 171 can be
                  amended to skip - either entirely or mostly - Bukit Timah Road and
                  Dunearn Road. Bus route 960 can be amended to only ply between
                  Woodlands and Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the other bus routes, they should remain the same.
                  Bus services plying on the bus routes can operate at a lower
                  capacity, if the ridership falls.</p>

              <p>While I applaud you for the well-researched and well-analyzed loading data, I have to remind you that there are a lot more standees in trains than in DDs by ratio, and in reality we may not have that many commuters in a packed train (due to passenger sizes, bags, etc. taking up some space)</p>
              <p>Also you need to consider buses for the stops in-between as well, those travelling between these in-between stops and outside stops will most likely still rely on buses to get around.</p>
              <p>I'd be wary of cutting any routes that ply across Bt Panjang (as in, the part that follows DTL) as they still link with parts of (Upp) Bt Timah. Cutting them off would create a massive transfering crowd at Bt Panjang. Best to save some to ply the next few stations as well. So don't hurt 171 too much.</p>
              <p>On 960 ... you do realise that if you cut it at BPJ then it would be redundant and simply tracing 961 and 963? I'm not sure how many Woodlands residents require the link to the city / Lower Bt Timah (BPJ lots have 190, 700 and 972), but this is still quite a radical change. Better to wait and observe the actual loadings.</p>

              <p>When DTL opens, service 23's full DD will even have to extend
              all the way to Dover Bus Interchange, that is near to Singapore
              Polytechnic (2017) and will merge with 191 (2 buses). This will
              allow a cap and a new direct link between Portsdown Rd and MCE,
              that is provided if there is no downgrading of fleets. Service 65

              <p>As I have said before, I'm not concerned with 66 because much of its loading comes from Bukit Batok and Jurong East (mainly BB, to be exact), where DTL isn't there. You seem to have forgotten 48 which also has some sort of duplication with DTL2, but I think it's fine.</p>
              <p>And like what AJQZC has said, some services need to be there as "shuttle" services from MRT stations to various bus stops as well. There are already considerably huge crowds at Botanic Gardens MRT at times (most of them come from CCL).</p>

              <p>this reminds me of NEL rationalisation part 1. First create links to the new stations, the remove the long-haul routes that follow large sections of the train line. This time, however, it seems that most routes won't be touched.</p>

              <p>It will come in time. With the DTL in place, it is forseeable that demand will fall, and certain routes will get cut / made express due to route duplications (though of course not as bad as NEL, LTA's experienced that already). Just wait and see.</p>
