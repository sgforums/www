              <p>DDs on 851 is the solution but 851 loading has dropped. When I had sent note to LTA, it said 90% of buses had less than 60% occupancy of its loading limit. Now not sure if they calculate 60% on 90 pax basis or 60% on 70 pax basis. </p>
              <p>But first step should have been to deploy HC buses on 851. Clearly 851 loading is not that high since it is always the service that is chosen to downgrade. 851 in turn also has many alternatives along its route.</p>

              <p>They used to my friend. But DTL2 takes them to BPJ in 15-20 minutes and then they have many services to take for few stops. Peak hours I see 170 with less than 20 pax until it reaches BPJ MRT - this just shows DTL has taken its load.</p>
              <p>More so the perrenial jam at Newton Circus have even moved people from Little India to Newton to DTL2 even if it one MRT stop given the long time it takes to clear Newton Circus.</p>
              <p>This is on ground facts.</p>

              <p>Ah well, like SBS 9256X and TIB 585L mentioned above. Also
              witnessed a sizable number of commuters relying on 852 to commute

              <p>I don't believe. Sorry. People are just paranoid to change routes here because of their personal preference. If 852 is a backup service like everyone say, then it is the right service to rationalize as there are other "main" services whose capacity can be increased if required. </p>

              <p>I understand your sentiment that quite a number of suggestions given are unrealistic / impossible / neglects basic facts etc... but do realize that the purpose of this thread is precisely to discuss the (possible) details of any possible rationalisations, simply because there have been almost no (reasonable) rationalisations done ever since the NEL saga in 2003, and forumers like us are looking forward to the plans that could/would be implemented. <em>(In fact this was why you posted your suggested scheme here in the first place yesterday, no?) </em></p>
              <p>I mean, what is discussed here isn't going to be directly implemented by LTA anyway. There's a lot of forumers here, some with more logistical / bus-operational experience, some with less, this is just a platform for those with less understanding to get the comments and criticisms to understand how things are being done. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              Haven't LTA learnt from NEL rationalisation and 76/134?
              If 170 will be shorten, why they introduced 170A?

              <p>In fact i think 170A is simply rubbish. Can withdraw lah, and given also BusAnalayzer supported his stand for peak with only less than 20 pax, 170A fleet is rly wasting resources. </p>

              <p>Don't confuse. 76 and 134 is not case of rationalization. Can you explain how it is rationalization? It was a dumb decision for sure. 170A introduction has nothing to do with loading. It is to manage the fleet with the uncertainty of 170 at checkpoint.</p>
