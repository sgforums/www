              <p>It is also justified... if you just see how empty buses run in the Bukit Timah stretch... 67 in opposite direction from CCK to Little India usually has between 10-20 pax per bus... Likewise for other services such as 66, 170, 171 plying the stretch. Overall loading on 154, 157, 174, 961 etc. have also slipped in this stretch. If you purely look at loading, there is a strong justification to have some duplicating routes rationalized.</p>
              <p>I have someone working for me who used to take 48 to Farrer Road from Bugis. Now prefers to take DTL to Botanic Garden and switch to CCL as she is fed up with the traffic snarl at Newton Junction. She prefers to change than take a direct bus. Many such cases.</p>

              <p>I don't think terminating at BPJ is the right call. There are
              many takers from BPJ Road/Petir who take 171 to Upper Bukit Timah
              road. They will lose the connection. Beyond that there are almost
              no takers between BPJ town and Bukit Timah road. Hence, logical
              looping point should be Beauty World.</p>

              <p>There's also 75 and 184 from Bt Panjang to Upp Bt Timah via Cashew Rd, although they do not cover the sector along Upp Bt Timah btw BPJ and Cashew, which is served by 963. Overall, I think it's ok to shorten 171 to Bt Panjang, unless it's extended somewhere else to cover deleted sectors of other routes, or as a route 'enhancement'.</p>
              <p>As for withdrawing svc 700, parts of the route can be merged with 972, as follows:</p>
              <p>Bt Panjang - Senja/Segar/Fajar -Â <strong>Pending Rd - Petir Rd</strong>Â - BKE/PIE - Whitley/Stevens/Scotts Rd - Orchard Rd -Â <strong>Shenton Way on weekdays, Suntec on weekends</strong>Â (similar to current 700/A)</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The direct connection between Petir Rd and Bt Panjang would still need replacement, which can be covered by amending or extending existing svcs. Options include:</p>
              <p>- amending 75 or 184 to ply Petir Rd/Dairy Farm Rd instead of Cashew Rd/Upp Bt Timah Rd (one less bus svc for Cashew Rd)</p>

              <p>- amending 961 to Bt Panjang Rd - Petir Rd - BKE/PIE express - Eng Neo Ave - Bt Timah (lost sector along Upp Bt Timah, but faster journey for long distance travellers)</p>
              <p>- extending 180 or 983 into Bt Panjang, loop at Petir Rd, or loop around Chestnut Dr/Dairy Farm private estate (may not have demand for the latter)</p>

              <p>It's not ok to terminate 171 at BPJ. Minimally it should go all the way till Old Jurong Road where 852 turns off.Â  Otherwise travellers from Yishun will lose the connection to places like Assumption Pathway/English, Mindef, Hillview Camp / Gombak.</p>

              <p>If 171 is removed from Bukit Timah road, you need 700 to connect Dunearn road condos to Orchard road. Anyway, 700 gets quite a good loading even today from the condos between Stevens and Newton MRT towards Scotts/Orchard.</p>

              <p>I would have liked 700 to extend to CCK via Keat Hong estate to
                          provide direct Orchard connection between Keat Hong and Orchard. If
                          190/972 have been so popular as direct services inspite of DTL/NSL,
                          I am sure extended 700 would be very popular as well.</p>
              <p>700 can be shortened to Marina Center Terminal instead of
                          Shenton Way, replacing 171 there.Â </p>

              <p>Merge 700 with 983. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>Eventually we will have 983 (CCK-Shenton Way day service), 983A (CCK-BPJ after-hours and weekend loop service) and 700 (BPJ-Suntec City after hours and weekend service).Â </p>

              <p>302 is a feeder route while 83 is inter-town. If anything 83 is like 859.</p>
