            <div class='col-md body'><p>Depends, because not all blocks there are near to the station and it would be quite a walk to get to the bus stops. Those blocks near the mega bus stop are not always near to Kaki Bukit MRT. In fact, 60 would be the only bus left to get to Bedok from there. There are also a lot of passengers going towards the town (at least thats what I observed)</p></div>

              <p>Coincidentally, I have a Friend at Bedok Reservoir Road, and I visit her often, so I can comment on Bus Service 60.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>60 and 21 share the same route from Eunos MRT to Bedok Reservoir Road. A lot of people walk to the bus stop outside Eunos MRT to take the bus, instead of waiting for 60 at the bus interchange.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>But the return trip to Eunos MRT only have 60. I take that route many years already, so I know.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>There's a route 228 from Bedok that loops at the market area, at Bedok Reservoir Road. I understand it's already 10 kilometres long.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>Maybe we can shorten 228 a little, to ply a shorter route between Bedok Bus Interchange and Bedok Reservoir Road market, and then extend the route to Kaki Bukit MRT station, and then return back to Bedok Bus Interchange.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>21 is already very long, so I won't recommend extending it any longer.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>60 is actually a feeder to Eunos MRT station. Consider we can edit 228, I rather we edit 228 instead, and leave 60 alone. It's the only route from Bedok Reservoir Road that goes to Eunos MRT station, and those city-bound passengers would use 60 to connect to the MRT via Eunos station, as that is the shorter way.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>Anyway, if I'm not wrong, 228 duplicates many routes before coming to Bedok Reservoir Road market. Shortening it should be easy, and then we can re-route it to the nearby Kaki Bukit MRT station for connection to the Downtown Line.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>How about that?</p>
                                      
                                      <p>And, if I'm not wrong, very few people take 228 at Bedok Reservoir Road - Kaki Bukit area. Most of the loading come from the section along the Bedok Reservoir residential apartments (those that face the Reservoir). So, as you can see, 60 is actually more popular than 228 at Bedok Reservoir - Kaki Bukit area.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>If want reroute, reroute 228 instead, to Kaki Bukit MRT station.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>Leave 60 alone, please.</p>

                  <p>There's still demand for bus connection from Bedok Reservoir Road to Eunos MRT station, because Downtown Line does not connect to all places where East West Line connects. So, the demand for 60 should remain the same. In fact, I think it would only drop a little bit, maybe 30%.</p>

              <p>In fact, if you don't mind, I would recommend 60 and 228 do a mutual route swap, to make 228 shorter, so that we can extend it to loop at Kaki Bukit MRT station.</p>

                                                                  <p>60 ply 228's route from Bedok Bus Interchange to Bedok Reservoir Road market area (Eunos CC), via the Bedok Reservoir condominiums.</p>
                                                                  
                                                                  <p>In fact, 60 extension to the other part of Bedok Reservoir Road would enhance connections. The route can also take this opportunity to loop around Bedok MRT station, instead of going into Bedok Bus Interchange. Many new community amenities would be launched at Bedok North area, so an amendment like this would really enhance the intra-town connection between Bedok Reservoir Road and Bedok Town Centre.</p>
                                                                  
                                                                  <p>228 on the other hand can take this opportunity to ply the Bedok Reservoir Road market area in both directions, to make things easier for the bus driver. With a shorter route, it can afford to ply additional mileage to the upcoming Kaki Bukit MRT station.</p>
                                                                  
                                                                  <p>Furthermore, 60 is a trunk and 228 is a feeder. 60 is considered average, whereas 228 is considered long. It would be appropriate to make 60 longer, and make 228 shorter. I mean, that should be the way, right? Why is it that the feeder run a longer route than the trunk, from Bedok Bus Interchange to Bedok Reservoir Road. It doesn't make it sense.</p>
                                                          
                                                          <p>So, yeah, that's what I recommend, to provide that connection between Downtown Line and Bedok Reservoir Road. I hope the relevant parties would consider all pros and cons carefully before arriving at a decision.</p>

              <p>Retain 60, amend 228 to ply KB MRT before heading to Eunos CC. There is 66 throughout 228's entire route except for its looping point. So the pair of bus stops 228 missed is already covered.</p>
              <p>Also, Eunos CC is a quick way to reach Chai Chee Industrial Est. It beats squeezing into 222 and heading to Bedok especially if you are going north-bound.</p>
              <p>Another part to take note is that at that Eunos CC area, 228 have very bad loading compared to the rest of its route. By amending it to KB MRT, it gives Eunos CC area connection to DTL3 without resorting to travel to Ubi/Bedok Nth. It will also complement 5/59 partially towards KB.</p>
