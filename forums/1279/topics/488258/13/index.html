              <p><br> Even numerous transfers will not take more than 20 minutes (which
                  is the time wasted on DTL1 - 10 stops from Rochor to Jalan Besar!).
                  Personally I know some people commuting between DTL2 and future
                  DTL3, and they already complain about how windy DTL is. They would
                  probably not prefer a direct route even when DTL3 is in
                  operation.</p>

              <p>DTL3 commuters are going to be disappointed. There is no direct transfer from DTL3 to prominent places such as Orchard and Bugis, and this hinders any progress in DTL rationalisation. Thus we may end up seeing most commuters transfer to buses at Jln Besar or Bencoolen instead.</p>

              <p>Some Bedok Reservoir Rd services can be diverted to Jln Damai, Kaki Bukit Ave 1 and Jln Tenaga. In this way no bus stops will be skipped and the only drawback is 5 mins of additional traveling time. 228 does seem like a good choice.</p>

              <p>518 highest loading is during weekday peak hours and also Saturdays,Sundays so so la..But dont be suprised to see fully seated Citaros after 9.30am too.The service can sustain le else you will see LTA withdrawn long time ago..You know some commuters they prefer to pay extra to take express which guranteed them seats and also bus stop skippings.In fact i support if LTA make 513 full day service..I dont really mind the 18-25 mins off peak freq too.</p>

              <ul>
              <li><strong>DT21 Bencoolen</strong>: At least one more service westbound / southwestbound (e.g, to Orchard, aside from 65). Can be a short trunk starting from Queen St Term.

              <li><strong>DT22 Jalan Besar</strong>: Could use a bus stop for northbound bus services. Currently there's only 23 to loop around to Serangoon Rd.

              <li><strong>DT23 Bendemeer</strong>: Decently close to Bendeemer Rd bus stop, but not to Serangoon Rd bus stops. Would be good to have more services along Kallang Bahru going northbound and possibly passing over to Boon Keng MRT station.</li>

              <li><strong>DT24 Geylang Bahru</strong>: The services expressing along PIE (5, 59, 506) can stop at the bus stops near here. Depending on need, can include 518 / other premium services as well.<br></li>
              <li> </li>
              <li><strong>DT25 Mattar</strong>: 125 can make an additional loop here. Also can have a new service to link to Potong Pasir estate / future Bidadari Int.<br></li>
              <li> <br></li>
              <li><strong>DT27 Ubi</strong>: Extend either one of the services along Eunos Link to detour into Ubi Ave 3 / Rd 3 / Ave 2 to improve connections, perhaps to Hougang Ave 3 or Bedok.

              <p>Really? Have you tried walking from Bedok Reservoir MRT (or, its would-be location) to Bedok North Ave 1/4? From Tampines East MRT to the inner areas of Tampines Ave 9, St 43/44/45? Even if you are very able-bodied, how confident can you say that your views represent all / majority of the residents in those areas?</p>

              <p>Actually I have to agree of what he says. Tampines East MRT is near to Tampines MRT although I got no idea where is exactly the station. From there, you have 293/28 to take you there to those streets. You want less walking, alight at Tampines MRT instead. From there, you even have 72/72A waiting for you at the int to Tampines Ave 9</p>
              <p>For Bedok Reservoir MRT, I understand as the walking distance is far and there is no way that the DTL can take you back to Bedok. However, I would consider if you take 60 from Bedok North MRT where the route would DIRECTLY bring you to Bedok North Ave 1. To get to Bedok North Rd/Ave 4, I dont really suppose if 17 should make a loop at Tampines Int like how 3 loops at Pasir Ris Int. Like that people can alight at Tampines MRT and take 17 from there or from Tampines Ave 7 where 17 is there as well. To Bedok Street 3, people should just go walk instead. Its not like it takes 5 blocks to get to the street</p>
