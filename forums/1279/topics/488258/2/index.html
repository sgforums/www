              <p>how can you merge 66 and 67?? they have different routes from
                  Little India towards Bedok/Tampines? 66 still can be cut because of
                  65 and 228 but 67 is unique and needs to remain.</p>
              <p>As earlier proposed, 67 can be split into two services: Tampines
                  - Middle road, and CCK - Lor 1.</p>

              <p>Then again you can continue it a little further and end the eastern half of the service at Marina Centre. Especially if 171 is truncated.</p>
              <p>Do agree that 67 between Tampines and Bedok MRT is rather unique, but after which it follows the MRT all the way to Lavender after that, backed up by several other buses.</p>

              <p>I don't think the rationalisation will be as much as before when the NEL or NSL/EWL opened. Rather, LTA will likely monitor the loading for various svcs for at least a few months, before deciding on changes.</p>
              <p>190, 700, 960, 971E and 972 are likely to remain with lower frequencies/ less high capacity buses. Each of them serve unique catchment areas then aren't directly served by DTL2 (CCK for 190, Petir Rd for 700, Woodlands/ Woodlands Rd for 960, Fajar/Segar/Senja for 971E/972), and commuters to theses areas would likely prefer taking these direct buses. 700's loading would probably drop the most, but should still remain.</p>
              <p>66 and 67 have important links on their other sectors (JE - Beauty World and Bedok - Bedok Res./Eunos for 66, CCK - BPJ/Upp BT Rd, Rochor - Geylang, Bedok - Tampines for 67) which would likely remain. Still, 66 duplicates the future DTL3 between Jln Besar and Bedok Reservoir, and that section may also be affected. They could be split and/or shortened in future.</p>
              <p>961 route is very long but most of the other sectors provide important links, e.g. Woodlands - BPJ/UPP BT Rd, Queensway - Bt Merah - Chinatown. Since loading between BPJ and SAV/TKK is likely to drop, could be made semi-express, via BKE/PIE, though depends on loading changes.</p>
              <p>170 would still provide an important link to Woodlands Checkpoint/JB, though most of its route duplicates DTL2 from Queen St (Rochor MRT) to BPJ, and loading is likely to drop a lot. Can also be made semi-express, possibly extended from Queen St to Marina South ITH in future.</p>
              <p>171's link between Yishun and BPJ would remain, but BPJ - Marina Ctr duplicates DTL2 and NSL, loading likely to drop a lot. May be shortened to BPJ or amended to terminate at CCK or BBT.</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Other routes with short duplicating sectors would probably be unaffected, loading may even go up due to connections to DTL2 MRT. More new routes could be introduced connecting to the MRT stns:</p>
              <p>Beauty World - Toh Guan/ Jurong East (41)</p>
              <p>Bt Panjang - CCK West/ Keat Hong (983, future)</p>
              <p>Bt Panjang - Yew Tee, Sungei Kadut (preferably via Woodlands Rd, instead of 983 further extension)</p>
              <p>Hillview - Petir Rd/ other private estates, possibly Fajar/Segar/Senja (via Dairy Farm Rd)</p>

              <p><br> I would not like to see sv 67 cut short to Bedok... Currently the
              bus stop at Bedok MRT outside Bedok Mall is always crowded, and all
              services have a lot of pax boarding here. You can see a lot of
              people taking sv 28 and 67 towards Bedok North Ave 3 (although I'm
              not really sure where they're alighting), where you can see bendies
              on 67 packed to the door and people cannot board. If sv 67 is
              removed, I don't know how sv 28 alone can handle that... While a
              lot of other services from Bedok Int also go to Ave 3, I don't know
              why many people still choose 28 and 67 (maybe for
              convenience?).</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, sv 67 is still the most convenient service for a lot
              of Bedok North residents to go to Geylang, Little India etc.
              Although DTL may be faster, there will be people who do not want to
              make so many transfers and walk for a long distance, and as long as
              DTL3 only calls at Jalan Besar (which is sadly not an
              interchange), there will be people who don't want to walk from
              there... And once again, you cannot force everyone to board the
              tiny 3-car trains on DTL.</p>

              <p>67 passenger might be dropping some where near the bedok reservoir road where is new the condo and hdb flats is or futher near the tampines safara. maybe not merging together as both different bus company but 66 and 65 might get cut as it belong to sbst. so left 67 remain as it is. but service like 8 65 23 64 66 even 61 might somehow be cut or amended. i think most of the sbst bus service will be amended. again by then if the operator is still sbst. that DTL3 open. DTL2 open i don't think many bus services will get cut or amended as most of them belong to SMRT.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, as sv 66 is surprisingly in Bulim package which results in serious dead mileage, is this because LTA already has some plans to amend or shorten sv 66, therefore it is in Bulim package unlike other long-haul services?</p>

              <p>852 may not go that easily, had in the past been filed for withdrawal but declined ... the main loading is between the schools along Bt Timah Rd and the two termini, especially Bt Batok (even with 66, 157, 174 plying alongside it). There may instead be amendments to the route, such as Sin Ming Rd, Sembawang Rd or BBT East Ave 4 etc. Don't know, will see how it goes.</p>
              <p>171 at Mandai serve different passengers than 180, and 180 loading is likely to increase when DTL2 opens, so I don't think it's a good idea to have full fleet bendys running about. Merging with 172 to Boon Lay with some express parts at Old CCK Rd may be useful, but the route would still be 30+ km. Still best to cut it to Bt Panjang, or at most combine with 177 to Bt Batok.</p>
              <p>As for 184, the crowd is rather considerable ... have you considered alternatives 75 and 970?</p>

              <p>171 will be the most affected for sure. 66 and 67 could feel the pinch. Other services could see capacity downgrades. The only untouched one will be 170, which could serve as the rail replacement anchor.</p>
              <p> After DTL3 opens there could be big changes to 65 and 66. By then the GCM model would be in full swing too.</p>
              <p>for now I'd say some Dunearn services will be affected. It's inevitable.</p>

              loading is likely to increase when DTL2 opens, so I don't think
              it's a good idea to have full fleet bendys running about. Merging
              with 172 to Boon Lay with some express parts at Old CCK Rd may be
              useful, but the route would still be 30+ km. Still best to cut it
              to Bt Panjang, or at most combine with 177 to Bt Batok.</p>
              <p>As for 184, the crowd is rather considerable ... have you
              considered alternatives 75 and 970?</p>

              <p>852 can be cut short after DTL2 opens. Current loading also just about okay. There is 157 in parallel all the way from Macritchie to Bukit Batok. 157 can be diverted via Upper Jurong road. 66, 174 will still cover Jurong Kechill. </p>
              <p>852 instead can be diverted via Yishun ring road to loop around Macritchie reservoir. 74 will be parallel from AMK Ave 3 junction all the way to Clementi road junction. </p>

              <p>Agreed. But let me correct you on sv 70. The buses got added /
              upgrades were done due to the NEX / Seletar Hills sector where new
              HDBs were completed and there was a sudden surge in loading.</p>
              <p>Even now, sv 70 gets 80+ pax in AM towards NEX... between NEX
              and Guillemard road, loading is around 30-50 pax.. not more.. again
              loading picks up at Guillemard road for Shenton Way / CBD where you
              again see DDs get full. </p>
              <p>So 70 not really mimicks CCL except for the middle part of its
              route, which is the lowest loading point for the service. </p>
              <p>93 did lose its DDs after CCL. Similarly 165 lost its high
              loading after CCL. Before CCL, 165 was a super high loading
              service. So services are bound to get affected.</p>
              <p>I don't think LTA will directly cut services but some like 171
              that do not have huge loading today might get truncated. Also some
              services might get few downgrades.</p>

              <p>Make sense to split 171 because it is a rather long route.</p>
              <p>66/67 changes must wait for DTL3. I think 67 &amp; 41 can merge when that leg of DTL is operational. Then 66 become DTL anchor.</p>
              <p>170 maybe can convert to limited stop service between city and Beauty World. After that all stops as per normal.</p>
