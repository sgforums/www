              <p>Little India to Bukit Panjang by DTL2 is <strong>20
              mins</strong> only (this is official on MRT time card).</p>
              <p>Consider how long it takes for 170 from Little India to Bukit
              Panjang - <strong>50-60 mins</strong> depending on congestion
              around Newton Circus.</p>
              <p>Now it is for you to decide how do the workers travel. Do they
              take DTL2 or do 170 all the way to Woodlands Checkpoint which is
              1.5 hours in bus. </p>
              <p>99% would take DTL2 from Little India and transfer to 170/178 at
              BPJ MRT.</p>
              <p>Weekends I don't know because I don't observe. It is purely
              family time. But weekdays it is around 20 pax during off peak and
              peak hours.</p>
              <p>Why don't you take 170 one of the evenings to try it yourself?
              also take into consideration if there is 961/67/171/178 in front...
              and how many minutes before is the earlier 170. </p>

              <p>Problem is the duplication with any of the other services if we try to amend or cut 170 in any way.</p>
              <p>Cutting 170 to BPJ would result in redundancy due to 160/178. (160 can just make an extra loop around BPJ)</p>
              <p>Letting 170 run express between BPJ/Dairy Farm and Stevens would mean duplicating 960.</p>
              <p>Withdrawing 170 altogether is probably not going to do well with the public.</p>
              <p>It's a dilemma ... then again considering the routes, if we suppose that 171 and 700 would be axed and 67 (probably) split, is it realistic to assume that 170 will take some of the pax along the way?</p>
              <p>Also may have to consider the effect of 48 and 66 along the lower stretches.</p>

              <p>And there is 178/961... together all of them don't even have
                  standees along Upper Bukit Timah until they hit BPJ where the

              <p>I am not saying there are no takers for these buses along Upper
                  Bukit Timah but when there are 3 services in parallel... the
                  loading is distributed to around 20 pax/bus during peak hours. If a
                  bus is late, loading will be better on the bus that comes
                  first. </p>

              <p>The loading you have described till BPJ MRT is one off... I have
              been in the area off late as I have two projects... and I haven't
              seen any 170 bus with even standees during peak hours... There are
              in fact many with less than 20 pax... Hence, the above loading is

              <p>Well, an average KUB have about 29/30 seats. </p>
              <p>Excluding a few who stands on the bus + yourself, there's hardly any chance where you will board the bus and is able to<strong> find a seat or a pair of seat. </strong></p>
              <p>Although I admit I rode 170/170A occasionally, I didn't insist it's the exact true representative. Diff. days diff. loadings, so it's kinda reasonable to say that your observations might not be true either, right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If you really do that, you will realize 80% of bus services in Singapore are having SD loading or even running empty during off-peak hours. Then some people will say every service should only have SDs during off-peak...</p>

              <p>Hi mr CZT, I don't think so. What one person observes will be different from another person. Basically it depends on the timing. A bus service does not warrant amending or cutting just based on few observations. Services like 170 are notorious for average to high loading throughout the past years. There are many other bus services with poorer loadings than 170. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I still think the best proposal regarding 700 is to extend to CCK via Keat Hong, so that residents there get a direct service to Orchard. But seems that it's unlikely under LTA, plus CCK already has no space.</p>
              <p>Terminating 67 East at Queen St is probably not a good idea because 1) Queen St may not have sufficient space and too many Malaysian buses there; 2) 67's link to Little India MRT is best to be maintained.</p>

              <p>Pls la, bus services don't exist to duplicate MRT lines, that would be a waste of resources. During MRT breakdowns (which is NOT a frequent occurence) there will be free shuttle buses.</p>
              <p>It's still best to rationalise based on optimized resource distribution.</p>

              <p>DTL3 is somewhat a special case due to it having too few interchanges with existing lines, hence effective MRT transfers cannot occur and buses will still be needed. Overall more likely to have route rationalisations on DTL2 than DTL3.</p>
              <p>Though it's quite likely that we'll see fleet downgrades on some of the heavily duplicated routes (22, 65, 66).</p>
