              <p>I just realised that if I use my phone to comment, the font size becomes huge. If I use my computer to comment, the font size is normal. LOL.</p>
              <p>Anyway back to the topic. Yes, I admit that Bedok estate in general already has many bus services. But I don't only look at the quantity of bus services. I also look at where the services go to and the time it takes to reach my desired destination.</p>
              <p>In Bedok, many bus services go to places not served by other routes (e.g. 17 to Bedok North Ave 4, 32 to Frankel Ave, 33 to Joo Chiat, 35 to Tanah Merah ferry terminal, 40 to Siglap Rd, etc). These routes are designed to maximise coverage and connect to MRT lines so they are not practical for long-distance trips. There are a few "expressway" services like 45, 168, 506 and CT18, but the frequency is bad (with the exception of 168).</p>
              <p>In the end, the <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">MRT is still the fastest way to travel from Bedok to most places. But not everyone likes the MRT because the MRT is often crowded (esp at Bedok, Kembagan and Eunos stations on EWL) and not very reliable due to frequent delays and breakdowns. DTL3 will definitely help to alleviate the situation on EWL, but DTL3 doesn't go to where I want to go. (I work in Jurong West, so I'm stuck with the crowded EWL or the infrequent svc 506 + 174.) In theory, from next month I can take 137, change to DTL3 at Bedok North, change to CCL at MacPherson, and change to EWL at Buona Vista, but it's too troublesome, and very likely I have to stand up for most of the journey.</span></p>

              <p>Not all of these pertain to DTL modifications. Here are my views.</p>
              <p><strong>973 &amp; 176</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No</span>; the services serve completely different routes, impossible to merge; along with fleet restrictions on 973. (75 &amp; 973 may be a more likely pair, though that would cause an awkward and long route that will be difficult to optimize.)</p>
              <p><strong>7 &amp; 69</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No</span>; the services cater to different demands &amp; a merger would definitely be too long (~30km).</p>
              <p><strong>135 &amp; 47</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Maybe</span>. Downside is the loss of the loop at Amber which may irk some commuters.</p>
              <p><strong>40</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No</span> ... don't see the point of shortening and the loss of links to Geylang / Mattar.</p>
              <p><strong>16</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Possible</span> but not quite necessary. 16 itself is winding enough as it is, plus a detour via Joo Chiat makes it indirect; adding the detour would slow it down further.</p>
              <p><strong>171 &amp; 944</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Maybe</span>, but the loss of links to Upp Bt Timah / Beauty World is an issue. I wouldn't support if there are better alternatives (such as 171 &amp; 41)</p>
              <p><strong>151</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No point</span> if there's no demand.</p>
              <p><strong>122</strong>:  <span style="color: #339966;">Can</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>190 &amp; 700</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Maybe</span>, but there'll be a need for a service to cover either Stevens Rd or Dunearn / Bt Timah Rd. There's a reason why both 190 &amp; 700 still have high demand (and 700 has not been withdrawn up till now).</p>
              <p><strong>62, 857, 970</strong>:  <span style="color: #339966;">Can</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>64 &amp; 111</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Not sure</span>, I'd be careful of disrupting links from Bt Merah to Serangoon Rd.</p>
