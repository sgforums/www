                                  <p>I am sorry if the suggestion I made about 178 and 180 did not resonate well with your expectations. As much as we all want to contribute something useful to the forum, not everyone can observe bus routes all the time.</p>

              <p>I remember when 170A was introduced (the same day when DTL2 opened), people were saying 170A is SBST's measure to ensure there are enough buses in BPJ area in case DTL2 breaks down.</p>
              <p>So, as long as 170 remains as the only SBST service in BPJ, I don't forsee it being shortened unless LTA/SBST don't mind asking SMRT for shuttle buses (which may still be troublesome even with BCM). An alternative solution is to have 170M from Bukit Panjang to Larkin while reducing the frequency of 170 full route, but it will make 170's route way too confusing with 170X, 170M, 170A etc.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A number of bus routes at Upper Bukit Timah Road come from Woodlands (160, 170, 178, 960, 961). If we split the Woodlands section of those routes and consolidate them into one or two bus routes that loop around DTL Bukit Panjang or Cashew station, I'm pretty sure this would optimise resources. Maybe that's why there are plans to create a new bus terminal at DTL Gali Batu depot, although a better location is somewhere around Cashew station. (In the first place, where's the official information from LTA that say that there will be a new bus terminal at DTL Gali Batu depot? The information on the contractor's letter to residents may not be accurate.)</p></div>

              <p>That wouldn't be ideal. There are lot of people who take 170 from BPJ, YT and Mandai Estate to JB. The best option is: Bukit Panjang &lt;&gt; Larkin. There are many who take DTL2 and will transfer to 170 at BPJ. </p>

              <p>Or, why not extend 160 to Larkin and make it loop once around
              BPJ? Then 170 can be made semi-express (or simply withdrawn,

              <p>Frm the discussions above, i think why not just strip 170 all
              the way up to start frm kranji? Thats where all the loading come
              frm. But first we need a proper bus ter there, if not they will
              mess up the kranji bus stop. In this case, can just retain the red
              plate route to malaysia, remove 170X and 160 (since no one takes
              buses to jb sentral, but if u observe otherwise do share it :)

              170 can stay as it is for the purpose of rail replacement, just like 2 in the east.

              <p>The loading you have described till BPJ MRT is one off... I have been in the area off late as I have two projects... and I haven't seen any 170 bus with even standees during peak hours... There are in fact many with less than 20 pax... Hence, the above loading is not a true representative. </p>
