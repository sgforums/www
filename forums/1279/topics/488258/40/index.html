              <p>Of course I am aware of that. The relatively few changes that followed the opening of CCL and DTL did surprise me somewhat. However, I have observed reduced capacity on a few routes during my few trips back to Singapore.</p>
              <p>I have travelled on the CCL between BNV and PYL. Ridership was fairly strong.</p>

              <p>The trend is that passengers on service 170 are most likely either go to Woodlands Checkpoint, Kranji or CBD. Nowhere else. Hence the alternative is 960 or 961. 67, 960 and 961 can then have compensations but will enjoy more double deckers on 960.</p>

              <p>IIRC 852 loading is only high in the morning, but not entirely sure for the evening, but off peak definitely is low. Reason being many sch students take the direct bus to reach their respective schools, all the way from amk to bukit timah stretch, in a way helping 851 reducing its load since it is always very high. If im not wrong, 852 is popular because it links bukit timah directly from yishun without having the need to transfer 2 times on the train.</p>
              <p>Well this perspective is coming from a Yishun resident who has lived there for many years and makes use of most of its trunk routes to commute to sch, work, and leisure so it may be biased</p>
              <p>Side note: if any of the yishun routes need to be cut, i think first think abt 853 and 855. These 2 are way too insanely long</p>

              <p>Bus 171 should be truncated as per what you have said or extend to a terminal near BPJ. This bus experiences low demand along the DTL2 Corridor and is already covered by 67/170 fully from Bukit Panjang to Newton. Low demand sector is also between Orchard and Marina Centre which is covered by Bus 36 (A&amp;B), 77, 106, 111, 162M, 502 (A), 518 (A). Many other bus services ply between Orchard and City Hall, relieving Bus 171 massively. Missing link between Dunearn Road and Orchard Road / Bras Basah Road covered by Bus 700. With this Bus 700 can stay.</p>
              <p>Bus 151 can ply another routing maybe via one-north Station and Kent Ridge Station or via Science Park Dr and Portsdown Ave, relieving demand on Bus 92/95. Missing link between Clementi Road (Southern part) and King Albert Park should be covered by a new bus service plying from BPJ to JE?</p>
              <p>Bus 852 generally has lower demand than compared to Bus 74/157 as people prefer Bus 52 express on PIE? Maybe Bus 852 should be amended away from the DTL2 Corridor and maybe go via Northern Singapore instead, possibly relieving demand on Bus 856 and more.</p>

              <p>It is interesting how different people have different perspectives. </p>
              <p>I wouldn't touch 853 or 855 as both have unique routes and do not duplicate. 853 may have low loading just like 852 but if you take it out, who will cover? 852 on the other hand has so many services in parallel.</p>
              <p>855 on the other hand has a good decent 50-60 pax loading and off-peak loading is not bad too. Why would you even touch it? </p>
              <p>AMK to Bukit Timah is already covered by 74 with a superb frequency and DDs. Yishun to Marymount is covered by 851. You may observed higher loading on 852 at certain times if it comes before 851. But on average 851 by itself can tank the load. Hopefully 851 will be treated better with SBS taking over and that should take care of the pax. </p>

              <p>No real need for 170. 67 runs parallel to DTL all along 170 route from Rochor to BPJ. If DTL breakdown, anyway SBS has to supplement additional buses. 67 is the back up, not to mention there are still a lot of other services running along BT/UBT corridor.</p>
