              <p>Agreed with optimisation of Woodlands Rd services (although most
                  of them now have greater demand towards BPJ MRT). In fact I don't
                  understand why 178 is designed this way...</p>
              <p>961 can remain as it is, in the event that 960 is truncated or
                  amended. 178 I feel needs amendments or splitting.</p>

              <p>I feel 178B would be better - serve from Kranji MRT to WL Checkpoint and erase that stretch of road for 178 at Woodlands Road (Fire Station/Domitory Area) so that it can go to ave 3 first then straight to marsilling drive without any interruptions caused by the causeway jam.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying it should skip the checkpoint stretch. That stretch of road isn't nice when it starts to jam and would take a longer time to travel to Boon Lay Interchange and I have seen alot of SLs slamming on the accelerators hard so that it could reach interchange on time and I have seen 1317R arriving late for its last bus duty before.</p>

              <p>Yes that would be good enough. From Bukit Batok to Jurong East you already have sv 66 following the same route. From Jurong East to AYE/Taman Jurong you have sv 49. Though some may argue that 178 goes to Corporation Rd, in reality people along Corporation Rd walk to Corporation Dr to take bus as 178 is the only service and absolutely unreliable.</p>
              <p>A short trunk service can be introduced between Boon Lay and Taman Jurong if required to cover missing link of Corporation Rd but not specifically required as sv 30/79/246 can continue to do the job.</p>

              <p>The issue is that the stretch of Corporation Rd (between Corporation Dr and International Rd) is currently only served by 178. Cutting it backwards from Boon Lay Int is undesirable at this point.</p>
              <p>A solution to support the cutback of 178 would be to amend an existing bus service from Corporation Dr (i.e. 30, 49, 98, 98M, 240 or 246) to Corporation Rd, but let's analyze their importance one by one:</p>
              <p><strong>- 30: </strong>Currently the fastest route between Boon Lay Int and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr. With such high demand, diverting it to Corporation Rd is undesirable.<br><strong>- 49: </strong>A possible bus service to divert to Corporation Rd with the availability of 98, 98M, 240 and 246, but would that have defeated its purpose of having to complement the above services? Maybe.<br><strong>- 98/98M: </strong>Currently the most convenient and complete route between Lakeside MRT and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr (49 only covers part of Corporation Dr). With its importance in connection, diverting it to Corporation Rd is undesirable as well.<br><strong>- 240: </strong>Plays a supplementary role between Lakeside MRT and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr and is currently the only service plying Kang Ching Rd. It is undoubtedly an important route along Corporation Dr as well, given that a short working trip has to be operated every weekday morning to complement its demand.<br><strong>- 246: </strong>Plays a supplementary role between Lakeside MRT and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr and is the fastest route between Lakeside MRT and Tah Ching Rd. It may not be as important as the other services above in Corporation Dr, but by diverting it to Corporation Rd will mean skipping Lakeside MRT, which is a critical transfer point for the residents of Taman Jurong and Boon Lay Gardens.</p>
              <p>Another solution will be to introduce a new service to cover the secluded stretch of Corporation Rd and connect it to Boon Lay, Jurong East and Bukit Batok. However, given that demand along this stretch isn't really high for 178 already, will operating a new service along that stretch even be desirable?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>The issue is that the stretch of Corporation Rd (between
              Corporation Dr and International Rd) is currently only served by
              178. Cutting it backwards from Boon Lay Int is undesirable at this
              point.</p>
              <p>A solution to support the cutback of 178 would be to amend an
              existing bus service from Corporation Dr (i.e. 30, 49, 98, 98M, 240
              or 246) to Corporation Rd, but let's analyze their importance one
              by one:</p>
              <p><strong>- 30:</strong> Currently the fastest route between Boon
              Lay Int and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr. With such
              high demand, diverting it to Corporation Rd is undesirable.<br> <strong>- 49:</strong> A possible bus service to divert to
              Corporation Rd with the availability of 98, 98M, 240 and 246, but
              would that have defeated its purpose of having to complement the
              above services? Maybe.<br> <strong>- 98/98M:</strong> Currently the most convenient and
              complete route between Lakeside MRT and the residential blocks
              along Corporation Dr (49 only covers part of Corporation Dr). With
              its importance in connection, diverting it to Corporation Rd is
              undesirable as well.<br> <strong>- 240:</strong> Plays a supplementary role between Lakeside
              MRT and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr and is
              currently the only service plying Kang Ching Rd. It is undoubtedly
              an important route along Corporation Dr as well, given that a short
              working trip has to be operated every weekday morning to complement
              its demand.<br> <strong>- 246:</strong> Plays a supplementary role between Lakeside
              MRT and the residential blocks along Corporation Dr and is the
              fastest route between Lakeside MRT and Tah Ching Rd. It may not be
              as important as the other services above in Corporation Dr, but by
              diverting it to Corporation Rd will mean skipping Lakeside MRT,
              which is a critical transfer point for the residents of Taman
              Jurong and Boon Lay Gardens.</p>
              <p>Another solution will be to introduce a new service to cover the
              secluded stretch of Corporation Rd and connect it to Boon Lay,
              Jurong East and Bukit Batok. However, given that demand along this
              stretch isn't really high for 178 already, will operating a new
              service along that stretch even be desirable?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It basically impacts only 2 bus stops along Corporation Road. There is a workaround. There are many services that connect Lakeside MRT to Taman Jurong Estate in different parts including 49, 98, 154, 240, 246. </p>
              <p>246 can be amended to ply Corporation Road in both directions, yet not affecting commuters in a big way.</p>
              <p>Boon Lay &gt;&gt; Quality Road &gt;&gt; Jalan Tukang &gt;&gt; Corporation Road &gt;&gt; Corporation Dr &gt;&gt; Tah Ching Road &gt;&gt; Yuan Ching Road &gt;&gt; Lakeside MRT &gt;&gt; Corporation Road &gt;&gt; Jalan Tukang &gt;&gt; Quality Road &gt;&gt; Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>* This will not upset current users + service still plies Tah Ching Road.</p>
              <p>* Also provides nearest MRT connection to Corporation Road / industrial estates.</p>
              <p>* The missing link of Boon Lay Place is covered by sv 240 + if they agree to extend sv 52 as per my proposed route.</p>

              <p>10 months on DTL2 has passed with only minimal rationalisation (170A, 173, 563, 979, 983).</p>
              <p>Therefore it may be unlikely that DTL3 gets major changes (probably not even much fleet downgrades either). Sigh.</p>

              <ul>

              <li><strong>DT27 Ubi</strong>: Extend either one of the services along Eunos Link to detour into Ubi Ave 3 / Rd 3 / Ave 2 to improve connections, perhaps to Hougang Ave 3 or Bedok.
