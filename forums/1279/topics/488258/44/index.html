              <p>21 is an alternative to 60 at Eunos MRT, because they both ply the same route from Eunos MRT to Bedok Reservoir Road.</p>

              <p>But, seriously, I donâ€™t think DTL3 would have any impact on 60.</p>
                              
                              <p>As I have said, people at Telok Kurau still have to take 60 to/fro Eunos MRT as there is no bus service to Kaki Bukit MRT; that MRT is as good as donâ€™t have. Unless they are willing to walk, but forget about it during rainy day, as thereâ€™s limited shelter at that area.</p>
                              
                              <p>About Bedok North MRT, the impact on 60 to/fro Eunos MRT should be minimal as the commuters at that section use 60 to connect to/fro Bedok MRT. It is the Bedok MRT section that may be affected, but then again, it depends on the usefulness of the Downtown Line.</p>
                              
                              <p>If the Downtown Line connects to more places than the East West Line, then the Bedok section of 60 would be affected. Else, not much difference.</p>

              <p>Whereas for 21, the loading may be affected, considering it follows the Downtown Line alignment from Kaki Bukit / Bedok North to Tampines East.</p>
                  
                  <p>Seriously, the bus connectivity to the Downtown Line at Kaki Bukit and Bedok North stations could be better. Is it because that place is under Workers Party thatâ€™s why they refuse to provide a good connection to those MRT stations, and make 137 wind above the Bedok Reservoir Road residential area?</p>
                  
                  <p>Or is it because they have plans to shorten 66 to loop at Kaki Bukit MRT, as mentioned earlier?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I think 137 should have diverted via Bedok North Road, Bedok North Avenue 4, Upper Changi Road, Upper Changi Link, Upper Changi Road East, Expo Drive and Changi South Avenue 1 to CBP.</p>
              <p>60 should take over part of 137 as a result since there is service 87 and is worth duplicating like 8/18.</p>

              <p>Wild idea for DTL3 rationalisation: <strong>cut 22</strong>.</p>
              <p>(Summary)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>- Cut <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">22</span></strong> east of Bedok North Rd, and make it <span style="color: #3366ff;">travel down 137's current route</span>. (There is DTL3 duplicating all the way up to Tai Seng.) </li>
              <li>- Let <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">65</span></strong> (or 21, if 65 is used for other DTL3 adjustments) replace lost sectors at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tampines Ave 4</span>. </li>
              <li>- Then amend <strong><span style="color: #008000;">137</span></strong> from Bedok North Rd to <span style="color: #008000;">travel down 229's route</span> and then terminate at UEC. </li>
              <li>- Withdraw 229, and let <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>7</strong></span> bridge the lost link from Bedok Int to Chai Chee. (Other Bedok Int services have erratic frequencies)<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This reduces the redundancy between Tampines &amp; Bedok Reservoir Rd, retains most of 137 and 229's route in Bedok while bringing DTL3 connection to Chai Chee and Bedok South Rd. (Quip: we can also get 2/22/222 at Bedok MRT bus stops!)</p>
              <p>Fleetwise, can let 137 continue with full SD, while 22 can downgrade but still retain some DDs.</p>
              <p>Obvious downside is 137's lost connection to Bedok MRT (so commuters from Kaki Bukit will have to transfer)</p>
              <p>Minor downside is loss of links between Bedok Int / South Rd &amp; South Ave 3 / Temasek Pri &amp; Sec Sch. Link to Bedok Central is still covered by 25.</p>

              <p>Wild idea for DTL3 rationalisation: <strong>cut 22</strong>.</p>
              <p>(Summary)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>- Cut <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">22</span></strong> east of Bedok North Rd, and make it <span style="color: #3366ff;">travel down 137's current route</span>. (There is
              DTL3 duplicating all the way up to Tai Seng.)</li>
              <li>- Let <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">65</span></strong> (or 21, if 65 is used for other DTL3 adjustments) replace lost
              sectors at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tampines Ave
              4</span>.</li>
              <li>- Then amend <strong><span style="color: #008000;">137</span></strong> from Bedok North Rd to
              <span style="color: #008000;">travel down 229's route</span> and
              then terminate at UEC.</li>
              <li>- Withdraw 229, and let <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>7</strong></span> bridge the lost link
              from Bedok Int to Chai Chee. (Other Bedok Int services have erratic
              frequencies)<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This reduces the redundancy between Tampines &amp; Bedok
              Reservoir Rd, retains most of 137 and 229's route in Bedok while
              bringing DTL3 connection to Chai Chee and Bedok South Rd. (Quip: we
              can also get 2/22/222 at Bedok MRT bus stops!)</p>
              <p>Fleetwise, can let 137 continue with full SD, while 22 can
              downgrade but still retain some DDs.</p>
              <p>Obvious downside is 137's lost connection to Bedok MRT (so
              commuters from Kaki Bukit will have to transfer)</p>
              <p>Minor downside is loss of links between Bedok Int / South Rd
              &amp; South Ave 3 / Temasek Pri &amp; Sec Sch. Link to Bedok
              Central is still covered by 25.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>65 section from Tampines Int up to Bedok North Rd (now using
              22's route)<br></li>

              <li>7 section from Bedok Int to New Upp Changi Rd<br></li>

              <p>Today, I went to Kaki Bukit MRT Station, to visit the neighborhood where I had been for as long as I have lived.</p>
                              
                              <p>To be honest, Kaki Bukit Station is not within walking distance from Telok Kurau, for an average person; young man still can, but it may be a torture for the elderly to walk about 400m between Kaki Bukit MRT Station and their house at Bedok Reservoir Road.</p>
                              
                              <p>Nonetheless, I gotta say that the distance is about the same as walking from Telok Kurau area to the market at Eunos CC.</p>
                              
                              <p>I hardly went to the POSB atm where Kaki Bukit MRT Station is located, so I wasnâ€™t expecting the distance to be â€œexceptionally longâ€� to walk from Kaki Bukit Station to Bedok Reservoir Road. But the distance may be as long as the distance to the market.</p>
                              
                              <p>Forget about Bedok North Station. Although the banner at Eunos CC says that itâ€™s near Eunos CC, itâ€™s actually tucked at one corner of a housing estate, further away than the market from Telok Kurau area.</p>
                              
                              <p>Anyway, as a person who grow up at Telok Kurau and have all these while travelled there via the East West Line or taxi, traveling to that place on the Downtown Line via Kaki Bukit Station is really a milestone.</p>
                              
                              <p>When I first step out of the train, I looked at the locality map and saw my relativeâ€™s flat, at the top corner of the map. It was really remarkable.</p>
                              
                              <p>Unfortunately, there was no bus to Bedok Reservoir Road.</p>
                              
                              <p>Meanwhile, the PAP grassroots people still can hang a banner at Bedok Reservoir Road to advertise the new bus service 137, when the bus route does not serve that area. What is this suppose to mean? To make the people regret for not voting the PAP is it?</p>
                              
                              <p>Seriously, I feel that they have politicized the situation at the wrong time... The MRT is supposed to be for everyone.</p>
                              
                              <p>Nonetheless, I feel that in terms of connectivity, the DTL3 is not primarily meant for the residents of Bedok, but more for the industrial area above it which has limited access to the East West Line and North East Line.</p>
                              
                              <p>After all, Paya Lebar is a relatively large area. The Bedok Reservoir Road area already have the East West Line. Although there may not be connection to the Downtown Line, at least one can expect the East West Line to be less crowded...</p>
                              
                              <p>Which leads me to the next point. On my way back home, I took the East West Line. The train is still crowded.</p>
                              
                              <p>Apparently, the DTL3 has limited effectiveness on the current coverage, but rather, it is meant for the future developments in the corridors that it serve.</p>
                              
                              <p>Notice at many stations, itâ€™s mostly a greenfield site? Yeah. Thatâ€™s what I mean. The DTL3 is meant for the future, unlike DTL2 which runs on a relatively built-up area of Bukit Timah and Bukit Panjang, thatâ€™s why it was effective in alleviating the crowding level on the western section of East West Line (as of 2016 when it just opened)... so the impact on the Eastern section of the East West Line is minimal.</p>
                              
                              <p>But well, å„¿å­™è‡ªæœ‰å„¿å­™ç¦�ã€‚Every line has its pros and cons.</p>
                              
                              <p>Thank you LTA for developing the Downtown Line. DTL3 may not be useful now, but Iâ€™m sure it will realise itâ€™s potential in the long run.</p>
                              
                              <p>Congratulations Tampines residents and Bedok... and... never mind....</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Zinger Borger:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Today, I went to Kaki Bukit MRT Station, to visit the
              neighborhood where I had been for as long as I have lived.</p>
              <p>To be honest, Kaki Bukit Station is not within walking distance
              from Telok Kurau, for an average person; young man still can, but
              it may be a torture for the elderly to walk about 400m between Kaki
              Bukit MRT Station and their house at Bedok Reservoir Road.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I gotta say that the distance is about the same as
              walking from Telok Kurau area to the market at Eunos CC.</p>
              <p>I hardly went to the POSB atm where Kaki Bukit MRT Station is
              located, so I wasn’t expecting the distance to be “exceptionally
              long” to walk from Kaki Bukit Station to Bedok Reservoir Road. But
              the distance may be as long as the distance to the market.</p>
              <p>Forget about Bedok North Station. Although the banner at Eunos
              CC says that it’s near Eunos CC, it’s actually tucked at one corner
              of a housing estate, further away than the market from Telok Kurau
              area.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as a person who grow up at Telok Kurau and have all
              these while travelled there via the East West Line or taxi,
              traveling to that place on the Downtown Line via Kaki Bukit Station
              is really a milestone.</p>
              <p>When I first step out of the train, I looked at the locality map
              and saw my relative’s flat, at the top corner of the map. It’s
              really remarkable.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there was no bus to Bedok Reservoir Road.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the PAP grassroots people still can hang a banner at
              Bedok Reservoir Road to advertise the new bus service 137, when the
              bus route does not serve that area. What is this suppose to mean?
              To make the people regret for not voting for the PAP is it?</p>
              <p>Seriously, I feel that they have politicized the situation at
              the wrong time... The MRT is supposed to be for everyone.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I feel that in terms of connectivity, the DTL3 is
              not primarily meant for the residents of Bedok, but more for the
              industrial area above it which has limited access to the East West
              Line and North East Line.</p>
              <p>After all, Paya Lebar is a relatively large area. The Bedok
              Reservoir Road area already have the East West Line. Although there
              may not be connection to the Downtown Line, at least one can expect
              the East West Line to be less crowded...</p>
              <p>Which leads me to the next point. On my way back home, I took
              the East West Line. The train is still crowded.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the DTL3 has limited effectiveness on the current
              coverage, but rather, it is meant for the future developments in
              the corridors that it serve.</p>
              <p>Notice at many stations, it’s mostly a greenfield site? Yeah.
              That’s what I mean. The DTL3 is meant for the future, unlike DTL2
              which runs on a relatively built-up area of Bukit Timah and Bukit
              Panjang, that’s why it was effective in alleviating the crowding
              level on the western section of East West Line (as of 2016 when it
              just opened)... so the impact on the Eastern section of the East
              West Line is minimal.</p>
              <p>But well, å„¿å­™è‡ªæœ‰å„¿å­™ç¦�ã€‚Every line has its pros and cons.</p>
              <p>Thank you LTA for developing the Downtown Line. DTL3 may not be
              useful now, but I’m sure it will realise it’s potential in the long
              run.</p>
              <p>Congratulations Tampines residents and Bedok... and... never
              mind....</p>
              <p>Congratulations Tampines residents on the opening of the
              Downtown Line.</p>

It rly is too ridiculously winding when the two endpoints are relatively nearby.

              <p>i rmb someone said the dist covered by 137 is approximately the same as 10e. Geographically if u measure a striaght line betweenn SP and UEC, they are closer than compared to the east --&gt; pasir panjang covered by 10e. Hope to clarify some misunderstanding :)</p>
