              <p>With regards to the cutting/withdrawal of bus routes with the
                  opening of DTL 2, the LTA initially intended to cut several
                  long-distance bus routes in 2010 after taking over central bus
                  planning. A <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/394736">thread</a> with regards to it was created, with tons of
                  backlash from many former/current forum members with regards to the
                  cutting of bus routes.</p>
              <p>Given that the NEL rationalization 12 years back had brought
                  about significant unhappiness among the North-Easterners (with a
                  thread of it linked <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/52455">here</a>), the opening of CCL didn't see any
                  rationalization and the massive backlash from many when the LTA
                  wanted to cut up long-distance bus routes in 2010, any massive
                  rationalization exercise for DTL2 (for DTL) may just result in
                  similar resentment.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is better for LTA not to touch any routes now,
                  even if they massively duplicate the DTL, unless they are able to
                  achieve a balance in the rationalization of bus services, similar
                  to TransitLink's integration exercises in the early in the
                  1990s.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The folks in the past were stupid enough to not only not cut routes worthy of cutting, they cut the wrong ones - 501 and 502 couldve been great alternatives to NEL, and if still alive 501 has great potential to ply KPE, becoming the shining frontier of northeast connectivity. </p>
              <p>See, routes that were hotcakes, LTA go and cut. Routes that ferry seats, not touched and left to waste resources. That is the bunch of idiots you got in 2003. </p>
              <p>Fast forward into the 2010s, LTA obviously have not waken up. Now they decide not to do anything at all! Using the excuse "rationalisation will cause unhappiness". Of bloody course it would! You have been blindly cutting in the past! Rationalisation comes with extensive on ground studies that explore demand and requirement even after MRT lines open! Not based on google maps right on the day the line opens! Once bitten, twice shy? More like not willing to be proactive...</p>
              <p>Seems LTA still dont get what is rationalisation... Or trying hard to cram demand into its train lines at the expense of commuter satisfaction?</p>
              <p>I myself fully look forward to rationalisation (not the nonsense they gave during 2003). I have been saying it wont happen, because I have already lost faith in the route development sector of LTA... Hopefully foreign operators this time round can help slap LTA out of their rainbows and butterflies...</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">However there are few points to note:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">a. Is it easy to perform a bus/train transfer?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">b. Are our train rides as comfortable as our bus rides [less cramped and well air-conditioned]?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">c. The length of your journey. And the number of transfers needed to reach your destination. With more train stations, more commuters need not make more transfers in reaching their destinations, thus people for bus rationalisation now will be higher.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">As for DTL2, from map it seems bus/train transfer along Dunearn Road to any DTL station will be a hassle. They may still be better off to rely on existing bus services to go their destinations. Perhaps LTA can consider running loop services that loop between Dunearn Road to Bukit Timah Road.  </p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I wondering what's the LTA predictions and/or pre-assumptions on the upcoming travelling patterns change due to DTL2? How the CCK/YT residents may make change in their travelling patterns. For me, I will abandon 48 if I am traveling to Little India/ Bugis. I will abandon 7/106 if I am travelling to Bugis. I will still take 970 to Sixth Ave. I will take train to HCI.I may still opt for 61 to Beauty World. I will take DTL/NSL trains to Novena.</p>

              <p><br>If you have entered Beauty World MRT from Exit C (the exit along Jln Jurong Kechil), you would have realised that it is quite far away from the fare gates. There's a long walkway inbetween the fare gates and Exit C... So less convenient than Exit A where 173 will be calling at.</p>
              <p>But frankly speaking I'm also not so happy with the amendment... Direct service to Bukit Timah Plaza is gone.</p>

              <p><br>Sadly, I don't think your point (c) is really that valid. With more trains, people will NOT make less transfers - but instead they may even make MORE transfers.</p>
              <p>Please take note that not all the MRT lines ply the same route in city, nor do they provide links to all the places that commuters are going to. DTL2 is an example where you need to tap out at Newton and then tap in again just to take one stop on NSL to Orchard. (Although the fare system will be changed, the mode of transfer will surely result in massive crowds at fare gates).  In fact, DTL3 will be worse but I shall not discuss here.</p>
              <p>I have not even taken bus transfers into consideration yet. Let's say you live at somewhere near NJC and are going to SIM. Are you going to take a bus to Sixth Ave MRT, then take DTL for only 1 stop, and transfer to 74/151/154 again? Or are you going to just take a direct 74/151/154? There are thousands of similar cases especially for short-distance travellers. In fact, even some long-distance travellers may also be wondering should they use 972-DTL-NSL or just a direct 972 to Orchard.</p>
              <p>Regarding bus-train transfers, although DTL is generally better than CCL, some stations still have bus stops so far away that deter people from transferring to buses. Botanic Gardens is a perfect example.</p>

              <p>My answer is simple:</p>
              <p>Even if I stay in Sixth Ave and I am travelling to SIM, I will take bus. I had taken a closer look at Kings Albert Station, oops it is so far away from the Macdonald. If I am travelling to Orchard from BP, if I need to first take 972 to BP Station, I may still opt for the more direct route 972 into Orchard. If I am a Sunset resident and I am travelling to Bugis, I may opt for DTL. If I am in CCK/BP and is travelling to NUS/one-north, I will opt for DTL/CCL. If I am at NJC, I will still take bus to ACS and Little India. However If I am at NJC, I will probably opt for DTL for Rochor and beyond.  </p>

              <p>Services 21 and 125 are made to ply Kitchener Rd via Jln Besar from Bendemeer Rd and then returned to Balestier Rd via Serangoon Rd. They thus stopped near Farrer Park MRT. Previously they used to get to Balestier Rd via Lavender St directly.</p>
              <p>Services 22, 53 and 70 all used to get to Upp Paya Lebar Rd via Boundary Rd, when Serangoon MRT opens, their routes are all curved to ply Serangoon Ctrl and Upp Serangoon Rd to get to Upp Paya Lebar Rd from Boundary Rd (22 &amp; 53) or Yio Chu Kang Link (70).</p>
              <p>Service 72 might have plied the stretch of Hougang Ave 4 that goes directly to Upp Serangoon Rd before. It is made to ply Hougang Ctrl (and thus stopping near Hougang MRT) before going to Upp Serangoon Rd.</p>
              <p>Services 130 and 139 should be nearly the same as Services 21 and 125, originally using Lavender St to get to Jln Besar from Balestier Rd, they also plied a "loop" at Boon Keng Rd via Serangoon Rd and then get to Jln Besar via Bendemeer Rd just to stop near Boon Keng MRT.</p>
              <p>These are all the amendments during Phase 1 of the NEL rationalisation. In my view, the routes all made a sharp curve to ply the NEL stations and their original routes are most likely to be more direct.</p>

              <p><strong>Service 156</strong> needs major improvement in frequency. It's now the only link from Sixth Avenue MRT to Sixth Ave (77/970 are a bit back-tracking) and certain parts of Holland Rd. It could have also been a fast link from Clementi to DTL (Sixth Avenue is more convenient for eastbound commuters).</p>
              <p>However, currently 156 has disastrous frequency. Just this afternoon I waited for 25 minutes at Sixth Avenue MRT, before finally giving up.</p>
              <p>I feel like there would be a need for some sort of 156M/156A from Clementi looping at Sixth Avenue or Tan Kah Kee MRT. (That is, if those in Sixth Ave and Holland Rd are willing to take DTL.)</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, yes it is very ironical. They should have expected Smrt 979 to be a hit since it goes to choa Chu Kang crescent and yew tee area. Smrt 983 did not. My colleague is so overjoyed that there is a new service direct to his house at choa Chu Kang crescent after so long. Moreover it connects to bukit panjang. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, yes it is very ironical. They should have
              expected Smrt 979 to be a hit since it goes to choa Chu Kang
              crescent and yew tee area. Smrt 983 did not. My colleague is so
              overjoyed that there is a new service direct to his house at choa
              chi Lang crescent after so long. Moreover it connects to bukit
              panjang. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>definitely so! At night around 9pm, spotted SMB3562K was almost empty on 983, but SMB3136H on 979 already packed to the door at opp Bukit Panjang Plaza stop...</p>
              <p>Today spotted 9 buses doing 979, suspect 7 AP and 2 TQ, and almost every bus that exit CCK/YewTee is full to the door or at least fully seated, thats during late morning and afternoon. At night, opposite direction has that situation...</p>
              <p>At around 10am, SMB3153H (979TQ02) even skipped the last 2 stops at CCK Cres as it was too packed...</p>
              <p>However, at YewTee MRT, when both 302 and 979 arrive, most pax still chose to board 302, possibly due to 302 having seats but 979 is fully seated already...</p>

              <p><br>983's loading is mainly from Ave 4 and Ave 5 to CCK MRT which justify DDs and bendies. And now since DTL is open a lot of them will go to BPJ MRT also (the 983 rigid that I took had a good 30-40 pax).</p>
              <p>Though I agree 979 should get more HC buses... But 983 no need to cut fleet.</p>

              <p><br>Cannot be 10 mins... I took 17 mins from BPJ MRT to Yew Tee MRT (0906-0923). Which makes sense for DDs.</p>
