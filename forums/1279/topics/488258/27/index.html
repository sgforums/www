              <p>Not easy. Both 190 and 972 are running at 03-04 min frequency

              services could inconvenience lot of people. </p>
              <p>Moreover, 972 needs to stop at Bukit Panjang road stop before
              BKE. At least 15-20 pax from Ring road transfer here for other
              services. Diverting via Pending/Petir will cause them

              <p>You wouldn't want to make any change to 190 which is undoubtedly the highest loading long trunk service with 02-04 mins frequency :)</p>
              <p>I think 960 could be a better candidate to cover 700 at Petir road. The only stop that will be missed out is "Pending LRT". </p>

              <p>It won't be wise to shift all the load to 49 though and it would be very inconvinient for people living in that stretch of road in Taman Jurong in terms of accessibility (to them 178 is the fastest way to go JE) and 49 and 98 takes a big round before going to JE and altering the route will only result in complains no compliments.</p>

              <p>Theoretically yes. Practically 178 has mostly less than 20 pax between Taman Jurong and JE. And almost all through its route except between BBT and Woodlands. Hence, the suggestion.</p>

              <p>I beg to differ for some routes:</p>
              <p>67: I know its stupid to keep the route, given that it duplicates DTL so much, but it comes in handy when ferrying pax over smaller areas, like the entire stretch frm Bedok MRT to Tamp Int has a very good and high loading during peak and off peak respectively. Im not too sure are there other alternatives but it still serve well.</p>
              <p>170: I think this is a very personal opinion that the starting location – queen st ter should not be changed. Instead, I thought of having it to express all the way to bukit panjang area to ferry any foreign workers quickly to their dorms along woodlands road, and then reduces duplication. Idk if this would work well.</p>
              <p>700: I think it is likely to be scrapped WITH other bus services modified</p>
              <p>852: There are many students who commute between the stretch of well-known sch along bukit timah road to amk and yishun. This being the most direct route, so withdrawing it would have some consequences. The current freq is actually good.</p>
              <p>Do correct me if you alr have mentioned in your post. Thanks</p>

              <p>Hmm possible, but wont it be duplicative of CW2/SJE? Personally i wont recommend that coz this would mean this express fares is charged and checkpoint transfers will be a prob. <em>Unless </em>its strictly in Singapore. But then how many ppl would even use this?</p>

              <p>I beg to differ for some routes:</p>
              <p>67: I know its stupid to keep the route, given that it
              duplicates DTL so much, but it comes in handy when ferrying pax
              over smaller areas, like the entire stretch frm Bedok MRT to Tamp
              Int has a very good and high loading during peak and off peak
              respectively. Im not too sure are there other alternatives but it
              still serve well.</p>
              <p>170: I think this is a very personal opinion that the starting
              location – queen st ter should not be changed. Instead, I thought
              of having it to express all the way to bukit panjang area to ferry
              any foreign workers quickly to their dorms along woodlands road,
              and then reduces duplication. Idk if this would work well.</p>
              <p>700: I think it is likely to be scrapped WITH other bus services
              modified</p>
              <p>852: There are many students who commute between the stretch of
              well-known sch along bukit timah road to amk and yishun. This being
              the most direct route, so withdrawing it would have some
              consequences. The current freq is actually good.</p>
              <p>Do correct me if you alr have mentioned in your post. Thanks</p>

              <p>Agree that 852 is difficult to scrap. Not sure if it could be modified to become semi-express though ... may be possible to cut to YCK.</p>
              <p>Amended 171 can loop around BPJ, but any longer and it'll be better to terminate to prevent bunching/schedule problems. Same goes with either half of 67 if it is split.</p>
              <p>700 can either be withdrawn, or rerouted to Jurong East/Bt Batok; both towns would benefit from an express link to Stevens and Orchard. There are enough alternatives in its place. 960 can be diverted to Dairy Farm Rd (not 972, as it is needed for transfers at the Blk 270 bus stop).</p>
              <p>66 and 170 can stay for the time being (either 65 or 66 may do well with a bit of diversions along DTL3 where needed).</p>
              <p>Overall I believe the priority should be as such:</p>
              <p>-- (1) Shorten 171</p>
              <p>-- (2) Withdraw / divert 700, make 960 cover for it along Dairy Farm Rd. (Also amend 972 to Dunearn Rd and Newton Rd to cover for 171/700, and probably extend to Marina Ctr if not given other route replacement). 971E may be modified to trace 700 for peak hours.</p>
              <p>-- (3) Split up 67, probably best with both halves passing through Little India</p>
              <p>-- (4) Split up 178 and make relevant changes to 960/961, if any.</p>

              <p>I think 180 <em>will</em> terminate at BPJ ITH since currently it is "homed" to a interchange that is not mainly served by SMRT buses, which beats the norm. I oso feel 177 <em><strong>might</strong> </em><em>make use but not terminate</em> there. 983 is like this BSEP short trunk so dun think will even enter. 971E is like many other SMRT express services that does not have a parent service and hence not likely to make use of the ITH</p>
