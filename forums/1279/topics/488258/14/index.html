              <p>Is it me or Sv960 has lesser demand now? </p>
              <p>A bendy bus can be seen with a few standees and seats fully
              occupied on weekends 7+ :o Weekdays don't seems to have packed

              <p>sv 960's demand/loading is quite erratic.</p>
              <p>The only loading that is consistent is between 545pm-630pm... buses calling at Mandai Estate to go towards Woodlands. Each bus gets packed during these timings. Opposite direction full route can be managed by rigids.</p>
              <p>Between Bugis and Bukit Panjang... most buses these days have 50-60 pax loading manageable by rigids... few get higher loading. Hence, I feel 960 has also lost some HC buses and more so DDs... </p>

              <p>Improve frequency, reduce route duplications (with both bus and MRT), reduce total journey time? For services with sections of completely different demand/loading patterns, can consider operating them separately (such as 171, I believe).</p>

              <p>960 can have DDs for weekends. During week days, 960 has high loading between Mandai Estate and Kranji/Woodlands. Hence, it would be good to have some DDs on 960 do downroutes from BPJ from 530-630pm to cater to the high demand.</p>

              <p>Another proposal will be to introduce a new route from Woodlands to Dunearn Rd/Little India/Rochor/Bugis/Marina Ctr via BKE/PIE, skipping Bukit Panjang and Woodlands Rd entirely (something along the lines of former 950/952 in the 1990s), and then have 960 cutback to operate your proposed route (i.e. Woodlands - Bt Panjang Ring Rd).</p>

              <p>Actually I have to agree of what he says. Tampines East MRT is
              near to Tampines MRT although I got no idea where is exactly the
              station. From there, you have 293/28 to take you there to those
              streets. You want less walking, alight at Tampines MRT instead.
              From there, you even have 72/72A waiting for you at the int to
              Tampines Ave 9</p>
              <p>For Bedok Reservoir MRT, I understand as the walking distance is
              far and there is no way that the DTL can take you back to Bedok.
              However, I would consider if you take 60 from Bedok North MRT where
              the route would DIRECTLY bring you to Bedok North Ave 1. To get to
              Bedok North Rd/Ave 4, I dont really suppose if 17 should make a
              loop at Tampines Int like how 3 loops at Pasir Ris Int. Like that
              people can alight at Tampines MRT and take 17 from there or from
              Tampines Ave 7 where 17 is there as well. To Bedok Street 3, people
              should just go walk instead. Its not like it takes 5 blocks to get
              to the street</p>

              <p>Tampines East MRT is at the junction of Tampines Ave 7 and Ave 9/2.  Note that Svc 293 is unidirectional at this junction, so you can take 293 from Tampines East MRT to St 42/43, or from St 45 to Tampines East MRT, but not the other way round. Svc 28 is all the way at Ave 7/St 45/34 junction and does not pass by Tampines East MRT at all. (And lastly, FYI 72 serves the western stretch of Ave 9 with 27/168, not the east!)</p>
              <p>Currently, the only bidirectional connection between Tampines East MRT and N4 is provided by Svc 29 via Ave 9, but it is full fleet SD and is already facing problems due to high loading between Tampines MRT and Ave 9.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Amending 17 to loop at Tampines Int is strictly no no. It's simply too far: you have to make 17 go from Ave 5 / Ave 2 junction all the way to TMI and then come back, which I estimate will add at least 10 minutes of travelling time. Moreover 17 is already well utilised as an intra-town route between Tampines Ave 2 and CGH / Bedok North Ave 4 industrial area, so I really don't see a reason why it should go to Tampines Int?</p>

              <p>can anyone tell me the demand on 178 come from where? The only time i personally saw the bus is full to the door is from WTBI to Kranji/ Sg Kadut during peak hours. After that the bus goes empty. It is like 852 already, serve as an alternative to other major service</p>
