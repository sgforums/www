              <p>If rationalization is needed to improve the ridership of a newly-opened MRT line, then it proves that there is <strong>no </strong>need to build the MRT line in the first place, since most commuters would rather continue to use buses than the new MRT line.</p>
              <p>This was <strong>precisely </strong>why the NEL rationalization was <strong>that </strong>brutal 13 years ago, because LTA wanted to force people to switch to the NEL rather than use public buses due to its poor ridership (about the same as DTL2 right now).

              <p>No thanks. These are extreme hypothetical situations. It is an undeniable fact that the public transport system is based on MRT-bus integration (however poor some areas might be). Rationalisation is based on finding the optimal balance between MRT and bus.</p>
              <p>There is currently an oversupply of resources based on what fellow forum members have observed. As it is not feasible to cut trains, the solution is to reduce buses, in particularly those on services with the most passenger loading decrease (that have transferred to the DTL).</p>

              <p>If they want DTL2 loading to improve, definitely they will need to rationalize.</p>
              <p>I think route planning of DTL2 hasn't been good. It mostly passes through condos/private housing. People choose to live further away in these areas so that they pay less housing money to compensate for COE and cars.</p>
              <p><strong>Peak period analysis</strong></p>
              <p>Bukit Panjang - major part of DTL2 loading</p>
              <p>Cashew/Hillview - very few people board</p>
              <p>Beauty World - decent</p>
              <p>All stations up to Botanic Gardens - loading/alighting remains poor. Contrary to popular belief did not notice many students alighting at King Albert or at schools along Bukit Timah stretch</p>
              <p>Botanic Gardens - good boarding/alighting - transfer pax</p>
              <p>Stevens/Newton - loading is poor</p>
              <p>Little India - good boarding/alighting - transfer pax</p>
              <p>Rochor - the station seems almost empty</p>
              <p>Bugis - not much boarding, quite a bit alighting.</p>
              <p>For a small MRT during peak hours there are seats available, and ample space to stand.</p>

              <p><br>1. From my sources, stations such as Tan Kah Kee are crowded with students in the morning.</p>
              <p>2. I don't know how you came up with the conclusion that loading at Newton is poor. It's not as good as Little India, but definitely better than Stevens.</p>
              <p>3. Again, Rochor is definitely not a station with almost empty loading. Many board at Little India and alight at Rochor. MANY.</p>
              <p>4. For Bugis, there's more people on DTL1 side than those on the DTL2 side.</p>
              <p>And during peak hours there are NO seats available. Nor for some off-peak hours. Just this morning 8am I was taking DTL to Promenade and the number of pax standing is as good as those seating, which is much better than the subsequent CCL train I boarded towards Paya Lebar (which was almost empty).</p>

              <p>Honestly I don't think 961 has lost its loading. I still observe quite okay loading at TKK towards Woodlands, which proves its unique route still survives well.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS7557R, who says the DTL can provide all the necessary connections to commuters' destinations??? There are many bus stops in between the DTL that are not served by MRT. They need to be continued to be served by buses. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>You need to realise the route of an MRT line is not as simple as that of buses. Tight turns or passing through too many buildings are extremely impossible. Plus, the route you're suggesting is basically too winding for BPJ residents.</p>

              <p>In all seriousness, the survival of sv147 and many other services that duplicate the eastern leg of EWL (sv2, sv24, sv26 &amp; sv67 - even though sv26 may not be that brilliant an example given that its demand is largely based in Kallang Bahru) had proven that even if a bus service duplicates MRT lines extensively, it does not mean that its passenger demand will drop to the extent that they are not required any more and should be removed.

              <p>As mentioned somewhere in this forum before (unsure if it's this thread as well), I would prefer an integration exercise of both buses and MRT (similar to those conducted for the NSL/EWL between 1988 and 1993) that not only see the withdrawal/shortening of duplicating bus services, retaining of duplicating services that remain in high passenger demand, but also the introduction of new bus service connections to adapt to the opening of the new MRT lines. However, I do understand that these integration exercises had also brought about many of the current "long distance" services such as 14 (from integrating with old 92) and 51 (from integrating with old 192). Therefore, more careful planning should be implemented when integrating bus services without causing bus services to become too long in distance. </p>
              <p>As mentioned countless times by other forum members, the NEL rationalization was probably too harsh in that sense with only sv147 left behind, leaving Punggol with no direct buses to the CBD and sealing the destiny of express buses which could have potentials to alleviate the passenger demands of NEL. And as mentioned by a senior forum member back in the era, the old sv85 still had "significant passenger demand" before its withdrawal. I'll not go into further detail on this issue again given that its damage is probably not totally reversible and it had been over-discussed in this forum with little to say effects in "reducing" the damage.</p>
              <p>With that being said, I do agree with user AJQZC that bus services that heavily duplicate the DTL that see a significant dip in passenger demand should be the ones that are withdrawn/shortened rather than just cutting all heavily-duplicating bus services on surface.</p>

              along the DTL corridor and cutting sv147).</p>
              <p>In all seriousness, the survival of sv147 and many other
              services that duplicate the eastern leg of EWL (sv2, sv24, sv26
              &amp; sv67 - even though sv26 may not be that brilliant an example
              given that its demand is largely based in Kallang Bahru) had proven
              that even if a bus service duplicates MRT lines extensively, it
              does not mean that its passenger demand will drop to the extent
              that they are not required any more and should be removed. Of
              course, it is noted that this does not apply to all bus services
              that heavily duplicate MRT lines.</p>
              <p>As mentioned somewhere in this forum before (unsure if it's this
              thread as well), I would prefer an integration exercise of both
              buses and MRT (similar to those conducted for the NSL/EWL between
              1988 and 1993) that not only see the withdrawal/shortening of
              duplicating bus services, retaining of duplicating services that
              remain in high passenger demand, but also the introduction of new
              bus service connections to adapt to the opening of the new MRT
              lines. However, I do understand that these integration exercises
              had also brought about many of the current "long distance" services
              such as 14 (from integrating with old 92) and 51 (from integrating
              with old 192). Therefore, more careful planning should be
              implemented when integrating bus services without causing bus
              services to become too long in distance. </p>
              <p>As mentioned countless times by other forum members, the NEL
              rationalization was probably too harsh in that sense with only
              sv147 left behind, leaving Punggol with no direct buses to the CBD
              and sealing the destiny of express buses which could have
              potentials to alleviate the passenger demands of NEL. And as
              mentioned by a senior forum member back in the era, the old sv85
              still had "significant passenger demand" before its withdrawal.
              I'll not go into further detail on this issue again given that its
              damage is probably not totally reversible and it had been
              over-discussed in this forum with little to say effects in
              "reducing" the damage.</p>
              <p>With that being said, I do agree with user AJQZC that bus
              services that heavily duplicate the DTL that see a significant dip
              in passenger demand should be the ones that are withdrawn/shortened
              rather than just cutting all heavily-duplicating bus services on
              surface.</p>

              <p>I do agree that it should not be rationalized for at least 6 months until they have more credible information on loading pattern to make the decision.</p>
              <p>But I have to say that I am a little shocked to see the low loading on DTL2.</p>

              <p>Also, no need for a new Route 68 to cover for the missing sector of Route 67, as Route 65 can do the job. Bedok-Reservoir-Little India has Route 66 as well as upcoming DTL3.</p>
              <p>For DTL2, my concerns are mainly for 171 and somewhat for 67. It makes sense to truncate 171 at Beauty World and use 67 to cover for the Newton-Marina Centre portion. Better still if 171 can merge with 180 or 983.</p>

              <p>You simply cannot use 65 to cover the eastern part of 67. Their routes are drastically different. And 67 can get packed to the door at Geylang Rd...</p>

              <p>If someone at DTL2 stations is going to DTL3 stations, he/she would not want to waste 20 minutes winding around the city on DTL1. If he is using CCL to connect DTL2 and DTL3, he/she should be already taking DTL2-CCL-EWL now (with bus transfers from EWL if necessary) given the close proximity between EWL and DTL3.</p>

              <p><br>Even numerous transfers will not take more than 20 minutes (which is the time wasted on DTL1 - 10 stops from Rochor to Jalan Besar!). Personally I know some people commuting between DTL2 and future DTL3, and they already complain about how windy DTL is. They would probably not prefer a direct route even when DTL3 is in operation.</p>
