              <p>During pre-DTL2 days, 170 can easily get at least 40-50 foreign
              workers from Bugis and Little India to their dorms at Woodlands
              Road, when 960 is so packed that they cannot board. Not sure about

              <p>Like what bus analayzer mentioned, ard less than 20 pax lor. Maybe what we need to do is to have someone else to go observe, so that we can all be more convinced? i guess thats the best way ard?</p>

              <p>Little India to Bukit Panjang by DTL2 is <strong>20 mins</strong> only (this is official on MRT time card).</p>
              <p>Consider how long it takes for 170 from Little India to Bukit Panjang - <strong>50-60 mins</strong> depending on congestion around Newton Circus.</p>
              <p>Now it is for you to decide how do the workers travel. Do they take DTL2 or do 170 all the way to Woodlands Checkpoint which is 1.5 hours in bus. </p>
              <p>99% would take DTL2 from Little India and transfer to 170/178 at BPJ MRT.</p>
              <p>Weekends I don't know because I don't observe. It is purely family time. But weekdays it is around 20 pax during off peak and peak hours.</p>
              <p>Why don't you take 170 one of the evenings to try it yourself? also take into consideration if there is 961/67/171/178 in front... and how many minutes before is the earlier 170. </p>

              <p>Ok thanks for ur advice. Of course ppl would wanna opt for the faster option which is the DTL, but in anyways i shall find time to observe it for myself. Cheers.</p>
              <p>Anyways, do yall think the DTL2 rationalisation would only take place when BPITH opens? And i mean the DTL2 sector, not sure for DTL3</p>

              <p>Agreed! CCK int is already at its max capacity... buses are now parking at the area near the entrance of the int (1 lot), and near the exit of the int in front of NTUC foodfare (3-4 lots), with rigids queueing up for lots even during non-mealbreak timings...</p>
