              <p>I think if 972 is a Tampines Blk 518C-Bukit Panjang link, then the route will be split at Orchard Gateway for better reliability and optimise resources, as there will still be Enviro500s all along after being so hungry-monster bus service like 190. The route may also duplicate DTL2 and may see a drop in loading. The western part of 972 will loop at Bencoolen Street, whereas the eastern part of 972 will therefore terminate at Orchard Gateway.

              <p>Reason is apparent. You were at Bugis, Rochor. Mind if I ask which day did you go there? DTL2 mostly passes by areas where people own cars and would've easily reached office via. PIE/BKE/Lornie Rd etc. Most rather jam in a car than squish in a train (even though it isnt that squished). At Bugis and Rochor you would expect most pax to be office workers, who a<span style="line-height: 1.231;">lso happen to drive. You may only expect BPJ residents to be taking the line, but again they have 960, 190. Hence the low catchment. </span></p>
              <p>But you have yet to see. Come to Botanic Gardens, it's a totally different story. Loads <span style="line-height: 1.231;">and loads of students cramming onto the trains before and after sch hours, not to mention many BPJ residents using the CCL, to places where buses will not reach. Yes, it is because the northwest lacks bus connections to various parts of the island eg. Central and the Northeast, thats why ppl are more inclined to use the MRT to get there, and CCL does the job better than CBD lines. Furthermore, schs at BKT receive students from all over SG, hence the need for these students who cant drive to take MRT. You wont expect students to head downtown on a school day, will you?</span></p>

              <p>I observed prime peak time at two stations Bugis and Rochor where I expected huge loading. The private houses starts mostly from Stevens to the Hillview stretch, where I don't exepct much loading except for ofcourse school students from SIM/Ngee Ann etc. </p>

              <p>Based on my personal experience, from DTL2 to NEL, transferring at Little India takes almost the same (if not shorter) time as compared to using CCL. You have 2 more stops this way but you don't have to walk the 2 super long transfer links at CCL interchanges and wait for CCL trains to arrive.</p>

              <p>This is why you need rationalisation to force people out of old habits. Not advocating for such brutal measures like were seen during NEL. But routes like 190, 700, 960 and 972 should have their frequencies reduced and additional fleet deployed elsewhere. For 960 an M varriant could be introduced from Wdl to BPJ. LTA should examine why commuters are not budging and I suspect people are still used to the direct service provided by these services (from office right up to doorstep). If so, then LTA needs to look at last-mile connections. If not, it really is a wastage of resources in the form of overcapacity caused by duplication. </p>
              <p>On the point about Bt Timah residents driving alot, well, just walk into one of those housing estates and you will realise how deep they are. It is a very long walk. This is where LTA needs to be more nimble. You can't introduce a BSEP service in Watten Estate for example. I would advocate a scheme B feeder service with limited one-way departures during AM and PM peak. </p>

              <p>Essentially DTL2 doesn't serve HDB estates other than Bt Panjang and Beauty World. Residents of CCK and Yew Tee could still consider transferring if DTL is more direct to destination, or if NSL is further away. It doesn't help to provide a direct link to those staying further west/south (such as Bt Batok, Clementi, Jurong West), who will still rely on NSL/EWL for the majority of their long distance travels.</p>
              <p>I recall a residents' (and students') campaign from the DTL2's early days to plead to LTA to extend the line to Yew Tee, given the density of its population. Didn't get much traction.</p>

              <p>983 is less likely due to different demand/loading, adjusting the frequency to cater to both sections is more difficult. 180 possible. I considered 177 too, but with 177 going to TT there may be an operator conflict.</p>
              <p>Either way, there has to be a reconfiguration of the loop around BPJ MRT if it is going to merge with either route.</p>
