              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Not all of these pertain to DTL modifications. Here are my
                  views.</p>
              <p><strong>973 &amp; 176</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No</span>; the services serve completely
                  different routes, impossible to merge; along with fleet
                  restrictions on 973. (75 &amp; 973 may be a more likely pair,
                  though that would cause an awkward and long route that will be
                  difficult to optimize.)</p>
              <p><strong>7 &amp; 69</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No</span>; the services cater to different
                  demands &amp; a merger would definitely be too long (~30km).</p>
              <p><strong>135 &amp; 47</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Maybe</span>. Downside is the loss of the loop at
                  Amber which may irk some commuters.</p>
              <p><strong>40</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No</span> ... don't see the point of shortening
                  and the loss of links to Geylang / Mattar.</p>
              <p><strong>16</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Possible</span> but not quite necessary. 16
                  itself is winding enough as it is, plus a detour via Joo Chiat
                  makes it indirect; adding the detour would slow it down
                  further.</p>
              <p><strong>171 &amp; 944</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Maybe</span>, but the loss of links to Upp Bt
                  Timah / Beauty World is an issue. I wouldn't support if there are
                  better alternatives (such as 171 &amp; 41)</p>
              <p><strong>151</strong>:  <span style="color: #0000ff;">No
                  point</span> if there's no demand.</p>
              <p><strong>122</strong>:  <span style="color: #339966;">Can</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>190 &amp; 700</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Maybe</span>, but there'll be a need for a
                  service to cover either Stevens Rd or Dunearn / Bt Timah Rd.
                  There's a reason why both 190 &amp; 700 still have high demand (and
                  700 has not been withdrawn up till now).</p>
              <p><strong>62, 857, 970</strong>:  <span style="color: #339966;">Can</span>.</p>
              <p><strong>64 &amp; 111</strong>:  <span style="color: #800080;">Not sure</span>, I'd be careful of disrupting
                  links from Bt Merah to Serangoon Rd.</p>

              <p>Dude, i didn't call for Route 40 to get shortened. All i said was for it to ply Marine Parade instead of East Coast Rd should 47 and 135 ever merge and serve East Coast in both directions. The plus side would be Opera Estate getting a direct link to Parkway Parade.</p>
              <p>As for 151 case, the bus stops at Defu have been disused since 323 was chopped.</p>

              interchange plus many passing by. Your estate also has many mrt

              <p>I just realised that if I use my phone to comment, the font size
              becomes huge. If I use my computer to comment, the font size is
              normal. LOL.</p>
              <p>Anyway back to the topic. Yes, I admit that Bedok estate in
              general already has many bus services. But I don't only look at the
              quantity of bus services. I also look at where the services go to
              and the time it takes to reach my desired destination.</p>
              <p>In Bedok, many bus services go to places not served by other
              routes (e.g. 17 to Bedok North Ave 4, 32 to Frankel Ave, 33 to Joo
              Chiat, 35 to Tanah Merah ferry terminal, 40 to Siglap Rd, etc).
              These routes are designed to maximise coverage and connect to MRT
              lines so they are not practical for long-distance trips. There are
              a few "expressway" services like 45, 168, 506 and CT18, but the
              frequency is bad (with the exception of 168).</p>
              <p>In the end, the <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">MRT is
              still the fastest way to travel from Bedok to most places. But not
              everyone likes the MRT because the MRT is often crowded (esp at
              Bedok, Kembagan and Eunos stations on EWL) and not very reliable
              due to frequent delays and breakdowns. DTL3 will definitely help to
              alleviate the situation on EWL, but DTL3 doesn't go to where I want
              to go. (I work in Jurong West, so I'm stuck with the crowded EWL or
              the infrequent svc 506 + 174.) In theory, from next month I can
              take 137, change to DTL3 at Bedok North, change to CCL at
              MacPherson, and change to EWL at Buona Vista, but it's too
              troublesome, and very likely I have to stand up for most of the
              journey.</span></p>

              <p>Agreed. IMO i am hoping they convert the CTs to express services, extend the operating hour, maybe like from 6 to 11 daily at 15 min freq peak and 25 min freq off-peak and allow boarding at yck and bedok respectively. In that case it will not only be popular within elderly, but also ppl working in chinatown area.</p>
              <p>While im not totally sure if it would be a good idea to allow more coverage for such services, maybe they could be extended to habourfront or pasir panjang? The former could be a better idea coz currently no direct and fast link frm amk to habourfront in the case of CT8, and a faster alternative for 30 in the case of CT18. The latter could result in a route that could be too long.</p>
              <p>While we hope for the best, bear in mind that the new kampong bahru ter has like 3-4 boarding berths, showing that it is highly likely it is going to take in the CTs</p>

              Current 973 becomes 973A. Room for 1 new route at BPJ made. 170X
              can be extended there and renumbered 974.</p>
              <p>7 can be merged with 69. Room for 2 routes at BDK made.</p>
              <p>135 can merge with 47 and ply East Coast Rd both ways. 40 can be
              amended to Marine Parade as such.</p>
              <p>16 can be amended to Chai Chee where there is no direct link to
              CBD.</p>
              <p>171 can absorb 944 in event of DTL bus route cuts. The BPJ-CBD
              portion can be covered by 67, whose LTI-TAM sector can be covered

              <p>151 should ply Defu which it originally did.</p>
              <p>122 should be extended to loop at Holland Village like 95 does
              in order to relieve 970.</p>
              <p>190 and 700 should merge and 972 terminate at NBR (future Kg

              <p>64 can also start from Marina South, with the DBG-Sims Pl
              portion covered by 111.</p>
              <p>Marina South to be linked to Clarke Quay by a public ferry, like

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, actually the minister says like no say like that. All along, everybody knows once new mrt lines are up, bus routes will be re-routed or rationalized. This is nothing new. Moreover, everybody knows mrt is the centrestage and buses only play second fiddle. This is the real situation. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
