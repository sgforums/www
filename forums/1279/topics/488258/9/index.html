              <p>definitely so! At night around 9pm, spotted SMB3562K was almost empty on 983, but SMB3136H on 979 already packed to the door at opp Bukit Panjang Plaza stop...</p>
              <p>Today spotted 9 buses doing 979, suspect 7 AP and 2 TQ, and almost every bus that exit CCK/YewTee is full to the door or at least fully seated, thats during late morning and afternoon. At night, opposite direction has that situation...</p>
              <p>At around 10am, SMB3153H (979TQ02) even skipped the last 2 stops at CCK Cres as it was too packed...</p>
              <p><strong>However, at YewTee MRT, when both 302 and 979 arrive, most pax still chose to board 302, possibly due to 302 having seats but 979 is fully seated already...</strong></p>

              <p>For bolded part: I guess pax board 302 because they don't know the route of 979. Spotted many times when 979 arrive at Yew Tee MRT and a lot of pax at the bus stop keep waiting. They subsequently board 302.</p>

              <p><br> 983's loading is mainly from Ave 4 and Ave 5 to CCK MRT which
              justify DDs and bendies. And now since DTL is open a lot of them
              will go to BPJ MRT also (the 983 rigid that I took had a good 30-40

              <p>With regards to the cutting/withdrawal of bus routes with the
                  opening of DTL 2, the LTA initially intended to cut several
                  long-distance bus routes in 2010 after taking over central bus
                  planning. A <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/394736">thread</a> with regards to it was
                  created, with tons of backlash from many former/current forum
                  members with regards to the cutting of bus routes.</p>
              <p>Given that the NEL rationalization 12 years back had brought
                  about significant unhappiness among the North-Easterners (with a
                  thread of it linked <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/52455">here</a>), the opening of CCL didn't
                  see any rationalization and the massive backlash from many when the
                  LTA wanted to cut up long-distance bus routes in 2010, any massive
                  rationalization exercise for DTL2 (for DTL) may just result in
                  similar resentment.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is better for LTA not to touch any routes now,
                  even if they massively duplicate the DTL, unless they are able to
                  achieve a balance in the rationalization of bus services, similar
                  to TransitLink's integration exercises in the early in the
                  1990s.</p>

              <p>Why too late, everyone was prepared for the eventual takeover of responsibilities by LTA, I'm sure SBS and SMRT are more than willing to leave bus purchasing to LTA, especially as there is no guarantee that SBS or SMRT will operate any parcel forever under the GCM.</p>

              <p>Bus services will not be rationalised as train stations are soaced out fr each other n offer a faster travel period.</p>

              <p>Hi mr AJQZC, why should bus services skip bus stops along bukit timah road??? When buses ply that road, it is the natural thing for them to serve passengers along that route. People still need to do direct bus to bus transfers and people still need to get to places. It is not possible just to leave 1 or 2 bus services to ply that route and all the others made express. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
