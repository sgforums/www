              <p>Gd idea, but 171 Yishun to Bukt Pnjng is 16km and 180 Bukt Pnjng
              to Boon Lay is 11km. If combine, it would be 27km, whch is too
              long. Sorry.</p>

              <p>I don't think length would be the issue here, the main issue would be that their capacities don't match (180 uses high-capacity buses, 171 uses solely single-decker buses) so how can you blend 171 together with 180?</p>
              <p>That being said, if they do cut back 171 to Bt Panjang, I reckon it will be a good candidate for future extension to the new Tengah town (though that would be out-of-topic here ...)</p>

              <p>The 171 Yishun - Bt Timah link isn't significant. Taking NYGH/HCI/NJC as a guideline, a 171 route back to Yishun is about 24 km. Add in road jams and crowds and it wouldn't be a popular choice. 852's route is about 16.4 km. Even if we disregard 852 due to its abysmal frequency, there's still DTL/CCL/NSL that would easily provide a fast and reliable (albeit crowded) alternative.</p>
              <p>171 to Boon Lay doesn't seem likely, unless the route is converted to express (consider planned upcoming service 500).</p>

              <p>Then it would be a pity if it doesn't merge with 41 (bus company rivalry aside, they can settle some separate swap). </p>
              <p>Rather have a 21+7km to Jurong East than do a 42km round loop and let the route risk bus bunching.</p>

              <p>I don't think terminating at BPJ is the right call. There are
              many takers from BPJ Road/Petir who take 171 to Upper Bukit Timah
              road. They will lose the connection. Beyond that there are almost
              no takers between BPJ town and Bukit Timah road. Hence, logical
              looping point should be Beauty World.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, since mr TIB585L is one of the insiders, either him or the other must be right. I also think not appropriate to terminate at bukit panjang interchange. What we can do now is to wait to see what is the final decision later on. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr hgdep103, I don't think LTA will cut away some services. They may cut short the routes but not withdraw the bus services (trunk services). Up until today, I did not see a trunk bus service terminated for many years. It will surely irk many people if they did not provide any alternatives for them. Just see 76/134 saga will know. Even providing alternative also causes commotion and widely reported in newspapers and online. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
