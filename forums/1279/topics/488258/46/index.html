              <p>Before the arrival of Tower Transit and Go Ahead, there are only
              2 public bus operators: SBS Transit and SMRT. Being in a duopoly,
              the 2 companies became complacent and paid their drivers poorly,
              resulting in the SMRT bus driver strike in 2012. The strike "woke
              up" the government, prompting them to end the decades-old bus
              duopoly and switch to the Bus Contracting Model (BCM), in order to
              bring in new players to improve service level and employee
              benefits.</p>
              <p>In view of the frequent train breakdowns and poor management,
              can we also end the MRT duopoly and switch to the "Train
              Contracting Model"? I would love to see foreign companies such as
              Hong Kong MTR coming to Singapore to kick the faces of SMRT
              management and bring in some improved services...</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, I think we should let Singapore public transport system as in mrt to be managed by our local companies. We should not open it up as well. Local operators should be up to the mark. We should not always think foreigners are the best resort to any problems faced. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>i agree, but they need someone better at the top to run the company..someone with experience... not someone from the army/air-force or navy.... that why i am asking to replace the top management first...  our transport minister is saying that he does not wan to fine the operators.. but without any penalty, the operators does not really care....</p>
              <p>what is the point of setting a penalty of up to 10% of the revenue but does not wan to enforce.....</p>

              <p>MTR also operates Crossrail in the UK, and a number of subway lines in Beijing, Shenzhen and Hangzhou. I agree that MTR is an experienced operator.</p>
              <p>In Hong Kong, MTR focuses mainly on rail operations, while bus services are mostly covered by bus operators KMB, Citybus and NWFB. (There are also public light buses, also known as minibuses.) Since MTR, buses and minibuses are competitors, it's common to see direct bus services and minibus services running parallel to MTR lines, providing commuters with multiple fast and direct options to travel from A to B. In the rare event when MTR breaks down, commuters can easily take buses and minibuses.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, transport operators run both rail and bus operations, and because of that, whenever a new MRT line opens, bus services are "rationalized" to force commuters onto the MRT lines. When the MRT breaks down, commuters are stuck because most bus services are short services or winding services meant to bring commuters to MRT stations, and not meant for direct long-distance trips.</p>
              <p>I feel that SMRT should focus on rail operations only, and SBST and other bus operators should focus on bus operations only. SMRT and the bus operators should be competitors to offer fast and direct services, so that ultimately, commuters have a choice and commuters are the one who win.</p>

Then the sky opened up on Oct 7.</p>
              <p>Mr Khaw <a rel="noopener" href="http://themiddleground.sg/2017/10/17/saying-sorry-badgood-enough/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">said then</span></span></a>: “So we are late by a few days. Had they proceeded to replace (the pumps) this thing might not even have happened.</p>
              <p>“But I suppose that is life.”</p>
              <p>It appears that Mr Khaw was not apprised of the facts at that time. Nor would SMRT have so blithely said that the last inspection of the anti-flooding measures was in June. Someone lied.<strong></strong><em></em></p>

              <p>Somehow, the level of negligence, the bypassing of procedures, the attempt to cover-up and the pushing of blame in SMRT reminds me of SAF. Those who serve NS would know that a lot of things are done for wayang only. To get rid of this "heck care" attitude, perhaps SMRT needs a change of management.</p>
