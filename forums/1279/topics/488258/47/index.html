              <p>Instead of simply pushing everyone to MRT and adding more trains, possibly beyond the maximum capacity (especially for older lines), LTA should really think about introducing more parallel bus routes that serve as an alternative in reasonable time.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, given that svc 500 is still nowhere to be found, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>

              <p>It's not just an issue with the transportation system... a sea change in culture needs to mitigate the burden caused by overpopulation - for example, to facilitate and provide infrastructure for homeschooling, encourage / give incentives to employers to allow work-from-home where feasible etc. - i.e. to reduce the need for daily regular commute.</p>

              <p>Makes sense after second thought, but I still hope not because
                          67 is still the only service from CCK Way to Upp Bt Timah Rd, aside
                          from the one bus stop at BPJ MRT which 974 serves. </p>

              <p>With the introduction of 974, it is possible that 67 will be split and the western half will be run as full SD. Then link with UBT / Hillview / Beauty World is preserved, while the heaviest CCK -- BPJ loading is now tanked by 974 and 983.</p>
