              <p>Actually, for Bukit Gombak, we can re-route 187 to ply into
              Bukit Gombak, to provide a bus connection between DTL Bukit Paniang
              station and Bukit Gombak. This would increase the length of the
              route by a few hundred metres.</p>

              <p>The current route taken by SMRT trunk services in Bukit Gombak is the best solution as it serves a bigger catchment than if it had served the area around the MRT. Otherwise, SBS wouldn't had routed them there if they were to serve Bukit Gombak back in the 1990s.</p>

              <p><br> Even numerous transfers will not take more than 20 minutes (which
              is the time wasted on DTL1 - 10 stops from Rochor to Jalan Besar!).
              Personally I know some people commuting between DTL2 and future
              DTL3, and they already complain about how windy DTL is. They would
              probably not prefer a direct routeÂ even when DTL3 is in

              <p>Perhaps. But there is considerable distance from the blocks bounded between St 31/32/34 to any of the 187 bus stops (if residents were to transfer to DTL). Of course one could transfer via 945, but that adds to the waiting time as well.</p>

              <p>Why would you create a new service for the existing 187 route and divert 187 away? You will have more complains diverting 187 away than creating a new service to serve the MRT side. It is never wise to divert a popular service away from its main catchment, especially one which serves as a feeder for much of its route.</p>

              <p>961 certainly still has its demand even after DTL2's opening. It's 171 that saw a much reduced passenger demand after the opening of DTL2.</p>

              <p>If you looked at my map properly you'd all have noticed that my proposed 171/180 merged entity cuts a rather direct line from north to west. The distance covered is only 25.1km maximum. The changes to 41 &amp; 77 are conditional on the fate of 171, obviously.</p>
