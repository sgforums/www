              <p><br>I fully agree to the extend that it SMRT Buses are not mantained well enough and this deprovement is very disappointing. Look no further than how well Trans-Island Bus Services in the 1990s mantained their good buses. I also agree that SMRT Buses do not take pride in their Bus Services, with clear comparison of many factors that Trans-Island Bus Services did much better, not forgetting the colourful Service Guides created by Trans-Island Bus Services.</p>
              <p>There are sources that say SMRT has invested too much on their Trains which caused the downfall of Bus Services standards but I do not agree to this because the Service standard of SMRT Trains is also not very up to standard based on some experience and many sources. This simply shows that SMRT does not take pride in their Services.</p>
              <p>With this reliable source telling that SMRT is investing in the Shenzhen Zona Transportation Group, I can infer that SMRT is just a cooperation intrested in only profits and further supports the point that SMRT do not take pride in their own Services in Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is another opinion that I would wish to point out. My advise to the merger of Trans-Island Bus Services and SMRT few years back is this. Either you focus in providing good Bus or Train Services. You cannot be providing two in one company if you want to provide the Service really well. I can also tell that if Trans-Island Bus Services did not merge with SMRT back then, there would generally be less shortage of funds in both companies, which results in much better Service standards.</p>
              <p>Running a Transport company is not plainly about maximizing profits. It is mainly about reaching out to the transportation needs of the people as well as enhancing the people's experience and comfort based on feedbacks. All Transport companies should take passenger feedback really seriously.</p>

              <p>There are sources that say SMRT has invested too much on
              their Trains which caused the downfall of Bus Services
              standards but I do not agree to this because the Service
              standard of SMRT Trains is also not very up to standard based on
              some experience and many sources. This simply shows that SMRT
              does not take pride in their Services.</p>
              <p>With this reliable source telling that SMRT is investing in

              just a cooperation intrested in only profits and further supports
              the point that SMRT do not take pride in their own Services in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>There is another opinion that I would wish to point
              out. My advise to the merger of Trans-Island Bus Services and
              SMRT few years back is this. Either you focus in providing good Bus
              or Train Services. You cannot be providing two in one
              company if you want to provide the Service really well. I can
              also tell that if Trans-Island Bus Services did not merge with
              SMRT back then, there would generally be less shortage of
              funds in both companies, which results in much

              <p>Running a Transport company is not plainly

              <p>- Just because TIBS came out with colourful guides would mean that they were better in those days ? SBS had those colourful guides too u know ? So, u r trying to argue that both companies are seeing better days in the past ?</p>
              <p>- Ask any business students and they will tell u.. Which Organisation is not interested in making profit ? The Main objective of an Organisation is to maximise their profits earn so as to show a nice report card at the end of every financial year to their shareholders. Unless u are telling me that SMRT is a charity organisation.</p>
              <p>- Ur are not quite true to say that a company can only focus on just one part of the company. This is not very true. I guess, as a communter of both side of the train system and bus services i can say that 1 side is better than the other.</p>
              <p>- Yes.. Running a transport company is not entirely about earning profits. But bear in mind that as a public listed company, the 1st and most important objective is to earn profits.</p>

              <p>Kiddo again, SBS Transit runs both buses and trains. Since everyone complains about smrt buses, and no one complain sbst buses, do you think sbst trains are bad? Aren't sbst doing to provide both buses and trains service well enough? Please lar, study more before you make any comments. Don't wish people to make comments without using their brain.</p>
              <p>Are you willing to earn negative profits, but taking passenger feedback seriously?<br>Or<br>Willing to earn more profits and close one eye on feedback since everyone needs transport?</p>
              <p>You no need to sound professional down here without knowing anything about business mindset of companies. Either you make remarkable comments or shut up.</p>

              <p>Hurhur, I'm one that depends on the conclusions to score my marks for my papers <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">~ But it depends on SBQ or SEQ. SEQ it's better to write the factors just as a safetynet, SBQ...huat ah, just write conclusion if you know what you're writing (I ever had "failed inference", "wrong example" for the first 2 factors, the conclusion "L5/8", the max mark for the SBQ question).</p>
              <p>As long as you know what you're writing and the rough marking guidelines you should be fine =)...</p>
