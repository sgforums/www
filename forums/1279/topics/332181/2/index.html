              <p>Kiddo again, SBS Transit runs both buses and trains. Since
              everyone complains about smrt buses, and no one complain sbst
              buses, do you think sbst trains are bad? Aren't sbst doing to
              provide both buses and trains service well enough? Please lar,
              study more before you make any comments. Don't wish people to make
              comments without using their brain.</p>
              <p>Are you willing to earn negative profits, but taking passenger
              feedback seriously?<br> Or<br> Willing to earn more profits and close one eye on feedback since
              everyone needs transport?</p>
              <p>You no need to sound professional down here without knowing
              anything about business mindset of companies. Either you make

              <p>This is a necessity. Government should keep the fare low and affordable for all of the citizens to use and not to pluck it to profitability.</p>

              <p>The goal of maximising revenue if I may add, is a pretty common goal as a short term measure, because it indicates consumer votes on the firms' products.</p>
              <p>Having a high revenue thus also indicates a high market share and raises your ratings.</p>
              <p>As a short-term goal, it is usually also associated with the long-term goal of expansion, with the expense of profit in the short-term.</p>

              <p>In case you haven't found out from the equation, there is a positive

                  done by increasing revenue or decreasing costs. In this case the
                  argument was flawed from the start as people argued about SMRT's aims
                  to maximise profits through maximising revenue (which everyone is
                  doing), and nobody bothered to address SMRT maximising profits through
                  minimising costs which people (including you) tried to argue but got
                  everything mixed up. There are some business decisions which a company
                  should make as minimsing costs may not lead to an increase in revenue if it damages your image (like what you've argued) etc.</p>
              <p>Please don't mix maximising revenue with minimising costs as they are two different things which lead to profit maximisiation.</p>

              <p>i believe what they are saying now should still not be off-topic yet because since this topic is talking about smrt investing in another company so there's nothing wrong in discussing about smrt's investments and other related such as cutting cost, profit-making, etc. . i agree, though, that the SBQ discussions shouldn't be here.</p>
