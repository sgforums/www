              <p>i guess so. SMRT invested in Shenzhen to make more profits and
              reduce losses.</p>

              <p>SMRT should be able to invest in other regions as well though. this foreign investment may not necessary reduce losses, but profits will definitely be more.</p>

              <p>Seriously people, just what has the less than stunning Singapore operations in Singapore has got to do with the company's ambitions in being an international player?</p>
              <p>By right, this kind of one-sided comments (what more, those that totally have no relation to the topic in question) should no longer surface. What I am seeing now is hatred towards SMRT blurring you guys' thinking that whatever SMRT does is crap. SMRT buys new buses. Crap - why only 67? SMRT improves train services. Crap - why cannot implement earlier/why not invest in buses instead?</p>
              <p>If the company sees no substantial need to increase its investment in one particular market or sector if it cannot increase its profits, then so be it. Why get so angsty? In fact, a lot of you who voiced out here all take a lot of SBST anyway. I've been surviving in Woodlands well enough. If I am not making noise, why should you? You have many many better choices anyway.</p>
              <p>In fact, I see this investment in Shenzhen as a good opportunity for SMRT to really gain experience which it can bring over to improve its local services. For one, some services by Zona are based on contracts by the local authority. This would be a good platform for SMRT to pick up good points and apply for the gradual opening up of the transport industry here come 2010.</p>
