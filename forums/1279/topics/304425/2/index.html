Yet when peak hour starts, there's still chaos all over the East/West Line. What pissed me off the most is that while they tried their best (but failed) to relief the bottleneck in the East, they had totally forgotten the West side which is operating with trains bursting 100% with loads. The wait to be able to board a train is definitely over 15 minutes.<br><br>My one question is from the Dhoby Ghaut incident and this incident, how well is SMRT and its staffs prepared to put their contingency plans in place during disruption, if there's any?</div>
