It was good for them to provide 40 buses for the shuttles instead of ZERO (During the DBG Fire last yr).

I guess, its obvious that they are always using the same old excuse for the media or the people of Singapore. 1 good example where we could see SBST doing better is the incident last year that happened at Outram. By night time, we all know what was the real cause of the train disruption. Unlike this time. I think SMRT had owe us a very good explanation. </div></blockquote>Wasn't it already mentioned by 7am that the fault was due to a maintanence train? Well, that seems to be what I remember.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What really happened on Monday</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Letter from Goh Chee Kong<br>VP, Corporate Marketing and Communications<br>SMRT Corporation Ltd</span><br><br>WE REFER to media reports and feedback from passengers affected by the train service disruption between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah MRT stations on Monday.<br>.<br>The disruption arose as a result of damage to our rail grinding vehicle (RGV) by a locomotive, the cause of which we are still investigating.<br>.<br>The RGV is used to grind tracks to level uneven edges for a smoother train run. This is performed daily during off-service hours. Due to the nature of the damage and site constraints, the recovery was slow and this was compounded by the fact that we were moving cautiously to avoid damage to tracks so we could resume service after the maintenance vehicles were removed.<br>.<br>Once we determined the extent of the situation, over 300 SMRT staff Â— comprising senior management, engineers, station staff, service leaders and corporate services staff Â— were activated from as early as 4.40am to assist with the provision of alternative transport services and preparations for resumption of train service.<br>.<br>On the ground, more than 100 staff were deployed to supplement staff strength at the affected stations and to assist commuters.<br>.<br>In any situation where service is interrupted or degraded, consumers Â— or in this instance commuters Â— will be inconvenienced and frustrations will arise. When such situations arise, at the operational level, there are many pressing concerns, key among which is the need to connect commuters so that they may continue on their journey and to resume service as soon as possible.<br>.<br>On Monday morning, bus bridging services commenced at 5.38am to coincide with the start of train services to ferry passengers from Pasir Ris, Tampines and Simei MRT stations to Tanah Merah MRT station, where they could continue their journey on the unaffected stretches of the network.<br>.<br>In anticipation of the morning rush hour, we activated more buses, bringing it to a total of 70 buses (40 SMRT and 30 SBS Transit). This was the maximum number of buses deployable without severely impairing the bus services islandwide and we appreciate SBS Transit's support.<br>.<br>In spite of the deployment of these 70 buses, there was still congestion at the stations as the heavy traffic conditions on the roads along the affected stations delayed the pace at which the buses could transfer commuters to Tanah Merah MRT Station.<br>.<br>In order to further ease the congestion, we introduced west-bound shuttle train services to ferry commuters from Tampines and Simei MRT stations to Tanah Merah MRT stations. The train was travelling on the unaffected stretch of the track and had to be driven cautiously. This meant the train was driven in manual mode of 15kmh, instead of the normal average speed of 45kmh.<br>.<br>To help commuters plan their journey, information on the service disruption and alternative travel modes were disseminated through train and station announcements, notices, rail travel information system in the stations and electronic signboards at the entrance of our stations.<br>.<br>In addition, regular updates on the train service disruption were sent to radio and television channels, with the first going out at 5.10am and subsequently at half- to one-hour intervals or as and when new information was available.<br>.<br>With the media's support, there were regular announcements to keep commuters updated of services available during the disruption and to encourage commuters not already in the network to seek alternative modes of transportation.<br>.<br>We recognise there is room for improvement and will take all feedback into consideration when refining our plans. However, as with all things mechanical and electrical, there will always be failures and in this instance, resulting in service disruption.<br>.<br>Under such circumstances, SMRT is committed to directing its energies to connecting commuters to available services so that they can continue on their journey, providing timely updates to commuters, and recovering the system to resume normal operations as soon as possible.<br><br>- TODAY</div>

Nothing else. Even during the small fire at DBG last year, if there wasnt ZB reporting on it, we will never know the reason on why there was train disruption in the middle of the evening peak hour. The reason given at that time was "Track Fault".<br><br>Remember the Great Outram disruption last year ? By evening, SBST admit that there was a problem with the metal rod (or wire) which caused the breakdown of train services between Outram n Harbourfront. Looking back at the incident (OR accident) that happened on 21st Jan. Till date, they are still maintaining their stand that the maintance train had "Broke Down". No further explanation was given by them. Looking through the few replies that they had published in various newspaper, it seems to me that they got no intention to say out the real reasons to what had actually happened on that day.<br><br>Think about it, if there wasnt any photos provided by the media or rather by tamago, do you think we would all know the truth ? If we had relied solely on SMRT press release, do you think we will ever get the truth out of it ? The answer would be a big fat NO.</div>
