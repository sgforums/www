            <div class='col-md body'>well this topic is sorely missing.<br><br>heres a summary of incidents on jan 21 In my opinion and really in my opinion and boy am i not happy opinions<br><br>OWN OPINIONS<br>once upon a night, when smrt are running maintenace trains on their MRT line fixing crooked rails and welding them straight, tightening loose rivets and welding tracks thhat have a huge gap after the days xpansion and retraction, a signalling fault occurs.<br><br>Then a bed pan train used to take up replaced track material rolls into the path of the mainenace train. maintenace trains rolls on then...at 340am BANG. the collisions between he two maintenace locommotives woke residents up in Simei.  (news)<br><br>at 538am SMRT finds that it cannot run train service between Tanah merah and Pasir ris stations due to the two broken things left on track. o it calls up 40 of its spare fleet and rings up SBS to ask for help.<br>END OF OPINIONS and ASUMPTIONS<br><br>by then the press had gotten news of the incident and they sent a staement out saying that it is some mechanical ault n we are investigating.<br><br>by 7am crowds throng the stations in the east like the scenes of the Paris train strikes - where they stopped train services whilst on strike. SMRT offered no help in chiense language. many were left wondering what happened. the buses sent were not enough to meet crowd demands<br><br>after this incident i have formed the opinion that smrt are covering their ***ses and not owning up to a seriuos industrail type incident and are trying to avoid the maximum 1 million fine to be impsoed. i am indeed in poor opinion of SMRT now. Also on the other hand the media could be at fault for repoting that the incident was a mechanical fault and not a clear industrial accident. and in the way they saboh SMRT. both english n chiense dailies reported unknown causes.<br><br>For now i guess we could either beleive the media or stete the opinion that  its an accident like i did<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tamago should know how frustrated I was ! My gf was one of those unlucky people in the morning. I was seeing my gf off at the station. We took 9557C on svc 9 and it was a longest journey to Tanah Merah ever. Usually it took around half an hour. Because of the crowd at Simei (People boarding our bus to Tanah Merah) . At that point of time, the Simei MRT was closed. It took us an extra half an hour to get there. When we got there, it was packed and I saw lots of buses at the opposite direction. we decided to take it to Bedok interchange. It was a good decision, less crowded and my gf managed to get on board the first train (Fully packed) to her work place. She was late for 45 mins. Anyway, I took 24 from Bedok to Tanah Merah and catch one of the shuttle buses from SMRT. It was a Citaro box bendy, the condition of this bus is absolutely DISGUSTING. Dusty seats, bad smell near the rear. F UP bus. I wasn't the only one complaining. Can't remember the rego. The driver was very blurred. Instead of turning to the lane where the Ikea (SMRT bus) stopped, the driver turned into Tampines mall (road leading to car park), lots of people gave us a stare. We stopped just after the traffic light for alighting before proceeding on to Pasir Ris.<br><br>This was my experience. One that will never forget. Luckily the incident happened in the early hours , imagine if one of the trains broke down at peak hours (let say 8am ?) It would be unthinkable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, Charles, heard about the chaos as well. Seems like the drivers themselves are not coordinating well with ground inspectors on where to alight and stuff. And no time to set up queues. Even 70 buses can't do the job.<br><br>the driver of 1080U blur blur turned into the IKEA shuttle stop at 11am (after finishing S shift on Svc 61) and got itself trapped at the curve after all the pax up the bus. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
