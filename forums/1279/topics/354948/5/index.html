              <p>IIRC, the 1st bus for 190 from there should be 5:45am (as compared to the 1st bus from CCK Int which is 5:50am).</p>
              <p>As for your 960 one, late morning I saw it once or twice but confirm the 1st bus will start downroute there too... 960's 1st bus from there is 5:35am iirc...</p>

              <p>Service 184 uses bendies everyday, except Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Do remember 184 doesn't only serve as "school bus", but also connecting bus service from Clementi / Sunset Way / Bukit Timah to Bukit Panjang<br><br>And for your info, the school crowds for 184 will end beyond 10pm due to part time night courses in SIM.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total: 1.17 million</span></p>
              <p>As for SIM ppl, there are also alternative buses to take for to Clementi: 52, 154 </p>
              <p>From Clementi/ Sunset Way to Bukit panjang:</p>
              <p>52, 154 and change 75 to Bukit Panjang. There got rebate if interchange wit another bus.</p>
              <p>Estimated fares:</p>
              <p>184: From clementi / Sunset Way to Bukit Panjang (via NP):</p>
              <p>$1.13</p>
              <p>52 or 154, change 75: '' ''</p>
              <p>64 cents + ($1.03 - 25 cents rebate) = $1.42</p>
              <p>When having NP school holidays, there'll be reduction of 35% &amp; SMRT, SBST provide alternatives to take other than 184.</p>
              <p>To conclude, when having their holidays, 184 can deploy some of rigids, not more, but adequate, whereas the bendies will do 190 as usual to supplement people.</p>
              <p>When school starts, 184 bendies will return &amp; do its own service.</p>

              <p><br> Last time I took 184 was on late Sep or Oct 2008 (can't really
              rmb). It was at night (around 7 to 8pm like that) when I was going
              home from NP to watch my RP's friend floorball POLITE match. The
              bus I took was: TIB860S. There was more seats inside the bus than
              people standing.</p>
