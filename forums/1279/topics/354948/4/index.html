              <p>SBST still face shortage of BCs maybe another batch of foreign BCs? sbst says it needs more time so the QoS report will be splitted into phases.</p>

              <p>Maybe SMRT lesser bus service to control. Thats why the population is quite easy to maintain as compared to SBST. Maybe also better benefits at SMRT.</p>

Due to the poor economic downturn, demand for 190 has fallen tremendously on both weekdays and weekends as nobody goes shopping in the city, opting for heartland malls.  <br><br>The bus is quite empty and there are seats back even if you board from Far East Bus Stop back to CCK. Probably that's the reason. <br><br>On Sunday when I boarded 190 from Choa Chu Kang to Orchard, the bendy bus was empty at Bukit Panjang at 230pm. Probably due to rain.  </p></div>

              <p><br>Working environment is horrible, the drivers are in 2 groups of people, 1 is the type that likes to drive very fast, 1 is the type that likes to drive very slow. Very imminent in feeder services where the headway becomes very prolonged because 1 driver speeds very fast and the one behind decides to die-die stick to his timesheet and gets pushed back due to 150% passenger crowd. As a result the original schedule goes haywire until the break times come in (in feeders you drive for about 2 hours and rest 15 min so for that 2 hours the headway is very very very unstable.)</p>
              <p>Standbys used to have 4 slots per week as ODW slots, now left 2, I even seen 1 before, means the rest of the week that driver rots away in the interchange.</p>
              <p>PRCs anyhow drive buses, time to speed he slows down (when there is nothing in front), reach traffic light he chiong past (when the light is amber). They like to play with time, purposely lambat so that they get to downroute, while other drivers suffer because of their inconsiderate actions.</p>
              <p>Timekeepers hardly use their common sense; poor driver lambats 35 mins (90% of mealbreak gone) and he asks the driver to get a quick bite and then continue driving (by definition of "continue driving" means 2 mins break and off you go again), driver lambats 5 mins and he asks the driver to do downroute (5 stops outside other interchange). Half the time they are dozing off in their comfortable air-conditioned office and they hardly care about inconsiderate drivers (like PRCs as mentioned above) until when I had to personally tell him off that he's messing up everyone's schedule because he anyhow pull their time. Then he go "Oh, that driver in front purposely lambat one ah? I didn't know!"</p>
              <p>So it isn't really nice working for SMRT. Though the pay is quite ok and working hours are very comfortable, but half of the driver population are black sheeps. I believe it applies alot to SBST also.</p>
