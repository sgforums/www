            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.. im new in SGforums... just wanna share with u guys this experience i had with Airebus (shuttle svc to KL, Mid Valley).<br><br>Apparently i saw this coach at DFS Galleria one day and decided to check it out. So i called up the counter at Far East Plaza and the counter staff answered my call... she sounded rather impatient and quite rude. Havent even asked my first question she already sounded so impatient! Then when i went down to buy their coach tickets, the counter staffs there didnt even smile once.

I tried calling the counter a thousand times, no one picked up the phone. Getting more and more worried, i went up to the counter at Far East Plaza (dragging all my luggage). Its only when i reached the counter that moment THEN they informed me the coach broke down and must be sent for servicing, and that means i would have to take another coach up to KL at another timing. Unfortunately they didnt have any timing suitable and i ended up having to purchase tickets from another coach company. I even had to wait a month for my refund!!!!<br><br>How irresponsible can this company be?? Im really disappointed in their services. Somemore this is only my first time with Airebus!

This is unfair to the them. I have used Sri Maju. an Ipoh based bus company for a good 10 years before. No problem. Experience burst tires, broken down buses when travelling with them, but we have to understand that these things do happen, and sometimes beyond the control of the company.<br><br>I have not tried Airebus before. Sure seems like customer service is bad. So other than sharing your experience with us, I suggest you write feedback to them, if you have not already done so. Whether they change or not, it is not important, you have already done your part by giving feedback.<br><br>Also, how much did you pay? I like to take Transtar 1st Class from Singapore to KL. Nice and powerful buses. I made it from Pasar Rakyat to Golden mile in just a little over 3 hours. You should try them. Audio and Video on demand. Meals on board. But I suggest you bring your own headphones.<br><br>Anyone tried luxury tours? Their buses seem to have seats with privacy hoods. Like those airlines business class seats.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I bought return tickets for my friend and myself from tis company, at the time of buying the staff ask me what meal i want on board. So i ask for standard meal for both of us. I forgot my friend is a pure vegetarian(indian) so she did not eat on the way there due to my mistake. When i reach there I went to the counter to ask the staffs to change the food to vegetarian for our trip back. They agreed to change for us, but to our dismay, standard food was served to my friend so she did not eat anything on the way back again. This was so upset.<br><br>On our way back, my friend needed to use the toilet urgently so she went to the lower deck. To her surprise, the staff told her she could not use the toilet as there was no water so it cant flush. The staff told her we will reach the toilet stop in 5mins so she came up to wait. After waiting for 20mins, she really could not stand anymore she went down again, the staff then told her will reach in 1mins time. Another thing, when we reached the toilet stop, the staff announced that will stop for 10mins but we waited for half an hour or so.<br><br>This is the worst experiences we encountered.  :bad:<br></div>
