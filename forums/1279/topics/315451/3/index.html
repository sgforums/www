              <p>Yes, the bus are put on routes they can serve most efficiently, such that the overall cost of running the network is lower, but I don't quite agree with the "more passengers to offset the cost" theory. At the end of the day, whatever bus they put on the route doesn't matter, because the passengers will still take it, and the fare collected is still the same, and the total revenue is the same.</p>

              <p>Before moving on, we must always remember that there are always cost involved in running the bus. If the bus is being put on service where the demand is low (119 for example), how much revenue do you expect to earn from the few students and aunties ? On the other hand, if u deploy the bus (on say 80) where the demand is alot higher than 119. Common sense will tell u that at the end of the day, it is 80 who will be bringing in the extra revenue for the company as compared to 119 which might even incurred loss.</p>
              <p>Yes, no matter what happens, the bus is still running on the road. BUT the fare collected and the total revenue will never be the same. As it is very clear that the demand for different services is totally different (as stated in the example.).</p>

              <p>I think you don't quite get my point. My point is this. For example, if running the trident on 89 or on some other service which require DD, and the other service cost the same to run the trident on it, then it does not matter. So what if 89 might bring in more money, the SUM of revenue is still the same, and the SUM of running the buses is the same.</p>
              <p>So for further illustration, let's say Service 89 and Service 2. Assuming I now have 1 trident and 1 Vo3x. Let's say the cost of running the trident on both routes are similar. It does not matter if I put the Vo3X on 89 or on 2. Because at the end of the day, i have to pay operating cost for both the trident and the Vo3X, and the revenue is still the same. So what if  Sv2 might have higher loadings, and more fare paying passengers compared to 89. I can put the Vo3X on Sv2, and the trident on Sv89. At the end of the day, my profit remains unchanged.</p>
              <p>So my conclusion is, as long as SBST finds the route which is most cost efficient for a certain model of the bus, they will put it on that route. They won't be bothered whether there are higher pax loading to offset the cost. This is because on a macro scale, the revenue is fixed. Put a Vo3X on a route with lower pax loading and a trident on a route with higher pax loading is not the way to go. But instead, it is to find the route which will cost less to run a trident on compared to a VO3x.</p>

              <p><br>Let me put your point in a simplified form and my own views</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operating Cost</span></strong><br>Trident &gt; VO3x. This is fact. No room for argument.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revenue</span></strong><br>Depends on route and pax load.

Bus on timing mentioned here, not pax load.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Utilisation Rate<br></span></strong>However, if it is about the utilisation rate of the bus, I would say both services have their highs and lows in according to a typical weekday. Assuming both buses on both routes have the same utilisation rate, it doesnt matter which bus model you put on the service.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fuel Consumption</span></strong><br>This is where you decide which model goes to which service. Factors considered is route structure (straight route / circuitous route / express route / CBD route) and traffic conditions (start-stop traffic / continuous heavy traffic / moderate traffic / light traffic). These 2 are the key factors in considering which route to put a certain model on. Look at why VSOs are taken off 168.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staff/Company's Decision<br></span></strong>The last point is how powerful the service leader is to be able to convince the starter to allow a certain bus to be perm on his route. Another case is made by the company to put a certain bus model on a service (say B9s and K230s, of course excluding cameos)</p>
              <p>What I feel is that the company is looking at the profit on a per unit basis. Say a trident on S89 - I have these much pax, these much mileage, these much fuel consumption. The pax type travel long distances = pay more, as well as more full paying pax than subsidised pax = more revenue. Compare a VO on S2 - pax load consists of a very even mixture of full paying pax and subsidised pax. They mostly travel short distances except for the Upp Changi Rd North side - hampering on profits. Mileage wise is start stop traffic though its a direct straight route.</p>
              <p>Though i agree the sum of the revenue is the same as the end of the day, however if you look into a per-unit profit basis, its totally different.</p>

              <p>Yes. You've are more or less correct. My point of view is that, HQ will take a macro view. To reiterate, I think HQ does not care about pax load on a specific service. As long as the service needs a DD, then they will put a DD. Now the question of which model of the DD to put on which service, it will depend on the route. They will put the DD with the lowest possible operating cost out of all the different models available. This way, the cost is lowered.</p>
              <p>Only cost can be lowered since revenue is more or less fixed. At the end of the day, they have to run a fixed no. of buses in the network. So the way to go, is to run the same no. of buses with a lower cost. How to do it? Put buses on routes which they are designed to serve.</p>
              <p>Unless they can find a way to put tridents as spares and deploy VO3x in replacement of ALL tridents, and I believe that the day will never come. So, I agree that Tridents are on 89 most likely because they run most efficiently on 89, but this has nothing to do with 89's pax load.</p>

              <p>Seems like you still don't get my point. Let me give you numbers to work with. Assuming that Sv89 brings in $200 per DD slot in a day. Assuming that Sv2 brings in $150 per DD slot in a day. So as to make things simple, we will assume that SBST only operates one DD slot on Sv89 and one DD slot on Sv2 in a day, and SBST has a fleet of 1 VO3X and 1 Trident. So now, let's say it cost SBST $50 to run the trident on Sv89, and it cost SBST $40 to run the VO3X on Sv89. For service 2, it cost SBST $55 to run the trident on it and again, $40 to run the VO3X on it.  This is because the route Sv89 travels on is more suitable for the Trident. Thus what SBST will do is to put the Trident on a route which cost less to run, in this case Sv89. The pax load on either service does not matter because at the end of the day, the revenue is $350. And the cost would be $90, compared to $95 if the trident was to carry out Sv2, and the VO3X on Sv89.</p>

              <p><br>But consider this:</p>
              <p>Wouldn't it be that even if trident and VO swop for say 89 and 74, the number of passengers at the end of the day would still remain equal for both svcs? Both being DDs, let's leave out SDs for the time being.</p>
              <p>So revenue is not a main factor but operating cost is, subject to traffic conditions.</p>
              <p>Although I also believe cost factors are not major factors in type deployment unless the difference in costs become too great to ignore which I believe can hence be overlooked in most cases.</p>

              <p><br>Of course there are traffic lights but there are not so many vehicles on the roads in HDB areas so the bus can travel at normal speed when not at a traffic light.</p>
