              <p>Wouldn't it be that even if trident and VO swop for say 89 and
              74, the number of passengers at the end of the day would still
              remain equal for both svcs? Both being DDs, let's leave out SDs for
              the time being.</p>
              <p>So revenue is not a main factor but operating cost is, subject

              <p>I don't know why you people are arguing over this matter. Let me put it in a VERY simple way:<br><br>Each factor has its impact over another factor and all these factors will in turn affect the decision of the bus companies which we have no idea how they came to it unless you are one of them. In short they are all related. These are strategic decisions which you and I won't know unless any of us is part of the management.</p>
              <p>And I doubt any management level staff will be stupid enough to leak company confidential information here.</p>

              <p><br>They started doing the modifications on the MK3s way in advance, then put them as spares running on routes like 16 and 33 and many others.  When the time finally came for 170 to go FAC, it was followed by a massive flooding of these ex-170 MK2s to various depots e.g AM/BRAM.  Even services like 155 got them too!</p>

              <p>Consolidating what was discussed over the previous two pages, I think we can come down to the point that:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- High passenger loads on Service 89 determines it gets DDs, but is NOT the factor that determines it gets a Trident instead of other models.</p>
              <p>- The route conditions of Service 89 determines that it is suitable and cost-effective and thus more favourable for Tridents to be deployed on them, as compared to Service 119 for example - holding pax demand constant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In other words, pax demand is NOT DIRECTLY related to the decision to deploy certain models of buses (but is related to the type: DD vs SD, rigid vs bendy).</p>

              <p>162 have a fleet addition of 2 A/P. the 2 singledeck from the 162 S Shifts go to the added 2 A/P.</p>
              <p>410 should have an addition of 2 S Shifts for each plate. these should be ADD blocks.</p>
              <p>52 should get : 9030, 9124<br>162 should get: 9006, 9045<br>410 should get 9035, 9091<br>leaving 9133, 9806 and 9826 as sp.</p>

              <p><br>162 should get 1 DD for A/P too... 3 should be enough for 162.</p>
              <p>Push all the Merc out from 162 and give them to DD slots... xD</p>
              <p>DD on 410 should still be on A/P slots... because if they run on S Shift slots the people taking them home from the St 22 stretch will suffer during non-peak hour... Currently the waiting time for 410G is already very horrible ever since they took away 1 bus.</p>
              <p>Whichever bus the services get I'm not really concerned... What I'm more concerned about is that the passenger loads of Bishan/Sin Ming bypass services are lifted.</p>

              <p>I don't know why you people are arguing over this matter. Let me put it in a VERY simple way:<br><br>Each factor has its impact over another factor and all these factors will in turn affect the decision of the bus companies which we have no idea how they came to it unless you are one of them. In short they are all related. These are strategic decisions which you and I won't know unless any of us is part of the management.</p>
