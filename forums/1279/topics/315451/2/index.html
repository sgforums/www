              <p>I do not see the link between exhaust noise and fuel consumption.Exhaust noise depends on brand and type of the exhaust system used. Rather it should be the aerodynamics,which is obviously screwed for bus <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Its not about power or not, its about cost of operating the buses. Tridents have a higher fuel consumption than the other DDs in Singapore. Its either you put it on a service where the load is high for most of the time (like 51, 80, where the cost can be offset by the no. of passengers paying adult fare) or you place it on services like 89 which do not require as much idling/slow moving traffic (which wastes even more fuel) than other services like 74 (which doesn't have an amazing off peak load) and 153. Furthermore, on such services, most of the time, the bus doesn't get out of 1st gear.</p>

              <p><br>Its not about power or not, its about cost of operating the buses. Tridents have a higher fuel consumption than the other DDs in Singapore. Its either you put it on a service where the load is high for most of the time (like 51, 80, where the cost can be offset by the no. of passengers paying adult fare) or you place it on services like 89 which do not require as much idling/slow moving traffic (which wastes even more fuel) than other services like 74 (which doesn't have an amazing off peak load) and 153. Furthermore, on such services, most of the time, the bus doesn't get out of 1st gear.</p>

              <p><br>Frankly I am not surprised that such a motion would surface time and again.  Service 24, 26, 53, 135, 139, 145 etc are long time "guardians" of Mercedes, and it is understandable for bus fans like us to wish to see other models of buses on these services to spice it up. </p>
              <p>(Once upon a time Services 22, 70 and 133 belonged to this league too, until Volvos finally came in over the past year.  And that was because these services had ADDs and hence had rectangular destos).</p>
              <p>But putting aside this subjective view of personal desires, the reason why such services have yet to get Volvos or other models is basically due to<br>- Lack of rectangular destos<br>- Plenty of Merz in AMDEP that the deliberate usage of Mk IV (even as cameo) is not necessary</p>
              <p>So I guess while such desire to "de-Merc Service 24" is perfectly natural, attempting to justify it with a myriad of illogical reasons based on "need" will not improve the situation.</p>

How I wish I can spot at least a AMDEP based Volvo MK4 cameo on these services. Also to add on SLBP services 240, 333 and 334 too.</p>
              <p>Service 70 if I am not mistaken got its rectangular desto and DD desto when it had NAC VO2x. It had been reused on VO3x, LO2x and VSO ever since the VO2x went to SLBP.</p>
              <p>Also for JB bound services 160 and 170 which are using only Volvo MK3 buses, I wonder if Volvo MK4 Striders and DM3500 can be deployed there as well.</p>

              <p>Yes, the bus are put on routes they can serve most efficiently, such that the overall cost of running the network is lower, but I don't quite agree with the "more passengers to offset the cost" theory. At the end of the day, whatever bus they put on the route doesn't matter, because the passengers will still take it, and the fare collected is still the same, and the total revenue is the same.</p>
