              <p><br>Very short haul services shouldn't be getting DDs, one of the reason is what as you said. Commuters wouldn't move up to the upper deck. Those very short route services with very high demand should get more SD instead, I'd rather see a few buses coming together with very good frequency than seeing a DD without many people at the upper deck while the lower deck is jam-packed. One of the good example is service 238.</p>

                  short they are all related. These are strategic decisions which you

              <p>Firstly, I think I have to clarify that there was no arguement between me and anyone involved in this discussion. It was a constructive discussion. So how is it different from an arguement? There was evidently no use of vulgarities or offensive language. Also, there was no childish name calling involved. Lastly, the tone of all the messages were rather obvious that all parties involved had the genuine intention of discussion, and exchanging differing viewpoints.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you, what is the purpose of this forum. Why call it a discussion forum? I see the purpose of this forum as to exchange differing viewpoints, and everyone gets their space to share the viewpoints, and through this, everyone learns. So the whole purpose of this discussion, was to discuss the various possibilities. Sure, we do not know everything, but we can make reasonable inferences and deductions. Give you an example. None of us knows which services are going to get the new WABs. Yet we still discuss it. Does this mean that we should stop doing that? I think not. After all, we come here to discuss what the possibilities are, and substantiate our viewpoints with inferences and observation.</p>
              <p>My conclusion is that, if we were only allowed to discuss things which we have information on, then we would have pretty much nothing to discuss. Either way, thank you for sharing your point of view, and thus giving me the chance to clarify the whole purpose of the discussion.</p>

              <p>Now, If you really want to know what crap is. It is the name calling you do to chickenlittle2. All the ayam and whatever. They are a real eyesore to the forum. You might argue that it is in the past, you have stopped your childish bickering. Fair enough. Then let us all look at this post. On a scale of 10, I think you know where this post of yours stand. Think about it, what is the value of this post. In my opinion, zero. I am confident that most other forum members would rate it in the similar range. I always belive that if you have nothing constructive to say, then don't say it. Think about it. I will not comment anymore. I think the other forum members can judge for themselves about your beahviour. You can reply whatever you like, but unless it is something constructive, I am telling you that I won't be bothered.</p>

              <p><br>Not really......</p>
              <p>Deployment seems to be based on factors besides profits. Hardly any deployment seems justifiable looking at just costs alone.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, it seems to be more about pax if we're talking about WABs and non-WABs, DDs and SDs. These seem to be the only categories of buses deployment seems to be based on.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, it makes a lot of sense. After all, a bus is still a bus that brings us from point A to point B. Fuel consumption, comfort level etc etc will of course be ignored unless the problems incurred are too large to be ignored. So it makes sense that these factors are ignored, or the management will be over-burdened with all these to think of.</p>

              <p>Firstly, I think I have to clarify that there was no arguement between me and anyone involved in this discussion. It was a constructive discussion. So how is it different from an arguement? There was evidently no use of vulgarities or offensive language. Also, there was no childish name calling involved. Lastly, the tone of all the messages were rather obvious that all parties involved had the genuine intention of discussion, and exchanging differing viewpoints.</p>

              <p><br>I disagree.</p>
              <p>Not accepting another person's opinions but being able to justify why is different from being critical but yet being unable to justify why. Looking over at other forums such as Military Nuts, you can see the folks there defending their views vigorously, in fact MUCH more vigorously than here and I do find that I benefited a hell lot just merely reading through the walls of text posted.</p>
              <p>And I do find it strange a lot of people like to put disclaimers like the one in bracket. If you have your views, by all means air it, don't soften the approach. I do know that it is a gentle reminder.<img title="Wink" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"></p>
