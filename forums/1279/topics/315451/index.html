              <p>Hmm.. interesting point.  Would be good if you have fuel consumption statistics to back up this stand - comparing a B10TL vs another model on the same service, and comparing the same B10TL on a feeder route viz-a-viz trunk route, holding one of the variable constant at a time for each comparison ;-)</p>

              <p><br>Frankly I am not surprised that such a motion would surface time and again.  Service 24, 26, 53, 135, 139, 145 etc are long time "guardians" of Mercedes, and it is understandable for bus fans like us to wish to see other models of buses on these services to spice it up. </p>
              <p>(Once upon a time Services 22, 70 and 133 belonged to this league too, until Volvos finally came in over the past year.  And that was because these services had ADDs and hence had rectangular destos).</p>
              <p>But putting aside this subjective view of personal desires, the reason why such services have yet to get Volvos or other models is basically due to<br>- Lack of rectangular destos<br>- Plenty of Merz in AMDEP that the deliberate usage of Mk IV (even as cameo) is not necessary</p>
              <p>So I guess while such desire to "de-Merc Service 24" is perfectly natural, attempting to justify it with a myriad of illogical reasons based on "need" will not improve the situation.</p>

              <p>Adding on to my previous point and attempting to steer this discussion in the right direction,</p>
              <p>If we are looking purely based on the perspective of <strong>"need"</strong> as the title says, then I have the following recommendations:</p>
              <p>- Service 190 and 960 require high capacity double deck buses that offer greater passenger comfort across an expressway journey</p>
              <p>- Service 222 and 291 require bendy buses with three boarding and alighting doors to quicken up boarding and alighting activities along heavy loading points</p>

              <p>Hmm.. interesting point.  Would be good if you have fuel consumption statistics to back up this stand - comparing a B10TL vs another model on the same service, and comparing the same B10TL on a feeder route viz-a-viz trunk route, holding one of the variable constant at a time for each comparison ;-)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, I would very much prefer to see the "sleeper class" reclining seats of the VSOs put to good use on long-haul services (particularly express services).  Shiok!</p>

              <p>But somehow, I find that a VSO seems to make more noise than a VO3x batch 2 or 3 especially on the lower deck. VSOs look good because of Volgren bodywork and the interior, not the engine and I think future buses should have Volgren bodywork. That's why I previouly mentioned for VSOs to be on feeders.</p>

              <p>Noise = due to radiator. In fact, the radiator noise affects many of our Volvo/Leyland Olympian buses.</p>

              <p>Having bendies along such corridors would be more ideal as they allow more efficient boarding and alighting for short-distance, intensive runs.  Another candidate would be the Pasir Panjang / Alexandra to Harbourfront MRT corridor.</p>
