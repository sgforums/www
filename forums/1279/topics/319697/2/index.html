              <p>SG only have 220+ routes mah, plus 40 are JIS/Parks?feeders/Intratown/Townlink and that leaved to 140+ routes for us to take, somemore 10+ routes are still limited operation, so there is a chance to meet each other, is that just we did not noticed each other, maybe sitting side by side, so it was sometime sad.</p>
              <p>Regarding to the bus turning wrongly, do not guide the driver when unsure, sometime it will complicate the situation instead of diffuse it, guide if you die die know route and area, but guiding was quite okay in the end, however standby drivers should be more careful in driving, one day last year, i took 162 to HGINT, the driver is SP so he drived slowly and take 100%attention on the bs and route signs,</p>

              <p>its jus that they may not have gone and tried out those buses, usually they need to try one round to familiarise themselves but sometimes starter give then jus go with the flow. B9TL no need to learn 1. jus need to learn how to operate the WAB facilities in the bus. K230UB no the other hand is different cos of the bumper issue.</p>
              <p>CNG status is so that the Jurong Island Security has approved the following BCs to be able to enter Jurong Island to pump Gas for the B10BLE CNGs.</p>

              <p>There is no VO or LO Licence. There is just DD licence. If a driver is given a LO or VO which he doesnt like to drive, he can always claim that he doesnt know how to drive.  </p>
              <p>As for the B9. There is no certain licence. Just that the BC must go through a lesson so as to know the basic controls of the Bus and on the operation of the ramp.</p>

              <p>At first, I thought it was a chartered bus (Does SBST allow chartered DDs?) but it turned out to be a hopelessly lost 168. Lol. Didnt manage to catch the rego though. Really wondered how the BC ended up in BP. Its so far off its route.</p>
