              <p><br>Lucky for BC he can still exit somewhere else.</p>
              <p>Many years ago, I was taking this 851 home (TIB 0800R - then AMDEP bus). It was at night so rather dark, and plus the Indian BC was talking to his Indian friend that was sitting behind the driver seat. They talked so enthusiastically, the BC forgot to make a right turn. End up the bus went into somewhere near Harbourfront. Luckily someone guided the BC back onto route and by the time we reached Yishun, he was nearly... 1 hour late? Plus with all the jams along the way.</p>
              <p>Sad story for the BC... but who ask him talk so much? =.="</p>

              <p>I remember onboard TIB548U on Service 188 last year June when the BC forgot to turn right to Pasir Panjang Rd (the South Bouna Vista that side) due to fast speed and can't go the right lane , instead he continue and follow 176 route , and try to U-Turn somewhere near Haw Par Villa ... I wonder how if its bendy</p>

              <p>Also posted before but years ago, one 913 bendy exited Woodlands Int and instead of going straight, turned left into the street 911 turns into.</p>
              <p>That was when I caught sight of the bendy entering rear first into a car-park to try to make a U-turn at the street and the process took about 5 minutes.</p>

              <p>Btw, everyone at the 1st bus-stop at JW ave 1 looks puzzled as well as the motorists waiting at the junction as the bus turns right from Jurong Canal Dr... lol <br>Pity those who waited at the 4 bus-stops missed by 8441J. Kinda shocked when BC didnt turn left.</p>
              <p>The best part is only 1 passenger is affected coz he suppose to alight at jrg town hall Rd. My journey cut down by 5 mins !!! and I think I didnt met the BC before...</p>

The other one is this year (forgot which month but I think March), I was on my way home from school when I saw SBS726R on Townlink 293 along Tampines Ave 9 lol and it turned into St 72. that means it missed one bus-stop and that is my former pri school bus-stop.<br><br>p.S: I remember posting this in a thread (seprately)</p></div>

              <p>not consider as drive wrong route, but nowadays, can see 903/911/912/913 all over in Marsiling/Woodlands areas, when there is jam at woodland check points. SL seem to be turning anywhere just to get back to WDL interchange. Usually, 911/912/913 buses will just use admiralty road/marsiling rise/road and then get back to original routes, skipping the part near woodland checkpoint.</p>
              <p>But nowadays, i see Sv 912/913 bus with full EDS at woodland St 13 toward WDL. Sv 912 bus turning right from Woodland Ave 1 to Ave 3 and back to WDL. Sv 911 turning left from St 13 to woodland centre road and then go to Ave 1/Ave 3 and back to WDL.</p>

              <p>Diversions are made automatically whenever there's traffic jam at Woodlands Checkpoint. OT abit.. even with all these diversions the frequencies of some feeders like 912 are still very bad.</p>
