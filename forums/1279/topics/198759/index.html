            <div class='col-md body'>do post any memorable or nostalgic bus rides that left a deep impression in your life.... be they sweet, fun or plain crazy!<br><br>--<br><br>i remember around 1992-3 when they introduced the SuperBuses, i loved to take SVC 51 from the former hougang south interchange. as i had tuition at the tuition centre there, i usually went to the shopping centre, buy myself a happy meal and bring it up to the bus to makan....that was way before they banned eating on buses. of cos being a kiasu primary school kid, i would always chiong to the front and stay there.<br><br>man it was so song cos i felt like superman there, with the cars and trees whizzing by and all. plus the fact that by then i was already a bus nut (my hobby then was collecting the bus guides and memorising all the routes...till this day)<br><br>what a rush!<br><br>--<br><br>hope to read more stories from u guys <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

I enjoyed the bus ride tremendously.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My memorable bus rides is way back in 1996 when i first took the TIBS Hino HT238K on SERVICE 181 from Woodlands Int to Marsiling. I remember that time when i was abt 4-5 yrs old , me and my mother went to took the bus and it was hot and stuffy as it is very crowded , haha...still remember that i could hardly press the Bus stopping bell until someone help me to press it. And also , i feel very sad that i almost fell down from the exit steps of the Hino HT238K .....<br><br>and also , i like those Hino NAC buses back then and it is my first fav bus  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>also , when i first took this Nissan OAC on Service 856 (can't remember what year) i like the seats till now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and the Doors Closing sign too ....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I get a memorable bus ride almost every day... when taking 179 home... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>You see buses horning, swerving, overtaking the lousy Internal shuttle buses, overtaking when going up hills, accelerator flooring, sharp braking(got once, an Indian slid all the way to the front and ended up lying on his back), etc...<br><br>One most recent event I remember(last month), was when a shuttle bus was stopped for no reason on the road... So our driver kept on beeping... It sounded like the comfort taxi system when the driver receives a call - beepbeep, beepbeep, beepbeep, beepbeeepbeeeeee - then the shuttle bus started moving slowly. This was downhill and normally 179 drivers would accelerate down it. But we had to use the brakes instead..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So we followed closely behind the shuttle bus, then that bus turned into the bus stop and our driver had to do the same as someone had pressed the bell...<br>Then for no reason, our driver horned again at the bus in front just before we stopped completely. As the shuttle bus driver started turning out, our driver turned the steering wheel faster and floored the accelerator(it was an LO), and overtook the shuttle bus before it left the bus bay! Then our driver continued to chiong since it was his last morning split shift round... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There was another one earlier this year, when a VO2x and an LO I was in was racing... The VO was leading at first (by probably 20metres), and managed to pass just before the red light. Our LO braked sharply...<br><br>Then later while the VO was stopped completely at a traffic light, our LO managed to catch up and crept slowly towards the traffic light but did not stop. Once the SIDE traffic lights turned red, our driver floored the accelerator, overtaking the VO just before entering NTU! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>(The VO was schelduled to be 3mins earlier than our LO)<br><br>And also yesterday, another VO &amp; LO race(not as fun though)... Too many memorable events... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
