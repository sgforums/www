              <p>Sleep is just a mediocre word. Every hour the truck has to move. So if they were to get proper sleep, whos going to move the trucks?</p>
              <p>I hate the atmosphere. It feels as if its hell. Poor drivers.</p>

              <p>I do pity them at that but what i meant the atmosphere that i liked is a trucker's life. I know how frustrated they are but luckily all truckers are clear and out of Singapore. As of 7 pm today, the jams of trucks have subsided.</p>

              <p>Do expect that hell will break loose on Monday when the work week begins and the jams will come back.</p>

              <p>today there was heavy jam again..<br>at 5pm, the lorries was only lining up along Old woodland rd. but by 7.30pm, the lorries queue have stretch back to mandai estate. however, 178/170/160/960/961/925 was still able to use woodland rd towards woodland direction.</p>
              <p>But today woodland centre road and BKE was in super heavy jam.</p>
              <p>BKE jammed all the way from checkpoint till mandai at least. So lot of 187/963/966 buses were stuck on BKE, plus those CW2/SJE buses as well. SMRT should divert these buses to Turf Club Ave and then use woodland rd (kranji mrt) towards Woodland Ave 3. Woodland Ave 3 (between BKE and marsiling mrt) was also jammed due to the traffic turning into woodland centre rd.. but the right lane was still passable. dunno why so many ppl still want to go to JB?</p>
              <p>also saw 1 Sv 912 bendy turning right into woodland ave 3 (towards WDL int) from Woodland Ave 1 cos woodland centre rd were jammed. i dunno how it continue its trip, but most likely that bus will just go straight and then turn into St 13 and back to woodland centre rd( towards ave 1)...</p>

              <p>Tuesday is the worst for the trucks. The jam lasted all the way from Woodlands till Bukit Timah Road. Was on 960 TIB1088Z , at Bukit Panjang, CCK, BT junction there when i saw the massive jam. Very surprised to see the trucks here at Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah.</p>

              <p>Service 182 towards Boon Lay Int. from Tuas South sometimes may diverted to Tuas West Road due to Heavy traffic at Tuas Checkpoint near Tuas bus Terminal.This is because due to huge numbers of lorries at Tuas Checkpoint.Therefore Service 182 had to skipped the bus stop opposite tuas terminal and tuas checkpoint.</p>
              <p>Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and AYE full of rubbish due to heavy traffic for lorries. But service 160 not affected at Jurong East Interchange.</p>
              <p>Did you know that from Mandai Road to Woodlands CIQ is about 5 km.Thats how the lorries stretch till there.</p>
