              <p>I know MRT is a bit off, but I'm going to share it with the bus experience anyway. Somewhere around last year, when I was still a secondary school student, I took bus 13 with a friend to J8. About 200m before bishan station, an aunty said excuse me while standing up then push me aside. I was carrying big and heavy bag, I almost fall on to 2 girl school mates. I was a little pissed and then I whisper to my friend about how inconsiderate this aunty is, the aunty still got the nerves to turn back and scold me before she alight. Said want to complain to my school, go ahead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An other time is when I was taking MRT back home, I was carrying quite a lot of stuff and no people want to offer me a seat. When reached yishun, I saw a seat which is like 25 cm away from me, I walk towards that seat. Who knows here comes another aunty who is much bigger size than me, ran like lightning to the seat I'm heading and "stomp", she sat down in front of me, pretend that she see nothing and I deserve to stand longer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, what is wrong with the aunties? Is it so difficult for you to give someone who need the seat more than you? Is it so difficult to say excuse in advance and don't push in a crowder bus? Sometime I just think that majority aunties in singapore are most inconsiderate, the minority were tainted by them.</p>

              <p>The bus quite clean but still with cushion-less seats , buses like 764L of 307 still the best in terms of comfort.</p>

              <p><br>Remember to give your kids money for round trip cab everyday when you have them and they need to go to school.</p>
              <p>In fact, that is the very reason you call them public transport and not private. You want spacious, get a private one.</p>
              <p>The only one I had was recently... As usual, I sat at the front of the double deck when I travel. Then this guy come to sit beside me... I tot nothing about it throughout the journey. Then when I alight, I saw that the back was like empty and I was thinking, why of all the seats that were empty that he came to sit beside me... Strange...</p>

              <p>Hmm... Then I tell you that at Little India Station bus stop (towards Bt Panjang/Woodlands), it can be worst as well, but given the frequency of SMRT service I can understand it.. Even when they entered the bus, they still push here and there... Not trying to be racist here but this is the true fact when Service 960 is overcrowded at night especially on Fridays and Saturdays.. Lolx..</p>
