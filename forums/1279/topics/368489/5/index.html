              <p>Try this!</p>
              <p>If you are taking pic only,</p>
              <p>Punggol-ers, take a pic of 581 outside the interchange, and go take NEL to Sengkang. And take LRT to Compassvale LRT stn.Take a pic of 578. Then you take 578 down to the city and take somemore pics of cS svcs. Then you take 579 along the transfer points. Take it to Tampines and take svc 3(or cross the ovrbridge to take 34) back to punggol</p>
              <p>Sengkang-ers. Do the same except or the changing part only, you take a pic of 578 then go punggol to take 581. Then take whatever bus to go back to your home sweet home</p>
              <p>Tampines-ers or Simei-ers, take 579, higlyhly valuable svc, to the city. Take some pictures of cS buses and take 578 or 581 on your wish. Then take the pictures. :)</p>
              <p>And one thing to take note. If you are trying to take the tickets, suggested to take it with a day difference. Try to take the pictures near the interchange, as it will be easier, you can also take the buses going out :) Surely you will get a lot of rewards.</p>
              <p>I will be trying to take some tickets when my mum brings me to the museum(at the SMU there) with my friend. And please... dun "harass" the bus captain.</p>
              <p>Seriously, cS svcs are not really a failure to Tampines-ers and Simei-ers who dun get a really straightforward trip to the city. Mus take mrt transfer here and there then you get there one. Although the fares to me is a bit expensive, but the journey was pleasant too :)</p>

              <p>Might as well you say take pix in the city. There's much much more buses there...</p>
              <p>If you are to clear the CS Svcs in a day, including pix and tix. I think I could suggest you with a better idea.</p>
              <p>Taking pix in the city, then get a ride on these svcs.<br>3 choices<br>1) 578 &gt; 136 &gt; 581 &gt; 579<br>2) 581 &gt; 136 &gt; 578 &gt; 579<br>3) 579 &gt; 3/34 &gt; 581 &gt; 578</p>

              <p>good idea but the route might be too long. 581 will lose out since most residents get a seat on NEL anyway to travel to town, so if 581 goes thru sengkang before going to town, no one from punggol will consider taking it except on the return journey. good thing is, we might be able to save probably 2 to 3 buses from this proposal.</p>

              <p><br>haha, i agree. take NEL cheaper, faster, no jams on CTE etc. if merge, den surely e fares will decrease also since it goes to 2 neighbourhoods, den more ppl will board. haha. budden if merge sk n pgl, why dun merge hg oso wif  ex-551. hahahaha.</p>
              <p>frm wad i noticed, those hu patronize Cityshopper svcs, are only those regulars. weekdays true dere is low ridership. but for wkends, e load can be high. feel tat dey shld operate on wkends instead, den maybe when suntec convention centre gt events e.g. IT fair can bring them back to service?</p>
              <p>but i will truly miss e service. sigh. no more comfty bus rides to town straight frm hse bus stop, can't get to enjoy e scenery anymore as i do get to enjoy in buses. can onli see e black shadows in NEL . yawns.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>which was ur fav CityShopper Service</strong><br>576<br>Why ? from tampines MRT it took me 23 mins to zip to far east Plaza. it offered the fastest way home from tampines with run time sof 1hr 12 mins. today with 576 gone, run times from tampines to my home is now 1 hr 37 mins. chui</p>
              <p><strong>Whcih was your least taken City Shopper Service</strong></p>
              <p>578<br>I have NEL to Sengkang so why need the 578?<br><br><strong>Whcih was the useless City Shopper Service<br></strong>577<br>if i were to take 162 from Ang Mo Kio MRT there to town, the CityShopper only faster by 10 mins. useless lor.<br><br><strong>Ever sit a high loaded CityShopper ride?</strong><br>well i had a svc 581 ride with 37 pax on baord. thats high loading. Almost all seats taken.</p>
              <p><strong>comments</strong></p>
              <p>Maybe Cityshopper shd continue but with minibuses so as to justify operating the service. With small bus .Perhaps so private operator might aply to LTA for Cityshopper? who knows.<br><br><strong>Wish llist</strong><br>i've always wanted a CityShopper from Woodlands, Sembawang and Yishun direct to orchard.</p>

              <p><strong>History on Orchard rd Special Bus Services</strong><br><br>We have here a back in time trip to discover how special  Bus services to orchard have evolved</p>
              <p>1980s<br>No MRT then. the first recorded express service to orchard area was <br><strong>Service 7   Chai Chee/bedok - Demspsey rd Ter(CMPB)</strong><br>The service had an express sector between Changi rd via Nicholl HW and Stamford Rd (Capitol). While not specifically publicised as an express service to orchard, the service is mentioned here. Its partner services 6 and 8 went to Chinaotwn and Shenton Way prespectively using the same express sectors along Changi rds and Nicholl HW. <br><br><strong>Service 390  Airport to orchard</strong><br>Widely publicised in Hotel guidebooks and spead among tourists alike, svc 390 was the serviice to take from the Airport to orchard Rd. Service introduced in 1981.  The service gained AIR-CON status in 1988. Service was withdrawn in 1994. (refer to 1990s section)</p>
              <p><strong>Service 168 (AIR0CON 168)</strong></p>
              <p>in 1985 the service went PARTIAL AIR-CON. Using the comfy Merc OF1417 air-coned buses with Merc O 303 designs of the day, people traveleling to orchard from Ang Mo Kio enjoyed comfy rides in air-con comfort. Withdrawn when MRT started in 1988 or so.<br><br>1990s<br>While 168 faded away apporx 3 years later, a  new generation <strong>Service 162 (Yio Chu kang - Marina Centre/Shenton Way)</strong>appeared. The service ha d a cool express sector along Thomson rd and Newton rd. However said service express sector was cut in early 1996 and the service now calls at all bus stops along Thomson Rd.</p>
              <p>1995 - The Express Services were introduced. 502 518 went to orchard. <br><br>With the demise of 390, <strong>a service 16E</strong> was introduced to as a form of "fast forward" to then svc 16 which was extended to Airport. 16E was <strong>later changed svc no to 36.</strong> Service 16E skipped national Sstadium and went by ECP but served parkway to Airport.</p>
              <p>2000- a second set of Express services were introduced. in Set 2,<strong> Express Service 512</strong> serving Hougang Int, Ave 8 , AMK Ave 3 and orchard was intrduced. however service operated during peak hours only and was directional based. For eg: evening peak operated from orchard to hougang. Svc was cut after NEL started. <br><br>2005 - <strong>fast Forward 14e 174e</strong> were introdcued. also Peak direction based express typed services.</p>

              <p>I WANT MY 579 TO STAY!! IT IS MY ONLY FAST-CONNECTION TO CITY!
              AND 1 MORE THING, 518 IS THE BIGGEST FAILURE EVER!! OVER-CROWDING
              ON THAT SVC DRIVES ME CRAZY! SHOULD USE DDs AND CHANGE THE ROUTE!
              INSTEAD OF THE ECP BRIDGE, ENTER THE CBD FROM SUNTEC VIA RAFFLES
              AVE AND USE THE ENTRANCE TO ECP NEAR THERE!!  </p>
