Do you think itÂ’s worth it to make amendments to the buses just for a small percentage of handicapped in Singapore?<br><br></div></blockquote>1)  No.  I don't think seats should be sacrificed for the WAB.  There are more needy people who need the seats than the wheelchair bound.  Eg old folks, pregnant women, parents with small kids.  To sacrifice the additional space for other needy people to serve the handicapped is not worth it.<br><br>2)  I don't think there's a lot of be done.<br><br>3)  The WABs are adequate enough.<br><br>4)  No.  Although I don't deny that there are wheelchair bound and handicapped members in our society, and it's a good effort not to stigmatise them because of their disability and to integrate them into normalcy (e.g. being able to use public transport) and society, I feel it would not be fair to the able bodied bus commuters who are rushing for time during peak hours that the travelling time increases  (I hope I don't seem too heartless...please don't flame me).  I believe it would be costly to refit buses just for the convenience of a 'minority' group of people, and we aren't even sure if the facilities would be fully utilised.  Why 'penalise' the majority?<br><br>I think the WABs are mainly cosmetic in nature in an attempt to showcase ourselves as moving towards a more gracious and accepting society.  But if your trip is being delayed due to a wheelchair bound person, and you are already feeling impatient, how gracious could one get?  One could end up being disgruntled and pissed, and some will probably be cussing &amp; swearing at the poor disabled fella in silence.<br><br>Well...to conclude, good attempt to try to build a gracious society.  But then again are Singaporeans innately gracious?  Or has a fast paced and meritocratic environment changed our hearts &amp; character?  Rather, education from young would be better.<br><br>If there's anything that really needs to be done, it should be about helping the wheelchair bound with their own private transport...making vehicles affordable to them.  I think that would be a better solution altogether.</div>

If you see others handicapped, give up your seat cos they need it more than you, that is if you're not handicapped. I'm sure handicapped ppl don't take much time to take a bus.
