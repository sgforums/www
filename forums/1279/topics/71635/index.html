            <div class='col-md body'>Recently many (Adshell) bus stops have bus guides posted on one of the advertising panel.<br><br>It's good to have these bus guides, they are very informative. However who pay for these bus guides? Adshell, LTA or bus companies?<br><br>How much they spent on these bus guides? Imagine revenue loss by Adshell as one of their advertising panels are now replace with bus guides.<br><br>Or LTA pity Adshell and buy the advertising space from Adshell?<br><br>If bus companies paying for the bus guides, then as a commuter, I would rather bus companies not to spend on such 'Added Services'. Ultimately bus commuters pay for such 'Added services'.<br><br>Whoever comes out with such bus guides have thought about the maintenance issues? Bus companines will now think thrice to amend/add a service.<br><br>Who pay for those bus guides?</div>
