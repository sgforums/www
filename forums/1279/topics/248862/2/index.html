Pls la, if u r so free, create ur own deployment page on ur own webpage! Actually I think u r very free, u use most of time to edit sgwiki. R u very lonely, like to do this? r u still schooling?

SBS9318B is red &amp; white, and is with a 'T100' word. SBS9417Z is yellow, and is with a 'W-series', and a larger 'W55' on it. Surely it is different from the old Sony HD 1080 Handycam ad in white? And, Sony will keep producing newer ads. So are you gonna put 1st Gen, 2nd Gen...... until 100 Gen? Wake up.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> The extra is YOU, only know how to complain, never see anything good come out from you. Only know how to point fingers. Why? Want to be king? Maybe only after you learn how to spell.<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Brown:</strong></span> You only used SBS9012H as an example. Anything else to back you up? Show me what else I edited. Prove it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> Challenging me? Your english also got problem. 'He would soon but all the VO3x in one list'. So are you saying that I will put all the buses in one list?<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> Who in the world is free? Maybe babies. Oh yes I forgot, chickens too.<br><br><span style="color: cyan;"><strong>Cyan:</strong></span> More like it is you that is the one who is so free. I think you also very lonely, create this thread and flame me, just to attract attention. Same as forum_dude, always post in Caps. You should be the one that should do your homework, should give you some spelling lessons.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Indigo:</strong></span> Why should I respect you when you are not respecting me? Call scolding someone respecting a person. Never practise what you preach.<br><br>To end off, so what if I'm wrong? Can say it in a nicer way? Your words are very rude. You are making me pissed off. If whatever I do is wrong, then say so. I am not you, you are not me either. How is anyone to know what is wrong when nobody says so in the first place. Only when I do something wrong, then you come and flame me. Never even say what is wrong, then come and say I am wrong. What absurdity is this? You are blasting me, call that not wrong? You really make asinine remarks.</div>

SBS9318B is red &amp; white, and is with a 'T100' word. SBS9417Z is yellow, and is with a 'W-series', and a larger 'W55' on it. Surely it is different from the old Sony HD 1080 Handycam ad in white? And, Sony will keep producing newer ads. So are you gonna put 1st Gen, 2nd Gen...... until 100 Gen? Wake up.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Red:</strong></span> The extra is YOU, only know how to complain, never see anything good come out from you. Only know how to point fingers. Why? Want to be king? Maybe only after you learn how to spell.<br><br><span style="color: brown;"><strong>Brown:</strong></span> You only used SBS9012H as an example. Anything else to back you up? Show me what else I edited. Prove it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Blue:</strong></span> Challenging me? Your english also got problem. 'He would soon but all the VO3x in one list'. So are you saying that I will put all the buses in one list?<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Green:</strong></span> Who in the world is free? Maybe babies. Oh yes I forgot, chickens too.<br><br><span style="color: cyan;"><strong>Cyan:</strong></span> More like it is you that is the one who is so free. I think you also very lonely, create this thread and flame me, just to attract attention. Same as forum_dude, always post in Caps. You should be the one that should do your homework, should give you some spelling lessons.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Indigo:</strong></span> Why should I respect you when you are not respecting me? Call scolding someone respecting a person. Never practise what you preach.<br><br>To end off, so what if I'm wrong? Can say it in a nicer way? Your words are very rude. You are making me pissed off. If whatever I do is wrong, then say so. I am not you, you are not me either. How is anyone to know what is wrong when nobody says so in the first place. Only when I do something wrong, then you come and flame me. Never even say what is wrong, then come and say I am wrong. What absurdity is this? You are blasting me, call that not wrong? You really make asinine remarks.[/b]</blockquote>You still do not know ur mistake. U just want to push away all ur problems but just no one recongise it and think that u r rite! My words are strong to wake u up! Why u just want to behave so childish and just dun want to listen to the others. Are u living in ur own world? When I say ur spelling got problem then u  point me back. U know how childish u r? U still put ur hatred on ur personal msg. From this, everyone would know that u r guilty of it and not knowing ur mistake! I am very disappoint by ur acts. Saying things like being a king. Haiz.. this shows that u are very shallow and low class!!<br><br>Taking about the Sony HD cam ad on SBS 9318B, u think would the technology of HD be stay on 1080 for 100 gen. If it is like that, I guess u would be eating air by now and not using high-tech computers! How can Sony advertise for more yhan 100 times for the same HD 1080 cam? We just want to show that Sony had make a new generation ads for HD 1080 series handycam.This second gen ads is still advertise on HD 1080 cam but different models. As they cannot just release one handycam and advertise for 100 times the same cam and technology! I tell u wat, read up more books and stop the editing in sgwiki. Technology would always improve. How can it last for 100 gen!<br><br>Lastly, just want to tell u to be more practical. You can still make changes! First thing u got to do is to ask us for opinion before u decide to make any changes.<br></div>
