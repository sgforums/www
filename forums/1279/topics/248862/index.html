            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS9806J:</div><div class="quote_body">It has already been changed into a link. I am the one who get pissed off by you. Shall I change my sig to ''chickenlittle2 hater'' or create a thread ''chickenlittle2 writing nonsense''? Like it? And FYI I only removed the link, not delete the page. You could easily have put the link back. So you are daring me to merge all the VO3x?<br><br>For the one status not confirmed, I put ^^^. Never see it? Blind ar? When did I put<br>SBS9229A (SLBP 143), or<br>SBS9303T (SLBP 143), or<br>SBS9318B (SLBP 143)<br><br>Talk rubbish man. This is what I really put:<br>SBS9229A (SLBP 143)^^^ (former SLBP SP &amp; BBDEP 196)<br>SBS9303T (SLBP 143)^^^ (former SLBP SP &amp; BBDEP SP) - Aviva Open<br>SBS9318B (SLBP 143)^^^ (former SLBP SP &amp; ARBP SP) - Sony Handycam T100<br><br>What have you got to say? I have exposed you as a liar. Don't belive me? Check it yourself. You are very irritating. Only know how to kick up a fuss.<br><br>Pissed off? Might as well get so angry until your blood vessels burst. So petty for what?<br><br>Still want to argue?</div></blockquote>So u mean I am accusing u.. Pls la u, so u merge mercz OAC, CAC together and u think u r right la? So wat if u leave the link there? U had already change it wat, without asking us! I was very angry about this!! I never mention anything about 3 buses on svc 143. Why? r u guilty about it? I am talking about other things u editied! BTW, if i not wrong the ads on SBS 9318B should be the 2nd generation ads of HD handycam. Examples like this <a href="http://www.sgwiki.com/index.php?title=Volvo_Olympian_3-AXLES_II&amp;curid=2256&amp;diff=57033&amp;oldid=57024" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgwiki.com/index.php?title=Volvo_Olympian_3-AXLES_II&amp;curid=2256&amp;diff=57033&amp;oldid=57024</a>. I dun understand why u want to edit it? U can just add the model no? It is the 2nd gen of sony's HD ads! That is the key point! Why u cancel it away? Like SBS 9012H which u changes from SL to BR! U dun want to ask for our preference and u just edit it! Not funny lor, since u like to edit so much u can create ur own deployment as we need not need <strong>"U"</strong> to be an extra by editing the whole sgwiki deployment list. I create this thread is to stop u frm doing all these stupid acts. Hey guys, I bet he would soon but all the VO3x in one list! BTW, there are some funny members who add aircon and non aircon on svc 154. Obviously, all the VO2x are non- aircon, why need to add that? Then V)3x and LO3x are all aircon wat! Pls la, if u r so free, create ur own deployment page on ur own webpage! Actually I think u r very free, u use most of time to edit sgwiki. R u very lonely, like to do this? r u still schooling? Then pls do ur homework first! U should respect others before editing what u want!!!!!!</div>

Wat is their purpose to do this?  r u talking rubbish? r u being childish here? It would not cause any death. Just like if u fail ur exam or fail in ur work also would not die!

Its not as if you will die with rules, the rules I suggested isn't anywhere near the rules communist leaders imposed on their people.<br><br>Its not that you are not supposed to do things, but consult people in this forum, or SINbus or Businfohub.com for a confirmed one. see all the flak you recieved after editing things. Not everyone knows this forum, but YOU know, and you do know that there are many people here who uses sgwiki and relies on sgwiki for deployment. Have you consulted others before doing such a major edit like merging DM merc deployment page?</div>

If many people are complaining about you, shows that they don't like you, not that they are dictators. Its democratic, because people say their opinion against you.
