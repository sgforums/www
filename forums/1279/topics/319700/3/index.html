              <p>Good for 242 and 243 get K230. I seriously don't mind squeezing
              and standing for a short journey. But please let us
              have a seat on long journeys. However, I cannot understand why 502
              is getting K230, because 502 is an Express service, and you pay the
              express fare to stand. Unless you are telling me that 502 is going
              to be a WAB service.</p>

              <p><br>Don't be so naive. SBST have the right to choose the services they want to deploy the KUBs on. You don't like doesn't mean others also don't like. There might be more cons than pros of KUBs in your opinion, but it is still a bus which needs to ferry passengers. Stop whining.</p>
              <p>S5 S9 are very suitable candidate. Currently there's no WABs passing by Changi General Hospital. S15 and S33 too. I don't want to further speculate.</p>
              <p>If bndep is fated to get, just stop making so much noise over this model. Enough is enough. Grow up.</p>

              <p>We can do without the anti k230 comments from that person. If you dont like the bus , fine just leave with it. I can tell you. The more you whine , the more you will see the bus on the svc. Dont bet against svc 9 not getting the k230 bus.</p>

              <p>Actually, i have both likes and dislikes about K230UB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, the K230UBs in 80xx series and the first lot of the 81xx series (Count in SBS8888D).</p>
              <p>They don't have the front seat next to the BC and I really don't like it, serious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, the suspension. BCs don't like the 'low-rider' kneeling feature. I mean, some even don't know where the hell is the kneeling button when the infamous SLBP redeployments took place in early May.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, from what I observed from chatters by children and young kids, they liked the bus as it is the bus that always 'bounces'. (They are refering to the kneeling feature). Actually, kids would always exclaim, 'New Bus! New Bus!' and some would even beg their parents to let them have a ride on it. This happens every time a new bus is being deployed. (K230UBs, B9TL, VSO)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, the sound of it. It is a unique bus sound and indeed, other countries are running them. Arriva UK purchased them and they are also found in New Zealand. Well, of course not because of the sound that they are a sought after bus overseas but due to it being Euro-IV and being made by a reliable manafacturer, Scania. More reasons can be suggested for this that I can't even think about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, you guys may want to know that a friend of mine is doing a model of it as a school project. And not suprisingly, he's also a bus fan. I bet only a few of us know him as he never is a member here in a matter of fact. For those going for the Bus Fan Amazing Race next Saturday, that's the chance you can meet him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: Sorry for being a little too 'off-topic'.</p>

              <p>Before u go any further mind if you go through your mind and think about the following question first before u start to post stuffs inside this thread ? <br>- How many units of B9TL did SBST buy in the 1st place ? And how many K230s did they buy ?? <br>- Even if they "Hope" to deploy a B9TL on svc 30, where on earth are they going to get B9TLs for the service ?</p>
