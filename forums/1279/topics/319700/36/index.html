              <p>i beg to differ though. sv64's 8064p, 8067g were once the worst within its fleet. 8064p had violent vibrations and suck air like a vso, while 8067g had bad virbrations and a rough engine. But hg technicians fine tune these problems and now, they are running perfectly well</p>

              <p>Imagine....if a fault is found in the K230UB.....isn't that stabbing yourself in the foot if the fault is repeated in 899 other buses?</p>
              <p>But 900 buses of the same type would make mainteinance easier.</p>
              <p>Oh well, there are benefits as well. Perhaps Scania AB dangled a carrot, probably in lower unit costs.<img title="Laughing" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>And your story continues on, chapter after chapter its always "Scania KUBs".</p>
              <p>Don't know when you can start accepting them.</p>
              <p><strong>"I believe even non-bus fans would be complaining everywhere on the Stomp Portal."</strong></p>
              <p>Go on and complain lor, if you don't like the bus, then don't take lah. No bus, complain, give you bus, still complain, then walk lah.</p>
              <p>Maybe SBST should consider full fleet SD replacement as SBST K230UBs. Then it will knock some sense into your brain.</p>
              <p><strong>"Now, I can only wish that this new batch of KUBs will vibrate less, smoother braking system, better suspension and have more seats."</strong></p>
              <p>I already said so many times. Got a view? Drop an email to SBST lah! =.="</p>
              <p>Since you like to talk so much about the technical aspects of it, why not you apply for a job in SBST mechanics and you can CRAP all you want about K230UB everyday to your colleagues? ^^</p>
              <p><strong>"They should consider buying more DDs, to cope with population increase and improve passenger comfort. If they just want to order SDs, why can't they order something different, like the MAN, B7RLE or Mercedes."</strong></p>
              <p>1) If they are doing SD &gt; DD replacement, you sponser them the funds okay?<br>2) Drop them an email lah. Why complain so much here when no action would be taken? Not as if SBST CEO surfs <a href="mailto:Buses@SGF"><span style="color: #000000;">Buses@SGF</span></a> everyday...<br>3) The K230UB to me is already comfortable enough. It's only with people like you that are so materialistic that you want everything to go YOUR WAY.</p>

              <p>As much as it's a disappointment to many, there's nothing much we can do. Please do not ask such a thing as to WHY SBST chose Scania instead of Volvo, Mercedes or MAN. They buy buses not to please us. And when I say us, it means <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span></span>. If it makes economical sense for SBST to buy more Scanias, why shouldn't they?</p>
              <p>And what if more B7RLEs or 18.240s are bought? Does that mean that the buses will have more seats as compared to the K230s? If you think 900 Gemilang-bodied K230s are eyesores, by all means, go and lock yourself in the storeroom, please. Stop thinking that the world revolves around you, and you only.
