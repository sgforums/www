              <p>Regarding the wheelchair accesible buses, there is an opinion so far that I would like to ask the company and all the folks here about; why designate a service WAB or not?</p>
              <p>Looking at Hong Kong, I do not assume that there are specific WAB services or not. Majority of their buses are WAB now, but back in 1999 when such buses were introduced, I do not recall any specific services and refusal to take passengers in wheelchairs (PIW) that happened there, at least not from the mouth of my relatives there!</p>
              <p>Back here, the reason that SBS Transit gives is that some services pass by bus stops which are not wheelchair acessible themselves. Now, we assume that the passenger somehow, on a wheelchair, managed to access that bus stop himself. Then he flags the bus, the bus captain tells him sorry, you cannot board, cause this service is not a WAB service, yes I have a ramp and one/two places for you, but company says no means no...</p>
              <p>This would be a different scenario when a passenger in wheelchair boards the bus and wants to alight at a bus stop which is deemed not wheelchair acessible, and gets stranded there. For this, I can understand the related company's action for not allowing him to board at the first place; in providing the passenger a smooth path to his destination, they disallow him to board in the first place.</p>
              <p>But with more and more WAB around, would this small detail be ignored for humanity sake, that passengers who are wheelchair-bound be allowed to travel on board? Sometimes this issue is much on a grey area; I remember when I was still in my poly attachment and working at Funan IT Mall, there was this wheelchair bound passenger on board SBS8055R, and this was before s174 became a 'WAB service'...</p>
              <p>So is it time we throw away the 'WAB service' designation? Your opinions and views guys. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Agreed.They should make all bus stops as WAB friendly status unless it is impossible for it to be. If they are making Singapore into a WAB/ accessible state, there'll be adjustments here and there in the future, such as making new bus stops to replace the bus stops that are not WAB accessible nearer to the original location.</p>

              <p>I think everyone is only interested with the WAB Logo in the EDS. Only the direction towards Clementi has it. Towards Hg Ctrl don't have the logo. Seems cool!!</p>

              <p>Regarding the wheelchair accesible buses, there is an opinion so
              far that I would like to ask the company and all the folks here
              about; why designate a service WAB or not?</p>
              <p>Looking at Hong Kong, I do not assume that there are specific
              WAB services or not. Majority of their buses are WAB now, but back
              in 1999 when such buses were introduced, I do not recall any
              specific services and refusal to take passengers in wheelchairs
              (PIW) that happened there, at least not from the mouth of my
              relatives there!</p>
              <p>Back here, the reason that SBS Transit gives is that some
              services pass by bus stops which are not wheelchair acessible
              themselves. Now, we assume that the passenger somehow, on a
              wheelchair, managed to access that bus stop himself. Then he flags
              the bus, the bus captain tells him sorry, you cannot board, cause
              this service is not a WAB service, yes I have a ramp and one/two
              places for you, but company says no means no...</p>
              <p>This would be a different scenario when a passenger in
              wheelchair boards the bus and wants to alight at a bus stop which
              is deemed not wheelchair acessible, and gets stranded there. For
              this, I can understand the related company's action for not
              allowing him to board at the first place; in providing the
              passenger a smooth path to his destination, they disallow him to
              board in the first place.</p>
              <p>But with more and more WAB around, would this small detail be
              ignored for humanity sake, that passengers who are wheelchair-bound
              be allowed to travel on board? Sometimes this issue is much on a
              grey area; I remember when I was still in my poly attachment and
              working at Funan IT Mall, there was this wheelchair bound passenger
              on board SBS8055R, and this was before s174 became a 'WAB
              service'...</p>
              <p>So is it time we throw away the 'WAB service' designation? Your
              opinions and views guys. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I agree. Look at SMRT. They have no such thing as WAB service. They accept PIWs even if the bus is on a cameo.....</p>
