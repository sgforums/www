            <div class='col-md body'>it is a system being tested on selected SBS Transit services (i only noe Svc 88 so where is 180P from?) whereby the console checks whether the driver is following his trip schedule closely or not. it uses the current position of the bus &amp; compares it with the schedule to determine if the driver had drove too fast or too slow. from my observations, it is 5 mins faster or slower it will beep loudly once, and the same for 10, 15, 20 mins and so on. so far there are varying indications on the console screen. pulling into pasir ris int, it once showed "+45" and another time it showed "+10".</div>
