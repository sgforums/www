              <p>Looking at this state I will suggest cancelling this event.</p>
              <p>This is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">SG</span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">TRAINS </span>leh</span></strong>!</p>
              <p>SGTrains is able to host such events because it is organised by a large party of admins, and these events are approved ones. With a fixed number of helps and lots of planning beforehand, they are then able to conduct such activities for the SGTrains committee.</p>
              <p>However, in SGForums where can you get the desired number of people who are willing to go for the race? Worse still, you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MAY NOT EVEN</span></span></strong> host this race and expect others to host it for you?</p>
              <p>It is super <span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>S</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANGE</span></strong></span> that you are the one who wanted this event and yet you wanted others to host for you?!!</p>
              <p>Also, hosting major events is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">NOT A JOKE AT ALL</span></strong></span>! Hosts are expected to be free on the exact day of the event. Also, hosts should already have fixed a date before even mentioning about the event, not choose a random date and expect people to join.</p>
              <p>Who are going to be responsible for the safety of the participants btw? You have a limited number of helps. In SGTrains there are cameramens who follow the participants, and maybe they will ensure their safety? Who knows? But in this case? Who's going to be responsible? You can't track down the locations of all the participants rite? Even if you can, you gonna end up with extremely high phone bills.</p>
              <p>Planning major events is much tougher than you think. Don't host an event just because some organisations host it and you find it interesting to host. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY</span></span></strong>! You need to calculate the expenses for this race and who's going to pay for it. Don't expect the helpers to help you pay hor. Even your helpers also run away liao, what do you expect? And don't ask me to help hor, though I'm your friend, I'm not going to do it this time round.</p>
              <p>Lastly, looking at this state right now I dun think anyone will want to go for this race, purely just by judging from the responses, and the number of dislikes received for your video. Even those who didn't mention anything will mostly think it's just crap. You want to host on June, on December 2013 somemore? Please lah! ä½ è¿™ä¸ªæ¯”èµ›éƒ½æ�žä¸�å®šäº†ï¼Œè¿˜æƒ³è¦�ç»§ç»­ä¸¾åŠžï¼Ÿåˆ«å¤ªå¤©çœŸå•¦ï¼�</p>

              <p>He is SBS3174M. His brother is the SGTrains guy SBS6060M. This guy SBS3174M already got bombarded by people scolding him and now is very despo, creating several new accounts to bribe people into other things. You think this stupid race of his is really a race? If you truly believe this is a race, then I shall conclude you're dumb and stupid. His aim for this fake race is to attract attention and satisfy himself. Not to mention, the SGTrains guy SBS6060M is his brother SBS3071B, which is 8 years old. Plus this kid over here always boss people around like we owe him money. Agree with you, how amazing it is for him to think about this race when he can't even attend this stupid race. Plus he said 'bring $10'. You think $10 is enough to last a person's transport fee if go to Kortaya? Please lah, 30 bucks not even enough to last day's expense for me. This kid and his brother always copy photo, copy video and copy what people said, post it here and never give credits. Not only did they never gave credits to the original owner, they also claim the rights to themselves and go believe everything what BIS posted. Not everything BIS posted is true, goddamn, kids nowadays. Anyone stupid enough to attend this race, I assure you, only you and the stupid ones will turn up at Yishun Int and the organisers for this event will not show his presence. His form of registration, when you click it, nothing comes out, only an error. He thinks that that stupid form of his can bribe everyone into going. Lastly, this amazing race of his is nothing mor than just scam.</p>
              <p>To SBS3174M and his brother &amp; clones: If you wish to fight back and deny every fact I said about you, then you're as redundant to talk to as Jason Lim/Rachel Lim. Your entertainment for all the stupid threads you've created does not pay off at all, stop all this nonsense and concentrate on your PSLE next year. Everyone has better things to do than listen to your nonsense and entertain them. I suggest you to stop as if you scam in the future, like how you're attempting to now, you can get arrested by the cops and thrown into prison. You know you've failed and should seriously stop it now, because I exposed your ulterior motive of 'organising' this scam race. Plus you're a kid, you think you can pay for everyone's bills. Speaking facts, even JB owes you. If he wants to hold a concert, he would have to pay the bills himself, not like you, asking the participants to pay the bills for you. You know what is åŽšè„¸çš®?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Looking at this state I will suggest cancelling this event.</p>
              <p>This is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">SG</span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">TRAINS</span> leh</span></strong>!</p>
              <p>SGTrains is able to host such events because it is organised by
              a large party of admins, and these events are approved ones. With a
              fixed number of helps and lots of planning beforehand, they are
              then able to conduct such activities for the SGTrains
              committee.</p>
              <p>However, in SGForums where can you get the desired number of
              people who are willing to go for the race? Worse still, you
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MAY NOT EVEN</span></span></strong> host this
              race and expect others to host it for you?</p>
              <p>It is super <span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>S</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANGE</span></strong></span> that you are the one who wanted this event and yet you wanted
              others to host for you?!!</p>
              <p>Also, hosting major events is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">NOT A JOKE AT ALL</span></strong></span>! Hosts
              are expected to be free on the exact day of the event. Also, hosts
              should already have fixed a date before even mentioning about the
              event, not choose a random date and expect people to join.</p>
              <p>Who are going to be responsible for the safety of the
              participants btw? You have a limited number of helps. In SGTrains
              there are cameramens who follow the participants, and maybe they
              will ensure their safety? Who knows? But in this case? Who's going
              to be responsible? You can't track down the locations of all the
              participants rite? Even if you can, you gonna end up with extremely
              high phone bills.</p>
              <p>Planning major events is much tougher than you think. Don't host
              an event just because some organisations host it and you find it
              interesting to host. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">DOESN'T
              WORK THAT WAY</span></span></strong>! You need to calculate the
              expenses for this race and who's going to pay for it. Don't expect
              the helpers to help you pay hor. Even your helpers also run away
              liao, what do you expect? And don't ask me to help hor, though I'm
              your friend, I'm not going to do it this time round.</p>
              <p>Lastly, looking at this state right now I dun think anyone will
              want to go for this race, purely just by judging from the
              responses, and the number of dislikes received for your video. Even
              those who didn't mention anything will mostly think it's just crap.
              You want to host on June, on December 2013 somemore? Please lah!

              PLAN!</span> </span></strong>If you think hosting events is so
              easy, please think carefully again. That's all I can say.</p>
              <p><strong>To <span style="color: #00ff00;">^tamago^</span>, may I
              request this thread to be locked, cos' this event is definitely
