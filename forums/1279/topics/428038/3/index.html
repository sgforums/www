              <p>You believe 8 min freq is comfirm 8 min? Please i live in a feeder serve area i know the timing more then you. Recently the headway freq for feeder is more then 8 min. if you pull bus out it will result in more and more people getting delay. As if you know what you are talking. If you believe pulling bus from feeder to other service then what about those waiting to go home using feeder? Those SP Buses are fake de ar? You say as if there spare buses. Each depot has a few spare buses if i remember correct as state in sgwiki. If those are not spare then keep as spare for? Cleaning your house? I believe SBS will had some back-up driver that can be use if encounter this kind of emergency stituation. If you are so smart into this plan it for me to see. See how smart you can plot this.</p>

              <p>I never state put buses from 30.. you are the one stating it yourself. I only state that if you want to pull feeder can. At least state the whole of boon lay feeder service, instead of not stating only 1 or 2.....</p>

              <p>emergency pick up? where is the jam located? let say at clementi
              road, by the time SLBP find a BC, drove the bus to Clementi road,
              it will take around 35-45 mins? and you wont know how long the
              buses will jam? and it will difficult to pinpoint where to start
              for the emergency trip?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>That why i say i hope that SBS can think of such solution by having some spare driver. I believe it not so difficult to find some. So SBS Can prevent this kind of things from happening again. I had state earlier in my post. As for jam. You can't pinpoint the location but i believe some of the area can be use for emergency pickup. Example It delay is from boon lay int due to jam alone Boon lay way, Can sent 1 
              bus to start trip at Lakeside or taman Jurong. If not when the late bus 
              reach boon lay it will absorb the passenger and those waiting alone the 
              way. Like that will cause the bus to be full and more passenger to be 
              stuck. I believe SBS will think of this too.</p>

              <p>For 178 I admit the freq might be 17-20 minutes but atleast the drivers have enough time to have their mealbreaks. Don't have to do downroutes. That schedule follows sundays schedule indirectly.</p>

              <p>852's frequency is HORRENDOUS. And during non-peak, you wait so long just to find that the bus is only half full.</p>
              <p>Mind you feeders are not spared too. 945 somewhat affected because of some 'maximum 4 buses' rule. Frequency may more than double on some instances.</p>
