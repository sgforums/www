              <p>sv70 ~7am timing along <span>YCK</span> towards Shenton

              road couldn’t board. At times got to skip up to 3 buses. Sometimes

              <p>Well said, there's just so much ways to complain. Why only rigid, why no dd, why so little bendy, why drive so slow, and why frequency so instable, why frequency so long?</p>
              <p>Why not look closer into the problem, analyze it in public and find a solution to it, propose as a suggestion. Dont simply jump to conclusion and say more DD or more bendy or better frequency will help. It can be possible to run all services at 3min freq, with a DD or bendy. But this wont recover even the cost to do it. A balance needs to be found.</p>

              <p><br>Suggestion still stands: God's sake, twist SMRT's arm and get it to purchase DDs la.</p>
              <p>Nor was the suggestion put blindly. As stated, services like 163 really do not need the DDs. And ok, its lousy frequency is justified....to an extent. But if you consider the fact that its the only bus that links East and West Sengkang, then I pity the people living there and any "better" input to this service is like "goodwill".</p>
              <p>I second that 70 needs to improve reliability too.</p>

              <p>Which is why i remember mentioning in my previous post somewhere, that SMRT cannot and should never be a multi modal operator.</p>
              <p>Its a conflict of interest for them to be the largest rail operator in sg while still operating a fleet of buses that compete on their own rail network.</p>
              <p>There's not a single example of a profit making company in this world operating trains and competing bus services together. That's because they will just improve their more profit making option (either train or bus). And there, u see why smrt buses is being neglated.</p>

              <p>I rather don't have bendies.</p>
              <p>They jam up roads, bus stops, bus interchanges, etc., even bus depots. And they take up too much space on these places, especially when they are almost empty. Inefficient. And at times I missed boarding my buses because of them jamming other places. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p><br>I don't think they are comfortable with bendies, since their depots are cramped and even overfilled because of the space they waste in their depots. They already having headaches on how to park them in depots and bus interchanges.</p>

              <p>Esp bendies always get "fireworks" it's like very scary to think of....</p>
              <p>Seriously, the "territorial" distribution of routes restricted deployment of certain routes, i.e. 851, 854 not able to get DD while some routes like airport routes, 261 might fare just as well operating in SMRT fleet since they are full sd which i doubt bendies can work with them also. But of course infrastructure wise la, cos depot location is a limitation and u can't let ur off service buses to run "cross country" to waste fuel.</p>
              <p>Wonder is it permissible for PTC to "shuffle the tiles", and for instance North region, we can put things like 57, 130, 162 (feeders maybe?) to SMRT and from Yishun side 851 "marry" to SBS Transit. Just 851 i guess it can garner the revenue of losing 57, 162 to SMRT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>For 854 i cant say the same thing - if the original 25 got axed and ppl adopt a 854 to 74/132 transfer next time? Die</p>
