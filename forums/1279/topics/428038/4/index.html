              sv 73 during evening peak (esp from TPY towards AMK) around 1845 to 1920hrs got to wait rather long. sometimes will end up with 2-3 buses bunching up along S'goon Gdn Circus.
              
              sv 315 &amp; 317 also often spotted buses bunching up and upset sv freq. This is esp so for sv 315 (morning &amp; evening peak), sv 317 (evening peak).
              
              The above-mentioned sv I ever experience up to 30min waiting.
              
              sometimes bus captains forgot to change destos too. For eg today morning, the BC of sv 315 (to Sgoon Int) forgot to change destos. With the White desto (to Sgoon Nth Ave 5), he proceeded from Sgoon Gdn Circus towards Int! Wonder who boarded the wrong bus! A couple of days ago, I spotted a BC of sv 317 forgot to change the EDS. With "&gt;BERWICK DRIVE", the BC headed from Sgoon Gdn Circus towards Sgoon Int. Wonder who boarded from Sgoon Gdn Circus bus-stop intending to go inside the bungalows estate ended up heading towards the Int!

              I think could be due to the traffic jams at and around Sgoon Gdn Circus area, esp the peak period and weekends evening/night. Pax from Nex can also cause uneven loading esp the time when many people are going there or going home from there and sometimes is really terrible. sv 109 loading is also upset due to this.

But i really wonder why 307 can wait up to 40mins during peak hour for a feeder service.

                                                  Actually 315 should have Scania K230UBs so that it will not be overloaded but , HGDEP does not have spares. Look at 317! :(

              and 2 split.Once the 2 split go to break hell break loose minus the

              <p>105 is rather irregular if you take it on weekday afternoons at around Toa Payoh/Serangoon area. There was once I saw 3 buses coming at one short. Long wait times are common during this period too.</p>

              <p>Seriously 852 doesnt require bendies,Just add 1 more split shift and 1 full day bus is enough.851 also another thing during Weekends,More n more rigids deployed..853 2 split shift need to convert to full day.854 currently is okay but Sundays/PHs they suka2 kapo 5-6 bendies for other svc.980 need more buses during Weekdays peak,More bendies during Weekends.981 convert to loop svc better.Now Factory also got 0000-0900 timings leh.855 peak hour cmi.859 under AMDEP is better at least 3 perm bendies.171 need perm bendies during peak hours.61 another clown,The rigids cmi from BBT-SP.Ditto for bugis towards Eunos.Can kapo some bendies from feeders/Intratown what.I dun see the reason why they need full fleet bendies for Feeders/Intratowns?Just improve the timings is enough.SBST also never deploy full DDs for feeders.Townlink mah.190 too many split shift rest after 0900 and 1915 hrs.They forget that old folks take after AM peak to Chinatown and Orchard towards CCK during 2300-2330 hrs.700 another headache,Cash cow yet only 1 perm bendy.961 off peak is horrible.The problem is always come from WL side.Not enough Standy SL to drive certain blocks.Thus they always adjust the departure timings.AM side still okay,Mostly follow timings.</p>

              <p>For 852's case I can close 1 eyes, considering that AMDEP did major revamps for the fleet somewhere early this year, Even if the bus is late but if the fleet is decent I believe these students won't bother to ji jiao so much.</p>
              <p>859 If there is a problem I believe AMDEP will take them back like what they did to 852 though, Now seems that AMDEP doesn't want to have 859 back so I don't see much of a problem.</p>
              <p>171's case, ah, should have convert 1 rigid to bendy for both WL (YI) and YI (AMDEP), for which 1 full day 1 as split, but should not require more than 2.</p>
              <p>961, WL, WL, WL, Oh my, WL (WR) group to be honest I don't see any improvements made, up till now. Keep giving problems with frequency and not serious with their deployments. 178 is one good example. AMDEP in general is much like SBST, lenient and willing to follow schedule, WL(SE,YI) I can close one eye, but WL(WR) isn't serious with their deployments, at all.</p>
              <p>In general, personal feelings aside but I feel AMDEP (SMRT) is much like SBST, reason being they wasted no time in finding replacements and their frequency are much safer. WL(SE/YI) I don't have problems but WL(WR) still no improvements as of yet.</p>
