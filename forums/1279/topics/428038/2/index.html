              <p>Service 154.</p>
              <p>During peak/normal hour if encounter with rain or bad traffic condition can stretch very long. Just last friday i was waiting for 154. Spent around 40 min(7.50pm - 8.30pm) to wait 1 due to traffic condition. And one short come 5 at 1 time. I hope that if this case were to happen again SBS(SLBP Depot) can at least sent 1 bus for emergency pick-up cause some passenger can't had patience. I mean not all but there were bound to be some.</p>

              <p>every service sure have issue one... it all depend on different situations..</p>
              <p>for example, if you need to take sv76 to YCK Mrt everyday.. so you know that the bus will arrive at your bus stop at around 8am everyday, so u go down at 7.57am to wait...  from mon to thurs, the bus come on time at around  8am... you happy happy go work... then suddenly on friday, the bus come later at 8.10 or 8.15am due to some jam/accidents or some other issue...so you will not be happy and will complain......</p>

              <p>Service 154.</p>
              <p>During peak/normal hour if encounter with rain or bad traffic condition can stretch very long. Just last friday i was waiting for 154. Spent around 40 min(7.50pm - 8.30pm) to wait 1 due to traffic condition. And one short come 5 at 1 time. I hope that if this case were to happen again SBS(SLBP Depot) can at least sent 1 bus for emergency pick-up cause some passenger can't had patience. I mean not all but there were bound to be some.</p>

              <p>180 has a very good frequency during AM peak towards Boon Lay Int. However, at the same time, it has irregular or bad frequency frm Boon Lay to Bt Panjang till now. ITE students waited almost 15-20 mins or even more for 180 to turn up. There was once between 7.30am - 8.00am only 1 bus turn up at around 7.50am where the Q strech till the service information board in Boon Lay Int. ITE Students start lesson at 8am and 8.30am.</p>

              <p>next bus 5min, subt bus 16 min. thats 11min frequency, quite normal. Cant compare with sv 8, sv 8 has many spilt shifts to cater for the TP and Ubi crowd.<br><br>Off peak sv 5 frequency is pretty bad, but the demand not there, and usually the demand is only one directional.

              <p>Somemore 1930 - 2030 are the timing e S shifts returns to depot. The drivers had clocked 3 - 5 hrs earlier in AM peak alrdy. Not to mention there's a max weekly working hrs set by MOM.</p>
              <p>If you think u know restriction, go write in. In any case it has occured before, they'll just pull out any buses on any running service if you looked at major MRT disruption over the years.</p>
              <p>If I dun pull 241, 242 or 243 buses, which one do I pull? Sv 30's headways can be 14 mins (tell me 28 mins headways?), 198 is BBDEP, 157 same issue w/ 30.</p>
