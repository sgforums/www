Republic Polytechnic started lesson officially in our new premise in woodlands on 17th April 2006 and I feel that there are some ways whereby SMRT can provide a better service for students of RP.<br><br>Service 169 - Ang Mo Kio - Woodlands Regional Interchange.<br><br>I am staying in Yishun and I usually board 169 along Yishun Avenue 2 (Block 154 bus stop). Although I have a direct bus from a bus stop near my place all the way to the bus stop right in front of my school, I am unable to take that bus every morning. Every service 169 that comes by the bus stop doesn't stop because the bus is full and cannot take in any more passengers. This not only causes inconvenience for students of RP, but also causes inconvenience of other passengers travelling on service 169. On top of that, it is also not beneficial to SMRT because passengers are rejected from boarding because the bus is full, it's equivalent to rejected revenue. I have the following suggestions in mind to improve the situation:<br><br>Reduce frequency between buses<br>Published frequency from 7am - 8.30am: 8 - 10 minutes Actual interval between buses (approximate): 15 - 18 minutes<br><br>I do understand that delays on the road is inevitable and buses may not exactly be on time as the published interval but if SMRT can add another 1 or 2 buses to the fleet serving 169 to shorten the interval between buses, the overcrowding situation might take a turn towards the better.<br><br>Deployment of 'Bendy Buses'<br>The amount of passengers taking service 169 have drastically increased with the opening of Republic Polytechnic, as such, I feel that SMRT should deploy more bendy buses to serve service 169, at least in the morning (between 7am - 8.30am) and in the evening (3.30pm - 4.30pm) to ease the overcrowding situation on service 169.<br><br>Other suggestions.<br><br>New Trunk Service - Yishun &gt; Sembawang &gt; Woodlands<br><br>I've made an observation regarding the morning crowd taking service 169 in the morning. Most students boards service 169 at Yishun MRT Station. These students are usually students staying and Yishun or are students staying in Eastern/North-Eastern part of Singapore, who transfers to 169 after alighting from Service 969 (from Tampines Regional Interchange) or from Service 965 (from Sengkang Interchange). There are also a handful of students boarding Service 169 at the bus stop before Yishun MRT, these students usually transfer to service 169 after alighting from SBS Transit service 39 (from Tampines Interchange) or 85 (from Punggol Interchange). As such, I suggest the introduction of a new trunk service to serve Yishun - Woodlands, via Sembawang. I do know of students staying in Sembawang as well, so perhaps a bus linking Yishun and Woodlands via Sembawang would be good. My suggested route as follows:<br><br>Yishun Interchange (majority of the students will board here after alighting from 39/85/other trunk services, students from 965/969 will board 169 at Yishun MRT Station)<br><br>Yishun Central - Between Block 201/202<br>Yishun Central - Block 322<br>Yishun Street 11 - Between Block 349/350<br>Yishun Street 11 - Block 419<br>Yishun Ring Road - Block 356<br>Yishun Ring Road - Block 358<br>Yishun Ring Road - Block 367<br>Yishun Ring Road - Block 314<br>Yishun Ring Road - Block 236<br>Yishun Ring Road - Block 227<br>Yishun Ave 2 - Opposite Darul Makmur Mosque<br>Yishun Ave 2 - Block 1002<br>Yishun Ave 2 - Lamp Post 163<br>Yishun Ave 2 - Lamp Post 181<br>Canberra Link - Opposite Block 504c<br>Canberra Road - After Admiralty Country Club<br>Sembawang Drive - Opposite Sun Plaza<br>Sembawang Way - Opposite Block 469B<br>Woodlands Ave 7 - Seagate<br>Woodlands Ave 7 - Opposite Woodsvale Condo<br>Woodlands Ave 7 - Block 793<br>Woodlands Ave 7 - Admiralty MRT<br>Woodlands Ave 7 - Block 666<br>Woodlands Ave 4 - Block 864<br>Woodlands Ave 4 - Evergreen Secondary School<br>Woodlands Ave 9 - Between Block 871/872<br>Woodlands Ave 9 - Block 808 (Opposite Republic Polytechnic)<br>Woodlands Ave 2 - Block 803<br>Woodlands Regional Interchange<br><br>Route modification to Service 858<br><br>(Refer to attachment '858.jpg)<br><br>Current route that 858 is plying, turns into Woodlands Ave 4 after Block 757 bus stop, instead of turning into Woodlands Ave 4, my suggestion is to allow Service 858 to cover the following bus stops:<br><br>Woodlands Ave 9 - Block 871/872<br>Woodlands Ave 9 - Block 808 (Opposite Republic Polytechnic) Woodlands Ave 2 - Block 803 Woodlands Regional Interchange.<br><br>I have observed that Woodlands Ave 7 (from 888 Plaza Bus Stop onwards) are served by many buses namely 964 965 969 900 913 and 858. Changing the route of 858 would not cause major problems to residents staying along Woodlands Ave 7.<br><br>--------------<br><br>The introduction of service 902 by SMRT is however, commendable. That's a good service initiative and I would like to express my gratitude to SMRT for putting in the effort to cater to students and staffs of Republic Polytechnic.<br><br>Previously at Tanglin Campus, SBS Transit did a great job by adjusting their bus services to cater to Republic Polytechnic Students, I hope SMRT can do an equally good job, or an even better job.<br><br>Hope my suggestions are taken into serious considerations and hope to see changes implemented soon.<br><br>Best Regards.<br><br>************************<br>Reply from SMRT:<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>We refer to your email of 20 April 2006 for service 169 and 858.<br><br>We have considered your suggestion to be beneficial and are pleased to inform you that we are will be adding additional resources to service 169 so as to cope with the surge in demand as a result of the opening of Republic Poly.  The proposed amendment will improve accessibility for students and for other commuters as well.  However, we will not reroute service 858 as this service serves a different group of passengers and will cause inconvenience to the current commuters.  Notwithstanding this, we will give your suggestion due considerations when we next review our network and will monitor the services closely.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.  We look forward to your continued support.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br></div>

I think I can see more UDs on 980, or UDs on 169 to cater to the RP crowd. Bendies can forget it. I don't think there are enough to cater for 169.<br><br>Surprisingly enough this time they never say "take MRT to Woodlands and change to 902". Quite a positive reply I should say, just wait and see when will the "adding additional resources" start and how they go about doing it.</div>
