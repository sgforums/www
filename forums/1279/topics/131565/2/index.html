            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if any had gt the show on channel 8 discussing bout the fare hike. Ur should have seen that economist saying dat the reasons given for the fare hike was insufficient and awkward.<br><br>Though the fare hike seems very minimal to many of us, i have a lot of friends in sch who'r earning that own allowance. I could understand their difficulties.<br><br>One of my friends, earn her own allowance... a mere 100 bucks by tutoring sec sch kid.  2 hrs per session once a wk. So it's a mere 25bucks per session. She isn't able to tuition more kids reason being, we're in the life science field and sch load tend to be more demanding.<br><br>So, she pays $45 per month for concession. N it left her with $55 of monthly allowance. So, she ended up bringing bread to sch almost everyday.<br><br>Now, i just wish that LTA could make a wise decision. .</div>
