N the prizes cost a bomb. N i realli dunno y they do tis thing. Ya... N e 'enjoy free MRT ride for a yr' lucky draw thingy. Y wud they come up wif such a lame thing? can sumbody pls enlighten me?<br>2. Condition... ya... does dat means more colourful seat?... bigger seats for growing butts?... the seat even gt a more adapt a more 3D shape to fit our butt! Hahaha.  Does e 3D shape mean any health benefits to our butts like those kingcoil mattress do?<br>GeXx... Ya... N those fanciful skin sum trains had huh.<br>3. Been to Dobby ghuat RMT station? It has even gt the conveyor belt thingy to bring u frm one point to another point. N the dist is so.... SHORT!~<br>Airport has those coz... all passengers r carrying luaggages!<br>But wad do all passengers at Dobby ghuat carries? Mini bags... i pod?.. water bottles? hp?<br>They even  gt so many escalator servin the same location.<br>C'mon this kinda.... 'improvement in condition' is totally not practical!<br>4. Ya... Those fanciful wall arts at outram park MRT.<br>Goodness!<br><br></div></blockquote>1st the lucky Draw thing... The reason is there because they wants to attract more ppl into the trains buses instead of letting them using their own publilc transport.2nd, the reason that they have those seats os that ppl having Long journey will not have a bad experience. so tha ppl will have a comfortable ride throughout. The Travellator over at the Dhoby Ghaut Int is there to help those senior citizens. As you know, Singapore is moving towards a Ageing populationk in near future. next time, if you have any walking difficulties, You BETTER Say Thankz to LTA when they 1st design this thing for you. At Dhoby Ghaut Int, the reason that they have so much escalator over there is because they want to clear the pasenger load in the shortest possible time. So that there will not be a Human Jam happening every single Day. As you know, there are alot of ppl using this stretch of the tunnel connecting NEL and NSL. another thing to point out is that the circle Line will ba ready in another 5 Years time. If they dont built all these things rite now, next time when the Circle line start running, trying to built all this things will be a bit TOO LATE. Lastly, all those arts are there as because in the past, ppl were complaining that the walls inside the MRT stations are too boring. Havign ak few art pieces will at least brighten up abit. and to bring up SINGAPORE as a Art city so that it will sattract MOre Ppl into SIngapore and at the same time, earning their money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly oppose this. The prices of everything nowadays are going up, but our salaries are either stagnant or going down. The government gets richer, while we get poorer. What kind of law is this anyway!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well<br><br>There are not going to be more buses or trains even when we pay more cause we are constrained by the existing lines and roads and the size of the roads/tunnels. There will never be bigger train cabins or 3 storey buses. Tts a fact.<br><br>We are not going to get any better service when we pay more which is the case with most other service lines. In fact we will still not get to sit comfortably on any trips as long as the transport companies can pack us in like sardines.<br><br>Number of passengers per train increase -&gt; utilization -&gt; effeciency -&gt; Profits -&gt; Not going to buy more trains -&gt; Optimal for transport Management -&gt; Passengers suffer -&gt; Shareholder profit -&gt; transport company exec drive all over the country cause they ain't gonna squeeze with the low class commoners<br><br>The profits do not flow down to their employees who are serving us everyday and we get sh!t for it even when we pay more and more.<br><br>The roads and train lines are built by LTA. The transport companies just take about 1 to 2 years (perhaps) to recoup all the expenditure on their assets. Just like Singtel, the rest is just pure profits minus some expenses.<br><br>In the past, the reason for forcing us to take the increase fare was the lame excuse of "bleeding" transport companies and that made me take a long hard look at the person's credibility for saying that now the transport companies are making extra stretched profits (and no other industry seem to even be able to acheive that). I doubt very much they ever bled but it makes some bloke in white shirt look like a fool now and I sincererly felt he's losing credibility for saying such a foolish thing then. But looking at his current comment about the casino and about the reason to push through and continue with it cause its a "loss of face" makes me wonder if its gonna be another "bleed company" excuse to sap the people again while enriching some "more equal people (Animal Farm - All are equal but SOME are more equal than others)" running these big, fat, rich companies.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Someone obviously never study finance.<br><br>In any of the transport companie be it SIA, TIBS, Translink and whatever<br><br>They will hedge the price of oil because they know this is a cost componment that needed to be controlled therefore the price they pay is below the market price because of the hedging. Unless of course these companies are stupid and did not do so. Then does it mean that WE as lay-persons got to pay the penality and become the crutch for the company is badly run by the management?<br>If they did not hedge their oil, its their own bloody fault for corporate goverance failure to manage their costs properly. Don't always come crying that the people have to PAY more just because their expense increase. Every company has increasing expenses, its up to the management to control it. Then one way to control expenses is to cut the top management salaries. Why don't they do that before squeezing the public? Obviously, we all know why and its back to the "some are more equal issue".<br><br>Its the same old thing all companies do. When the economy is a little depresses. The employing manager will use that as a excuse to Depress your asking salary when you apply for work. But once you work for them, you would realise that the depressed economy did not impact your company and in fact, your company is doing so darn well and you just felt underpaid. However, the dpressed economy is used as a tactical excuse by the management as it is their perogative to drive down costs even at your expense. Where did that excess go ? When the report is submitted, Oh that manager managed to do so much with so little cost, therefore he is promoted. get the drift?<br><br>So when SIA retrenched so many people and they cried and cried about the company going down and senior guy in jeng hu even come around and mediate. Immediately, the next year(maybe only months later), what's their profits?<br><br></div>
