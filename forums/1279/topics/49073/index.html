            <div class='col-md body'>As the opening of NEL is near, scheme B bus operators are receiving letters that some services will be withdrawn. As a result, their livelihood is affected. Also, a "Sembawang - Changi Airport" MRT line is proposed, if in reality, a direct compeition to service 858. I really think that in the next 30 to 50 years, bus operators will only have feeder services to operate on, while other routes will be covered up by rail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not only 858 will be affected, I think all the other services using TPE will be affected, eg. 969,965,161,168. But however, the two players will still not lose out in the end, with TIBS and SMRT together and SBS Transit operating both rail and bus services.<br><br>I do not take scheme B bus services, but although they can be crowded during the peak hours, they do not run according to timetable and do go around in loops to get enough pax. Sometimes, they do not even run as the bus drivers would rather take on the profitable charter business. If I'm not wrong, the Punggol services are run by an association of bus drivers, not an organized company like Comfort.<br><br>I believe that the withdrawal is a positive measure taken by the government, as it would force the remaining operators to buck up their lousy service, reduce the fares ( currently it is $1.50-$2.20 ), and cut the travelling time in order to compete with the NEL. It is not a question of taking away the driver's livelihood, but it is my opinion that companies have to adapt to challenges to survive and to improve.</div>

Service 804 already has enough passengers for it's own 12m O405s. Imagine adding in the load from service 806.</div>

And fix a traffic light with sensor system to detect the bus is coming so as to activate the lights accordingly.</div>

There is an improved version at Yishun Ring Road to cater to the U-turning of 804A, where there is this large rectangle for the bus to turn, but I don't know whether it is enough for a 0405G to turn. The L-shaped thing had been expanded several times, but I guess TIBS still wanted to deploy only 12m 0405s on 804, but I still think that 0405Gs can stomach tight turns in neighbourhoods, like svc 800 turning at Yishun St. 71</div>
