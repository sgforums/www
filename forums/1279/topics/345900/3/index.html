              <p>1) Service 700A and 171 last bus (as their last bus timing is around the same), and given the alternate stops along Scotts Rd for BS 09212 (Royal Plaza on Scotts) and BS 09213 (Thong Teck Building), they may not be able to rush just in time to travel from BS 09213 to BS 09212, and still, ended up either train or NR3 (or 3N for CCK only).</p>
              <p>2) Service 502, whether their last few buses, that arrives at BS 09213 after 12am (no more Service 190 buses by then) are still packed to the brim to the extent that it skipped that bus stop?</p>
              <p>3) How SBS Transit and SMRT Buses manage their scheduling of their bus services.</p>
              <p>4) Supply &amp; Demand for both Service 190 and 502 (and probably other services as well if you wanna broaden it for a wider perspective)</p>

              <p>As said earlier..</p>
              <p>"I'm using 502 in comparison to 190 <strong>in terms of loading and outgoing route from town</strong>, notwithstanding fares, frequency and fleet size/type."</p>
              <p>By theory, 190 is later by 4-6min than 700A/171 last bus. last train from Orchard to the North-West is 2344 via Raffles Place &amp; Jurong East, 2356 via Woodlands. Miss the last 502 = take night bus already. There's still the train (if ppl bother to walk) if they miss the last 190/700A/171.</p>
              <p>Though 190 may be a profitable route, its profits are used to cover losses in other areas of SMRTB such as loss making routes? Why not withdraw them you may ask. Reason being it would go against PTC regulations as well as grassroot objections. By adding more P shift only buses would require bus and driver availability. From the looks of it manpower shortage looks partially solved with the influx of drivers from China, there's still the bus issue. If convert S to A/P would incur losses from the early-mid afternoon portion. Dont forget both SBST and SMRT have to meet the PTC guidelines of at least 80% of services having 10min freq or less. 190 way exceeds the requirements. henceforth they need to pay attention to other services instead. In this aspect 502 is out of the question since its a non basic service to begin with.</p>
              <p>Your arguement seems to be focused on Friday and Saturday nights since you mentioned Night Bus services. You should consider spotting on Sun-Thur instead since you are on holiday until that pink letter comes. In any case, still a micro perspective.</p>
              <p>I do agree SMRT has tighter runtime so that things look nice on paper but not in reality. Its like painting a beautiful picture in your house for everyone to see but no one knows what goes into that painting itself. This is reality.</p>
              <p>If SMRT says 190 (and other sardine packed services) on paper claims that the supply of their buses meet the demand, what can you do about it?</p>
              <p>So I would advice you to stop dreaming, wake up your idea otherwise get yourself your own mode of transportation. I hope by then I wont see you complaining in the Cars or Motorbike forums that too many ERP gantries, too little parking space, parking rates too expensive, road tax/insurance/instalment so ex etc.</p>

              <p>Usually it's not as crowded for Monday - Thursday (Sunday not sure because I seldom pass by there at night), especially for Monday - Wednesday (excluding eve of PH / PH) whereby I have higher chance of getting a seat in Svc 190 bus.. (Don't even need to mention the chances of being able to board the bus).</p>
              <p>As for Service 502, although I don't usually see their buses packed to the brim after 11pm, but I will still take the effort to observe if I happen to bypass there..</p>

              <p>Actually taking a step back, I feel that SMRT had done everything they can for this service...

              <p>Funny thing is, are there anything to be solved now, or there is nothing at all, just our short-sightedness? There is just many people (yes, talking of only weekends) and the buses in the system perhaps just nice to cope with the traffic.</p>
              <p>I agree that its uncomfortable to squeeze with other commuters on the way home or standing all the way, but we solve the 'able to board' factor first. Taking Japan as an example, why the trains are so packed in the city is much due to <strong>utilization</strong>, the maximum usage of space in every vehicle. This maximum can be pushed way beyond what we, Singapore have, like 205-209 percent of passengers on a train. Putting this in, it is evident that s190 is a highly utilized service. With a highly utilized service and frequency that is well within PTC's regulations, then there is really nothing much to be done about it.</p>
              <p>My personal viewpoint, and I think that this is also shared by many other folks, is <strong>not for every commuter to get a seat</strong>, but rather the aspect of <strong>being able to get home on the bus</strong>, without having to walk to the train station or take any other alternative transport, including night buses. For me who wait at Orchard area for a bus at the same hour, abeit towards a different location in the West, I too hope being able to squeeze on board a bus, standing is totally no problem for me, provided that the frequency is within reasonable range! For my same situation, there is a last s174 bus which would reach Orchard around 0012 hrs, later than s77 or 106 for the same bus stop. I hope that this viewpoint would be more reasonable instead of argueing for 'every passenger to have a seat' or '2 minutes frequency' which would either be impossible or a draining of resources and destroying the aspect of utilization.</p>

              <p><br>there is a solution. SMRT can make 700 extend to CCK. Maybe use the 67 route instead of teck whye. If they increase the frequency, they can pull maybe a few passengers over to 700 instead.</p>
