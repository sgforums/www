I'm sure you are angry with SBST for cutting routes. I don't bother what happens to SBST/I'm sure it's the same for you. I'm sure that you're thinking "Why should I bother about Tibs? It doesn't affect me at all!"<br><br>You see, it's different for me. I have been living in a Tibs area for my whole life. I lived in BP &amp; Yis. I witnessed the taking over of bus services in BP from SBS to Tibs.I witnessed the closure of Old WD intand the opening of WRL. I witnessed some of the major events in Tibs. It's not easy to accept the fact that this is happening. An established name going down just like that?<br><br>I'm sorry if I sound rude,9818.It's just a sad event.Merging with SMRT is the most foolish thing Tibs did!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, one shouldn't said it as condolences, as if TIBS is 'dying off' soon. What it did happen was that SMRT merged with TIBS to form SMRT and SMRTBus. This is to create a better competitiveness for the public transport operators, and also to maximise the capital for the company, for better utility of resource. In this case, we shall see both SMRT and TIBS to improve after the merger. Things do change against time, unless you could tell me that nothing changes in your life. That would be abnormal, wouldn't be?<br><br>Regarding the livery, though it looks kinda gloomy, one could depict in the way that it has stepped into a new millenium of public transportation. SMRT and TIBS are going into the new chapter of public transportation, and changes to be made to improve the existing services.<br><br>We shall see how SMRT and TIBS improve down the road, or what we don't like to see, getting lousy down the road.</div>

What it did happen was that SMRT merged with TIBS to form SMRT and SMRTBus. This is to create a better competitiveness for the public transport operators, and also to maximise the capital for the company, for better utility of resource. In this case, we shall see both SMRT and TIBS to improve after the merger. Things do change against time, unless you could tell me that nothing changes in your life. That would be abnormal, wouldn't be?<br><br>Regarding the livery, though it looks kinda gloomy, one could depict in the way that it has stepped into a new millenium of public transportation. SMRT and TIBS are going into the new chapter of public transportation, and changes to be made to improve the existing services.<br><br>We shall see how SMRT and TIBS improve down the road, or what we don't like to see, getting lousy down the road. </div></blockquote>Well, I said condolence mainly because of an established name going down.haha. I'm very sure nothing much will change except the name and the livery.</div>

I'll surely miss the days where buses with Tibs livery of orange and yellow passing through the streets... My first Tibs ride was on Service 851 with me parents and siblings for Chinese New Year visits some 10 years ago <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I actually started taking Tibs buses myself when Service 970 started around 4 years ago, passing through the roads where me house's located... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Though Tibs itself's not really gone yet because it has gone under SMRT, the name itself is gone, the bus livery's gonna be gone soon, forever... However despite that so, I would wish to see better improvements when Tibs' go under SMRT after 10th May 2004. I would really wish to see that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Even though under SMRT, the name Trans Island Bus Services Ltd will truly live in me heart forever, in some other fellow bus enthuasists' hearts too... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
