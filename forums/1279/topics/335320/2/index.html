              <p><br>1) No</p>
              <p>2) Depends. Most services don't, but service 900/901 SLs do rotate once every few weeks. This week appear on 900, later the next week on 901, and it seems that there is no fixed pattern to it. SLs may be able to drive other services along the way if they are asked to do it by the depot starter. Explains why sometimes SLs may be doing different services. I remembered once the service rep of 900/901 was driving TIB1038T on 856 and another instance on TIB1191H on 856 too. Another time was a service 900/901 SL driving TIB672T on 966 sometime back before the redeployments</p>
              <p>3) Depends again. If the timesheet requires a xover, they will do different services in the 8 hour shift (like TIB1225U requiring the SL to drive a trip of 911 (Woodlands St 81, 82, 83) before going to 963)</p>

              <p>Hi, as you know, SBST and SMRT are having shortage of drivers at
              the moment. Many people have been complaining of irregular bus
              frequencies, long waiting times and sometimes crowded buses.</p>
              <p>Hence, it does come to my mind that one day, some locals might
              consider being bus drivers. So, are there any bus drivers
              around who are keen to share their experiences?</p>
              <p>I have a few qns, currently, pertaining to the roles
              of bus captains.</p>
              <p>1) Is there such a thing as a 'part-time' bus driver?</p>
              <p>2) What is the average salary like (just a very rough one will
              do)?</p>
              <p>3) What qualifications and/or requirements do we need?</p>
              <p>4) How's the job hours like?</p>
              <p>5) What incentives can bus captains look forward
              to?</p>
              <p>Hope those with bus driving experience can share their views and
              opinions, the pluses and minuses, the good and the bad, so
              that any prospective new drivers can make informed
              choices.</p>

              <p>Oh I see... He certainly deserves the praise.</p>
              <p>But I experienced a rather interesting bus-driver onboard 198 to school. He's a regular 198 bus driver but I'm not sure what shift he's on. He greets everyone onboard the bus as well. So I suppose that's a good gesture.</p>
              <p>But the smile grin on his face evolved to a menacing threatening look once he hears double-beeps when a student/concession card is being tapped. Not matter how packed the bus is, when he hears that sound, he will demand very loudly, (so that everyone will turn their head and see what happen) for the ez-link card to be shown. He will make sure that he checks ALL student cards. He literally takes the card from you and look at it for 3 seconds before returning it to you. Really admire those who tapped using their adult cards; they proceeded on to their seats with a breeze.</p>
              <p>As a result, the poor me and other students had to queue up and surrender our cards mercifully under his command. I know that's his job and he has the right to do so... but.. it just doesn't make my day, expecially when I board his bus in the early hours of the morning; because of his rude gesture when demanding for my card although he greets us rather sarcastically after he checks them. </p>
              <p>Should he be given an award for efficiency to save the bus inspector's time on checking the cards? My friends and I feel that it's high time that he gets it. But, alas, no matter how much "effort" he has put in to forcefully check our cards, there's nothing on his collar.</p>
