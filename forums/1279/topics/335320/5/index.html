              <p>Oh I see... He certainly deserves the praise.</p>
              <p>But I experienced a rather interesting bus-driver onboard 198 to
              school. He's a regular 198 bus driver but I'm not sure what
              shift he's on. He greets everyone onboard the bus as well. So
              I suppose that's a good gesture.</p>
              <p>But the smile grin on his face evolved to a menacing
              threatening look once he hears double-beeps when a
              student/concession card is being tapped. Not matter how packed the
              bus is, when he hears that sound, he will demand very loudly, (so
              that everyone will turn their head and see what happen) for the
              ez-link card to be shown. He will make sure that he checks ALL
              student cards. He literally takes the card from you and look at it
              for 3 seconds before returning it to you. Really admire
              those who tapped using their adult cards; they
              proceeded on to their seats with a breeze.</p>
              <p>As a result, the poor me and other students had to queue up and
              surrender our cards mercifully under his command. I know that's his
              job and he has the right to do so... but.. it just doesn't make my
              day, expecially when I board his bus in the early hours of the
              morning; because of his rude gesture when demanding for my card
              although he greets us rather sarcastically after he checks
              them. </p>
              <p>Should he be given an award for efficiency to save the bus
              inspector's time on checking the cards? My friends and I feel that
              it's high time that he gets it. But, alas, no matter how much
              "effort" he has put in to forcefully check our cards, there's
              nothing on his collar.</p>

              <p><br> Just press 3 straightaway (if no D). 1 and 2 are used for kick down
                  or when climbing gradiants.</p>
              <p>Its like your car with D, 2 and L.</p>

              <p>those 1 2 and 3 buttons are pre select gears. u dun mess with them unless u know what they are really for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(the following apply to bus, car smaller so different operation )</p>
              <p>1 is when bus is to be towed. u pre select 1</p>
              <p>2 is for snow slippery surafce driving.</p>
              <p>3 is for city built up area driving where the bus never needs to hit 4th (say ZF old series)  and the bus had been pre programmed to optimise gear and engine and gear 3. (By the ECU and mechanic)</p>
              <p>AFAIk u juz step n go if not in a pre selct modes.</p>
              <p>As for  kick down i dun think u shd be pre selecting the gear before a drive session. anyhow u wun know when it is time to kick down. when it is needed to do a  kick down just operate the pedal to force a kick down lor. In car is differennt refered above.</p>
              <p>i am not a car or bus driver. no license. what i may have said is utter rubbish. lol...please correct me if i am utterly wrong</p>

              <p>Oh...he's bald and has rather small eyes. I dun know if he's the one you are referring to. When you alight, he will also say "Goodbye" to you. I didn't know he has been in service for 15 years!</p>
