            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of Bendys during peak hours, i would say that svc 806 has the highest frequency during morning peak with a Habit arriving every 3-5 mins as the demand warrants it.<br><br>In terms of overall for SBST, i have to agree its svc 72 ..look at the freq of 0405s and DDs exiting Tampines..<br><br>For TIBS, it should be svc 190 , though the waiting time can be excrutiating long at times...i waited for 12 mins on Monday alond Stevens Road!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>72's waiting time is a little long at night in my opinion. Most of the passengers boarding the bus are those commuting from Tampines Interchange to any of the bus-stops from the mosque to before Tampines Dormitory as a form of a "feeder" service. The queue can stretch to 2 times the queueing berth would allow (which is quite long already). So if you're right at the end of the queue, it's as good as waiting for the next bus and pray hard u don't get the O405s or you'll be squeezing like mad on the bus. Perhaps there could be a feeder service introduced to better serve Tampines Ave 6, 9 and 10 as an alternative to 72 and to lighten its load. Moreover, many 72 commuters alight at Hougang Ave 3 too and it's quite frustrating having the Tampines Ave 6, 9 and 10 people crowding out the bus and then not being able to board the bus to go to further locations like Hougang or Yio Chu Kang.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sv. 72 frequency is one of the best, just looking at the number of buses exiting Tampines Int within 15 mins already gives you a good idea. Sv. 55 frequency isn't too bad but pales in comparison with Sv. 72, which, IMO, is the SBST service with best frequency besides the old SBS-operated Sv. 190.</div>

There's a lot of people taking 72 from tampines at night and it would be better if their frequency is reduced to 5 minutes.<br><br>55 frequency is pretty average in my opinion. It serves my place and 25 has a better frequency than 55. I think for every 2 55s, there'll be at least 3 25s.</div>
