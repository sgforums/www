              <p><strong>SCANIA BUS MODEL CODES</strong></p>
              <p>some of us seem confused over this, so guess its time to clarify</p>
              <p>There are 5 generations (the word series can also be used) of Scania bus models</p>
              <p>currently in aug 2007 , Scannia released the 5th generation. the very familair N113CRB are 3rd generation Scanias. bellow is a exmaple list</p>
              <p>First generation: umm i dun have an example..lol<br>Second generation: Scania BR112DH - East lancs bodywork = SBS7000 NDD under SBS then. <br>Third generation: Scania N113CRB - these we are familair with.<br>Scania L113CRL - SMRT Scanias<br>Fourth generation - Scania L94UB - volgren CR221L SBS2888T<br>5th generation : Scania K230UB</p>
              <p>note that 5th series you do not see the 5 in the model code. this is due to the fasct that Scania switched to a new format in 2007. However, if u are happy with saying K95UB, its no problem among us.<br><br>old format:-(1st to 4th series)<br>First letter - N K L - denotes how engine is placed (Swedish words)<br>K is rear engine<br>N is transverse rear engine<br>L is tilt rear engine<br>F is front engine<br>the one or two digit after the first letter is<strong> litre size of engine</strong> followed by <strong>series</strong><br>eg: L<strong>93</strong>CRL is a <strong>9</strong> litre <strong>3</strong>rd series bus (um a malayisan citybus btw)<br><br>last three letters (for a better explaination - please refer to The_Bus_Guides_post below)<br>well<strong> L</strong> stands for low flloor, the rest are Swedish words i dun understand.<br>I guess the <strong>B </strong>stands for bus lest the same chassis can be used for a Scnaia truck.<br><strong>U</strong> stands for <strong>u</strong>rban <br><strong>D</strong> stands for Double Decker<br><strong>A</strong> articulated bus</p>
              <p>nearer to the end of the 4 series, Scania put horsepower rating badges on their buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Example: malaysina coach have thhis 360 at rear meaning the bus is a 360HP rated bus.<br><br>The 5th series was launched and Scania decided to ue HP rating in part of its chassis n moel coodes. Following the likes of MAN bus.</p>
              <p>The fifth series retaind the first letter codings but replaced the rest of the numbers with HP ratings. the rear letters remain the same type.<br><br>Example: Scania K230UB - rear engine (<strong>K</strong>) - <strong>230</strong>HP rating - <strong>U</strong>rban <strong>B</strong>us<br><br>Green fuels scania<br>Scania too produce buses with CN fuel or other alternative fuel like Ethanol electric fuel drive.</p>
              <p>these will start with a <strong>C</strong> where C initially stands for CNG<br>eg: <strong>C</strong>N94UA (thats another bendybus model in korea besides the Iveco ones which u have seen pix of)<br>eg; CN310UD (Ethanol electric fuel double deck scania in UK)</p>
              <p>DO NOT think CN means part of he word CNG. it is not. the seocnd letter is still engine placement. it is only because so far all alternaitve fuel models they have to place the engine in the transverse positions which is N in code..</p>
              <p>Hope this clears up some misunderstandings on Scania bus</p>
              <p>Soruce - Windy's old post..somewhere and my own understanding of the bus industry<br>ZYX</p>

              <p><strong>Nissan Spacerunner Series</strong></p>
              <p>A short history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">A Humble start; the U/UA20, U35 series</span></strong><br>The
              Nissan U31 RCN belongs to the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) model
              Nissan Spacerunner-UA/RA (æ—¥ç”£ãƒ‡ã‚£ãƒ¼ã‚¼ãƒ«ãƒ»ã‚¹ãƒšãƒ¼ã‚¹ãƒ©ãƒ³ãƒŠãƒ¼UA/RA). The Spacerunner-UA
              started off in 1970s as the U/UA20 series and designed as a large type
              city bus. The engine was chosen to be the PD6H (originally PD6 railroad
              diesel engine, H added to denote a horizontal engine) and of 185PS
              (182bhp). The designations for wheelbase is also included in the model
              number, for the U/UA20 series, H is for 4.67 meters, L for 5.2 and N
              for 5.6. Most of the units were sold to operators in Hokkaido. Bodywork
              were made by Fuji Heavy Industries, modeled R13/3E. The U35 is later
              sold with an engine same to the later K-U/UA30 series, but with
              original U/UA20 layout.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">Development of new engines; the K-U/UA31, 36 series</span></strong><br>In
              lieu of the Showa 54 (1980) gas emission requirements, the U/UA20
              series was discontinued and production went on to the K-U/UA31 series,
              with a new improved engine (Nissan PE6H, 230PS/226 bhp) for direct air
              conditioning requirements. Meanwhile, the U35 series, being just
              qualified for the year's emission requirements, undergo a series change
              to N-U36. The wheelbase numbers also changed; K for 4.76 meters, L for
              5.1 and N for 5.5. Bodywork was also by Fuji Heavy Industries, and
              features the new R15/5E alongside the old R13/3E bodywork. This was
              also the export model for TIBS (presently SMRT) units and labeled as
              U31RCN, in which U31 denotes the series and N denotes the wheelbase. No
              technical detail related to R and C letters despite research into their
              denotation.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">Further developments; P-U/UA32 series</span></strong><br>The
              developments for this model was fast, and in 1984, the older models
              were replaced and the new P-U/UA32 series came into force. Notably, the
              pre-combustion engine of the previous series was replaced but with the
              same model, the PE6H, with a same rating. This was made for the Showa
              58 gas emission requirements.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">The V age; P-U(UA)33, 50 series</span></strong><br>1988
              saw a new revision to the Spacerunner-UA model, the newer engine
              (Nissan PF6H 235PS/231 bhp) and the option for a strong V8 engine under
              the U/UA50 series, powered by a Nissan RE8, 295PS/290 bhp. The
              wheelbase also undergo a change, K for 4.72 meters, L for 5.24 and N
              for 5.55. The new bodywork modeled R17E and 17B. The interesting thing
              for this series is that, although the U/UA50 is aimed at the city bus
              market, they are rarely used, presumably for the high engine output!
              Express buses and family owned ones are dominant.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">Into the 90s; U-UA440, 510 (520)</span></strong><br>Heisei
              Calendar Year 0 (1990), the older series were all discontinued when yet
              another new gas emission requirement came about. The U-U/UA440 series
              were introduced, with its wheelbase denotation changed from K to H. All
              other figures remain.<br>The 510 series were aimed at yet again the
              high power range, with a new Nissan RE8 V8 type engine delivering
              310PS/305 bhp. The 520 series even brought the range up higher with a
              340PS/335 bhp, Nissan RF8 V8 type engine! This clearly drawn a line
              between highway buses and city type buses.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">Mid 90s; KC-UA460, 521 and NE-UA4E0</span></strong><br>Heisei
              6 (1995), a series revision was on for yet another set of gas emission
              requirements (in a period of ten years, every year there had been
              revisions aiming at bringing levels down and cleaning the air). The new
              series added with a new R wheelbase of 6.0 meters and T of 6.5 meters.
              The engines also fell back to the PG6 (235PS/231 bhp) however, with the
              powerful V8 still in production with model numbers starting with 5. The
              NE variant was introduced for CNG version.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">Last of the step buses; KL-UA452</span></strong><br>With
              population growth and aging population in Japan, it was decided that
              bus production are to be converted to pure non-step buses and this
              signaled the end of the Spacerunner-UA in high floor city bus. The last
              series, KL-UA452 was introduced in 2000 conforming to the Heisei 11 gas
              emission requirements. The engines comes in two models, the standard
              PF6HTA (240PS/236 bhp) and PF6HTB (300PS/295 bhp). The bodywork comes
              in 7E and 7B, with new versions by Fuji Heavy Industries. In 2003, FHI
              ended its bus bodywork production and hence these are the last
              Spacerunner-UA batch with FHI bodywork.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">Into the Non-Step World; The new Spacerunner</span></strong><br>As
              this section no longer touches on the old Nissan Spacerunner-UA high
              floor types, I would consolidate all series under this section.<br><br>F Series; UA460KAM<br>In
              1997, this model was first introduced on Nagoya City Bus as a
              prototype. The wheelbase features K for 4.8, M for 5.3 meters. The
              engine is a similar PG6 (235PS/231 bhp) to the older series. For a new
              Heisei 11 emission requirement, the series are then named KL-UA272KAM,
              with KL-UA272MAM denoting those with a different wheelbase if both are
              of the same and registered in a same company.<br><br>N Series; KL-UA272KAM 'Kai'<br>With
              Fuji Heavy Industries ending its bus bodywork line, the bodies for the
              new Spacerunner-UA buses go under the NSK Company (è¥¿æ—¥æœ¬è»Šä½“å·¥æ¥­). The model
              numbers remain, and CNG versions were produced as well.<br><br>G Series; KC-UA460*AN 'Kai'<br>This series undergo small changes, with the redefining of wheelbase to H with 4.72 meters, L to 5.24, M to 5.3 and P to 5.8.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 100%;">RA Series; The Successor to the Spacerunner-UA's Long Marathon</span></strong><br><br>ADG-RA273A Series<br>The
              emission requirements change came to a slow down in Heisei 17 (2005),
              when a long term requirement was set and bus manufacturers need not
              change that frequent to new standards. The new series are non-step and
              feature a new MD-92TJ engine (300PS/295 bhp) as a standard. This engine
              uses SCR technology and Adblue fluid. Route buses uses 5 speed manual
              transmission or 5 speed auto by ZF. Intertown and family use buses
              offer 6 speed manual. Series name is formally changed to Spacerunner-RA.<br><br>PKG-RA274A/PDG-RA273A Series (Conforming to Heisei 27 Emission Requirements)<br>The
              new buses that are under production now would be able to last the
              emission requirements till Heisei 27 (2015). The new buses also
              incorporate the technology of the previous series and with changes to
              interior of the vehicles only. The other change was an OEM license to
              Mitsubishi to produce the PKG-AA274A and AA for Nissan Diesel. The
              units by Mitsubishi carries their steering wheel design.<br><br>With
              the few models of U31 in Singapore, notably the U31SCN (SBS), U31RCL
              and U31RCN (TIBS). The TIBS models only differ from wheelbase (refer to top).
              Older bodywork of R13/3E would have also existed in the fleet. Another
              demonstrator for SBS, U21SXN (SBS2452S) would have been a unique bus,
              due to the lower horsepower engine (PD6H, 185PS/182 bhp) and possibly a
              R13/3E bodywork. That bus brought in in 1982 would likely fit all the
              technical pieces of puzzle together.</p>
              <p>Of the entire series, an
              added A would mean air suspension. Local U31 with the absence of A
              would mean leaf spring suspension. Also, the 'Spacerunner' name is
              added with the newest series of low floor buses. However, it can be
              understandable to extend the name to the entire series of buses
              produced from the 70s.</p>

              <p><strong>Bus transport in <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a></strong> is the most comprehensive and affordable means of <a title="Public transport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport">public transport</a> for the masses, with over two million rides taken per day on average on the buses of the two main public transport providers <a title="SBS Transit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS_Transit">SBS Transit</a> and <a title="SMRT Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Corporation">SMRT Corporation</a>. There are more than 300 bus services covering all parts of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Plans released in the Public Transport White Paper by the <a title="Land Transport Authority" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Transport_Authority">Land Transport Authority</a>,
                  however, predict the gradual decline of extensive public bus transport
                  with the development of a comprehensive rail-based transport system
                  such as the <a title="Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_%28Singapore%29">Mass Rapid Transit</a>.
                  It was due to this concern, that the government worked towards
                  establishing multi-modal transport companies so as to allow them to
                  remain relevant in the future.</p>
              <p>However, plans are also underway to revitalize the public bus network, and make it an attractive and practical alternative to <a title="Private transport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_transport">private transport</a>. It is hoped that this would increase the ridership onboard <a title="Public transport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport">public transport</a>, as well as reduce congestion. A comprehensive review of Singapore's public transport and bus system, commissioned by the <a title="Land Transport Authority" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Transport_Authority">Land Transport Authority</a>,
                  was completed in early 2008. It has resulted in the relegation of bus
                  route planning to the Land Transport Authority by 2009, among other
                  things.</p>
              <p>When <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> first gained independence in 1965, the state of the <a title="Public transport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport">public transport</a> system was extremely unsatisfactory. Its capacity was inadequate to
                  cope with the population, while the buses were old and slow.
                  Furthermore, the system was beleaguered with frequent problems such as
                  poor management and substandard services and quality.</p>
              <p>The main bus operator was the <a class="new" title="Singapore Traction Company (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Traction_Company&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Singapore Traction Company</a>,
                  plying routes in the city area. Apart from that, there were many small
                  and individual Chinese private bus companies, each plying a small part
                  of the rural and fringe areas of the island, with only a few routes
                  each. Therefore a simple journey from the East to the West of the
                  island could involve several bus transfers, and could last a few hours
                  aboard noisy and rickety buses.</p>
              <p>As Singapore Traction Company had a 30-year monopoly and had no
                  direct competition, its services were usually substandard, while the
                  small Chinese bus companies also had a shortage of resources and funds.
                  Moreover, many bus companies had <a title="Manual labour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_labour">labour</a> problems. There were quite a few cases of labour unrest. In the late
                  1950s, the situation deteriorated. Militant bus workers, manipulated by
                  <a class="mw-redirect" title="Communist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist">communist</a>-controlled unions, resorted to <a title="Strike action" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action">strikes</a> in a demand for better work conditions and pay. These work stoppages plagued the entire bus system into chaos.</p>
              <p>A famous bus strike was the <a title="Hock Lee bus riots" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hock_Lee_bus_riots">Hock Lee bus riots</a> on <a title="May 12" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_12">May 12</a>, <a title="1955" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955">1955</a>, where workers from the <a class="new" title="Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hock_Lee_Amalgamated_Bus_Company&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company</a> began to go on strike. They were members of the Singapore Bus Workers'
                  Union (SBWU) and were protesting against bad working conditions, long
                  working hours and a low pay. Students from the Chinese Middle schools
                  even came to join and support the strikers. The situation was so bad
                  that in 1955, the Chinese bus companies were hit by a total of 57
                  strikes. In 1956, the 'Great <a class="new" title="Singapore Traction Company (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Singapore_Traction_Company&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">STC</a> Strike' lasted 146 days. The strikers crippled the country's transport
                  system. The chaotic conditions usually left the commuters in a lurch.</p>
              <p>It was in the early seventies that government stepped in to
                  reorganize the bus system. Many small bus companies were amalgamated
                  into three larger bus companies, namely the Amalgamated bus company
                  Ltd, associated bus services Pte Ltd, and the United Bus Ltd. They were
                  grouped into three regional sectors. The STC continued its monopoly on
                  the central area of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding the reorganization, bus services still did not
                  improve much. There were still frequent breakdowns, overcrowded buses,
                  and irregular fare and route structures. During this time, the <a title="Protectionism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism">protectionism</a> of the STC by the government was also removed. The STC could not cope
                  with this new environment and closed down its operations due to large
                  financial losses.</p>
              <p>In <a title="1973" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973">1973</a>, The three main bus companies were merged into a one single organization. The new company formed from this merger was the <a title="Singapore Bus Service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Bus_Service">Singapore Bus Service</a> (the predecessor of <a title="SBS Transit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS_Transit">SBS Transit</a>),
                  which came into operation in November 1973. It was hoped that this
                  would create economies of scale and ultimately improve bus services.</p>
              <p>The government mooted the idea of a second bus company in the early
                  eighties. The idea was to provide some degree of competition to SBS.
                  Therefore <a title="TIBS Holdings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIBS_Holdings">Trans-Island Bus Services Limited</a> was formed on <a title="May 31" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_31">31 May</a> <a title="1982" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982">1982</a>, as the second major public bus operator. Trans-Island started operations on 3 April 1983.</p>
              <p>Mr <a title="Ong Teng Cheong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong">Ong Teng Cheong</a>,
                  the then Minister for Communications, remarked that "Each company will
                  act as a natural impetus to enhance the performance and efficiency of
                  the other in the spirit of healthy competition and in the process help
                  bring about a better level of service." In August 1994, the government
                  announced the transfer of 17 SBS services to Trans-Island bus services.
                  This was to help TIBS in its early years.</p>

              </div>
              <p>In 2001, Singapore bus service changed its name to SBS Transit
                  Limited. This was to reflect its status as a multi-modal transport
                  operator, as it had won the tender to operate the new <a title="North East MRT Line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_MRT_Line">North East Line</a> and the <a title="Sengkang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengkang">Sengkang</a>/<a title="Punggol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punggol">Punggol</a> <a title="Light Rapid Transit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Rapid_Transit">Light Rapid Transit</a> Lines.</p>
              <p>In late 2001, Trans-Island became a subsidiary of the Singapore Mass
                  Rapid Transit Corporation (SMRT). Trans-Island Bus Service was renamed
                  as SMRT Buses Ltd on <a title="May 10" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_10">10 May</a> <a title="2003" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003">2003</a>. This continues till today.</p>

              <p><strong>How a bus is made (Chassis)</strong><br><br>In this review article , we will learn how a bus is constructed from scracth, ore about the bus industry and later apply what we know to our hobby</p>
              <p>The construction of a bus can be divided into two stages. Chassis building and body building. I shall concentrate on citybus examples and explanations. In this section, we deal with chassis.</p>
              <p><strong>Chassis</strong><br>Purely in the bus industry, they build the chassis, the skeletal strcuture of the bus base. the dash with steering (and usually the driver's seat), gearbox and engine are them assembbled up on this chassis "pkatform". Natrually drive shaft and air suspension etc systems are fitted as well. the chassis cna be driven by itself as a workabble peice of machinery. You may have seen delivery of bus chassis in Singapore with people literaly driving the bare skeletal things around to depot for deliveries.<br><br>Therefore <strong>Chassis (bus industry) </strong>is defined as the bus skeletal strcuture along with he dash and gearbox etc <br><br>A chassis is fitted at a bus maker's plant. For example at a MAN AG germany plant for the MAN bus .using universal modular parts as accordance to MAN's bbus models and specs, chassis are built. therefore one cna identify a bus just by looking at chassis parts. for bus fans, this usualy mean the dash. likewise the gearbox a universal component can be identified at dash. Sometimes even the engine compartment at rear of bus cna give clues to what mmodel a bus is. For example the Lyeland Atleantan enngine  compartmen is a uuniversal design and is part of the chassis aseembly process.</p>
              <p>However, when identifying a bus, the bus fan should not in any way decide what a bus is by looking at it from outside. This is because the <strong>bus bodywork</strong> is what u see and not the chassis parts. <br><br>In the next section we entail how the bus is built from the chassis by building up the bodywork.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><strong>How a bus is made (bodywork) </strong><br><br><strong>Integral bodywork</strong></p>
              <p>We deal with the integral bodywork types first.<strong> Integral bodywork</strong> means buses bodywork that have their bodies built up at the makers plant. Integral bodywork are usually built up from the chassis immediately after the chassis is done using blueprints drawn up by the bus maker themselves.<br><br><strong>Bus body</strong> - windows , doors, walls, roof. aiir-con pod, CNG pod.... not chassis parts kind of bus parts.<br><br><strong>Bus maker</strong> - Mercedes benz, volvo, Scania who build bus chassis for their brands of bus.</p>
              <p>A bus operator can specify if it wants the bus maker to continue building the bus bodywork using their "integrated product line" or have the chassis shipped locally and built by a <strong>local bus bodybuiler</strong>.<br><br>For exmaple: MAN AG has their own line of bus intergral product. famously known as the MAN Lion's City. o everything is done up at the makers plant nd the bus is shipped CBU to country S for bus operator say ZYXbus.<br><br>The term <strong>CBU means Completely built up. </strong>it means the bus is shipped over to bus operator fully built . <br><br><strong>Bus bodywork</strong><br><br>Certainly to save costs,bbus operators tend to ship their chassis to their local countys / country to build the bus using a Bus bodywork builder company. One example for Singapore is our dear Soon Chow.<br><br>In this case, the chassis and some other parts of the bus will be shipped <strong>CKD - Completely knocked down</strong> - over to Singapore for <strong>bus bodybuilders </strong> Soon Chow to build up the bus bodywork. Sometimes the chasis is cut short for easier shipping as in the case for a Scania k230UB chassis whereby a 2m section middle section is not connected yet to chassis During the bodywork assembly process the bodywok builder 9erm gemilang) will have to attach the chassis part to the shortened chassi THEN build  the bus body.<br></p>

              <p><strong>How a bus is made (Analysis and applications of knowledge by the bus fan)</strong><br><br>So we know roughly the stages of assembing a bus and how some varaitations can be made. lets view the variations<br><br>Chassis -&gt; intergral bodywork - shipped CBU to Singapore<br>Chassis - Ship to Spain build body - Ship CBU to Singapore 9this is for the SMRT mercs)<br>Chassis -+United ingdom body builder (Alexander) - Ship all parts CKD to SBS &gt; SBS build the bus bodyworkat SBS building plant .<br>Chassis -&gt; ship CKD -&gt;  Australia Volgren bus builder in Sydney - build in volgren CR224L - drive/ ship bus to brisbane for local bus operator<br><br>As you can see, different countrys have different ways to build their bus. <br><br><strong>Applying the info</strong><br>We now know that buses can be built by local bus bodybuilders. That creates a problem . These builders like <strong>Volgren </strong>can use the same desgins on other makes of bus. for example, We can have a mercedes benz OC500LE built in volgren Cr228L in brisbane and worse is thier MAN 18.310 also uses volgren CR228L. Essentially both bus look alike. So how are we to tell them apart by looking at the bus from ar.</p>
              <p>nearly impossible.</p>
              <p>its like you go japan, u know ahh Hino, isuzu mitshubishis are the norm there..but u land there u see all the buses look alike all in their Japanese NSK bodyworks...bummer man. heck its even possible a neoplan was built in NSK and u wun know for sure.</p>
              <p>So how how how?</p>
              <p>Dun worry. As mentioned is only bodywork, u forgot about chassis. the bus chassis parts are now the parts u want to look at. ut first, the bus should have make and model <strong>badging</strong>.</p>
              <p>check....</p>
              <p>what? see none. tough luck. no badging was put by the bus bodybuilder.<br><br>No worries.<br><br>Creep up to the bus (lol). have a look at the <strong>engine grilles</strong>. can tell? still cannot?  Creep closer...<br><br>Ok have a cursory glance at the dash. because the bus makers make the dash in universal desgins this is the best way to identify a bus. The knowledged bus fna are able to tell main European dash designs apart just by a quick glance at the dash. Of coruse a look at the middle of the steering wheel where the maker's badge is will always be the lst resort if cannot identify still.<br><br>For exmaple: one fin day i saw this coach at transtar. The good bus expert bside me had a quick look at the <strong>rims </strong>and decided it was a Scania. since my eyes really suck and i have no ideas on rims... I did the creep to bus thing. glanced at the dash. its a Scania <strong>4th</strong> series bus. So an educated guess will put the coach to be a K12<strong>4</strong>EB coach . <br><br>Source - i wrote this from scratch using my own knowledge i have and my own experinces</p>

              <p><strong>The fuel-saving features</strong> include an innovative air-processing system that uses excess energy to
              fill the air tanks, and an automatic gearbox that achieves higher

              <p>The B9TL chassis shared the same design of the B7TL. The key
              difference from both its predecessor, the B10TL Super Olympian and
              B7TL, is the new 9.4-litre engine originally designed by <a title="Renault" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault">Renault</a>.
              The radiator is located at the rear offside, similar the smaller B7TL.
              The front module design is shared with other low-floor bus chassis
              built by Volvo, and independent suspension is fitted at the front axle.</p>
              <p>The B9TL was initially offered in 3-axle format, and the 2-axle
              variant was added in 2006 to replace the B7TL. The driveline comprises
              a Volvo D9A <a class="mw-redirect" title="Euro III" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_III">Euro III</a> engine (rated at 300bhp or 340bhp), which was later replaced by the Volvo D9B <a class="mw-redirect" title="Euro IV" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_IV">Euro IV</a> engine (uses <a title="Selective catalytic reduction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_catalytic_reduction">selective catalytic reduction</a> technology; two versions were offered - the D9B260 rated at 260bhp for
              2-axle version, and a higher powered D9B310, rated at 310bhp, for
              3-axle version), and coupled to a <a class="mw-redirect" title="ZF Friedrichshafen AG" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZF_Friedrichshafen_AG">ZF</a> 5/6-speed gearbox. Volvo also offer the <a title="Voith" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voith">Voith</a> 4-speed gearbox as an option.</p>
              <p>The front wheels of 3-axle B9TL are usually supplied by <a title="Alcoa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoa">ALCOA</a> of the USA, but some buses (including the 3 prototypes) have all their wheels supplied by ALCOA.</p>

These are Singapore's first <a class="mw-redirect" title="Wheelchair-accessible" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair-accessible">wheelchair-accessible</a> buses. However, instead of automatic ramps, SBS Transit has decided to
              use manually-operated ramps. While the ramps would need more time to
              deploy, they would be more reliable than automatic ones and would be
              cheaper to install and maintain because of the absence of complicated
              mechanical parts.</p>
              <p>The buses were launched on <a title="February 15" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_15">15 February</a> <a title="2006" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006">2006</a> by Singapore's then <a title="Ministry of Transport (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Transport_%28Singapore%29">Minister for Transport</a>, <a title="Yeo Cheow Tong" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeo_Cheow_Tong">Yeo Cheow Tong</a>.
              They were supposed to be deployed from April onwards, but this was
              delayed till June 2006 - they were slightly wider than most other buses
              in Singapore, bus stops had to be retrofitted for the wheelchair-bound,
              and it was necessary to survey which bus routes in Singapore had the
              most pressing need for such buses.</p>
              <p>Fourteen such buses were registered initially, in the range of
              SBS7300P to SBS7320G (not all registration numbers inclusive). Bus
              Service 21 was the first to receive the buses, where ten were put into
              service serving between <a class="new" title="St. Michael's Bus Terminal (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Michael%27s_Bus_Terminal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">St. Michael's Bus Terminal</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pasir Ris Interchange" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasir_Ris_Interchange">Pasir Ris Interchange</a> on <a title="June 27" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_27">27 June</a> <a title="2006" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006">2006</a>, with an official launch ceremony held at Pasir Ris Interchange on <a title="June 26" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_26">26 June</a> <a title="2006" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006">2006</a>.
              Service 21 was chosen after consultations with various welfare
              organizations serving the needs of the handicapped, as well as the <a title="Land Transport Authority" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Transport_Authority">Land Transport Authority</a>. This route also passes the premises of the Handicaps Welfare Association as well as <a title="Tan Tock Seng Hospital" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng_Hospital">Tan Tock Seng Hospital</a>, among other medical facilities. B9TLs continued to roll out of the bodywork assembly plant at <a title="SBS Transit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS_Transit">SBS Transit</a>'s

              Depots, where the routes chosen are expected to serve large numbers of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Elderly" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderly">elderly</a> commuters.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit placed an additional order for 50 more chassis soon
              after placing its first B9TLs into operation, bringing the total fleet
              size to 200. As of 29 September 2006, before the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Euro 4" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_4">Euro 4</a> dateline of 1 October 2006 set by the Singapore government for diesel
              vehicles, all 200 B9TLs have been registered, with registration numbers
              SBS7300P to SBS7499A. Currently, all 200 B9TLs are out on the roads.</p>

              <p><strong>where to find the VIN</strong><br><br>the VIN is usually located at the front of the bus. look for it at the front door entrance, or aove the dirver on some compartment or bbehind the driver seat or at the seat right behind the driver 9for local bus builders of coaches)</p>
              <p>The VIN can also be found on bus engine but thats not accesible to you. it is also tagged onto the chassis as well. again not seen by us.</p>
              <p>with the VIN in hand, databases will reveal whhat bus it is and which companies have used the bus or bbus was second ahnd from where.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This form of knwledge is usful to vintage bus fans who wish to trace the orgins of a old bus that they have interest on (this is a very European bus enthusaist idea)</p>

              <p>On a personal note, I also remember some buses with the VIN. WEB61232321099027. Easy to remember once it takes some time to get the hang of it. Crazy it seems.</p>
              <p>For a manufacturer who produces less than 500 vehicles a year can not need to follow the VIN international convention, but their own convention of manufacturer indentification.</p>
              <p>U31 VIN might be due to the JDM side as the chassis might have been destined for Japan market. I am not too sure about that point, but Japan buses do have a funny trend of putting model numbers first.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reminder by The_Bus_Guide for the point on the first two letters that in fact denote the World Manufacturer Index.</p>

              <p>The first character on the VIN doesn't neccessarily mean the country of manufacture. This is a misconception that many people (including myself) had. Actually, it is part of a unique 3-character code called the World Manufacturers Index (WMI). That first character is the country where the manufacturer is based. The OC500 is manufatured in Spain but its VIN starts with WEB. WEB is the WMI for Evobus, a company based in Germany but with manufacturing facilites in other European states. All buses from Evobus, no matter in which country they are made, starts with WEB. Another example is the Volvo B10TL. Its VIN starts with YV3 (Volvo Bus, Sweden) but it was manufactured first in Scotland, then in Poland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For most cases, the chassis is manufactured from the country where the company is based. For example, Scania (Sweden, YS4 or YS2). However, there are manufacturers with 'sister' companies based in other countries. These companies operate independantly and have their own line of products although they are a part of the same organisation. An example is Mercedes-Benz do Brasil (9BM). Scania have one too. There are Scania buses, like the K124 360, whose VIN starts with 9BS (Scania no Brasil).</p>

              <p>alright some tahnks are in order and comments:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Thanks the_Bus_guide for clearing up some scania chassis codes . So the 3 or 4 letter codes after the front parts are mainly on what type of bus it shall be and the level of comfort for the journey type. Be it ur regular city travel <strong>U</strong> , your highway to towns travel <strong>E</strong> or the really village and highway of trsvel from city<strong> I</strong>.</p>
              <p>I would opinion that the 4X2 or 6X2 axle layout desgination would be good to leave out as makes it rathr long. But good to know about these extra bits after the main code.</p>
              <p>2) Ok the first part of the VIN is a manufacturs 9maker's) codes. not country of orgin. misconception by this noob (me , not anyone else, refers to me) .<br><br>3) ummm, generally i fell is not Ok to change ur posts after being corrected. Unless its one of those really important guide guide mannual kind of posts. i will of course make a correction for passenger in wheelchair.</p>

              <p><strong>Bus manufacturers</strong><br><br>A misconception by me is that bus makers have only plants in their country of origin. Not true. Bus makers or manufacturers are big global companies with many divisions worldwide. As pointed out by The_bus_guide <br><br>Cited exmaple by him was the Mercedes benz in brazil operations. <br><br>Of course to cut costs down, bus operators will generally seek for the local bus manaufacturor branch to do the job.<br><br>NOT GOOD:<br>Brazil Bus operator Want Scania k230UB<br>Build chassis in Sweden &gt; ship CKD to brazil - local bus bodybuilder build<br>-not good why? costs high and ship voer continenets.</p>
              <p>MUCH BETTER<br>Build chassis in Scania brazil - ship localy or drive the chassis over to body builders - build bus up from chassis.<br>Lower costs. <br><br><br><br></p>
