              here is the time 2013 - 2016/17 by the time DTL opens and time to lose capacity
              
              23 to be withdrawn. Alternative would be DTL, route 8, route 65 and 67.
              
              66 &amp; 67 are spared from any bus rationalisations.
              
              190 to downgrade 25 artics to about 18 double deckers.
              
              291 to downgrade 5 DD to 2 SD
              
              700 to be fully withdrawn and replaced by 921.
              
              921 will be a new service to replace part of lost 700.
              
              960 to downgrade 16 artics to about 8 double deckers and 4 single deckers.
              
              970 to cut down 1 single deck and transfer to 960.
              
              971E to be withdrawn (Bukit Panjang - Shenton Way)
              
              BPS1 to be withdrawn (Choa Chu Kang - Fajar Road)
              
              For future lines:
              
              Holland Line will then withdraw 61 (Jurong North - Buona Vista, retaining Commonwealth Drive corridor), 106 (Bukit Batok - Marina Centre), 7 (Bukit Batok/Clementi - Marina Centre/Bedok).

              <p>How long it takes from Bt Panjang to Promenade &amp; Upp Cross St on DTL?</p>

              <p>Cashew: 2 mins, Hillview: 4 mins, Beauty Word: 8 mins, KAP: 10 mins, Sixth Ave: 13 mins, TKK: 15 mins, Botanic Gardens: 17, Stevens 20, Newton 23, Little India 26, Bugis: 29, Promenade: 32, Bayfront: 34...</p>
              <p>23 mins to Newton, that's still comparable w/ 700 during off peak hrs. But not peak hours...</p>
              <p>How to compare w/ Promenade &amp; Bugis.</p>
              <p>To me, as long as the direct travelling time is slashed by more than 50%, prepare to see buses to get withdrawn or route mergers.</p>

              <p><br>EXACTLY! THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO EXPRESS!!! What if DTL has its train in three cars coming in 8 mins? SBS somemore leh... cannot compare MRT experience wif SMRT sinceÂ she only operated MRT in 2003 while SMRT oredi like 20+ yrs liao... then the situation will be UNBEARABLE since there aren't any Bukit Panjang bus svc to clear some passengers back to their home.</p>
              <p>Some might not even like to take MRT in the first place... i still remember a user mentioning he did not like automated trains in the first place... ahh yes, user MoltenFalcon. And what trains do DTL use? AUTOMATED Bombardier MOVIA C951. so a "duplication" may be good... some duplicating bus svc can even show to be even more efficient than MRT, and thus bringing much popularity even when it's duplicating MRT. SO 700/190 will still have a certain but adequate amount of popularity after DTL opens.</p>
              <p>I'm not finished yet, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sbst275</span>.</p>
              <p>Try to think of this: some people living in Pending, Senja might not be able to reach the MRT directly right? Some residents may just take 700/190 that stops just in front of their doorstep and travel straight to the city via the expressway, rather thanÂ taking that incompetant LRT and then transfer that chiongÂ chiong MRT that goes circles in the middle-west. And 700/190 DIRECTÂ to Newton/Orchard/New bridgeÂ rd/SGH/ ChinatownÂ somemore eh! Just like NEL(which I also hate), it does NOT bring you to important landmarks such as city hall/Marina BayÂ straightaway, and that's what 75,190,700 and 970 can do. You still have to transfer CCL/EWL/NSL to get there. So look who's in charge here.Â </p>
              <p>And this "rationalisation" thing won't work on Bukit Panjang bus svc. Because this is not like the 2003 NEL Bus Rationalisation, where SBS cuts downÂ her OWN svc. IMO, I think what SMRT will do is thatÂ she will improve its Bukit Panjang bus svc instead so thatÂ she can compete wifÂ her competitor, because SBS withdrawn its 501 and 502 (northern stretch) only it's due toÂ she has a much better NEL. SMRT definitely may not succumb to SBS liddat.Â She will (I hpoe that's real)Â doÂ her best to keepÂ her control of Bukit Panjang like now (hope SMRT really will do that, becoz by looking at SMRT now, I doubt she will really "try her best").</p>

              <p>Sorry to burst your two cents of worth.</p>
              <p>The PIE is always jammed, Stevens Rd exit is jammed. How long it takes to clear Stevens Rd form up to get to Tanglin Mata chu bus stop? 10 mins?</p>
              <p>10 mins could get me from Bt Panjang to KAP alrdy. Another 18 mins on the BKE can get me to Little India/ Bugis?</p>
              <p>Look, face it, expressway are the worst form of roads esp if there's any accident.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, there's a thing called feeder bus. Guess, till to this day your've no idea of the trunk/ feeder concept came up in the 1982 bus plan.</p>
              <p>City Hall? Do many alight at City Hall area? If you notice, many alights at Orchard, so 190 can still takeover.</p>
              <p>700 &amp; 960 I can say it's fate is almost sealed. DTL plies to Suntec, Bayfront, MBFC (which 700 does not even cover), parts of Shenton WayÂ &amp; Chinatown.</p>
              <p>It's not about bowing down to MRT, I guess you've not even seen how the 1987 - 1993 bus rationalisation program was implemented. Did you know 163 used to ply to Marina Square? Did you know 137 used to ply from Toa Payoh to Zoo? But why it was rationalised?</p>
              <p>Like it or not, the MRT + feedering concept would inevitably kill off trunk buses. By then, buses could also be redeployed to serve other areas. Dun forget Yishun inner portion is developing.</p>
