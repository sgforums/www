SBS 0420Y and SBS 2803M were scheduled to depart from Bedok North Bus Interchange at approximately the same time, with SBS 0420Y on Service 26 departing first.<br>2. The BC of SBS 2803M, without the knowledge of the fact that SBS 0420Y was reversing and preparing to leave, left the berth.<br>3. I was at the CSS Service 608 berth when I heard a loud bang. It probably came from the two buses I mentioned, so I looked out and saw that the Service 26's bus (SBS 0420Y) was stucked. I went to have a look.<br>4. The radiator part of SBS 0420Y had disloged on it's left looking from the front and there was a 'spider web' on the glass; it probably had cracked. The damage to SBS 2803M could not be examined.<br>5. Thereafter, the passengers of SBS 0420Y were directed to board SBS 0135X which as parked right beside SBS 0420Y while for the passengers of SBS 2803M, the bus which they got onto was unknown.<br>6. Some BCs were taking out their cameras to take the first shots of the damage incurred at the first moment. I am unable to show you how badly the bus had damaged, but it was just only the front of the bus that got slight damage.<br>7. The reason of the accident was unknown, but I suspect it was because of error and negligence of the BC of SBS 2803M. He may have not known that a bus beside him was reversing. When he reversed, he unknowingly crashed headlong into the front of SBS 0420Y.<br>8. The BC of SBS 0420Y may also be blamed as he did not horn to warn that a bus was behind when SBS 2803M was reversing.</div>

SBS 0420Y and SBS 2803M were scheduled to depart from Bedok North Bus Interchange at approximately the same time, with SBS 0420Y on Service 26 departing first.<br>2. The BC of SBS 2803M, without the knowledge of the fact that SBS 0420Y was reversing and preparing to leave, left the berth.<br>3. I was at the CSS Service 608 berth when I heard a loud bang. It probably came from the two buses I mentioned, so I looked out and saw that the Service 26's bus (SBS 0420Y) was stucked. I went to have a look.<br>4. The radiator part of SBS 0420Y had disloged on it's left looking from the front and there was a 'spider web' on the glass; it probably had cracked. The damage to SBS 2803M could not be examined.<br>5. Thereafter, the passengers of SBS 0420Y were directed to board SBS 0135X which as parked right beside SBS 0420Y while for the passengers of SBS 2803M, the bus which they got onto was unknown.<br>6. Some BCs were taking out their cameras to take the first shots of the damage incurred at the first moment. I am unable to show you how badly the bus had damaged, but it was just only the front of the bus that got slight damage.<br>7. The reason of the accident was unknown, but I suspect it was because of error and negligence of the BC of SBS 2803M. He may have not known that a bus beside him was reversing. When he reversed, he unknowingly crashed headlong into the front of SBS 0420Y.<br>8. The BC of SBS 0420Y may also be blamed as he did not horn to warn that a bus was behind when SBS 2803M was reversing.[/b]</blockquote>Thank you for your nice reporting Mr TWS, as with most newspaper reporters, you make the same mistake of not having the correct facts of vehicles.<br><br>because.....I dint know the radiator of an O.405 is at the front.</div>
