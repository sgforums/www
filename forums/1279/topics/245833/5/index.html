However, a person's feeling may not be the actual velocity of an object, cos the force a person feels on a moving object is caused by acceleration, not by velocity. Looking at speedo is better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SBS 1990 L (Sv 96) knocked into a motorcylist on 4 May, around 0820 hrs. BC was trying to turn right, exiting from the interchange when he suddenly jammed brake and threw many off balance.<br><br>Afterwards, we realised he had knocked down the motorcylist, who suffered minor injury (limping). After 10 minutes of recording some info onto a piece of paper, the BC continued on the journey. However there was a small slowdown in traffic as the bus was in the middle of the junction.</div>
