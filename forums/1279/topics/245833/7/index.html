            <div class='col-md body'>It was rather ironic. 3mins after the accident. I saw a neighbourhood policecar which happens to pass by the bus but did not stop.I don't think the news crew came (or you would have seen it on the news) as it was a "minor" one compared to other crash as no one was injured. The bus was blocking the juntion for 2mins then i moved off to a safer but still rather dangerous exit of a slip road.<br><br>*Sorry for my oversized picture of the bus.</div>

I was in that bus, on the top deck front seat and i saw the whole accident clearly. In this case, the bus was 100% in the right of way.<br><br>I guessed the blue Nissan lorry was too eager to make a right turn that he did not see (or he did see but did not give a damn) and just made the turn.The green light was for the bus, while the green arrow is not lighted for the lorry yet. The bus sounded the horn, could not brake in time, then smashed into the left-rear part of the lorry. Good thing i was holding on to the handle bar or god knows what could have happened. The collison wrecked the front left part of the bus. Windscreen was smashed, bumper got bumped off, headlights broken. I got the pictures of the wreck...Could anyone teach me how to post it here...thks...(i m new here)</div></blockquote>Cases of assumption by the lorry driver,You can be a good samaritan by helping the BC to provide details to his Route Manager @ HG/CLE.Trust me if you're applynig for Friends of SBST you will get the most priority attention.</div>
