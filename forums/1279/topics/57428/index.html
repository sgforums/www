            <div class='col-md body'>It happened just now. I was on Bus 315 and it drove towards Serangoon Garden bustop and there is a sbs bus in front of my bus. I was sitting near the first left hand seat of the rear exit door(near the window) and I have a full view of the bus stop scenario in front of me. Suddenly I saw an old granny tripped at the edge of the curb and fell in front of the first bus and hit her head. I was in the second bus. Then the Matrix begins and all the people near the incident were shocked and couldn't move for 10secs. Luckily few people picked her up and let her rest in the bench and she's ok now.....what a relief!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I have since learnt to rely on speed to board it ahead of them, and since there are often Chinese couple with babies dutifully queueing up, i see no reason why a big group og 6 with only one noisy baby should cut..the ratio does not make sense. So, when they, esp the tudung lady make that unapproving clicking sound that i hate so much, i only tell them to queue like the rest. This is one instance when I will NEVER give up  and let them board first, cos i see no logic behind it, but of course, when im not in my school uniform, and i dun want to risk kenna spotted by teachers or the "School Photographer" as much as possible.<br><br>When there is an old couple like say waiting at the berth, i will allow them to board, but when one whole clan take advantage of a minor or senior, then that is a no-no......i dun see why a whole clan is needed to take care of a baby when one or two can do the job, the rest can queue like the rest.</div>

When you are waiting for service 852 at Bt Batok Interchange, students in school uniforms won't give a damn and will just board the bus, regardless of the queue length. So much for the education these days, the students are getting ruder and have no sense of shame.</div></blockquote>I dun do that at interchanges.......but i'm guilty of doing that outside my school bus stop and sometimes the next bus stop cos i'm so tired and the pax are all school students.....TCH, NYGS, HCJC, RVHS etc..</div>

I have since learnt to rely on speed to board it ahead of them, and since there are often Chinese couple with babies dutifully queueing up, i see no reason why a big group og 6 with only one noisy baby should cut..the ratio does not make sense. So, when they, esp the tudung lady make that unapproving clicking sound that i hate so much, i only tell them to queue like the rest. This is one instance when I will NEVER give up  and let them board first, cos i see no logic behind it, but of course, when im not in my school uniform, and i dun want to risk kenna spotted by teachers or the "School Photographer" as much as possible.<br><br>When there is an old couple like say waiting at the berth, i will allow them to board, but when one whole clan take advantage of a minor or senior, then that is a no-no......i dun see why a whole clan is needed to take care of a baby when one or two can do the job, the rest can queue like the rest.</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

I agree about that activity, it is not good. I see parents with young children queueing up for Sv. 969, but I don't think they are exempted from queueing? If they are, please then inform the commuters! I'm sure they will be speechless.</div>

But again, its yourself.<br><br>I personally prefer more subtle methods...</div>

Once he scolded this group of white-collared morons in the MRT after they barged in without letting the others alight first. My friend said "I'm trying to get out of the train you bunch of assholes". Then one of the morons replied "Wah, so rude ah". Which my friend spontaneously replied "As opposed to you assholes!". I cracked up soon after that..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>
