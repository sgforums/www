              <p>Cut 2764S some slack. At first glance, missing handgrips and missing badges could be caused by routine maintenance. So a badge going missing or handgrips going astray on one bus might not be cause for alarm yet.</p>
              <p>So it could seem like the desto bracket cover was removed to facilitate maintenance and the replacement cover did not have a badge on it, or the straps on the handgrips are about to give way and waiting to be replace. Not that a big deal unless as you guys put it, things have gone missing rampantly from all over the place. Definitely that would be cause for concern.</p>
              <p>That said and done, misappropriation of the company's property is not and should not be condoned at all. Please report it to SBST and do something productive about it instead of simply posting here. What's the point of posting this here when it does not result in any corrective action?</p>

              <p>Missing items in buses? Due to maintenance? Or was it due to someone who actually tried to make them his possession?</p>
              <p>I have seen some photos by this very someone who has decorated his room to a near bus deco. Some of his items seem to be gotten down from some buses. However, I don't think we should rule out that not every missing item may be under his possession. <br><br>TO THIS VERY PERSON: If you read this forum, may you take this suggestion away: Pls stop whatever you are doing if you are still doing this. You have done it once, and most probably have done it again. It would be of no surprise if any items have gone missing or placed in other positions. Do note that this forum is viewed by people who may be related to this company he/she is working in. Who knows... someone has been monitoring this closely... <br><br>What I would say is... What you have done has portrayed some stupidity and harm for yourself. If it is that someone who helped you in getting these items, you are endangering his rice bowl. <br><br>At this moment, I think it is not substantial for the whole matter to be reported as evidences may have not been accounted for its reliability. However, should it be traced down to whoever has done this will be reprimanded and the possibility of having to pay a huge amount of money to the items discovered to the company.</p>

              <p>surveillance? it will probably work if even more buses had CCTVs installed then there's surveillance. otherwise, manual surveillance (SBST staff coming onboard to check, after operating hours bus is sent for checking) seems very futile. monitoring the situation doesn't help if there's no evidence to monitor. i wouldn't consider this "surveillance" at all in that case.</p>

              <p>It depends if he is conscientious enough to feel that he should stop doing all these. He should start to repent for what he has done as soon as he feels so.</p>

              <p>Missing items in buses? Due to maintenance? Or was it due to
              someone who actually tried to make them his possession?</p>
              <p>I have seen some photos by this very someone who has decorated
              his room to a near bus deco. Some of his items seem to be gotten
              down from some buses. However, I don't think we should rule
              out that not every missing item may be under his possession.<br> <br> TO THIS VERY PERSON: If you read this forum, may you take this
              suggestion away: Pls stop whatever you are doing if you are still
              doing this. You have done it once, and most probably have done it
              again. It would be of no surprise if any items have gone missing or
              placed in other positions. Do note that this forum is viewed by
              people who may be related to this company he/she is working in. Who
              knows... someone has been monitoring this closely...<br> <br> What I would say is... What you have done has portrayed some
              stupidity and harm for yourself. If it is that someone who helped
              you in getting these items, you are endangering his rice
              bowl.<br> <br> At this moment, I think it is not substantial for the whole matter
              to be reported as evidences may have not been accounted for its
              reliability. However, <strong>should it be traced down to whoever has done
              this will be reprimanded and the possibility of having to pay
              a huge amount of money to the items discovered to the
              company.</strong></p>

              <p>It's hard to say... but if things get to hit sky high, it can really be that bad. Like what I've said earlier, only if he knows how to repent his own wrongdoings, he will understand that it is going against his conscientious and may have endangered the person who may have aided him in his accomplishments.</p>
