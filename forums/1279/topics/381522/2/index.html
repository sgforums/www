              <p><br> If you have no idea what's going on, ignorance is a bliss. But if
              you have no idea what's going on and trying to think you know, I
              think you have found the wrong audience.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the user SBS8043A brought this up the other time in one
              of the sticky thread the other time but post was removed. This
              issue has been brought to attention for tat short moment. I am
              quite sure a handful of you read that post too.</p>
              <p>I feel that we have the right to do our part to stop such acts
              from continuing. As the situation is more serious on service 107
              buses (especially those without CCTV), we should be looking out for
              the culprit. We believe that the culprit has someone on his
              backing, if not he wouldn't have succeeded from such illegal
              activities.</p>
              <p>However, we have no rights to point finger at whoever now
              without concrete evidence. It is up to the culprit to hand himself
              in if not the consequences may be worse if you are caught
              red-handed instead. It is not nice, and there's no where to hide
              once your name and details are exposed here.</p>
              <p>I understand we are all bus enthusiasts but we do not resort to
              stealing and vadalising even if we are desperate or crazy over bus
              parts. These are company's assets and who are we to remove them?
              Who's paying for the damages and loss?</p>
              <p>2779A seem to be a potential victim for most number of lost
              items in the bus. Check it out.</p>

              <p>Cut 2764S some slack. At first glance, missing handgrips and missing badges could be caused by routine maintenance. So a badge going missing or handgrips going astray on one bus might not be cause for alarm yet.</p>
              <p>So it could seem like the desto bracket cover was removed to facilitate maintenance and the replacement cover did not have a badge on it, or the straps on the handgrips are about to give way and waiting to be replace. Not that a big deal unless as you guys put it, things have gone missing rampantly from all over the place. Definitely that would be cause for concern.</p>
              <p>That said and done, misappropriation of the company's property is not and should not be condoned at all. Please report it to SBST and do something productive about it instead of simply posting here. What's the point of posting this here when it does not result in any corrective action?</p>

              and waiting to be replace. Not that a big deal unless as you guys

              <p>i believe the picture posted by ngjy22 above very much proves that the items that appeared in the picture aren't lost through routine maintenance. there is a corrective action through posting it here. creating awareness in the forum so if other bus fans take a certain bus with missing items, they can find out for themselves if they disappeared during maintenance or via other methods.</p>

SGForums is NOT the proper channel to create awareness of such situations.
