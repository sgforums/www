              MediaCorp reporter on Friday morning.
              <br> <br> He had observed that the doors of the buses were left open.
              <br> <br> SMRT said that to further tighten security, it has reiterated to

              <br> <br> SMRT added that there are security personnel at the interchange to carry

              <p>From TODAYonline:</p>
              <p><strong>SMRT tightens security at bus interchanges</strong></p>
              <p>After the incident of the vandalised MRT train which went undetected and unreported for two days, Singapore's public transport system is now undergoing a comprehensive review as announced by the Public Transport Security Committee last Friday. One question which has been raised: Should this include making bus interchanges less open and more of a hard target? Assuming this is even practical. Currently, train depots are designated as protected places.</p>
              <p>A spotlight has been thrown on this issue after MediaCorp checked out four bus interchanges in the early hours of the morning last Friday, and found the interchanges easily accessible, with the doors of the buses at one of them - the Yishun bus interchange operated by SMRT - left completely open.</p>
              <p>Responding to MediaCorp's queries on its findings, SMRT Buses vice-president Kang Huey Ling said: "SMRT is committed to making our public transport network safe and we take Today's findings seriously. Besides a comprehensive review of all our security we have implemented tighter security SOPs on all our premises, and this includes regular audits checks to instil discipline on all staff."</p>
              <p>At the Yishun bus interchange at 4am last Friday, MediaCorp had walked unchallenged into and around the interchange and found more than 30 SMRT buses with their doors open. These buses were also left unattended before drivers began arriving after 4.40am to start their shifts. Asked why these bus doors were left open, Ms Kang explained yesterday: "The buses were being aired".</p>
              <p>Were the doors supposed to be left open?</p>
              <p>Ms Kang said: "To further tighten security we have reiterated to cleaners that cleaning of buses should be done one at a time, and after completing each bus the doors should be closed."</p>
              <p>Unlike train depots, which are wire-fenced, the Yishun interchange's bus park is secured by a combination of wire fencing, shrubs and hedges. At one stretch, the physical barrier consists only of a fence made up of a few planks and ropes, and extends upwards to under a metre in height.</p>
              <p>Ms Kang said "there (are) security personnel" at the Yishun interchange who perform periodic patrols and a night parking assistant who carries out preparation for service the next day, including random checks on the buses. However, MediaCorp was only approached when a driver arrived for work at around 5am, an hour after the reporter had been there.</p>
              <p>"We note that one of our Service Leaders had spotted Today's reporter and had requested for identification," said Ms Kang.</p>
              <p>This appears to be the norm - earlier on Friday, security guards at Pasir Ris and Hougang bus interchanges also sought identification when the reporter neared the parked buses. SBS Transit's parked buses at these interchanges had their doors closed.</p>
              <p>No guards and parked buses were however observed at Sengkang bus interchange operated by SBS Transit between 2.30 to 3am. SBS Transit spokeswoman Tammy Tan explained: "In interchanges where we have buses parked overnight, security guards are deployed to ensure the safety and security of the premises and the buses. In particular, they will make sure that no one breaks into the buses or tampers with them. In interchanges which do not have any buses parked overnight, security guards are not deployed." And this was the case with the Sengkang Interchange.</p>
              <p>However, one temporary retail booth at Sengkang had its door left open and unlocked. "We have since reminded all our tenants to ensure that their booths are locked when they are unmanned," Ms Tan said.</p>
              <p>Member of Parliament Dr Lim Wee Kiak, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, told MediaCorp that in light of the recent vandalism case, it is understandable that the public takes a keener interest in security of public transport.</p>
              <p>However, he cautioned against an over-reaction and pointed out that public bus interchanges are quite accessible and open. "It is not possible to protect them (buses) like military vehicles which may translate to higher costs for the commuter."</p>
              <p>While these incidents served as reminders to review public transport security, Ms Ng Sue Chia - who specialises in transport security research at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies - pointed out that an array of measures had been introduced over the last few years to improve transport security. For example, more cameras have been installed at bus interchanges and train stations.</p>
              <p>For SMRT's buses, Ms Kang said its drivers conduct "thorough checks" before the start of the first service each day. "Service leaders have been trained on how to look out for suspicious-looking items left unattended in the bus, and must report any irregularities to their supervisors immediately," she added.</p>
              <p>MP Mr Lim agreed that public transport serves as soft targets for terrorists, and more should be done to enhance the security, but he asked: "The issue is how much is enough ... Are current measures sufficient?" He has filed a parliamentary question on public transport security for the Transport Minister to answer at the next sitting of Parliament.</p>

              I think no matter how we are going to protect the bus interchanges and depots, worse scenerio is; how are we going to prevent suicide bombers from attacking? These people act swiftly and don't need to sabotague anything before hand; they just got to walk into crowded places (not limited to public transport!) and then detonate by another person using remote controlled device? Isnt what these are happening overseas?
              
              Also, how are we going to control the private bus operators? Besides buses, lorries etc can also be a tool for terror attack. remember the Yishun MRT bombing incident when terrorists plan to detonate a truck filled with explosives? And how are we going to protect the public heavy vehicle parks where private buses and trucks park there? And how about normal carparks? Shopping centres carparks? If we broaden our minds to anticipate terror attacks; its so wide and scary! But most important we should not be paranoid, and seriously think of how to tackle such threats to the point. 
              
              And I think should install some security barriers at all bus interchanges entrances to prevent terrorists and unauthorised vehicles from driving in. For instance, I often find private cars or vans parking inside the interchanges; esp Woodlands interchange. Who knows if these cars belong to the bus/train operators' employees or just illegal parking? And did Transit Security check and do they have the authority to issue summones for vehicles parking illegal inside? Can they be charged for trepassing? I think normal barriers should be installed to open for authorised vehicles (incl police &amp; ambulance) only. And a second crash barrier should be installed several metres after. Once the normal barrier is crashed by a vehicle, the crash barrier should automatically activate to prevent vehicle from entry into the interchange.
              
              I think the Building &amp; Construction Authority (BCA) should also think of all possible terror attacks scenerios, then revise the building codes to address for instance mass emergency escape in crowded places, whether bomb blasts can affect building structures, bomb proof roller shutters to partition off an attacked area? (just like fire curtains), fire/bomb blast protection systems, mechanical exhaust system to suck off bomb smoke and fumes in case of attack. How about sprinklers loaded with chemicals to subdue bomb explosion? And we should address overcrowding at trains and train stations; redesign existing train stations to discourage people from loitering around to wait for friends etc; for eg City Hall?

              <p>I think no matter how we are going to protect the bus interchanges and depots, worse scenerio is; how are we going to prevent suicide bombers from attacking? These people act swiftly and don’t need to sabotague anything before hand; they just got to walk into crowded places (not limited to public transport!) and then detonate by another person using remote controlled device? Isnt what these are happening overseas?</p>
              <p>Also, how are we going to control the private bus operators? Besides buses, lorries etc can also be a tool for terror attack. remember the Yishun <span>MRT</span> bombing incident when terrorists plan to detonate a truck filled with explosives? And how are we going to protect the public heavy vehicle parks where private buses and trucks park there? And how about normal carparks? Shopping centres carparks? If we broaden our minds to anticipate terror attacks; its so wide and scary! But most important we should not be paranoid, and seriously think of how to tackle such threats to the point.</p>
              <p>And I think should install some security barriers at all bus interchanges entrances to prevent terrorists and unauthorised vehicles from driving in. For instance, I often find private cars or vans parking inside the interchanges; esp Woodlands interchange. Who knows if these cars belong to the bus/train operators’ employees or just illegal parking? And did Transit Security check and do they have the authority to issue summones for vehicles parking illegal inside? Can they be charged for trepassing? I think normal barriers should be installed to open for authorised vehicles (incl police &amp; ambulance) only. And a second crash barrier should be installed several metres after. Once the normal barrier is crashed by a vehicle, the crash barrier should automatically activate to prevent vehicle from entry into the interchange.</p>
              <p>I think the Building &amp; Construction Authority (BCA) should also think of all possible terror attacks scenerios, then revise the building codes to address for instance mass emergency escape in crowded places, whether bomb blasts can affect building structures, bomb proof roller shutters to partition off an attacked area? (just like fire curtains), fire/bomb blast protection systems, mechanical exhaust system to suck off bomb smoke and fumes in case of attack. How about sprinklers loaded with chemicals to subdue bomb explosion? And we should address overcrowding at trains and train stations; redesign existing train stations to discourage people from loitering around to wait for friends etc; for eg City Hall? And <span>DSTA</span> should do more research to invent high-tech bomb/explosive detection devices for crowded areas?</p>

              <p>Imagine Toa Payoh Int is totally fenced up and entry is allowed at certain points. The entry points at Toa Payoh Int will have an automatic vehicle checkpoint. Then you set up a human checkpoint  - 1 at the alighting bay and 1 near the 143 berth. Everyone alighting from the end-on berths have to proceed to either checkpoint to get themselves checked.</p>
              <p>delivery men delivering goods have to route the long way via the bus stop and Cheers instead of cutting thru the int unless destination is within. At Breadtalk there also install another security checkpoint as well as the one near the 232 berth and the HDB hub entrance. If too troublesome just fence up one of those entry points.</p>
              <p>To double up security all depots can install vehicle screening checkpoints at the entrance of the depot to ensure safety and security of the buses returning to depot.</p>

                  to add on, CCTV on buses is good evidence in accident claims, esp when the bus captain is not at fault. Even better to deter staged accidents. Otherwise, usually end up both parties 50-50 fault. CCTV also good for buses to reverse as it minimise blind spots, esp to lookout for idiot jaywalkers. CCTV should also be used to nab bus vandals and hand over to police for action. Maybe should also include bus litterbugs and slap them with CWOs. End of trip, bus captain check the bus for litter; if got serious litter, note down the time for staff to review the video and nab these culprits. Should be serious to catch litterbugs; in current times of terrorism threat whereby whoever left their things behind becomes sensitive issue.

              While we are all  trying very hard to plug a gap, there are still plenty others that need to be pluged. We are just short of screening all pax before allowing them to board the buses; just like airport. Even if we do so, how about a truck bomb intentionally travel at high speed and clash head-on to a crowded bus? Terror can just happen anytime and anywhere and caught us before we can do anything. The challengue is how to combat terrorism effectively while at the same time maintaining a relaxed and untensed society. Unfortunately, many other countries have failed to spread the righteous religious ideals to discourage people from joining terror cells. 
              
              Maybe our govt should consider amending the law to make it a serious criminal offence if a person knows one who is a terrorist involved in terror networks but failed to report to authorities. This is something similar to the case where the soilder who stole the rifle out of the camp and his friend failed to report to police. When caught, this friend is charged as an accompliance and sentenced. Hope other countries also do this.
