              <p>Thats one problem with having double-deck buses deployed on feeder routes that are short in nature such as 225 where people refuse to go up and all squeeze at the lower deck. This is why SBST should have purchased bendy buses specially for feeder/Intra-Town use only while DDs should be restricted for trunks only. Double-deck buses are not very ideal for feeder/intra-town in my opinion. Articulated buses are far more suitable because naturally people tend to stay at the bottom for short journeys like you mentioned, saving the hassle of climbing up and down and as a result, DDs are not properly utilised for these type of services.</p>

              <p>I was thinking something like the MAN A39 but with slightly shorter length,13.7m for most of the residential route is like overkill,Maybe they can design something like 12.8m at least?With centre and rear staircases and three doors its quite practical for feeder usage..</p>

              <p>While I normally support the usage of DDs, I would prefer the usage of bendys over 2-stairs DDs for feeders. It does have faster boarding/alighting times than a standard DD, but comes at the cost of pax capacity. A bendy have both, but comes at the cost of space taken up by the bus. However, generally these feeders rarely serve roads that often have congestion.</p>
              <p>It does not means that using 2-stairs DDs will not work though. If it is a service that constantly leave the terminal as a full bus (full upper deck), and have to choose between a 2-stairs DD and bendy, I personally prefer the bendy, but if the pax amount leaves at around 100+ pax, I will take the 2-stairs DD.</p>

                  prob is many estates and its bus interchanges are too cramped to accomodate bendies feeders. for shorthaul ADDs feeders we end up most pax sticking at lower deck. so best is to deploy full single deck fleet with high freq. maybe pasir ris can use some feeder bendies when the bus routes are contracted out.

              <p>If you dont have bendies for feeders.. u need dds irrespective of whether upper deck is more than half seated. Dds with half upper deck still take around 90-95 pax compared to sds that are already jam packed at 70 pax. We keep talking about sv 225. Please go to Bedok interchange and see for yourself how queue gets cleared when a DD comes compared to SD. Same goes for 181, 240, 241, 243, 291, 293, 334. In fact, some of these feeders need more dds (again given that there are no bendies). 225 just got a DD fleet add. If dds were that ineffective, 225 would have got SD fleet add. I do agree though that DD on 225W is not that useful, but on 225G is a must for AM heavy loading and also PM.</p>

              <p>Agreed... but right now SBST does not have bendies... and current infrastructure doesn't support it... so no choice but to deploy DDs on SBST feeders.</p>

              <p><br> prob is many estates and its bus interchanges are too cramped to

              most pax sticking at lower deck. so best is to deploy full single

              <p>I think he is referring to trunk routes where passengers can use it to travel long-distance between towns and short distances within the town as if it was a feeder service.</p>
              <p>In Adelaide there is a solution to this problem - design the routes to pick up passengers who are traveling between towns and not within towns. Travel within towns should be restricted to feeder routes within towns.</p>
              <p>This helps to shorten dwelling times of these routes. Such an idea faces resistance in Singapore due to perception of capacity wastage, but it is a proof of concept that works in other cities. However, you should not be surprised if any prospective foreign operators in the contracting model proposes such an idea.</p>

              <p>Possible idea to optimise a Double Decker bus:</p>

              deck still take around 90-95 pax compared to sds that are already
              jam packed at 70 pax. We keep talking about sv 225. Please go to
              Bedok interchange and see for yourself how queue gets cleared when
              a DD comes compared to SD. Same goes for 181, 240, 241, 243, 291,
              293, 334. In fact, some of these feeders need more dds (again given
              that there are no bendies). 225 just got a DD fleet add. If dds
              were that ineffective, 225 would have got SD fleet add. I do agree
              though that DD on 225W is not that useful, but on 225G is a must
              for AM heavy loading and also PM.</p>

              <p>the service is too short for DD buses and also there are many SD serving this service. the service turning at this braddell road waiting time is a bit slow due to heavy traffic. with the road widening there waiting time should not be a problem for this service. another way solve this crowded problem is to re route 232 again. or 238P?</p>

              <p>SBST did trial DDs on sv 238 but it failed coz of the left turning. With the road widening, it could be possible in future to have DDs on sv 238 again. </p>
              <p>But AMDEP / BRBP use a different policy for feeders/intra-towns - they prefer to stuff the service with many SDs rather than giving few DDs. Something what BNDEP/SLBP refuses to do and rather gives DDs to the feeders/intra-towns.</p>
