              <p>All frequency are based on the waiting time + iris. At that
                  point of time, there were no indications of any jams along the
                  route. So I just don't know why they can't get rid or reduce the
                  no. of SDs running. </p>
              <p>Further more, HGDEP have plenty of DDs and yet they are don't
                  deploy them out. I have also see inconsistency deployment
                  throughout the weekends. So are you going to saying that this week
                  there will be less riders than last week? </p>
              <p>For the P564, I heard SBST deployed 2 Citaros and there were 38
                  pax. So obviously even if they deployed 1 Citaro/E5 KUB, there's
                  still ppl unable to board. </p>
              <p>I believe that bus fan(s) have already knew that P564 have some
                  capacity issues when a 45-seater bus is pulled out of
                  svc. </p>
              <p>And regardless of the no. of bus fan(s), SBST should have think
                  of the possibilites of more commuters[including those that made
                  last min adjustment]. There isn't a fixed name list of those who
                  rides P564 daily...</p>

              <p>this two days, saw 10 trips of Sv161 on both directions on SLE.. around max30-40 pax for each trip... does not really justify full DD deployment on weekend... weekend paxs are alway changing... there is no fixed pattern. this week u go woodlands, does not mean u will take 161 next weekend...</p>

              <p>And did you know? Everytime or most of the time, at 1 go, it's already 40+ pax. It also depends on what time you observed. </p>
              <p>Like I have mentioned, there might not be a need to have full DD, but at least 80% of the fleet are DDs. With it's lousy management, I forsee this won't come true or stay permanent. No fixed pattern? Obviously bullshit. </p>
              <p>Even if it's the starter's fault, which bus can ferry 38-40 Pax at 1 go? Are you on the bus too? Because you should seriously see how poorly manage this is. I wish I could.</p>

              <p>The journey time is only 1 hr max. That why they did not plan for sv161 to have long break at wdl.  The bc will be having long break at HG. </p>

              <p>Please lah. Now u r saying everytime there is at least 40 pax on each sv161 departing or arriving woodlands on sat or sun??? Dun exaggerate lah. I go to woodlands often on weekend n travel along SLE as well u think I dunno how many paxes are there? </p>

              <p>yes... you are exagerrating.... definitely there are instant that buses are with more paxes, BUT DEFINITELY NOT EVERY SINGLE TRIP on a weekday, have 40 paxes or more....</p>
              <p>not sure why u mean it show how lousy when there are at least 50-60% DD fleet on weekend on sv161..... the demand is NOT THERE to deploy FULL FLEET DD on weekend... just because a few SD TRIPS have standess that mean HGDEP/SBST is lousy in deployment?? </p>

              <p>Because it seriously happening too frequently that it's like almost everytime.</p>
              <p>The demand may not be over significant, but there's demand still? <strong>I don't ask for FULL DDs once again, but LESSER SDs(MAX. of 3).</strong> By subsituting 1-2 SDs with DDs won't kill right? </p>
              <p>Currently on 161 fleet, there's like 5-6 SDs on weekends. And a quick count of the loading is at least 40 already. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, you talk about comfort. Shouldn't they have replaced some SDs with DDs since s161 gets at least around 40+ demands?  </p>
              <p>Not all depots can do DD "check-up", which is why they don't deploy more DDs on weekends. But at least for now, they improved quite a few services. And I doubt SMRT earns a lot, given the LRT system + MRT ones. </p>
