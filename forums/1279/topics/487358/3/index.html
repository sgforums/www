              <p>pls lah.. dun anyhow say.. why would a BC go purposely drive so
              slowly and in the end, he cant rest? there are many factors which
              can easily caused buses to arrive late....</p>
              <p>BC will be query if they arrive way too early, that is for
              sure... but when BC are late, usually there are valid reasons
              involved... traffic jam/accident/too many ppl boarding etc

              <p>it will be no good as if the driver drive fast or too fast there will be accident. i think it stupid to fine the driver of 10min late. we should put pressure to LTA to have traffic give way to public bus service using the expressway. one way is to ban big truck from usinig expressway during peak hours. other way to have a give way lane in expressway like YOG for public bus service.</p>

              If you are late more than 10 mins BCs are fined. SBST has hardly

              <p>Actually without valid reason, 10mins earlier or late will tio fine.. Take note only BSEP svcs only so strict. Trunk services not under BSEP like 402 the bc told me he can suka suka arrive and depart earlier or later than usual. He told me got some bcs chiong then reach terminal 12mins earlier then go there sleep. If im not wrong there's some buttons that the BC can activate eg. Wheelchair boarding or traffic jam etc so it will readjust the timing of the stipulated arrival time at the terminal and also to sync with the IRIS arrival timings.</p>
              <p>If you dont believe me it's up to you afterall im not a BC. Take everything with a pinch of salt</p>

              <p>there is no 20mins frequency for sv161 on weekend.. do check
              first. average frequency for sv161 during weekend is around 13-14
              mins as well..</p>
              <p>obviously SBST have the loading data, and they think that sv161
              does not require full DDs on weekend. just because 1-2 trips of the
              SD are having more paxes does not warrant to upgrade to DD slots
              for the entire day. </p>

              <p>Is their loading data even accurate?? Look at their P564, their figure(of 35 pax) and the actual is more than expected. Even if it's an average, are you going to deploy a "just nice" capacity bus out? There's ought to have some +/- of 5(eg.)</p>

                      boarding or traffic jam etc so it will readjust the timing of the

              <p>If i am the minister i will not allow public transport operator like smrt or sbst to bid for the runing of premium bus service and also remove this stupid rule of non standing on the bus. and made this premium bus service a full day operation. after peak hour the timing can reduce to 30min or 60 min if low demand. i think the origanal idea is having mini bus or coach on the service, then come sbst and smrt bidding for the service which i think is unfair for private operator. </p>

              <p>actually if SBST wants they can convert some Euro IV KUBs to
              non-wabs and add 10 more seats after removing the wheelchair bays
              then deploy them permanently on premium svcs. Other then that can
              deploy on Express Bus Services and Training. No way they will be
              deployed on basic bus svcs when they are still hit the full WAB
              fleet before 2030. </p>

              <p>SBST can actually consider putting more pairs of seats in the rear portion, legroom in KUBs can be quite spacious actually, in addition to the conversion of seats on the Euro IVs</p>

              <p>AFAIK most of the Euro IV KUBs have 2 wheelchairs bay but they are only allowed to let one PIW board the bus. SBST can convert the 2nd Wheelchair bay and put seats. I think can put 6 more seats with that space. </p>
              <p>Personally i prefer KUBs because they have more leg room. </p>
