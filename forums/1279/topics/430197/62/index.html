              <p>I know how BNDEP is not up-to-date with their perm stickers. The point i'm trying to make is that 778R and 1932E's former perms are BN 291 and BN SP previously, so the outdated perm stix is from the days they were still on their former perms? But how could it be that 7338G's stix is outdated when it was never perm BN 21 ever? It was only ever perm on 12 and now a SP bus. And the last time i boarded it 1 month plus back, it indeed has the big 'spare' sticker pasted.

              <p>From what i observe daily (because 21 passes by my nearest bus stop), 7422X has been on 21 for the past few weeks. Probably not everyday, but most of the days it is on. From last month right you said the perm stix was alr up on 7338G, 7338G was still doing 2, 5, 12 and other services i can't recall now. Just not sure if 7338G is perm 21 or not now as what the stix says, because evidently it is still cameoing around?</p>
              <p>Anyway, 7422X is still on 21 today. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>

              <p>Not too sure about that. But it has the sv 21 stix on it though. But just recently it has lecip installed. Maybe it might go into one of BN's services soon. 14 and 196 cdge's have lecips installed and they were straightaway back on service. I do know 7338G was once a 12 perm.</p>

              <p>Yes, 7331A's former perm was 12. 8227L's former perm before 39 was 293. The point i'm trying to say is that 7338G's former perm was SP, and then before that was only 12. There was no way the perm stix could have been outdated, because it was never perm on 21 before so hence it couldn't have gotten an outdated 21 perm stix like 7331A &amp; 8227L (which reflected their former perms). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
