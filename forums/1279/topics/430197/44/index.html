              Another kid...
              
              They're hybrid trunk/ feeder services known by LTA. And I say again, the only reason they're considered trunk officially is because of the last bus timing issue from Hougang. 
              
              The central stop is Kovan instead, has to do with the old Hougang Int..,
              
              Complain? Your think your know the operational aspects of buses? I type your dun even understand a thing and cannot visualise it. I dun have to entertain people who claim to know bus route planning when they dun even know how the trunk/ feeder came about...

              Trunk???
              
              Ok, do your know the routing of 153, 157 inside Toa Payoh before feeders came about?
              
              249 is the Jurong Ind leg of 157 do your know???

              ought to be feeder, why not you write in to SBS abt their little
              mistake and ask them to change from trunk to feeder and renumber
              them to 312/313/314? and not write down the things you shld write
              down in the email to SBS here?</p>
              <p>i oso think it doesn't make sense, but <strong>do you need to

              agree. if they are feeders,
              then 111 is what?
              all loop services
              if 115 is feeder, it is gladly understood. same situation as 284/284M,275.
              
              and btw sbst275.
              101 is also renumbered from 328.
              why not feeder leh?

              SBST now dont care bout hg alr.
              now all focused on svcs OUTSIDE HG.
              
              svcs 113,53,45 always so crowded in lorong ah soo.
              the svc that got dds in lorong ah soo is 62, always come so empty.
              if school hours serangoon sec students crowd lor.
              its a first-come-first-serve basis. sometimes 113 gets the crowd if it comes first because more nearer to the places where ppl are commuting. 62 always come first than comes 113, by then the crowd is dispersed.
              Still, 113,45,53 should be introduced more trips/buses/DDs(same like some other svcs got crossover from other svcs than buses go back to their Original svcs)

              Where 101 terminates? So Serangoon New Town is part of Hougang New
              Town?</p>
              <p>Anyway, 101 was routed in that manner to maximise the no of
              buses plying to Kovan.</p>
              <p>Do 111 serve any new town now? Furthermore what are you digging
              out now? A CBD bus route is a feeder bus?</p>
              <p>Anyway... The more you try to dig more out, I think you dun even
              understand the bus system at all.</p>

              the funny thing is, that you are pointing out that all feeder svcs that are merged are feeders. Even though 111 serves the CBD area, it was once a svc in HGS. at that time, 321 - 329 were feeders in HGS. SBST decided to merge 321 and 326 tgt, hence introducing a fully trunk svc. It was intended to merge 113 and 119, so that it will become a trunk service that will finally persuade you, that it is not a feeder. Your concept of feeder is different from the generation now. I ask u ar, if WP nvr intend to merge HG and Paya lebar ward into Aljunied GRC, it is a trunk. Even though it is merged now, it is still a TRUNK. if u like to emphasise on your point that svc 334 is same as 113, is 334 even a Trunk in the first place?

              <p><br>I'll explain this one by one.</p>
              <p>111 is a trunk as it operates OUT of Hougang. It plies Serangoon, Potong Pasir, Queenstown, Ghim Moh.</p>
              <p>How many times must I say 113 operationally is a feeder? Whether is it to merge 113 or 119 into a trunk has no precedence for 119 is a trunk service operating from Sengkang. Once a bus plies out of its HDB town boundary, the feeder term no longer stands.</p>
              <p>Sv 113 if it's a feeder, then it has to opeate the last 113 from Hougang at 0030 to Upp Paya Lebar Rd AND BACK.</p>
              <p>Stop playing politics. Bus routing plans is based on HDB town boundary.</p>
              <p>Another thing to add in why is it based on HDB town boundary. Some 15 years ago, a MP requested for SBS to convert 96 into the feeder band. But it was rejected as NUS is not part of Clementi New Town boundary.</p>
              <p>113 being considered as trunk has its reasons. But it's just a simple feeder service.</p>

              <p>As for 334's case.</p>
              <p>Very simple</p>
              <p>Back in 1985, there was only the new Jurong East Int &amp; Jurong Int. There wasn't any Boon Lay Int</p>
              <p>It became natural for SBS to plan 333, 334, 335 to start from Jurong East while plying Jurong West for 334 &amp; 335.</p>

              i have requested before. feeder svc = more buses and priority to the service. Lower fares.
                      
                      113 is not converted to feeder till today. the request was made in 2009. have passed. So?
                      what does this prove? at tht period of time, 113 had additional buses.
                  
                  there were many bus svcs plying lorong ah soo. it was not a feeder at all.
                  If it was a feeder, the edition of 2004's transitlink guide, it will be stated as "FEEDER" 113
              
              i'm waiting for svc 333,334,335 to be "TRUNK"
              i wonder why you dont like to be persuaded.
