              <p>i will daresay that 119 was a tacit admission on the part of sbs that they made a mistake by withdrawing the then-85 during NEL rationalisation which was serving quite a number of schools along the northeastern corridor. note that the route of 119 substantially duplicates the route of then-85.</p>

              <p>Boy, have you seen all DDs of sv62 are full to the brim during peak hours? If you can, state where the demand is from, before complaining so much like a pussy. I would say most services for S Shift operating on OFF PEAK hours are quite empty *don't consider feeder/town service. Unless you wanted all S shift BC to drive 2 hours each for am/pm peak hours.</p>
              <p>If im not wrong, there are xover from sv33 to sv45 for am peak. Not sure if it still exists. Anyway, there is 1 E shift doing sv45A.</p>
              <p><br>Sv53 freq is already quite good, but due to high traffic along bishan and loyang which leads to bunching for D2. Hence, it is crucial for sv45A to be implemented as all pax can board the empty bus at opp blk 115.<br><br>There is already SWT for sv113. It is most needed from Lor Ah Soo to kovan. Other than that, it can be easier covered by 82/80/101/107/119/136 from kovan to other hg areas, depend which Avenue you are heading to.</p>

              <p>and besides, nowadays trunk services tend to be doing quite a bit of feeder-like roles with the constant winding through the estates (which is why i brought up 5). this causes the buses to bunch up and bad frequencies especially during peak hours - one of my biggest gripes about buses.</p>

              <p><br>Yah lor</p>
              <p>Where got like say 241 today, so many Wrights while 182 n gang still using VO2x. Should be reversed.</p>
              <p>I think 241 is too pampered as a feeder bus alrdy. 3 mins freq when 179's loading is still in a mess. Sorry, but seriously compare to the past. Trunk gets priority like it or not.</p>
              <p>Of course, some vices I've noticed on 179. The BCs have a habit of delibrately waiting for bus to be filled at 27211 before moving off.. Depriving ppl at 27231, 27251 of a boarding chance even if they're not intending to Pioneer MRT Stn but the neighbourhoods.</p>
              <p>I guess that's why for a moment, 179A was virtually didn't bothered to be dispatched. Tell everyone take 179 be it to BNL or to Pioneer or to neighbourhood.</p>
