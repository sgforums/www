               <br>First thing, do you know the purpose of this thread? Do you have to post this here?<br>
              <br><br>
              <br>Second thing is, why are you whining again? High capacity buses are on routes not because the companies want them there for fun.<br>
                     <br><br> 
              <br>The reason why DDs are there on routes during non rush hours is because you can't possibly ask the driver to drive back to the depot and change to a single deck then drive back out. This means more costs for the company and the time wasted on driving back to the depot can be better spent on having the bus running on the roads collecting revenue.<br>
              <br><br>
              <br>Please la, everyone can see that you are still harping on the same old issue, even if you deny it. I repeat it, 113 does not need DDs. Period. It will only lead to the same problem the other feeders with DDs face, top empty, bottom full.<br>

              <p>DDs are purchased for peak hour needs. Do not start ranting that so and so is empty during off peak. When you need the bus, kpkb the SD is packed.</p>
              <p>151 is pretty complex. I agree with 2601 that 151A is redundant, but it cannot be totally removed operationally because of 151e's duty. Then 151 has to cater for SIM &amp; NP.. That said, it can be done better.</p>
              <p>78 &amp; 79 are packed during the peak hours. 78 is even more frequent than 113 for a reason.</p>
              <p>291 is the only bus to N3. I've taken that leg before, it can be packed. As for the DD, I must say it's because of that people dun want to move up thinking there's always the next bus.</p>
              <p>I know I know... But if 113 has ADD, 243's problem would surface as well. Dun need to argue, dun need to laugh.</p>
              <p>243G/ W routing is there for a reason.</p>

              <p><br>78 is very popular. 7 mins freq is there for a reason. Sorry, it sucks, 2x 78 before a 113 is dispatched.</p>
              <p>81 always come 2 DD.. Do you know the route profile of 81 these days, its commuters pool?</p>

                      hougang central - upp paya lebar road (loop)
                      it goes through 5 schools.
                      goes through roads that were once under different political parties.
                      stops at the main stop where people can xfer to services to PAYA LEBAR.
                      In case you don't know, HIHS students/CHIJ/Punggol Primary people like to take 113 from their school in AVE 6/8 to LORONG AH SOO. (18-25 mins ride)
                      Peak hours can crowd until bus delay. BC chiong.
                      EG. i took 113 @ 5.00pm HG PLAZA. SUPPOSED to reach home at 5.24pm. It ended up @ 5.45pm.
                      What does that prove?
                      113 is not a feeder. A basic trunk service.
                      2nd. Feeder's frequency is capped at 10 mins MAX. I can end up waiting 18-25 minutes for this service.
                      It was a merge of services 321 and 326.
                      Service 60 had a merge as well. It has DDS btw.
                  And in addition, there are ALOT of piws boarding this service. EG. everyday, 5.30pm without fail, PIW @ lorong ah soo NKF bus stop to hougang ave 6.
                  This proves how important 113 is.
                  A feeder or not a feeder,
                  113 is not capped at 3.2KM.
              
              -NOT A FEEDER SERVICE IN THE E-GUIDE-
              ALSO. u might be thinking, why in the hell does 113 needs dds?
              put yourselves in the shoes of people boarding from HG PLAZA.
              what 113 needs are more buses and more trips.

              <p>QoS??? There's a quota... 231, 275 is not even 10 mins max
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The threshold is 90%, you can try writing to
              PTC or LTA. That'll will be their reply.</p>
              <p>113 is feeder not even a trunk service. Then like this lots of
              bus svs can anyhow be termed trunk, ask you pay full fare like
              334... You've avoided 334</p>
              <p>60 has endless of queue during the peak hours.</p>

              <p><br>Did you know how the fare stage mechanism worked for 3, 38, 60, 112, 113, 181 before DBTF occured?</p>
              <p>Anyway they are considered operationally as trunk is all because of the last bus obligation...</p>
              <p>I suggest have better read all the QoS guidelines over the conditions before proceeding any further.</p>
