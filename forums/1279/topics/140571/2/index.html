            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys, enough. I live in all SMRT areas(Yis,BP,CCK,Wdl, BB) in my Whole Life and i know how they work. When SMRTB was tibs, everything was great. Literally, Tibs was a company full of professionalism and enthusiasm, unlike SMRT, which is money-minded as you can see obviously.<br><br>When printing route amendments, quality of posters are POOR. But when they put up NEW FARE posters. WHOA!The quality is superb.It is made of hard cardboard and they use laser jet ink cartridges to print it. And new fare guides are so nicely designed.<br><br>BUT when they print amendments and service guides, design is so simple and quality is bad...Regardinng the removal of guides issue, true, there are 2 batches printed. One is June 2004 and the other is May 2005. A few weeks prior to the fare adjustments, all of it was removed...SMRT IS PLANNING TO PRINT NEW GUIDES&gt; evidence:<br><blockquote><strong>8 21/06/2005-12/07/2005 by 1030 hours TENDER NO: QX05-32<br>DESIGN, PRODUCTION OF ARTWORK AND PRINTING OF TRAVEL INFORMATION FOR TOURISTS AND VISITORS TO SINGAPORE, BY SMRT<br><br>ELIGIBILITY:<br>EPU/SER/18 or EPU/SER/20, Financial Grade S3  and above<br><br>DOCUMENT FEE:<br>S$26.25 each set (Inclusive of GST)<br>Payment by cheque only (non-refundable)<br>Cheque payable to SMRT Corporation Ltd </strong></blockquote></div>

The buses may be dirty, so unless you want to help SMRT and SBST clean the buses up, i suggest you tone down your complaints here. It would not make any difference.<br><br>Let's face it, both companies are trying very hard to earn more profits. If you want them to spend more money on cleaners etc, be prepared to fork out more money for your bus fares as additional costs would ultimately be handed down to passengers. Now, would YOU want that? Unless you tell me you guys actually do your part by helping to pick up litter in the buses and sweeping the collected dust away, I really dont see a need for this thread coz it's simple - it is biased against a company. I am not saying i'm supporting SMRT, it's just that the title of the thread itself goes to show that pple here think badly of the company, let alone the buses. Sigh.</div></blockquote>Well, I don't mind helping them as a part time worker to clean up after army. What do you suggest then, any kang tao to recommend me in?<br><br>IMO, I don't think SMRT should sacrifice such things to keep costs at their reasonable level. Of course, you're on a different frequency, thus our views differ. Furthermore, there are some frequency problems such wasn't discussed here because I consider them off topic here.<br><br>Lastly, I'm not biasing SMRT against SBST. It is more like what has transformed ever since SMRT took over TIBS.</div>
