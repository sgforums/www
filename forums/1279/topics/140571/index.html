IMO it's one of the best evidence that SMRT Bus did not bother to clean it despite the initial complaint and followup mail to them.

SMRT has printed TWO sets of guides. <strong>TWO SETS.</strong> One was when SMRT renamed TIBS to SMRTBuses, which was the first print. <strong>A reprint took place just last May and June THIS YEAR, which was ONLY ONE TO TWO MONTHS away before the fare hike announcement.</strong><br><br>When this reprint took place, loads of guides were seen returning back to the racks INSIDE the buses as well as the racks at the interchanges. Here is where I doubt some of your claims that SMRT did not replenish the guide supply in the buses' racks because SMRT did. The reason why some claimed SMRT did not bother about the lack of guides even after repetitive complaints were simple.<br><strong>1) They were not observant enough.</strong><br><strong>2) They dont take SMRT buses frequently enough.</strong> I am not saying those who do not live in SMRT areas are not unaware coz they might take SMRT buses more frequently even if they live in SBST areas.<br><br>The cut-off date for these second batch was May and June 2005, depending on the towns and depots producing them. I am more inclined to think that those who said that SMRT guides can still be found should be the ones that are supposed to "travel out" and see for themselves before posting fake info. SMRT has recalled ALL guides since the fare hike announcement. It would be irresponsible of them to continue distributing outdated info, and this they know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay people, enuf. The buses may be dirty, so unless you want to help SMRT and SBST clean the buses up, i suggest you tone down your complaints here. It would not make any difference.<br><br>Let's face it, both companies are trying very hard to earn more profits. If you want them to spend more money on cleaners etc, be prepared to fork out more money for your bus fares as additional costs would ultimately be handed down to passengers. Now, would YOU want that? Unless you tell me you guys actually do your part by helping to pick up litter in the buses and sweeping the collected dust away, I really dont see a need for this thread coz it's simple - it is biased against a company. I am not saying i'm supporting SMRT, it's just that the title of the thread itself goes to show that pple here think badly of the company, let alone the buses. Sigh.</div>

I have TIB1197S groaning.. yes, the sound was like a person farting (but of course louder), whenever the bus turns left. But hey, as long as the bus can get us to our destinations, why bother? Not happy, take alternatives, since u mentioned complaints do not work.</div>
