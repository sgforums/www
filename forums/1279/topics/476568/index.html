              <p>No doubt the material seems expensive, but from far, it makes each BC look like some Ah Teong uncle imo. IMO, it might look abit more professional if it's a solid shade of purple instead of using stripes down the length of the shirt (think SMRT BC's red shirt &amp; SBST Trains' green shirt)</p>
              <p>From outside, it blends in quite well with the dashboard of the buses though (or put it in another manner, camouflage the BC's presence in the bus). <br><br>But a refreshing change nonetheless after so many years with the previous greenish-blue hue shirt. Should be to align with their livery, just like their competitor. </p>

              Hello to the new SBS Transit bus captain purple uniform, replacing the older blue (and green for frontline staff) uniform as of today. Many thanks to this friendly bus captain for posing for this shot too!
              <p>
              The North East Line staff is also said to have a different set of uniform as well.

              <p>Saw the SBS Transit bus drivers wearing the new purple uniform in person today. In comparison to the previous light blue colour, purple looks more professional. The light-purple stripes make the bus drivers look thin, somewhat making them look ‘better’. I notice that on the collar, there are collar pin/badges. Not sure if this is sign that SBS Transit is implementing some ranking system (similar to in the military), nonetheless, this makes the bus drivers look smart(er).</p>
              <p>I believe the “more expensive” material is meant to make the bus drivers feel more comfortable when they are driving the bus on the roads. (Analogy: Polo tee vs normal Cotton tee) Indirectly, this would also improve the quality of service – in driving the bus and when speaking to the commuters (to ask them to move inwards to the rear, answer their questions, chit-chat with them, etc.), when the bus drivers feel more comfortable and are in a better mood.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, “more expensive” would also mean that it can last longer; don’t need to replace so regularly. Thus, in the long run, it may allow SBS Transit to save money, and re-channel the saved money on other things, such as better buses, seats, etc.</p>
              <p>I believe this change of uniform is meant to be in-line with the opening of the Downtown Line – SBS Transit’s second MRT line. Not sure if having separate colours of uniform for different modes of transport(bus, MRT, LRT) would be better, I assume it would look more ‘organised’/’professional’/’neat’/’uniform’ if this change to Purple uniform is applied uniformly to all of SBS Transit’s operations; to the NEL and Punggol and Sengkang LRT, besides applying it to the bus operations.</p>
              <p>I read from somewhere that there was also a change of uniform for the NEL staff members. I have not seen the new NEL uniform yet but I hope it is also the same purple uniform that the bus drivers are wearing.</p>

              <p>My guess is the bus exterior have 3 type of color, purple on
              bottom (bumper), white (body) and orange (roof). The uniform of bus
              captain is purple, represent the lowest ranking in SBS. </p>

              <p>I don't think so. Like that the trainee drivers have the highest ranking lol.</p>
              <p>SBS3294A morning driver decided to wear the old green jacket (with the new purple uniform).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Also saw another driver who wore black sunglasses with the black jacket, looks really professional.</span></p>

              <p>In my opinion, I feel that in terms of ranking, the Frontline customer service staff should be the lowest, followed by the train drivers, the bus drivers , and the staff in the control station being the highest.</p>
              <p>The control station staff, whether in bus interchange/terminal/depot or train station/depot, have to be equipped with the knowledge required, aside from the skills. They are the "brain" of SBS Transit's operations. Before anything else, they probably have to get the relevant certificates, degree, diploma, etc. This is before they attend training sessions to equip themselves with the skills required to be control station staff, before they can join as control station staff. Hence, not everyone can be control station staff. Therefore, in terms of ranking, the control station staff is the highest, or one of the highest in rank.</p>
              <p>Bus drivers have to first be trained to drive bus, then go for driving tests to get the licenses required to drive. When they join SBS Transit, they have to learn how to drive different models of bus and where to drive the bus to(route familiarisation), before they can be bus drivers of SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>Train drivers, on the other hand, do not require any license to drive train. They, however, need to know how to manually operate the train. Still, they do not need to familiar themselves with the route, or learn how to drive different models, especially since there is only one model of train in each line that SBS operates. So, the only skills required of Train drivers is perhaps how to manually operate the train. Hence, train drivers are less skilled. Therefore, in terms of ranking, the Train drivers are below the Bus drivers.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the frontline customer service staff, they only need to know how to talk. No pre-requisite required. Therefore, in terms of ranking, the frontline customer service staff are the lowest in rank.</p>
              <p>In summary,</p>
              <p>Highest: control station staff.</p>
