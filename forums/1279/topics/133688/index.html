            <div class='col-md body'>That's the kneeling feature found in some citybuses. A few Scania bus-chassi in Singapore uses it since around 5 years ago. Useful to have but i wonder how well would it be used versus any known 'tradeoffs' compared to not using it ?<br><br>The bus-stop name indication is useful but i'll prefer just flashing the name on the LED interior panel (which already exist on TIBS buses here but now they use it to show time &amp; temperature instead !) To make one's ride as quiet as possible, no need to announce audiably except when there's blind people on board which the driver would know of any.<br><br>The operators &amp; or drivers here need to learn how to set more realistic air-con temperatures !!!! Of late i notice they simply set to the coldest @ full blast, which is not only wastage but is actually making people more uncomfortable than comfortable ! If there's condensation &amp; they need to use wipers even to see outside (which stupidly seems quite common nowadays especially @ night)<br>then it's very obvious the setpoint temperature is too cold yet they can't seem bothered to make sensible adjustments ! Operators &amp; drivers do need to wake up to deal with such wasteful &amp; inefficient usage of the air-con !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by miwitch:</div><div class="quote_body">that Singapore Buses should be like Germany's...<br><br>Germany buses have hydraulic facility for bringing the steps lower to allow old people to easy board the bus. When the hydraulic deactivates (or activate, im not too sure) the bus will tilt in an angle around 5~10 degrees down towards to bus stop. Before closing doors, it will activate and the bus is in upright position again.<br><br>It has a system whereby when it stops at every busstop, it will annouce the busstop name (or rather street name).<br>Together with the streetname appearing in a screen mounted at the top (like LEDs but better than that, also duno call wat =_=) so that you will not miss your busstop and need not look around to see if you are alighting at the right busstop or not.<br>Sometimes singapore drivers very powderful, they full blast the air con, causes the condensation on the windows.. Cannot see where u are at all. ~_~"<br><br>So with these facilities, I am sure there would be lesser chance of "XIA CUO ZHAN LA!"<br></div></blockquote></div>
