            <div class='col-md body'>Air is released from usually the front air-bellows of the air-suspension so that the bus's boarding/alighting height is reduced, to make it easier for people to go up/down the bus. I'll say such feature mainly makes sense on low floor citybuses only with zero or few shallow steps.<br><br>Volvo B10M i don't consider it an ideal citybus due to its higher step/boarding  height, higher floor level &amp; no low profile tyres used. Furthermore, with the engine placed so near to front axle, if there's any kneeling @ the front entrance &amp; there's a hump on the road underneath, then i think the resulting ground clearance can be too little &amp; the engine may be hit. If the engine's right behind which tends to have higher clearance from the road (as in the case of purpose built citybuses which i don't consider the B10M to be) then perhaps kneeling may be used.<br><br>Therefore i'm not surprised if there's no kneeling function as standard on Volvo B10M.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cck_190:</div><div class="quote_body">may i know what is kneeling function?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So that is the root cause of the 'excessive cooling' problems ?!??<br><br>The fact that you get so many over cooled buses (with condensate misting up the windows &amp; what ? drivers wearing jackets (how stupid that sounds to even think about ?!) especially @ night conclusively shows either unrealistic temperature setpoints &amp;/or automatic control not responding effectively to ambient temperature changes in the interior !!!!<br><br>Since such automatic devices don't seem able to function to give people realistic levels of comfort (i.e. normal air-con room coolness NOT refrigerator/freezing compartment coolness) then human intervention would therefore become practically justified again.<br><br>High time they learn from Handal Indah in this area !<br>I've taken many rides on their CW2 route &amp; notice their drivers are able to manually fine-tune the temperature setpoint &amp; blower fan speed from the dashboard to suit changing interior temperatures !<br><br>As a result, i mostly encounter acceptable levels of coolness on their buses which is NOT excessively overdone to the point you see misting on the windows ! Other +points associated is that because the air-con compressor does not have to come on all the time &amp; due to the variable blower fan speeds, the interior also becomes quieter which makes the journey more pleasant for the passengers !<br><br>Of course the drivers require some basic training perhaps on how to go about fine-tuning the temperature &amp; what consitutues 'acceptable' temperature ranges etc. Nowadays with higher educated drivers here, that surely is no longer a problem to train them to be able to do that !

Other +points associated is that because the air-con compressor does not have to come on all the time &amp; due to the variable blower fan speeds, the interior also becomes quieter which makes the journey more pleasant for the passengers !<br><br>Of course the drivers require some basic training perhaps on how to go about fine-tuning the temperature &amp; what consitutues 'acceptable' temperature ranges etc. Nowadays with higher educated drivers here, that surely is no longer a problem to train them to be able to do that ! If they can train people to service air-cons, then they can damn well also train people to USE air-cons<br>properly !<br><br></div></blockquote>Haha,What can i say?Another point of view?There are some reasons for them to set it up that way.Another thing that you can went to their HQ and debate to them about this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

(found on most buses like volvo mk4 and VO3x etc). with the divider thing, dun think it will be wheelchair friendly, esp when SBS had start to implement it.. anyway, most wheelchair ppl use london cabs..<br><br>and yeah.. those u mentioned, the drivers usually kneel them down and sometimes extends the ramp.. Singapore buses kneeling is less frequent and obvious, tho i daresay i experienced the SBS1688 and SBS2888 kneel</div>
