            <div class='col-md body'>For those who have questions on the decision on playing pool during outing, I would like to clarify myself.<br><br>1.   Most pool centres have an age limit of 16 and above.<br><br>2.   The pool outing is just a suggestion. I believe this decision would not be feasible for this outing, taking into consideration there might be younger bus enthusiasts around.<br><br>3.   Also I would like to stress that the forumnites here do not get too anxious over anything posted here. There are suggestions which might be or might not be feasible. The decision would be made carefully, ensuring that no one would be left out.<br><br>4.   If this proves successful, I suggest we may have outings for pool games, etc for different groups of people. This would not be implemented very soon.<br><br>5.   In addition to what I've posted previously, I am against the idea of just taking buses as there might be other parties interested for this outing, but they are not bus enthusiasts. We must spare a thought for them as bus rides may bore them to the ultimate.<br><br>6.   Thank you for your patience on reading this.</div>

Have you tried spending over $15 just on bus rides a day? I believe not.<br><br>I have a personal experience on this and the feeling of seeing the number on the EZLink reader getting smaller and smaller isn't that good.<br><br>And yes, shrinking wallet.

Visits of bus depots cannot be impromptu. It will not be entertained by the bus companies. Both parties (us and the bus co) need time to consolidate the strength of the group, security clearance and also the availability of staffs to guide the tour. From experience this will take at least 2 months or more.<br><br>2.   Rides on 9889U would have to be on a weekday and I believe there will be some forumnites who can't make it. My suggestion is that you can get hold of the schedule if possible, and go on the trip at your own time or in a small group of your choice.<br><br>3. Same goes for the CNG Buses. Just that they might operate on weekends. No guarantee here.</div>
