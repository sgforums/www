              <p>The hybrid bus, is hardly green at all.</p>
              <p>Just think of the production of its huge-ass battery, just how
              much rare earth would be needed to mine, and then the production
              process, how much CO2 would be produced at the same time (if you
              will), and then the by-products created that would be disposed
              somehow.</p>
              <p>Its just a novelty.</p>
              <p>Nothing more.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, its just as bad to the environment. Its
              just where the pollution goes, and when its mostly produced. Even
              if the CO2 produced by the bus is reduced, if we focus on the Kyoto
              Protocol, then we're simply transferring the carbon credit to
              another place in the world, where the rare earth gets mined and
              refined.</p>
              <p>In other words, we're still not doing enough for the environment
              and the hype over such a bus is therefore somewhat meaningless.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I would take this kind of hybrid buses as a stepping stone to something more green, perhaps a full electric or alternative source energy powered vehicle.</p>
              <p>Yes, there are plenty of materials wasted and destroyed, emissions made in the production of the vehicle. Heck, even the bus bodywork is made from limited materials mined from the earth. Given the current situation however, there seems to be little alternative to this.</p>
              <p>I would take Japan as an example here, they manufacture the batteries and produce the hybrid buses and vehicles. Industries have caps on emissions as well, not only the vehicles, hence the government there implemented laws to restrict industrial emissions, all the way from manufacturing to the end user. Recycling to them is almost a compulsory thing as well. A complete package of restriction is necessary to ensure that the end product is more efficient in inflicting less harm on the environment than a conventional method made product.</p>
              <p>However if you are presenting the point that 'we're still not doing enough for the environment', I would like to hear from you; what kind of bus or vehicle would be the ultimate green vehicle? Do not take this as a challenge; I just want to hear from your point.</p>

              <p><br>I concur with your points, its just that when we read about such things, it must be with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>I wasn't thinking in line with "greener" buses. As you have pointed out, even our everyday objects contain rare earth, but the thing about this hybrid bus is that it contains a lot more of these precious metals.</p>
              <p>It is simply not sustainable.</p>
              <p>As it is, even if we do not talk about the environment at the moment, China is the one that produces much of the rare earth (&gt;90% I believe), and it is now mulling over whether to restrict supplies to the global market. Will half a million bucks be the lowest price we'll be seeing? I'm not sure personally.</p>
              <p>Disposing off this bus and its battery will be another issue.</p>
              <p>There have been talks about getting people to use enhanced technology to induce stay-at-home working, but that's not likely to happen on a large scale either. Buses will stay.</p>
              <p>Objectively speaking, we're not doing enough, but it is more because of our lifestyle choices these days and a lack of alternatives. We need to travel more now because we are able to and are expected to. Yeah, implicit acknowledgement on my part that at least there's something being done, even if I disagree that it should be more than a trial bus and hence experimentation with technology.</p>

              <p>Why would you want to remember your passport number? Is there
              the need to remember it?</p>
              <p>I just collected my new passport not long ago, when the staff
              handed over the new passport for me to sign, the biopass page was
              already slightly bended, and that makes the whole passport slightly
              bended as well.</p>
              <p>One more thing to add, ICA doesn't encourage people to
              pay the passport fee by cash. Look at the application form, it
              mentions all sort of payment methods but does not mention the cash
              payment. That time I gave the female staff two $50 notes, she asked
              me: "You don't have cashcard", I replied no, she still can asked
              me: "Then you don't have $70 exactly?" (If I have $70, I would have
              give you already right!) Can see that she was not happy when I paid
              in cash. When everything was done, she placed the passport and
              other stuffs on the counter then straightaway press the next
              number. Very poor service attitude. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hd-videoconverter.com/mts-converter.html">MTS Converter</a></p>
