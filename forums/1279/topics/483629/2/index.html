              <p>It's nostalgia bro. </p>
              <p>163M is different in quite some ways. </p>
              <p>It is not a real feeder svc, does not ply where 371 ply, and most important of them all is 163M has only one bus that differs everyday. </p>

              <p>For some funny reason I really miss the Scania N113CRB CACs. Used to ride them on service 28. Also miss the Volvo B10M Mark IIs I've ridden once in awhile on Hougang services.</p>
              <p>I also remember a VO3X B2 on service 28 with full seating at the bottom deck, and I remember 9484D and 9452X had the frame-like thinggy on the exterior for quite a long time.</p>
              <p>Back then I dreaded riding VO2X on service 93. Now I kinda miss them. The most recent time I've ridden one was on service 193 in Jurong, while I was still in my first few months of NS after BMT.</p>
              <p>To be honest I don't miss the Leyland Olympians. Didn't really like them at all. Used to take 143 and always hoped to get an O405 instead.</p>
              <p>And also remember Mercedes-Benz O305s on 152 and later on 28.</p>
              <p>All fairly recent I guess. I'm only 24. Still a little boy. Not a lot of memories...</p>

              <p>Actually yeah, might be LA or LO2X instead. Got confused with the bodywork... I didn't really take note of the NAC DDs back then, was focused mainly on the VO3X.</p>
              <p>*Just checked on sgwiki. Looks like only one LA permed on 28 and the rest were LO2X. No O305s at all. Only know for sure there was once I rode on a different-sounding NAC DD on 28, might be the LA. The rest all sounded the same so probably all LO2X. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

              <p>I dun think 143 and 157 had 0305s before.</p>
              <p>For 157, it used to be under dual BBDEP if I am not wrong and there were LAs and Volvo MK3s deployed. It was later in Oct 1993 that 157 went under JRBP and the LAs changed to LO2x and Volvo MK3s totally withdrawn from this service.</p>
              <p>26 was all the while under HGDEP in the past and hence 0305s and Volvo MK3 were deployed even though it plies to Toa Payoh. There were also MK4 deployed on 26 before for a short while. Can't remember when 26 moved to TPDEP/BRBP controlled?</p>

              <p>Was the old service 1 (Changi Village to Delta fringe carpark) under BNDEP, HGDEP or BBDEP? I remember Albion Vikings on this route followed by a short term upgrade to MK2s just before it's withdrawal in Dec 1989.</p>
              <p>390 also. Dunno which depot operated when it was still with Albion Vikings? But for sure 390 went to full BNDEP once upgraded to FAC.</p>
              <p>Or did BNDEP took in any Volvo MK2s for a short while in 1989 before the Scania N113CRBs rolled into SBST fleet?</p>

              <p>Now I remember. I did indeed ride a Mercedes-Benz O305, but it was either on service 153 or 165. Not 28. It was definitely an O305 though, I remember the engine sound and there are O305s recorded on youtube. Don't think I've ridden on an LA before, so pretty much only ridden on one O305 and quite a few LO2X (on 28). O305 has a very nice engine sound though.</p>
              <p>Were the LO2X manual? Sounded like it...</p>
              <p>It was also on a Hougang service that I got to ride on a B10M Mark II. First and last time. Sigh.</p>

              <p>153 O305 DD was already old when it appeared on 153. I have seen non-air volvo olympian appeared on 153 and 31 before. LO2X was automatic gearbox and both LA and LO2x i think was the same type of gear box. sound like manual but in fact was auto.</p>
              <p>LA was very rocking compare to LO2x. and the older LA had semi-auto gear box which found in service old 159 (using CTE to old AMK interchange),old 140,143 and sometime 157, old 56 and old 141(use to be express service to shenton way and loop back to toa payoh) old 140 (express service, <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">toa payoh to </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">orchard loop back to toa payoh) old 56 (toa payoh to bishan) and 142 also use to have very old LA in service. if now SBST can bring back 140 express and extend it to AMK, i am sure this service can help out in MRT problem. </span></p>
