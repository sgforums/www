              <p>I was going through my loading notes and witnessed how different Sv 111 was 3 years back when CCL had not yet opened. It was a majority dd fleet with only a few SDs contrary to how it is today. </p>
              <p>There used to be very high loading on 111 from Suntec to Dhoby ghaut with each bus getting more than 80 pax. Also since it was one of the few loop services, am rush outside Dhoby ghaut MRT was lots for Suntec/Esplanade. Interesting to see how services change with new infrastructure. </p>

              <p>Still remember taking SBS6888S regularly on 198 in the mid 1990s' when I was still a primary school student then.</p>
              <p>Still remembered that SBS9250L to SBS9259M were the first batch of ADDs to ply my neighbourhood in 1994 doing 99.</p>
              <p>Then a year later in 1995 198 started using VO3X also from SBS9359H to SBS9368G and SBS9372T.</p>
              <p>Then in 1996 157 also started using LO3X. Still remember the 'pioneer batch' of ADDs SBS9002L, SBS9096R, SBS9187L, SBS9155D, SBS9032A, SBS9082E, SBS9104B, SBS9125R, SBS9078T, SBS9115U etc. SBS9173B, SBS9174D, SBS9128H, SBS9055J and SBS9036P 'joined' 157 later while somewhere in 1998 when some services became FAC some of them were redeployed to 98 like SBS9082E, SBS9115U, SBS9125R, SBS9104B etc while remaining JRBP LO3X SBS9128H and SBS9155D were redeployed to 179 in 2001 leaving JRBP side no LO3X for 157 after a year or two when buses like SBS9039G were redeployed to 157.</p>

              <p>I also have some deep memories on LO2X.</p>
              <p>Still remembered that last time 51, 97, 154, 197 have similar type of fleet for DDs - Non AC fleet comprises of LO2X and LO3X for JRBP side while HGDEP side comprises of O305s and VO3X.</p>
              <p>While 143 and 157 had LO2X and LO3X from both JRBP and BRBP side. While 99 and 198 were using LAs and VO3x until somewhere in early 1997 when VO2x started replacing LAs on both services. And 30 have the unique combination of LO2X and VO2X in its NAC fleet.</p>
              <p>Also not forgetting 105, 172 and 174 having similar type of fleet too using O405s NAC/OAC WA/DM bodyworks.</p>

              <p><br>Ya actually most ppl do not want to sit at the lower deck rear row most of the time, due to the poor ventilation and engine at the back of the seat. But O305 different, rear is cooling as engine located below instead.</p>
              <p>Single deck I prefer OF1413 Auto Transmission with Supreme Star body. Smooth and fast journey.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, sbs 198 did not go dover road. It went straight onto AYE after north buona vista road. At that time, a loss of bus service 196 along dover road is deemed as very crucial as it is only 1 service connecting to buona vista mrt from the deep end of dover. It is the so called door-step bus service for dover. Protests were up and eventually sbs transit did recognise the premature cutting back of sbs 196 at buona vista and extend it to clementi. </p>

              <p>For some funny reason I really miss the Scania N113CRB CACs. Used to ride them on service 28. Also miss the Volvo B10M Mark IIs I've ridden once in awhile on Hougang services.</p>
              <p>I also remember a VO3X B2 on service 28 with full seating at the bottom deck, and I remember 9484D and 9452X had the frame-like thinggy on the exterior for quite a long time.</p>
              <p>Back then I dreaded riding VO2X on service 93. Now I kinda miss them. The most recent time I've ridden one was on service 193 in Jurong, while I was still in my first few months of NS after BMT.</p>
              <p>To be honest I don't miss the Leyland Olympians. Didn't really like them at all. Used to take 143 and always hoped to get an O405 instead.</p>
              <p>And also remember Mercedes-Benz O305s on 152 and later on 28.</p>
              <p>All fairly recent I guess. I'm only 24. Still a little boy. Not a lot of memories...</p>
