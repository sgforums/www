              <p>Hi everybody,</p>
              <p>I am back.</p>
              <p>Recently there was a thread on becoming a bus driver aka BC. I did write some of my comments, and it is nice to know that a BC job is not scorned.</p>
              <p>I am just curious to know how many of you guys out there really want to be a BC.</p>
              <p>It is easy, just get yourself a Class 3 driver's license and that's it. Because SMRT or SBST will provide in-house training. You will have to pass the test and then you will get a vocational license which the employer will authorise the license holder to drive a bus. It is just that easy.</p>
              <p>The vocational license will allow the license holder to drive any bus, be it SBS or SMRT or even own a private hired bus.</p>
              <p>But it is not a job which will give you plenty of money, but rather sometimes you may get scolding from unreasonable passengers.</p>
              <p>I met my ex-colleagues recently. It appears that the schedule is not as demanding as before. Thanks to the GPS tracking system.</p>

              <p>must apply to 'enter' the route.</p>
              <p>as with any job, it's about how you balance your working life with family life. drivers have a standard off day per week (some hardworking drivers, mostly PRCs who dun have their family here, choose to come back to despatch office even on their off days cos of double pay) too. some split shift drivers like their duties as it allows them to go back to school during swing to bring their kids home and have lunch with them before going back to drive during the evening peak.</p>
              <p>as for renumeration, it can be comparable to any other job of similar job scope, so it boils down to your budget control. in other words, if you cannot marry with the pay for other jobs, it'll be the same for a BC job since the pay is comparable. nobody gets the basic pay anyway. there is some OT and allowances for the different shifts performed throughout the month, and not forgetting performance and no-accident bonuses.</p>
