                  <p>If you know your pictures cannot make it and/or you don't feel
                  any sense of accomplishment while taking photos, then I suggest you
                  don't take photos that often so as to save yourself from any
                  possible torrent of comments regarding your photos. Go do something
                  else; for the bus community, you can contribute in other areas like
                  timesheets ;or do something which benefits you as a whole, you can
                  pay more attention to your social life or studies instead of doing
                  senseless stuffs. You don't have to take photos every other day or
                  week to prove that you are a bus fan, I don't take photos of buses
                  frequently.</p>
                  <p>If you don't understand what I typed above, then it simply
                  means, it is quite disappointing to see substandard photos from a
                  few people despite repeated recommendations.</p>

                  I agree, true to the fact, let's say if your pictures you take is in a mediocre level, then you might as well not post the entire photos in the forum, post only those pictures you think that it's perfected or up to standard. This reduces the number of comments about your photos from other fellow bus fans in such a level. Me too, I don't really take much photos (like maximum of 5-6) because I have some other commitments to take care of &amp; I don't take pictures simply because I just want to kill time unless I had a specific free time to do so.

              <p>Try not to post alot of bus pics at one time..Remember, there are some users with slow connections (like me, running on 1mbps line). It will take sometime for it to load. What I suggested last time was, maybe put 3 bus photos, that you think is nice and want to show to other bus fans. But the remaining photos, can post it as a link.</p>

              <p>much agreed... this is not an online photo store of all your photos. a few good photos would speak better than having the most number of ordinary-looking photos, or even multiple shots of the same bus over a few frames which is unneccessary.</p>

              <p>you recommend, but there isn't a set rule. and i've asked twice in the past wether if 10 pictures are ok but no response.</p>
              <p>and really, there should be some rules now if you put it this way - 10 seems fine to me given it's over 2 post. Either way the pictures' resolution is quite low already.</p>
              <p>And if you're using an outdated browser, please update to the latest one.</p>

                      <p>you recommend, but there isn't a set rule. and i've asked twice
                      in the past wether if 10 pictures are ok but no response.</p>
                      <p>and really, there should be some rules now if you put it this
                      way - 10 seems fine to me given it's over 2 post. Either way the
                      pictures' resolution is quite low already.</p>
                      <p>And if you're using an outdated browser, please update to the
                      latest one.</p>

              This is to those ppl who have slow internet connection speed especially using wireless connection, not only outdated browser itself. Although there's no set rules about it, another recommendation that I can think of is that example if you have 10 pix to post, you may also break up the post (meaning that ur 1st post, u post 5 pix, then ur 2nd &amp; subsequent, then u post another 5 and so on)

              <p>Anyhow post?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> watch your words.....</p>
              <p> Then if that's the case why not ask every single website to be as "light" as possible just post the links to the pictures and have all words? And also,  a picture linked here can speak a thousand words over a link that says a rego and svc no.</p>
              <p>let me clarify</p>
              <p>Websites like youtube you also need to wait for the video to load on a slow connection, facebook's games have options to turn low/high quality for slow/fast connections or a friend's mostly pictures blog to load.</p>
              <p>So what im saying here is, data content has evolved in size.....so if that's the case, i believe you can also tell the other heavy content sites such as channelnewsasia not to have interactive contents on their website.</p>
              <p>I've <strong>asked twice</strong> <strong>before posting my format of 5picsX2post</strong> in the past if i post 10 pics is ok or not since i don't contribute daily, The tribe had spoken, no objections filed, i presumed it was ok to post 10 pics and no feedback to me were given at all! you tell me <strong>"Doesnt mean no objections can post anyhow right?"</strong> there were no objections or opinions until today and you use that to flame me too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif">.</p>

This reduces the number of comments about your photos from other fellow bus fans in such a level. Me too, <span style="color: #00ff00;">I don't really take much photos (like maximum of 5-6) because I have some other commitments to take care of &amp; I don't take pictures simply because I just want to kill time unless I had a specific free time to do so.</span></p>

              <p>It's sad to come to a point where taking photos in quantity = kill time and lack of commitment towards other stuff.</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong in both...it's only wrong to people who somehow convinced themselves that their pictures are somehow superior as well as their time management.</p>
              <p>No offense....all the highlighted portions in your posts are quoted with reference to other posts as well.</p>
              <p>I'm using 3MBPS line and I'm already finding it a pain in the neck loading the pictures. No need to talk about those using 1MBPS.</p>
              <p>Nor was the call for fewer pictures the first time, for this is the 2nd time I'm mentioning that this has been mentioned countless times.</p>

              <p><br><strong>1) Who are we to judge what's "mediocre" or not, for the matter</strong>?</p>
              <p><strong>2) Is there such thing as a "fixed" standard for pictures?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3) It's sad to come to a point where taking photos in quantity = kill time and lack of commitment towards other stuff.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>4) There's nothing wrong in both...it's only wrong to people who somehow convinced themselves that their pictures are somehow superior as well as their time management.</strong></p>
              <p>No offense....all the highlighted portions in your posts are quoted with reference to other posts as well.</p>
              <p><strong>5) I'm using 3MBPS line and I'm already finding it a pain in the neck loading the pictures. No need to talk about those using 1MBPS.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>6)Nor was the call for fewer pictures the first time, for this is the 2nd time I'm mentioning that this has been mentioned countless times</strong>.</p>

              <p>1)Photographers's opinions</p>
              <p>2) Presentable, comprehendible (not distorted, colours can make sense)</p>
              <p>3) It's probably your imagination.</p>
              <p>4) Your imagination too</p>
              <p>5) Not really. I use 3MBPS too and it loads quite fast.</p>
              <p>6) i asked and got no responses. this is the third time. And if there was a problem, why nobody bothered to raise the alarm sooner? i'm quite puzzled..</p>
              <p>And imo, posting 10 pics is no prob. It's not like im flooding this page either. neither are the rest who post pics.</p>
