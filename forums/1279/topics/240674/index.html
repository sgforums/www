Any comments?[/b]</blockquote>Well, it's part &amp; parcel for large companies to have black sheeps. In this case, it's a 2 way communication which failed. Mainly on the BC's mishandling on this matter &amp; also the person who made the allegations seemed to have poor personal character too.<br><br>Also this is merely a one sided story. The actual situation may have been very different from what this person wrote.<br><br>While in the working world, I received many types of feedbacks. Some based on malice twisting facts some based on hard cold facts extracted directly from the situation. Anyone who's going to make a complain must understand that he is pointing a finger. If he has to take it personal and not at the problem, likelihood that person has a lot to be corrected &amp; the case he has may not be as what he has portrayed it.<br><br>Eg. I illustrate the type of complains that can be made by the public.<br><br>Someone took a bus and found that the air con is not working. Makes the following complain.<br><br>(1) I took SBSxxxx on XX/XX/2006 and found that the air con was not working. The BC explained that he will send the bus to workshop immediately after my trip after I complained to him. Please kindly make the necessary investigations &amp; refund my air con fare. Thanks.<br><br>(2) I took SBSxxxx on XX/XX/2006 and found that the bus was hot like an oven, I paid an air con fare but was given a non air con bus! Is this the way SBS treat the passengers? Your recent fare hike have not been proportional to your service standards. I told the BC that the air con was not working but he ignored my pleas and continued driving the bus! Do SBS employ drivers with no basic sense of courtesy &amp; common sense? If this is the case, I am going to inform the MP and the government why is this kind of service standards allowed in Singapore! blah blah blah... ... ...<br><br>Well don't be surprised that I do see type (2) complains.<br>So how do you think you feel? Anyway the direction given is very clear that BC no matter what cannot scold customers. But that doesn't mean the customer can abuse them. It is a 2 way respect for customer service matters. Do not forget that today the BC may providing the customer a service by ferrying the customer around. Tomorrow that customer may be giving the BC a service at the restaurant or shopping arcade. Talk about customer service? It's a matter of dual carriage way respect.<br><br>Let us learn to respect each other and make feedbacks based on facts and not assumptions. Also never ever lie when making negative feedbacks. Because what goes around do comes around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am annoyed by the bus network in CCK town centre . Count the number of truck services at the town centre and you will know. It is 8! Hard to get around by bus. Even town like Sengkang and Pasir Ris have their number of truck doubled of that. Even punggol has the same number of trunk as that of CCK currently despite it is a very new town. Take a look at town around CCK like Boon Lay, Jurong East, Woodlands, Bt Panjang &amp; Clementi. These places have direct link to Bt Merah, Jurong East/West Ave 1 &amp; Jurong East town centre. It must be CCK that does not have such a direct link. If 172 is not amended to the CCK interchange, CCK will again be the only 1 that has no direct bus link to Boon Lay. Even Hillview that is near CCK does not have a direct bus link. In fact a town that is further away like Jurong East, Clementi &amp; Woodlands have such a link. Another example will be the old Woodlands interchange. Again CCK does not have it.<br><br>In another case about the lack of services in Yew Tee. The bus services there can only bring you within its own town and not elsewhere. There is no direct link to CCK West. The link to Teck Whye is beating around the bush. Town like Tampines and Pasir Ris has pretty good link within its own town. From what I can see is the inaccessibility of the road over there  &amp; Sungei Kadut is above Yew Tee which is an industrial area. CCK Dr is not extended to Sungei Kadut. North 7 is not extended to Woodlands Rd. CCK Link is a narrow road which the vehicles cannot turn right to the other side or turn into from Woodlands Rd from the other side. The only links are from CCK Way &amp; KJE which is below. If a bus service were to go into Yew Tee from Woodlands Rd or KJE, it will have to make a big round. There is a shortcut at Sungei Kadut Ave for turning left into Woodlands Rd but this is only 1 directional. For the other direction, It must proceed further on Woodlands Rd to turn into Sungei Kadut Ave as the shortcut cannot be used. So pass-by services are hard to go into Yew Tee. To let Yew Tee more accessible by bus, a bus terminate should be set up there to let the buses operate from there. From there the bus can go to other parts of S'pore or within its own town.<br><br>SMRT will just be uninterested if I were to write to them. Is SMRT the cause as they had not improved the bus network in CCK for several years except for that crap 985W?</div>

To them MRT are important not for buses. Haizz , So you must understand that. Also , for that 985W , its just another crap just to cover the small part of Bukit Batok West.</div>

It is just not fair for us people staying there if that is a case. It is obvious that if SMRT launch new service, it will eat into its own MRT business and they will have to pay certain amt of $ to PTC or whatsoever and in term using more resources and thus generating lesser profit. On the other hand, SBS Transit can launch new services to eat into the SMRT business of their train of which their buses are in their SBS Transit territory. So the bus network are generally better under SBS Transit territory because majority of the MRT line are under SMRT control.</div>

These places have direct link to Bt Merah, Jurong East/West Ave 1 &amp; Jurong East town centre. It must be CCK that does not have such a direct link. If 172 is not amended to the CCK interchange, CCK will again be the only 1 that has no direct bus link to Boon Lay. Even Hillview that is near CCK does not have a direct bus link. In fact a town that is further away like Jurong East, Clementi &amp; Woodlands have such a link. Another example will be the old Woodlands interchange. Again CCK does not have it.<br><br>In another case about the lack of services in Yew Tee. The bus services there can only bring you within its own town and not elsewhere. There is no direct link to CCK West. The link to Teck Whye is beating around the bush. Town like Tampines and Pasir Ris has pretty good link within its own town. From what I can see is the inaccessibility of the road over there  &amp; Sungei Kadut is above Yew Tee which is an industrial area. CCK Dr is not extended to Sungei Kadut. North 7 is not extended to Woodlands Rd. CCK Link is a narrow road which the vehicles cannot turn right to the other side or turn into from Woodlands Rd from the other side. The only links are from CCK Way &amp; KJE which is below. If a bus service were to go into Yew Tee from Woodlands Rd or KJE, it will have to make a big round. There is a shortcut at Sungei Kadut Ave for turning left into Woodlands Rd but this is only 1 directional. For the other direction, It must proceed further on Woodlands Rd to turn into Sungei Kadut Ave as the shortcut cannot be used. So pass-by services are hard to go into Yew Tee. To let Yew Tee more accessible by bus, a bus terminate should be set up there to let the buses operate from there. From there the bus can go to other parts of S'pore or within its own town.<br><br>SMRT will just be uninterested if I were to write to them.

I wouldn't just say it's the bus companies, basically it's Singaporeans who are very fussy (including myself) and particular . Aircon spoil make noise, bus leaking make more noise , they can feedback these to the company instead of lashing their anger at the poor drivers.<br><br>In my l 2007 bus company scenario for SBST,  the likes of scania n113, mark IIs and mercedes O405 should be long gone and replaced by new WAB buses. Mark IIIs at this time should be in it's last years of service before making way for newer buses.  , 2007 scenario for SMRT buses : SBST or  any other competent foreign bus companines (if allowed) taking over SMRT's fleet and replaced most of the lousy buses with updated WAB buses as well. More connections between the North west and East area.<br><br>But as you can see ,mid 2006 is just the start of WAB buses and that is lagging for Singapore bus transport comparing with Hong Kong and even Malaysia. So whoever calls Singapore's current bus transport World Class can shut up.<br><br>Conclusion : Singapore bus transport whether it's in terms of service or buses, it's far far from perfect. I am immuned to whatever rubbish I am hearing from any of the two bus companines. Just "bo chup" and enjoy whatever you like.</div>
