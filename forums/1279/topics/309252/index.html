              <p>Remembered when the Malaysian Lances were new to the SMRT fleet, that was when it was using the plastic blue front destos. They made 1st appearances on Jalan Kayu services 59 and 163 (TIB907S-TIB918K). Subsequently services 103, 169, 825, 853 and 854 also got the Lances with plastic blue destos. Services 855 and 980 also got the Lances after some Lances got its front EDS screen and also the fact that Jalan Kayu and Sengkang services came under SBS.</p>
              <p>2nd batch of UK Lances came in during 2000, they were 1st on service 980 (TIB1002X-TIB1004R). More UK Lances went into service 852.</p>

              <p><br>Tibs service 182 in the past used the Hispano DAFs which was from services 950, 951 and 952. Some WA DAFs like were also on service 182 when new. Service 182 was withdrawn in 1996 during the WL MRT route rationalisation.</p>
              <p>Those new buses that were new to AMDEP were actually Scania Striders. They came in about the same time together with the WA DAFs in late 1995 and the buses were quite similar in terms of interior design.</p>
              <p>Scanias were mainly on services 59, 103, 163, 169, 851, 854. DAFs were mainly on services 182 and 852. Service 160 (renumbered 980) also had perm Scanias and DAF fleets too, making the fleet rather interesting <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br> Tibs service 182 in the past used the Hispano DAFs which was from
              services 950, 951 and 952. Some WA DAFs like were also on service
              182 when new. Service 182 was withdrawn in 1996 during the WL MRT

              <p>Those new buses that were new to AMDEP were actually Scania
              Striders. They came in about the same time together with the WA
              DAFs in late 1995 and the buses were quite similar in terms of
              interior design.</p>
              <p>Scanias were mainly on services 59, 103, 163, 169, 851, 854.

              980) also had perm Scanias and DAF fleets too, making the fleet

              <p>Remembered when the Malaysian Lances were new to the SMRT fleet,
              that was when it was using the plastic blue front destos. They made
              1st appearances on Jalan Kayu services 59 and 163
              (TIB907S-TIB918K). Subsequently services 103, 169, 825, 853 and 854
              also got the Lances with plastic blue destos. Services 855
              and 980 also got the Lances after some Lances got its front
              EDS screen and also the fact that Jalan Kayu and Sengkang services
              came under SBS.</p>
              <p>2nd batch of UK Lances came in during 2000, they were 1st on
              service 980 (TIB1002X-TIB1004R). More UK Lances went into service
              852.</p>

              <p>after reading TIb1018's replies the scanias on 855 are due to the fact that 59 163 160 182 etc no longer were around under TIBS 9withdrawn or handed over to SBS) . hence the striders new new to AMKDEp were left around to do cameos before being dumped to woodlands services. Ie under then KJDEp circa 1996. (or if there was a woodlands depot in 1996...)</p>
