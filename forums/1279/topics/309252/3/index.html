              <p>ok thanks 1018</p>
              <p>i have a better pix of the DAF alexanders.</p>
              <p>they were never new new in AMKDEp. instead because WLDEp was not around then,,,there is this KJDEp, and this KJDEp operated many "AMKDEP" of today services like 160, 182 and 955 ( 4 slots). . thus confusion arose for me.</p>
              <p>as pointed out, even 178 was under kjdep. the dafs never left kjdep at all. till today they are still in ther</p>
              <p>ok thanks 1018 + vivienlee</p>
              <p>i too have a better outlook at the scania L113CRLs. they were new to amkdep and operated on many amkdep services like 171 854 103 59 163 and even bus 82. 75 was also under amkdep then.</p>
              <p>the fact that 75 was under ammkdep n used scanias caused much confusion when i was compiling the list. haha</p>
              <p>eventually in 1998 to 1999 as the lances start to come in from being shifted from services 103 59 and 163 who were returned to sbs. the scanias were free to do cameos all over the place. filling up 171s with so many scania regos. lol</p>
              <p>after about 1 or 2 years of cameoing within AMKDEP services, woodlands depot finally opened n the scanias were shiifted over there in many phases.</p>

              <p><br>Service 75 was never under AMDEP before, it was all the while under KJDEP in the early days. Those days service 75 had DAFs and Hinos only. Service 75 started to have OAC/NAC Scanias after it came full WLDEP in June 2000. However heard that service 75 is going back to KJDEP again soon.</p>
              <p>If I am not mistaken, AMDEP transferred its Scanias progressively to WLDEP according to its regos. Some of its earlier batch of Scanias (eg. 56x -57x series) had been with WLDEP since day 1. At the same time AMDEP received its new Malaysian Dennis Lance buses. There was also a time when NAC Scania Elbos remained in AMDEP whereas all the NAC old Nissan U31 SCNs were transferred to WLDEP, after which AMDEP transferred all its NAC Scania buses to WLDEP in return of the NAC Nissans.</p>
              <p>TIB664S-TIB674M were the last batch to get transferred to WLDEP, only after UK Dennis Lances came in to take over in Apr 2000. Happened that service 75 came under WLDEP in June 2000, those last batch of Scanias that came in from AMDEP were deployed on service 75 perms.</p>
              <p>TIB665P all the while had been serving on service 160/980 since day 1 in AMDEP. Went to perm service 167 in July 2000 after it got transferred to WLDEP. Became a service 980 permer again, when service 167 and 980 came under partial AMDEP/WLDEP in Jan 2001 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>TIB939A did service 169 after TIB927J was taken out for dunno some reasons. TIB931X caught fire and was deregistered <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif">.</p>
