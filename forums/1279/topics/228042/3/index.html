Looking at that bus we can see how much things have changed over the years. From NAC DDs, we now have AC DDs and the latest ones are wheelchair accessible too. From hand painted ads, now we have more realistic looking sticker ads and even 3-D ads.<br><br>It is a regulation, I can't remember from which governing body, which disallowed the putting of ads on the front.
