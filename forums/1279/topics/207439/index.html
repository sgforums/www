            <div class='col-md body'>I guess what the BC did was rather right except he shouldn't break very hard as other passengers would be affected to it. However, it was rather irresponsible of the BC to dump him at turf city there as that mentally ill indian man may bring trouble to other BCs or commuters. He should have called for help from police or IMH before forcing him to leave<br>But he was only fair to the people who paid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I happen to be on board the service , which is on 174. I saw thementally ill man boarded the bus, talking to himself, which then, he started to speak very loudly to the BC and passengers. If i did'nt hear wrongly, i heard the BC telling the man to "Shut Up" . Then the man went to his seat and started talking to himself. Then all almost went well till suddenly BC braked. got out of his seat, and told the man to "Get off NOW!".<br><br>I was shocked by how the BC had reacted to the man, and i believe other commuters are also shocked.Is there no other way for the BC to handle this matter in a more professional way?

I saw thementally ill man boarded the bus, talking to himself, which then, he started to speak very loudly to the BC and passengers. If i did'nt hear wrongly, i heard the BC telling the man to "Shut Up" . Then the man went to his seat and started talking to himself. Then all almost went well till suddenly BC braked. got out of his seat, and told the man to "Get off NOW!".<br><br>I was shocked by how the BC had reacted to the man, and i believe other commuters are also shocked.Is there no other way for the BC to handle this matter in a more professional way? Instead of shouting at the man in front of all the fellow commuters? My view towards SBS is now to an average of 67% after this (down from 84%).</div></blockquote>This way of handling should be the best to a mad man.</div>

The best way is to let himbe, unless he threatens the passengers, as in my MRT incident...</div>
