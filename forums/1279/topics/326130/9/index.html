              <p>AFT555 u mean? n u r seating at e rear? That bus uses DD-style A/C.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i worked for Grasslang bef. Boss wants e bus to be clean all e time. Note that since last year, they have been refurbishing their 27-seaters with new seats n livery. however didnt like their top speed to be capped at 110kph. 120kph (max for all buses) is my preferred option.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i took bef MAN 24.400 (great acceleration in just short while), 18.310, B7R, UD JA450S (my fav),</p>
              <p>n e Scania SriMaju 380 Hi-deck.</p>
              <p>i took that hi-decker, AFV3998 on 20/3/07 from Ipoh at 10pm. e interior seats r yellow, n e nylon covering is exactly e same as e B9TLs. was at 120kph n i couldn't hear much from e engine. it more than compensated e 20min delay bef e start.</p>

              <p>True. And just to add on, Five Stars don't usually deploy the
              MAN triaxles to KL. So does the Bee Hing Scania high-decker. KL is
              usually served by the Scania and Nissan Diesel Mitotechs.</p>
              <p>Likewise, Sri Maju does not have any high-decker coaches to KL.
              The only other destination is Ipoh.</p>

              <p>For trips to Genting, do note that the first alighting point is
                  in front of Highland Centre and final stop at First World bus
                  terminal.</p>
              <p>Besides the popular Yong Peng stopover, I think the upcoming
                  popular stopover is at Restoran Kim Guan in Air Hitam (refer to my
                  earlier posts).</p>
              <p>I asked Transtar when booking for my trip to Genting recently
                  and the lady who attended to me said that usually hi-deckers are
                  deployed for Genting trips that starts off in the morning. My
                  return trip was Transtar premium single-deck. the seats looks grand
                  and good but unfortunately not as comfortable as the typical sofa
                  type. and the air-con filter was so noisy throughout the journey.
                  even our public buses are not as noisy.</p>
              <p>I ever tried an old Konsortium bus to Penang beginning of this
                  year and was comfortable.</p>
              <p>So far, I still feel that Grassland buses are generally more
                  comfortable and the buses are relatively new.</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I do know that Transtar actually converted a First Class bus to a Premium bus. Think it is AFC3333. I am not sure how the premium buses are as I always stick to First class when travelling on Transtar. I usually end up on the Single Deck MB (Mtrans), and agree that the aircon filter can be quite noisy, but the aircon is always freezing cold.</p>
              <p>I once tried Five Star tours, and got onto a rickety old single deck Scania. The interior had shell flat seats but it was worn out, at least 4 PTV were not working, and two seats cannot recline. The emergency exit was letting hot air in, and the driver like left his underwear next to the door of the bus. When the bus was climbing steep parts of the highway, the air con had to be switched off. We were like overtaken by all the other buses. Lastly, there was a lot of "illegal" stops. Oh, and the driver knocked into a road sign at a rest stop. That's why I'll never go with 5 stars again. The only plus is that the seats were soft and comfortable.</p>
              <p>I avoided Konsortium as there was a period of time they were suffering from a lot of crashes.</p>
              <p>Generally, I only go for transtar first class, because I don't know of other companies which do SIN-KL non stop. Also, no other companies offer 2 seats abreast on the bus, and transtar first class programmes on PTV are really good. But I'll be happy to try Grassland next time, since it has much positive reviews.</p>

              <p>i worked for Grasslang bef. Boss wants e bus to be clean all e
                  time. Note that since last year, they have been refurbishing their
                  27-seaters with new seats n livery. however didnt like their
                  top speed to be capped at 110kph. 120kph (max for all buses) is my
                  preferred option.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i took bef MAN 24.400 (great acceleration in just short while),

              <p>I do know that Transtar actually converted a First Class bus to
              a Premium bus. Think it is AFC3333. I am not sure how the premium
              buses are as I always stick to First class when travelling on
              Transtar. I usually end up on the Single Deck MB (Mtrans), and
              agree that the aircon filter can be quite noisy, but the aircon is
              always freezing cold.</p>
              <p>I once tried Five Star tours, and got onto a rickety old single
              deck Scania. The interior had shell flat seats but it was worn out,
              at least 4 PTV were not working, and two seats cannot recline. The
              emergency exit was letting hot air in, and the driver like left his
              underwear next to the door of the bus. When the bus was climbing
              steep parts of the highway, the air con had to be switched off. We
              were like overtaken by all the other buses. Lastly, there was a lot
              of "illegal" stops. Oh, and the driver knocked into a road sign at
              a rest stop. That's why I'll never go with 5 stars again. The only
              plus is that the seats were soft and comfortable.</p>
              <p>I avoided Konsortium as there was a period of time they were
              suffering from a lot of crashes.</p>
              <p>Generally, I only go for transtar first class, because I don't
              know of other companies which do SIN-KL non stop. Also, no other
              companies offer 2 seats abreast on the bus, and transtar first
              class programmes on PTV are really good. But I'll be happy to try
              Grassland next time, since it has much positive reviews.</p>

              <p>You want to catch all of SriMaju's fleet? Quite impossible,
              because I think Sri Maju's fleet is really big, the Ipoh bus park
              alone is super big. Anyway, does Sri Maju High deck go to KL?</p>

              <p>Sri Maju's high-deckers only serves Genting and Ipoh from Singapore.</p>
