              <p>Today pics are taken at Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen has adopt a new system call "Three Layer Public transport"</p>
              <p>First layer is Branch layer, usually start with letter B, service passenger within a small district.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/DSC01861.jpg" alt=""><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1290439.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
              <p>The second layer is Main Line, usually run on main street. ( Actually i don't know how to classify as main line as most bus route in Shenzhen are run on main street........ )</p>
              <p><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1290419.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1290426.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1290431.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1290448.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1290455.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"><img src="http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa98/busdiscuss/P1280744.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The last one is Express Route, most express route start with letter E, but there are still some express route use regular number like 365....</p>

              <p>Much like RapidKL's bus system.</p>
              <p>Tempatan (Local) services serves the local district/township/neighbourhood or from these areas to the Bus Hubs/LRT stations. From the Bus Hubs, passengers may hop on the Utama (Mainline) services to the city centre. Ekspres (Express) services serves the outer towns with a direct connection to the city centre. </p>
              <p>And needless to say, the Tempatan services starts with T, Utama services with a U and Ekspress with an E.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Before we get on with pics of more taiwan Buses, i feel it is more apppropriate to lay out the background of TAIPEI buses.  For buses operating elsewhere in tiawan, there was not much research done. apologies.</p>
              <p><strong>TAIPEI BUS SYSTEM AND OPERATIONS (THE 15 BUS COMPANIES)</strong><br>Taipei's was once operated by a mess of bus operators. They sued different prices and fares and tickets on bus services by Company X cannot be used on Company Y.<br><br>They reformed early. In the late 1970s commitee meetings were held and it was agreed to standardise bus operations among bus operators. A single ticket system and fare system shall be used. 9we'll come to that)</p>
              <p>In terms of revenue distribution, its like Singapore. the revenue is channelled to one regulation body after which the money is dsitributed among the 15 companies "enough to meet thier operational needs".</p>
              <p>At present, 15 bus companies operate around Taipei city and the surrounding areas which we refer to as Taipei Prefecture. (we = me)</p>
              <p>Below is a list of the 15 bus companies</p>
              <p>Some of them are in a joint consortium - which i call the blue and red eagle consortium (named after the nice livery)_</p>
              <p>below are the bus companies and some that stand out to me are further explained</p>

              <p>I will admit it is confusing and i always never know which bus company the bus belongs to but that will not trouble us. What we strive for is to review the taiwan bus models and have a sense as to what u will see should u go toruing in taiwan (now that is fun!)  and their quirky interesting operational ideas and some analysis.</p>

              <p><strong>TAIPEI BUS FARES</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Payment system</strong><br><br>AA background check on these showed they sued conductor style punch cards till 1994. at which point OMO (in Singapore terms) was finally started to use.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in 1998, stored value cards were then used to pay for bus fares. However the failure and inaccurarcy rate of this system using very pirmitive RFID technology was very high. Still they tahan using the system until came 2002</p>
              <p>In 2002, rhe Smartcard technology too arrived in taiwan. They called their smartcard the <strong>Easy Card</strong> . the card like Singapore's one interfaces with card readers on baord bus and MRT. One wonders if the name is a copy of our EZ-Link, but anyhow we digressed</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Fares</strong><br>Based on the fact that there were many toll areas along major highways or roads, the fare system used is if you pass one toll area, one pay <strong>one section</strong> fare. Pass two toll booths, <strong>two sections</strong> fare.  Maximum is 3 sections. In main bus fare jargon essentially what they have adopted is a <strong>Zonal fare system</strong> where if you cross zones.</p>
              <p><strong>Transfer concessions</strong><br>Of coruse natrually there are transfer concessions when using the easy Card. But these are in the form of capped fares. With Adults paying $8 cap for the whole leg of the journy. and Child with $6 cap. the PIW enjoy a nice $4 cap on fares when trasnfers are made.</p>
              <p>Note that our system is rebate where fare is deducted, and theirs is cap.<br><br>ZYX</p>

              <p><strong>Bus service numbers</strong></p>
              <p>oohh man now this is a mess.</p>
              <p>Now the fact of the matter is, almost all countires in the wolrd name their bus route numbers bby service type and by district type. Like many of the 47x services on korea serve District X or terminate at Int X. not so for TaiPei buses and around the prefecture (ah hem county)</p>
              <p>The fact is, taiwan buses are anmed after <strong>how many sections they cross</strong> (and thus what kind of fare they charge). there is mention of a lianYiang bus system which was reform . I am guessing this is some old bus system which was in use. Under this system the above was adopted.</p>
              <p>So Simply<br><strong>2 digit routes</strong></p>
              <p>0 north 0 east 0 west... etc. these ran to taipei Main Station. Much later as the MRT was introduced in the early 90s, bus routes tagged to the MRT line colours. All such routes are 1 section routes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the more modern bus routes are named after MRT colour line and a digit to signify svc no. Eg if the route is a one section along the Muzhu line (brown line) and its the 9th service to be introduced. its called Brown 9.</p>
              <p>And no the EDS do not show brown colour. lol. some funny svc routes like 12 or 14 or 33 are simply feeder routes goign in one section only.</p>
              <p>Now this is similiar to Tokyo buses (and u shd know that taipei has many influences from japan)</p>
              <p><strong>3 digits routes</strong></p>
              <p>Most taiwan buses have 3 digit routes.</p>
              <p>ORIGINAL SET<br>1xx - reacreational bus routes. like our Parks services. these are naturally one section routes for general one section rotues, refer to 2 digit routes.</p>
              <p><strong>2xx </strong>- crosses two sections (many run into heart of town)<br>Eg: 220 is a premier svc route using latest buses ever since 1996. 220 once used a renault Agora SLF demonstrator. today 220 has WAB buses.<br><strong>3xx -</strong> crosses three sections</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AIR-CON BUS</p>
              <p>Oh wow. then came the air-con bus. as they sued different fares (uh we taking before the fare reforms), they had to distinguished out.<br> So <br><strong>5xx</strong> - one section air-con bus route<br><strong>6xx</strong> - two section air-con bujus route (amny run into heart of town)<br>Eg: 604 runs to ban Chiao (WoodBridge)<br><strong>7xx</strong> - this one is interesting. a basic reform of services after the LiangYang system was resovled. serveal services of 5xx and 6xx were reformed to two sectional routes.<br>It is interesting to note that there were no three sectional air-con bus service nos then.<br>Eg: svc 705 runs to a HSR station and runs across two sections. but it seems that 705 is a rather new service introduced for the HSR feeder services.</p>
              <p><strong>8xx</strong> - these are bus routes not going in city but in the outskirts and suburbs. They are the taiwan County routes. managed by county transportation department<br>Eg: Svc 836 which runs in Damshuia nd svc 827 which runs to JiuFen</p>
              <p><strong>9xx</strong>  these are EXPRESS bus routes<br>Eg svc 902. 902 is now a full WAB service.</p>
              <p><strong>MAIN LINE or TRUNK LINE</strong><br>a simple copy of China bus routes. anmed after the main roads they serve for exmaple XinYi trunk line serves from some sections to XinYi rd then to other sections.</p>
              <p>As the MRT system was developed and train lines run paraell to certain roads bus routes were later renamed to be MRT feeders (See two digit nos)  Eg: nanjing trunk line was renamed <strong>red 25</strong> as it now serves to the MRT red line.</p>
              <p><strong>Small buses</strong><br>Some regons only require small midi bus shuttle bus. these were called the S routes. eg S1<br></p>

              <p><strong>Buses </strong><br><br>Most of the buses that are around are built after 2000. it seems the oldest bus running on the road is of 1998 make suggesting that their buses expire and get scrap after only 10 years of use.</p>
              <p>Now the pros of this is that the buses do not even emit any exhuast. the impression that taiwan buses are chui is sadly mistaken. the buses are well mainatained and do not have any brake squeals. however due to the current hot summer in taipei, many buses radiators howl and overwork to keep the bus cool. <br><br>The buses are evaluated for Quailty of Service. this takes place every two years by the governing body. the buses are then plastered with flowers at the front dash . the more the flower the more higher quality of service. Buses that are brand new naturally have even up to 14 flowers.</p>
              <p>Bus drivers are dorn ties and some vests. interestingly enough amny female bus drivers were spotted. All wear uniform.</p>
              <p><strong>Paying your fare?</strong></p>
              <p>usually what u do first is</p>
              <p><strong>1) LOOK OUT FOR BIKE</strong><br>Ok so there are many bikes in taipei. everyone owns a bike to travel around. and these bikes, they do cut in between the bus and you. As a safety measure, when the door pops open</p>
              <p>1) A bus reversing signal is activated to tell bikers to STOP<br>2) a cute stop sign flaps out from the door and acts as a sign to tell bikers to STOP<br><strong>2) BOARD AT REAR</strong></p>
              <p>Like the japense, because bus is flat fare, you only tap once to baord. a vvery soft low pitch beep indicates you have succesfully paid for your whaterver no of section bus ride.</p>
              <p>3) i guess when alighting you alight at the front,.</p>
              <p>now do note that boarding at front is allowed.</p>
              <p>At night as buses come to a stop, <strong>beamer lights</strong> switch on to tell bikers to be careful also.</p>
              <p>Inside the bus<br>Each bus is equipped with a <strong>TV set (if applicable) all Mobile Tv sets</strong> in taiwan are tuend to digital signals much like our TV mobile. even our tour bus ahs it. even the taxis have it.</p>
              <p>Each bus has a PIS (passenger information system) . the disdplay used is a standard miedium size LED screen. the screen is spotted to display only Chiense chratcers. <br><br><strong>Alternate short working or differnet bus services</strong></p>
              <p>Such bus services like say 260 or 262 will have different routing versions. to differentiate the Bus EDS will show in <strong>green number</strong> for such alterante route<br><br><strong>Taiwan EDS and service plates</strong><br>Most taiwan buses use EDS. However every bus has a plastic desto. Both plastic desto and EDS are used (simply defeats the purpsoe of having the EDS really ...lol). However as notcied when in bright daylight, the worst thing is u cant even see the svc no due to glass flare reflect and the worst thing is green svc number just cant be seen. ghence the need for plastic desto.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EDS formats</span></p>
              <p>Depending on bus make or bus company, front EDS will show</p>
              <p>A type) [ From Chiense service no in midle Destination Chiense]<br><strong>patch scroll</strong> - this interesting form of scrolling whereby the english words start to appear in pacthes while majority of the chiense words remain. after the scroll is midway through more of the Englsih sections appear and then finally we have</p>
              <p>[ From in Enlgish Svc no Destination : in Enlgish}<br><br>B Type [ From: Chiense big words below smaller font Enlish  - Svc no - Destination with same format as left side]<br>these kind of EDS need not scroll</p>
              <p>- Note the goign by destinations do not to be seem to be shown on front EDS. A side plastic EDS will show going by places. <strong>Soemtimes both front and side owrds are stickered onto bus windows indicating that the bus in use</strong> CANNOT DO CAMEO. This is essenatilly same as Korea style.</p>
              <p><strong>WAB Services</strong><br>WAB services are interesting, they call them <strong>Bo-Ai</strong> routes. the EDS show a heart shape with the word "new" in chiense in the middle. So Somtimes when the EEDS stays on this screen, you have no diea what the svc is.</p>
              <p>WAB services use two main bus models, the Daewoo with Scania looking front and the Chiense makes SangYang and King Loong both made out to look alike because they use the same bodywork (haiz)</p>
              <p>Wheelchair ramps are mannual oeprated. Buses are clearly indicated by a blue wheelchair logo set in the bus livery of red (for eagle consortium bus companies)</p>
              <p>and the normal blue n white Wheelchair logo pasted in middle below where the svc no wd be on EDS. (for other bus co)</p>
              <p>amny interesting smaller signs n words are pasted on the rear door which is the baording point for PIW and where the ramp is located on both model. the taiwan WAbs use the same manual fold out ramps as us.</p>

              <p><strong>Taipei Bus fleets n makes<br><br>general introduction</strong></p>
              <p>most of the buses are bodied in local bodywork. The older bodyworks will feature the ribbed sides features. Our older SBS buses were modelled after these such taiwan buses. <br><br>Bus makes are mainly Hinos, (Mianly on the eagle consortium), many Isuzu , many Mitshubsihi Fuso, older Daewoos.<br><br><strong>Newer buses</strong><br>these are mainly of japense makes and many new Daewoo and many many new isuzu LT133 series close to our LT134P cuosins on coaches in Singapore. in fsct they sound alike. <br><br><strong>Low floor bus<br></strong>Taiwan did bring in a Renault Agora low floor bus for trial on Svc 220. it was a CNG bus. bus was exported or scrap soon after</p>
              <p>They also brought in the <strong>Ikarus 412T</strong> series bus. the Ikarus is rare in Asia and in taiwan. because the buses operate on fixed schedules on weekdays, i did not manage to meet any or snap any due to the fact that i was in taipei only on weekends.</p>
              <p>These are low floor and not WAb. further proof is needed to show they are WAB.</p>
              <p><strong>WAb buses</strong><br>As mentioned Daewoo models with Scania Omnicity like fronts and the Chhiense makes.</p>
              <p>Midi bus<br>mainly jaoense makes. of interest is Hyundai Country</p>
              <p><strong>Bodyworks of citybus (All local - except Ikarus)</strong><br>most midi bus are improted from japan or Korea CBU with integral bodywork. so a Toyota Coaster like say will look like a singapore one. whereby ours is also CBU-integral imported.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless the taiwanese are also known to copy many eurpoean and others designs. of note is the Scania omnicity muted fronts, the volgren setra like fronts on some buses and the very japense like Mithsubishi fronts .</p>
              <p><strong>Coaches (All local)</strong><br>Many coaches feature european designs . even the rears some of them look like older Merc trevago, Some fronts look neoplan classic. others look like irizar. its copy copy copy.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer - i did not ride any citybus . i only managed to shoot pics.<br><br>EDS- EDS was a horror story as usual. All EDS-ed buses had to be shot at 1.60 shutter. I was very glad to be seeing a palstic desto-ed bus coming down the road. lol</p>

              <p>Their ads however do not usually advertise sundry items. few electornic ads were seen. <br>Suffice to say their bus ads are also very nice to snap at.</p>

              more apppropriate to lay out the background of TAIPEI buses. 
              For buses operating elsewhere in tiawan, there was not much
              research done. apologies.</p>

              <p>There's an interesting feature for Taipei Bus Guides - For individual route pages, they are not listed in linear form. The approximate map diagram of the route is drawn (similiar to the SMRT town/LTA CBD maps) marking the bus stop with a dot. One thing I noticed is that some route maps have branch stops, where the bus deivates from the main route.</p>
