              <p> </p>
              <p>this is macau. macau once colonised by the porteguese. So they
              drive on RHS of veh like us. is like hong Kong also colonnise by
              british. I wuun be suprise if Shanghai ppl also RHS drive.</p>
              <p>next thing i will point out is just only 2 years, macau they
              start to fit EDS on their buses. hwaaahhh.</p>
              <p>If u had been to Macau, u will know that msot of their bsues is
              the 10m 11mm or 9m type. hardly adeuqate for the locals to get ard
              on bus as very squeezy. i have mentioned in this thread ebfore 'as
              bus was packed, i cannot take interior pics"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see above pages for more macau bus taken by me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw i had taken the pic of that model of bus. till now wondering
              what model, dun think is King Loong. i guess is Huang  hai
              bus</p>

              <p>Yes, Macau was once colonised by the portuguese, but thats not a reason why the traffic in Macau drives on the left (same as sg). Portugal drives on the right, not left.</p>
              <p>The reason why Macau drives on the left is because most of their cars was imported thru Hong Kong, which drives on the left.</p>

              <p>WHAT? It's the manufacturer's fault? Where did you get that idea from?</p>
              <p>Mister. Listen up. The customer has been informed of the height of the bus. If the manufacturer has to satisfy all height clearance in Malaysia, THERE WILL BE NO DOUBLE-DECKERS. What makes you think that the manufacturer is suppose to make buses that can pass through ALL bridges?</p>
              <p>In this case, it's highly likely that the fault lies with the driver, because obviously he does not know that the bridge is too low for the bus to pass through. Unlike scheduled bus services, express buses are known not to have specific routes, especially within a town or city. Whatever route can get them to the destination faster will be at the discretion of the drivers.</p>
              <p>If I were to take your statement, I believe it's Walter Alexander's fault then that the Service 196 Atlantean crashed through the height barrier at Stadium Walk?</p>
              <p>In any case, your last sentence should reflect yourself. If you have no idea, then shut the trap. I really can't understand why you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">LOVE</span></span> to make yourself a subject of humiliation of others.</p>

              <p><br>Is apology the only words which always come from you? You made so many unnecessary errors.</p>
              <p>The bus company and the drivers bear some responsibility of the situation because they didn't check if the bus was able to pass the bridge or not. Instead they just let the bus go under the bridge. It isn't the government's fault. And since you know there's height restriction, why should you still drive the bus in?</p>
