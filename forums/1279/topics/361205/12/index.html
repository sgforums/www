              <p>if you are not impressed with the report, there's no need to voice this out. you already have a negative impression with some of the bus fans here and you are trying to make it worse. we can't stop you if you want to do that, but you are certainly disgracing the bus fan community by criticising negatively on a article which should boost the bus fan community further in the eyes of the public.</p>

              <p>i know he did. i stated that i felt that the report was ok. rather balanced. of significance to bus fans. just because i didn't say that he didn't do a wonderful job, doesn't mean that i don't know that he did a good job.</p>
              <p>the last sentence in the article may have shown some sarcasm but i would say that that sentence is rather balanced because most people in the public who has no prior knowledge to such a hobby would probably find such a hobby a waste of time and a "weird" hobby to embark on (apologies to those who feel offended by this statement) but as time goes, the significant presence of such a hobby being known to more and more people will probably change the general public's view about such a hobby so i feel that this statement is balanced.</p>

              <p>I agree with you. The article is quite balanced. Other than the word 'fanatic', I dont really see any word with a negative connotation. Derick used the word 'weird' too and I dont see any problem with that.<br><br>Anyway, I thought this is the 4th Amazing Race being organised if the one by SBST in 2007 is to be counted?</p>
