            <div class='col-md body'>CONGRATULATIONS!<br><br>Hope u like ur stay there. Basically if you want to find out more on HK buses, go this website: www.gakei.com/hkbec<br>Other than tt HK has 3 major bus operators: KMB, NWFB,Citybus<br>These 3 companies use a variety of buses &amp; they do swop buses often thru sale to each other coys. NWFB &amp; Citybus are related, i tink owned by a coy called Chow Tai Fook.<br>NWFB uses Dennis Dragons, Neoplans, Dennis Tridents, 10.3M,12M respectively.<br>Citybus fleet has VOs,Dennis Dragons10.3M,Man buses, SDs like Dennis buses on sv6,6A,6X,260,12M,25A<br>KMBs buses are the newest: TRansbus Enviro500, VOs,VSOs, Dennis Dragons... click on the above website for more...<br>Fyi, they dun have an interchange like ours, their int/terminals is by the roadside for most of their svcs. However, for major places like Admiralty Center, they have a central parking space but the parking arrangement is like a roadside terminal...<br>KMB serves mainly Kowloon side but for svcs with prefix '1','6','9' cross harbour svcs, they serve HK island side also.<br>This goes the same for Citybus, NWFB which serves mainly HK island side...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah....talk about Hkg buses, made me remember of a family trip to the island in the late 90's.<br><br>On the way to The Peak, we took an old Leyland Olympian (didn't manage to check what model) up around the mountain road, passing by bungalows, apartments at great speed that at one moment........WhooSh, down a steep road with the cool mountain wind blowing at my face!!!! Cool and totally satisfied  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Few days later, took a blue-white Leyland model (Sorry, didn't manage to check the model again) to an industrial like outskirt near Aberdeen for a visit to a factory outlet. After alighting at the bus-stop, my family went to search this place to no avail. Dissappointed, we were searching for a bus-stop when a blue white Leyland came chugging and stop right in front of us.<br><br>The doors flip opened and BOY were we astonished! It was the same bus we took minutes before!! The bus driver told us that the factory outlet has been closed due to poor sales, and apologised for not telling us......We asked him why he stop for us despite we're not standing at a proper bus-stop..<br><br>And, the answer was simple....the nearest bus stop was still far from our present location and decided to give us a lift.....and yessiree, the return bus ride came free with no charge at all!......Despite our offers to pay him....<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Wah, wrote such a long story......bet this could be the longest post I've written! These are some of my experiences I've encountered and always be remembered. Next time you go to HK, feel the experience of the bus services there! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

In addition ALL bus stops have route details nt like Singapore where only selected bs have guides! KMB buses have route announcements for their newer buses, it's in English, Chinese, Cantonese. In addition the buses have EDS in the bus to tell you the bus stop!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
