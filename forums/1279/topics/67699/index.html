            <div class='col-md body'>I had boarded a TIBS 106 and observed that the bus disallow commuters to tap their cards while the bus is on the move. That is the easylink system was set to 'No Entry' .<br><br>Because of that,  the bus captain has to ensure that all commuters had tapped their cards before he start the engine.<br><br>The experience was rather bad when the bus was packed like sardines, and commuters searching for their cards, and some commuters realised that their cards no longer valid, and had to start looking for coins. And some commuters not knowing what went wrong in their cards, continue tapping it on the machine.<br><br>I boarded a TIBS 106 from Somerset Station heading Holland V. Unfortunately it was a single cabin (not the long bendy Mercs) bus. The bus was packed when it arrived. Anyway I still boarded the bus. During the journey, I had observed that the bus captain had spent unneccessarily long time in most bustops. And the worst was while the bus had arrived at Holland V (where I alight, luckily). I alighted from the bus, crossed the road to Holland Village, buy a Sunday Times, waited at the traffic light to cross Holland Ave again, crossed the traffic light, walk along Holland Avenue to Blk 2. Zoomed.... the same TIBS 106 had just overtaken me. Imagine the bus had spent more than 10minutes at Holland V bus stop.<br><br>I can't figure out what had went wrong at that bus stop, but my guesses are:<br><br>a. the bus was sardine packed.<br>b. someone not able to tap his card. and that someone had more than a card to tap.<br>c. more than one person unable to tap his card.<br>d. bus captain refused to continue till all had settled their fare.<br>e. .....<br><br><span style="color: red;">The most obvious fault I think shall be: THE EASILINK SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DISABLED WHILE THE BUS WAS ON THE MOVE. That would allow bus captain to continue his journey while commuters trying their ways to tap on the system.</span><br></div>

Main reason: To prevent passengers from tapping their cards way ahead of their exit point a k a underpaying.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am aware of the reason for making such changes.<br><br>No one may have predicted that by implementing such change, it could have caused more inconveniences to commuters. Are there any evaluations if the enhanced change had cut down the number of cheats? If the new system does not cut down the number of cheats, won't the non-enhanced system better than enhanced system?<br><br>Moreover, if there are real cheats, the cheats may still tapped their cards while the buses stopped at bus stops.<br><br>Perhaps a more enhanced system, would  be to always have the system at exit doors nearer to the bus captains always 'ON'. At least bus captain may still drive on, while commuters still forray into their means to pay the fare.</div>
