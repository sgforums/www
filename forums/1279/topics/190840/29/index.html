            <div class='col-md body'>Many thanks guys for all the feedbacks. There are still a few more but is not ready yet.<br><br>Anyway, all these fantasy services have been introduced for 3 to 4 years time.<br>Service 71 is introduced when I was Secondary 2 that time in year 2001. Guess all of you know my age now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>I studied in Xinmin which was moved from Hougang to Fernvale for a period of time. After that, 371 is introduced to relieve the loads of 163 from Sengkang to Xinmin.<br>So, I introduced this fantasy route 71, hoping that it can provide a faster link from Fernvale to Sengkang as compared to 163 or 371. Besides, it goes to Punggol too so that means I don't have to make a transfer at the interchange.<br><br>For 74 and 147, those two services are plying the same route at Hougang which one ventures into AMK, Bukit Timah and then West while the other city then West. As some of you have mentioned, as this two service provide great and valuable links, it is from a passenger point of view beneficial for them to extend to Punggol. The extension of 74, 147 routes were almost the same last time but I have changed a little for 147 since its route is challenging and considering the numerous traffic jams that the BCs encounter and plus more roads at Sengkang and Punggol are open.<br><br>140 is a more of a supplementary service to provide a quick link from Punggol to Yio Chu Kang Rd, Serangoon North areas, Bishan areas. Besides, it provides a quicker link from Serangoon North, AMK Ave 10 areas to the city as compared to 132. This service is parallel with 132, 156 from AMK Ave 3 onwards if you have noticed.<br><br>To sum up, in my opinion, with 3 and 83 only (plus 62 on Punggol Field and 85 at Punggol Central) is insufficient. Besides, most of the bus services plying at Punggol int will have to ply wither Punggol Field or Punggol Central to get the passengers residing in Punggol. Most of them will continue to go to Sengkang as there are demand over there. So, I feel that in terms of duplication, it is rather heavy. (For example, 71, 74, 140) However, with the Circle Line coming up with Serangoon Station as the interchange, I will expect more Punggol residents to utilise the MRT either at Punggol Station or Sengkang MRT station to the Northern Central areas like Bishan or transfer to NSL to AMK or YCK. Plus the increasing use of LRT for Sengkang/Punggol residents to MRT stations as more residential housing are built.<br><br>At that time, I guess 71, 140 can be withdrawn.<br><br>Once again, thanks for your opinions.</div>

I guess you have left out some roads between Sengkang East Way and Sengkang West Ave.<br><br>So, anyway from Sengkang to Harbourfront, there is already 80. But it takes very long to reach there as compared to this service cos this service plies the lower density areas.<br><br>Besides, there is already a link from Sengkang to AMK Ave 6 (86). So, it provides a direct link from Sengkang to Marymount Rd and MacRitchie Reservoir.<br>The route looks similar with route 93 and 855 onwards except the part where it uses Kampong Bahru to get to Harbourfront.<br>It provides a direct link too to Bukit Merah from Sengkang and Marymount, residents residing in Shunfu estate.<br>From Kampong Bahru to Harbourfront, it has a lot of route duplication in that small portion which are 61, 143, 166.<br><br>In short, Direct link within these three areas, Sengkang - Marymount (Shunfu estate) - Bukit Merah and also to provide a faster link to Harbourfront from Sengkang though there is already an MRT</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm.... I'm new here, and it is great for me to come across this bus forum since I'm quite a bus enthusiast.<br><br>One of my interests is to suggest bus routes but I didn't know there is such a bus forum until today, so here are some of my suggestion. I have more, but I donÂ’t want to list them down all at 1 go cos it will be quite tiring.<br><br><strong>Service 41: Upper East Coast - Jurong East</strong><br><br>Direction 1:<br><br>Upp East Coast Term.<br>Bedok South Ave 1<br>Marine Parade Rd<br>Amber Rd<br>Haig Rd<br>Geylang Rd<br>Paya Lebar Rd<br>Pan-Island Expressway<br>Jln Toa Payoh<br>Whitley Rd<br>Bt Timah Rd<br>Upp Bt Timah Rd<br>Jln Jurong Kechil<br>Toh Tuck Rd<br>Toh Tuck Ave<br>Boon Lay Way<br>Toh Guan Rd<br>Jurong East Ctrl<br>Jurong East St 13<br>Jurong East Int<br><br>Direction 2:<br><br>Jurong East Int<br>Jurong East St 13<br>Jurong East Ctrl<br>Toh Guan Rd<br>Boon Lay Way<br>Toh Tuck Ave<br>Toh Tuck Rd<br>Jln Jurong Kechil<br>Jln Anak Bukit<br>Dunearn Rd<br>Whitley Rd<br>Jln Toa Payoh<br>Pan-Island Expressway<br>Paya Lebar Rd<br>Sims Ave<br>Geylang Serai<br>Geylang Rd<br>Haig Rd<br>Amber Rd<br>Marine Parade Rd<br>Bedok South Ave 1<br>Upp East Coast Rd<br>Upp East Coast Term.<br><br>This service will serve as a direct connection between East Coast/Marine Parade and Jurong East/Bukit Timah corridor. Since SBST has been introducing more bus services between towns these few years, so I was thinking if my above-suggested route would be feasible.<br><br><strong>Extension of service 962 from Woodlands to Boon Lay VIA NTU:</strong><br><br>Basically, my suggestion is that bus 962 will not call at Woodlands Regional Interchange and will call at opposite Woodlands Library when it is coming from Sembawang. Then the route will go as follows:<br><br>Woodlands Ave 3<br>BKE<br>KJE<br>PIE<br>Jln Bahar<br>Nanyang Ave<br>Nanyang Drive<br>Pioneer Rd North<br>Jurong West St 63<br>Boon Lay Int<br><br>The return journey will be in the opposite direction, and then it will join back the original route after calling at Woodlands Library.<br><br>This route extension would greatly benefit those living in the North, who has to travel to NTU everyday. It will provide a faster alternative for them since it plys by BKE and KJE, whereas now, they have to take MRT to Boon Lay and transfer to bus 179/179A. Also, the Jurong portion of the extended service 962 will provide more buses that ply between Boon Lay and NTU.<br></div>

Furthermore, this route will most likely take a longer time to reach HG Central from Pasir Ris as compared to 89. From HG Central to Eunos Link/Kaki Bukit Ave 1/Bedok Reservoir Rd, there's Sv 87.

Since SBST has been introducing more bus services between towns these few years, so I was thinking if my above-suggested route would be feasible.<br><br><strong>Extension of service 962 from Woodlands to Boon Lay VIA NTU:</strong><br><br>Basically, my suggestion is that bus 962 will not call at Woodlands Regional Interchange and will call at opposite Woodlands Library when it is coming from Sembawang. Then the route will go as follows:<br><br>Woodlands Ave 3<br>BKE<br>KJE<br>PIE<br>Jln Bahar<br>Nanyang Ave<br>Nanyang Drive<br>Pioneer Rd North<br>Jurong West St 63<br>Boon Lay Int<br><br>The return journey will be in the opposite direction, and then it will join back the original route after calling at Woodlands Library.<br><br>This route extension would greatly benefit those living in the North, who has to travel to NTU everyday. It will provide a faster alternative for them since it plys by BKE and KJE, whereas now, they have to take MRT to Boon Lay and transfer to bus 179/179A. Also, the Jurong portion of the extended service 962 will provide more buses that ply between Boon Lay and NTU.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Your proposed Sv 41 seems quite ok, just that there's already Sv 966 from Marine Parade Rd to Jalan Toa Payoh/Whitley Rd.<br><br>Your proposed Sv 962 is a good idea, but will it be able to utilise bendies?<br></div>

I didn't know about that when I was thinking about this route, but my proposed svc 41 and the present express svc 506 have almost entirely different routes, except the PIE and Jln Toa Payoh part. Also, svc 506 does not serve Bt Timah Rd and Marine Parade, so svc 41 will help to connect these areas.<br><br>I don't think SBST will be willing to serve CCK as it is a SMRT territory.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by patdog112:</div><div class="quote_body">for the proposed 962 NTU bus service need huge amount of buses smrt has enough of them to run this route?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> tink they need to steal 1 bus from all these service to run NTU route  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>Hmm.... I'm not too sure about the present situation of svc 179, but from the forums, I heard that bus 179 still cannot cope with the amount of passengers even at 1 min frequency. Also not too sure if SMRT has enough buses, but hopefully they can at least extend svc 962 to Boon Lay via NTU, so as to provide a direct link to those living in the north and to relief some passenger load at Boon Lay.<br><br>Haha.... I have some more route suggestions here:<br><br><strong>SMRT service 967: Woodlands to Marina Centre (Loop)</strong><br><br>Woodlands Regional Int<br>Woodlands Ave 2<br>Woodlands Ave 1<br>Woodlands Ave 12<br>SLE<br>Upp Thomson Road<br>Thomson Road<br>Balestier Rd<br>Lavender St<br>Crawford St<br>Republic Ave<br>Republic Blvd<br>Raffles Ave<br>Nicoll Highway<br>Raffles Blvd<br>Temasek Blvd<br>Temasek Ave<br>Raffles Blvd<br><br>The service would then make its return journey after Raffles Blvd.<br><br>Unlike svc 960, 967 would serve the Upper Thomson corridor, in which there is no direct bus link to Woodlands. It will also serve the Balestier area and Lavender St, then go through the Crawford Underpass towards Marina Centre.<br><br>This service can also be extended to the future Integrated Resort when that area is fully developed.<br><br><strong>Merging of SBST Services 87 &amp; 35 to become the new 87</strong><br><br>I feel that there should be a more direct link to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. This can be easily achieved by merging services 87 and 35, such that the new service will go from Sengkang to Bedok using the present 87 route and then continue to the ferry terminal using the present 35 route. It should be extended to Changi Naval Base also.</div>
