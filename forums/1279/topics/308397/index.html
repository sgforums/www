              <p>The route that Sv. 85 takes along Punggol is quite desolate, especially during at night. Mostly Punggol side is alot of forested area and usually past Sengkang then the area starts to "liven up" a bit.</p>
              <p>However it would be quite unusual to do the same thing after it exits SLE. Just imagine the bus stops at every stop along Lentor Ave... and it is very spooky at night especially if you're alone along Lentor Ave. Whats more, Yishun town is rather densely populated and at 2330++ hrs it is still rather "busy".</p>
              <p>At bus555: what's so unusual about a BC opening the doors before it stops at the bus stop? Quite a few BCs do that... and they are mostly chiongster BCs / drive very recklessly.</p>

              <p>he's just very strict abt the rules. by right eating and drinking is really not allowed on bus and train, but most commuters just heck care, and most BCs/ SLs heck care as well, and then people dirty the bus with the food they start complaining why is the bus so dirty?</p>

              <p>eating esp usually pollutes the air inside the bus and is annoying. even if a passenger retains the used food packet and throws away after alighting the bus, some food particles may fall inside the bus premises hence attracting insects and cockroaches. for drinks, any spillage onto seats and floors is not fair to passengers taking over these seats.</p>
              <p>by refraining from eating and drinking onboard the bus is a matter of civic consciousness and its a shame that such rules got to be put up instead of expecting people to be considerate in their behaviour. Others include:</p>
              <p>- no smoking, no spitting, no littering, move to the rear of the bus, give way to alighting MRT passengers, stand to left of escalator, etc etc. Why are we trying to educate adults about civic mindedness when they are expected to set a good example to the their kids and the younger generation?</p>

              <p>IDFC requirement. Sometimes the BC need to stop at every bus stop to let the IDFC be read by satallite. Some BC also reflected to me before that they felt really stupid and scary to do that but no choice. </p>
