But at Senoko, you can see that not many take buses, you go see the tons of Malaysian motorbikes there... You know the term "tong pang?, many does that actually. But sad to say, most factory workers rent flats in Singapore.<br><br>Ya la, but the frequency at Kranji during peak is 1 - 4 mins while 950 is 7 - 15 mins. Frequency still cannot match. I would rather wait at Kranji when there are more buses now.<br><br>Actually, staff at SMRT are not keen as the diffuiculity to get passengers over to WRI when there is no "safety net" of other services. When I called and later told to regret that I can't use this way, they were understandable.</div>
