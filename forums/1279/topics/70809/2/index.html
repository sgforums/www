Both are almost equally ranked for me, tridents being the fact that the last row is often too hot for comfort,as well as the very hard and straight seats...i relax on the bus, not train my posture!!!. They are low floor , zero step buses that should be the way city double decks in the future as Singapore's population grows older and the govt. try to make Singapore more handicap friendly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once again, I would like to stress the following:<br><br>1. VSOs are totally speed limited b/w 60 - 65 km/h. As a result, VSOs don't speed fast as other vehicles. The fault does not lie on Voith gearbox actually. It's just that the revving of the engine is high.<br><br>2. Tridents are pretty good, except that the seats are a little bit harder, and the staircase is a little bit more narrow.<br><br>3. VSOs do produce higher level of noise due to - 1. Buses run on diesel, that is why it's so much noisier. 2. Unlike any other conventional double deck buses, the VSOs have their radiators at the right side of the bus, which therefore cause a higher noise level.<br><br>I hope that such information, which is based on what I've known and observed, could let you guys know what's the fact behind all these factors. Also, I feel that we shouldn't complain too much about the buses used on Singapore roads. Comparing with third world countries that use very very old TATA Buses and whatsoever, we're consider quite fortunate. Also, we should not bear grudges why we couldn't get some other excellent buses from other countries. Bus companies do have financial limitations and they try to save whatever they would from budgeting. And of course, this is a much more "politically correct" way of stating how bus companies function. Hope that what I've discussed over here would enlight you guys here.</div>
