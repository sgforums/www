I remember this incident , its still fresh in my head .<br><br>I was taking Nissan Diesel bus 608 ( formerly known as CSS 8 ) . I stopped near Tao Nan School ( my primary school  ) , the driver was pissed off with other passengers and I took my own sweet time to get off the bus , the driver called me and gave me a scolding , I was so pissed off with him because he was so unreasaonable just because I took my own sweet time , and then when i got off the bus the driver closed the door and my leg almost got stuck at the sliding door , i was about 1 sec fast !! From then on , I decided to boycoot CSS buses until this year !! No kidding , I havent taken CSS buses for many years .<br><br>How about you guys ? </div></blockquote>Well, while I feel for your story, perhaps you should have taken up your complaint with CSS and not taken a somewhat immature way of boycotting an operator just for an incident that took place so long ago?<br><br>Well, my worst experience on a bus in Singapore is aboard a 170 in my most recent trip to SG, where the driver crawled along at below 30km/h.  By the time the bus even gets to 2nd gear, he'd have to stop, so progress was very slow.  Not only that, I had waited at Kranji for 25 min for a 170, and it happened to be this driver.  While aboard this bus, 5 170 buses overtook this bus.  I was so irate, that I asked the driver to drive a little bit quicker, and he said that he wanted to drive at this speed, because he enjoyed life in the slow lane (pun was intended, I think), and i asked him whether he hada timetable to keep to, and he just claimed that he could go so slowly that a whole trip can be cancelled.  The way he drove was such that he literallly took in the scenery as it went past, looking sideways and looking at young girls by the side of the road (some were school-age, which was scary), or to look at a bus that overtook him.<br><br>Windy.K. 2003.</div>

This is especially prevalent nearing the afternoon peak, which is about 4 p.m and is very hot. I think this is to avoid 'bunching' up with the bus in front, which in turn is also travelling like a snail to prevent bunching....so I think it is like this. I understand that SBST had strict instructions against bunching, especially after 2001-2002 when lots of people complained to the forum in ST about SBST. 93 also has the same problem, 165 a little better, and drivers like to drive very slowly along Lornie Rd, but drivers do tend try to beat the lights at Hougang.<br><br>However, the lousy Volvo Olympian 2-axs also have a role in it. I had not sat in more than 5 times that the bus is driving at a comfortable speed. Perhaps is due to the Voith gearbox?</div>

They should be more concern for passengers needs and instead of making more $ .  If Tibs are competiting with SBS most routes , I can say they will lose out more because afterall TIBS provides good service and cleaner buses ( seats not comfortable but that is alright ) . It's time for SBS to get the wake up call , just like Singapore Airlines . I love that airline but its a pity , the management are stubborn and success has definately get over their heads .<br><br>My 2 cents .</div>
