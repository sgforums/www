              The 66xx Citaros are there for a reason I guess? Plus if they dump
              a BSEP fleet add for Sv 53, it doesn't solve the congestion prob at
              CGA for Sv 53 every day after 7pm. Cause by that time, the BSEP bus
              would be on the expressway or reaching back Bishan

              <p>Do you know that 76 also had capacity increase recently? Now it has 11 DDs, 5 SDs. 43, 70, 76 case is unique. 76 is one of the only bus that connects through the most populous areas of AMK to Paya Lebar. The morning peak timing load on each bus is around 100 pax. You will see around 30 pax getting down at Asiawide, another 30 at Tai Seng. The bus will have just 20 pax when it reaches Paya Lebar MRT. Here, if a 43 or 135 has not called at the stop, then at least 70-75 people enter the bus just at this stop. If there is a 43 or 135 just ahead, there will be only 7-8 people boarding the 76 and so at Marine Parade you will see only 20 pax in the DD.</p>
              <p>I would have added more DDs to 70 and 76 rather than svc 43 as in the area where it plies on its own Buangkok Green to Punggol or Marine Parade to East Coast Terminal, the normal loading is only around 30-40 pax. But <span style="line-height: 1.231;">43 is a good service to provide relief to 76 from Marine Parade to Tai Seng, and 70 from Paya Lebar to YCK Road.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>I remember last year when the capacity on 43 was increased from 2 to 4 DDs, everyone said it is a waste. Later in the year, the capacity increased from 4 to 8 DDs. You never know they might add 1-2 more DDs to make 43 50% high capacity service. It is HGDEPs favourite service. </p>

              <p>Have to agree with you that the starter has kind of messed up his priorities this year. A few years ago when the CDGEs &amp; VO3xs were still together on those Chinatown services like Sv 2, 12 etc, every year during CNY period, confirm chop they will deploy DDs to Chinatown. Even full DD fleet usually during that period. </p>
              <p>But after the KUBs started to invade Sv 2 &amp; 12, the starter somehow deployed more KUBs instead during CNY this year &amp; last year. Which doesn't help with the load much cause there's only so much crush loading can do.<br><br>Yeah, Sv 43 kinda has a surplus of capacity nowadays. However, I don't rule out there's someone here, or out there in the general public, that has consistently complained to SBST abt getting more buses for Sv 43 that they got tired of his / her complaints that they just dumped more DDs once &amp; for all for Sv 43. It definitely seems so to me given how much the capacity Sv 43 increased in the past year when the demand is unstable.</p>

              <p>Alot of the services you mentioned you could do with more DDs.
              Like I said, having excess capacity wouldn't hurt in any case if
              the depots has enough SP DDs to deploy in the first place. It's
              like saving up for a future rainy day. And more importantly,
              services like 12, 21, 59, 70 etc already have more than 60% WAB in
              their fleet to satisfy the quota. So even if the starters add 1 or
              2 more non-WAB DDs, the proportion of WABs in their fleet would
              most likely still remain above the min 60% required for the quota.
              So the starters actually have alot of play with in my opinion, both
              B9TLs &amp; VO3xs / B10TLs that could be deployed from their SP
              fleet if they chose to. It's whether they choose to utilise the
              existing non-WAB SPs or put in the newer B9TLs.</p>
              <p>I think Sv 268 has some height restriction along the way though
              or something with regards to using a 3-axle DD? Same case with Sv
              359 actually. Sv 359 has a stretch of road that is too tight for a
              current 3-axle DD to turn, but Sv 359 did have 2-axle DDs last time
              many many many years back. There's a slight difference in that I
              think. So they resorted to adding BSEP for Sv 359 instead of
              upgrading to DDs (which was the case of mass DD upgrades for Sv 291
              last year)</p>

              <p>I'm not so sure about Service 268, but it might be due to AMK St 62 or AMK Ind Park 2 turning constraints. There are no turning constraints at St 63 or St 64, as Service 70 plies there, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

              <p>Hoping to see DDs on 268, the peak hour loading is crazy on this service and 2 back-to-back KUBs will be packed with 70pax. As far as the road, it doesn't seem there is any turning restriction and there is definitely no height restriction. </p>

              <p>svc 12 doesn't ply near Changi Prison, my friend. I think you
              are confusing with svc 2. svc 12 and 24 share common route from
              Tanah Merah MRT to Expo Halls only (which I had earlier referred to
              as Expo road, meaning road leading to Expo, not literally the road
              name is that. Sigh!) </p>

              <p>I suppose the direction you're talking about is towards PSR for Sv 12? It seems so from the way you describe. Anyway, the reason why Sv 12 is always packed from Tanah Merah &amp; Expo onwards is because Sv 12 has a tendency to come first before any Sv 38 bus, esp during &amp; immediately after Peak Hours. So those ppl working at Expo &amp; the Changi Business Park have to board Sv 12 to get to Simei or Tampines to switch to other services, since Sv 38 doesn't come as frequently.</p>
              <p>Those ppl will alight in bulk at the Tampines East CC bus stop at Tamp Ave 2 &amp; transfer to the other Tampines-bound svcs at that bus stop. Seen that alot of times already for years actually. After that stop, the Sv 12 bus would be considerably empty or half-empty usually.</p>

              <p>Paiseh uh, but when did Sv 109 had 5 DDs from HG all along? As far as my memory goes, the max no. of DDs it ever had as perm was the current 3. Unless you're saying that the number of DD duties 109 had was five?</p>
              <p>Sv 109 weekends BNDEP usually send out 1 DD per week, has been the case for many months alr. haha. And I believe at least one of the current HG 109 DDs is a A/P bus. They added two S-shift initially (3060H 3082U), but the 3157M they added later on AFAIK is on a A/P duty. Not sure if they converted 3082U into A/P too or not lately though. </p>

              <p>Not all of these services are under BSEP, are they? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"> I only spotted a bunch of 66xx Citaros on Sv 53 today so far..do you happen to know the timings of the new trips for Sv 53 as well? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service 15:<br></span>I spotted the entire fleet of Sv 15 today throughout AM Peak today. All the 16 existing permers are accounted for (all the perm Mk4s &amp; KUBs, no other cameos). But there's an <strong><em>additional duty</em></strong> though today, in between 8665E &amp; 8356Y, but the Citaro that was on that additional new slot is <strong>6168L (BN 518)</strong>. I didn't spot any other BSEP Citaros or that kind on Sv 15 for the entire route during AM Peak. So Sv 15 isn't under BSEP it seems?<br><br>Could it be that Sv 15 only has 1 new S-shift added with this new timetable change from today? Cause I rmb the other time you said before that Sv 15 seems to have an extra bus according to the previous timetable, but these 2 months I've observed the fleet and there's consistently 16 buses during Peak usually, including 8189M. So possibly 8189M was on outside-schedule duty? So possibly in turn means this timetable change reflects the updated timings for 8189M + 1 more new S-shift? <br><br>What are the timings anyway again for the added trips on Sv 15? Maybe the BSEP trip I missed out or something...but idk. wanna double-check with you first.</p>
              <p>On another note, the Sv 15/354 X-over is removed WEF today as well I suppose? both 2603Z &amp; the occasional x-over replacement 1942B are on Sv 15 throughout AM Peak. </p>
