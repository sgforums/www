              <p>Are these the only changes / improvements? Quite few considering the number of Citaros registered. 193/240 was not BSEP so that is SBST trip reduction. </p>

              <p>Err. I wouldn't go all the way to say that you're wrong, but both services do need more fleet adds, if not BSEP ones.</p>
              <p>Firstly, there's a reason why Sv 10 also has something called Sv 10e since years ago yeah. Sv 12 on the other hand managed that peak hour crowd daily for so many years without any shortworking trips, much less any FFw trips. </p>
              <p>Secondly, Sv 12 the number of buses in the fleet now is just about right. But the number of SDs is seriously disproportionate to the number of DDs it has considering the peak-hour demand. Many many years ago, Sv 12 only had 2 SD slots of 2721R &amp; 2723K, and now look at the number of KUBs it has (7 in total). Well it's true that when they added in the KUBs to replace some of the DD duties years ago, it was meant to be that 1 DD = 2 KUBs. So theoretically the load for Sv 12 would be spread out over more buses during the Peak Hour stretch, something like what SMRT is trying to do with its train services these days.</p>
              <p>But with the people working at Bugis &amp; along the route growing, coupled with the schooling crowd, the KUBs for Sv 12 now can barely manage the load. Plus the rapidly increasing population in PSR, Tamp &amp; Simei, it's making things worse. And that was a reason why Sv 12 quietly converted 8205A's WSD duty into a WDD duty done by 3131L last year. If the demand for DDs isn't there, what for convert a SD into a DD?<br><br>And honestly, spare capacity for DDs wouldn't hurt. If Sv 43 that kind of service with unstable loading can get that much DDs over the past year, I don't see why Sv 12 can't do with increased capacity of more DDs as well. And considering that Sv 12 is a route with a much longer runtime &amp; passes by more of the city areas, I think it's high time they added more DDs as well. If they want to keep the KUBs, then add in more buses for Sv 12, that's logical.<br><br>And don't tell me too that what Sv 12 don't need more DDs because the demand at Katong area is pathetic. People don't go to Katong just to eat laksa these days yeah. There's offices around that area &amp; many people who work at Parkway Parade that board Sv 12 instead as an alternative to getting back to the East instead of the SD-only Sv 15.</p>

              <p>Sv 60 again uh? They just added one a few months back right?<br><br>I actually hope Sv 53's one is a normal fleet add &amp; not a BSEP. The 66xx Citaros are there for a reason I guess? Plus if they dump a BSEP fleet add for Sv 53, it doesn't solve the congestion prob at CGA for Sv 53 every day after 7pm. Cause by that time, the BSEP bus would be on the expressway or reaching back Bishan alr? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>Err. I wouldn't go all the way to say that you're wrong, but
              both services do need more fleet adds, if not BSEP ones.</p>
              <p>Firstly, there's a reason why Sv 10 also has something called Sv
              10e since years ago yeah. Sv 12 on the other hand managed that peak
              hour crowd daily for so many years without any shortworking trips,
              much less any FFw trips. </p>
              <p>Secondly, Sv 12 the number of buses in the fleet now is just
              about right. But the number of SDs is seriously disproportionate to
              the number of DDs it has considering the peak-hour demand. Many
              many years ago, Sv 12 only had 2 SD slots of 2721R &amp; 2723K, and
              now look at the number of KUBs it has (7 in total). Well it's true
              that when they added in the KUBs to replace some of the DD duties
              years ago, it was meant to be that 1 DD = 2 KUBs. So theoretically
              the load for Sv 12 would be spread out over more buses during the
              Peak Hour stretch, something like what SMRT is trying to do with
              its train services these days.</p>
              <p>But with the people working at Bugis &amp; along the route
              growing, coupled with the schooling crowd, the KUBs for Sv 12 now
              can barely manage the load. Plus the rapidly increasing population
              in PSR, Tamp &amp; Simei, it's making things worse. And that was a
              reason why Sv 12 quietly converted 8205A's WSD duty into a WDD duty
              done by 3131L last year. If the demand for DDs isn't there, what
              for convert a SD into a DD?<br> <br> And honestly, spare capacity for DDs wouldn't hurt. If Sv 43 that
              kind of service with unstable loading can get that much DDs over
              the past year, I don't see why Sv 12 can't do with increased
              capacity of more DDs as well. And considering that Sv 12 is a route
              with a much longer runtime &amp; passes by more of the city areas,
              I think it's high time they added more DDs as well. If they want to
              keep the KUBs, then add in more buses for Sv 12, that's
              logical.<br> <br> And don't tell me too that what Sv 12 don't need more DDs because
              the demand at Katong area is pathetic. People don't go to Katong
              just to eat laksa these days yeah. There's offices around that area
              &amp; many people who work at Parkway Parade that board Sv 12
              instead as an alternative to getting back to the East instead of
              the SD-only Sv 15.</p>

              <p>Thanks buddy for the detailed explanation. I would be wrong to say they don't need fleet add. I totally agree that many of the KUBs need to be replaced by DDs on svc 12. With svc 10, I am surprised because during morning / evening peak there is 10E wth DDs running to and from city. Ofcourse, both 10E and 10 DDs are fully seated with 70-90 pax during peak hours.</p>
              <p>I feel services 21 (with almost 50% SD fleet need more DDs), 59 (definitely need 2-3 DDs add for this service), 62 (had capacity addition recently, but guess need 1-2 more SDs converted to DD slots), 69 (during Temasek operating days, loading is over +100), 70 (need 1-2 more SDs converted to DD slot), 74 (I won't say anything; lot has been already said), 87 (the BSEP Citaro addition should be converted into DD slot), 88 (Definitely need 1-2 more buses considering the load), 159A (much has been said about this already), 186 (need 1-2 more DDs during morning peak hours, can crossover to another service during evening peak), 268 (2 DDs would have been good to start with). What do you think? </p>

              <p>KUBs are better than the Citaros in ferrying the load. Citaro 4 seats are wasted that are in opposite direction to moving bus and ever anyone sits there. + lesser standing space. KUB can take 70 pax, Citaro after 60 pax difficult to enter. Ofcourse depends on how much people are ready to squeeze in.</p>

              <p>Alot of the services you mentioned you could do with more DDs. Like I said, having excess capacity wouldn't hurt in any case if the depots has enough SP DDs to deploy in the first place. It's like saving up for a future rainy day. And more importantly, services like 12, 21, 59, 70 etc already have more than 60% WAB in their fleet to satisfy the quota. So even if the starters add 1 or 2 more non-WAB DDs, the proportion of WABs in their fleet would most likely still remain above the min 60% required for the quota. So the starters actually have alot of play with in my opinion, both B9TLs &amp; VO3xs / B10TLs that could be deployed from their SP fleet if they chose to. It's whether they choose to utilise the existing non-WAB SPs or put in the newer B9TLs.</p>
              <p>I think Sv 268 has some height restriction along the way though or something with regards to using a 3-axle DD? Same case with Sv 359 actually. Sv 359 has a stretch of road that is too tight for a current 3-axle DD to turn, but Sv 359 did have 2-axle DDs last time many many many years back. There's a slight difference in that I think. So they resorted to adding BSEP for Sv 359 instead of upgrading to DDs (which was the case of mass DD upgrades for Sv 291 last year)</p>
