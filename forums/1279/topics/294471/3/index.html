Cars and buses are different in their ways. But the reason as in why some people cannot understand the reason for the passion in buses is because they are unable to see the beauty beneath the 'wealth and success'. Cars ownership is often associated to the individual success of a person. If the person is driving a continental car makes him more 'successful' than the rest. But buses are often associated with 'losers' in their aspect who have to squeeze in buses and unable to choose to their own personal transport.<br><br>You put it a way that you go and fetch someone in your car and go and fetch someone by taking the public bus.

They look up to buses as a general means of transport for the middle class, while they classify themselves as the "upper class". We have such classic examples right here in the forum, as in the case of the teenager not paying enough bus fare and all that cyberr1981 and his clones saga. It demonstrates the fact that people who are richer tend to look down on people who are poorer. It's more or less an accepted fact already.<br><br>But, that doesn't mean having a liking of buses means being poor. I can still be fond of buses even if I own a Mercedes, right? Wealth has no link to hobbies and passion in any sort. Wealth links to your social status, and not your passion. Even if people turn a cold eye on you, you can just take them as being idiots. People who have this kind of mindsets are often just plain childish. Reasons for such hatred / misunderstanding of buses include:<br><br>1) Seldomly take buses. They mostly drive around in their car for anything from eating out to work. As a result they do not take public transport often and think that it is for the poorer.<br><br>2) Grudge with public transport companies. Like those people who blah here and there about SBST and SMRT, "they sucks" "I think we expect more after the fare hike" "Why should we continue to suffer after paying more?" These people mainly have some sort of outrage with public transport, for which I don't know the reason. Then they take it out on the people who love buses. Strange right? It only displays their childiness even more; having a grudge on public transport just because of fare hike is already being stupid enough.<br><br>Then, what more we should do is just turn a blind eye on people who think money = everything. Remember that money cannot bring you your true passion. Even if you have $1b but you don't achieve anything there isn't any point in being a billionaire. What matters most is that you have a passion to indulge in; something for which will follow you for life.</div>
