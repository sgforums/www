            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, it's swing nose crossing (SNC), not single nose crossing, though it's also logical to call it single nose crossing..<br><br>Definition of Swing Nose Crossing: A set of points incorporating a moving blade in the Common Crossing that is moved according to the lie of the points. This eliminates the `gap' in the running rails and makes for a smoother ride and reduces wear.<br><br>This type of crossing is found almost everywhere in the MRT network.. The central 'V' shape rail can actually swing to both ends (it is movable).. So imagine the 'V' as a different colour (red?) from the main rails in ur head.. Now the 'V' rail can swing towards the straight track or the curved track so that the train will follow the direction 'V' is swung towards.. for live anmation, visit Jurong East middle platform and wait at the side towards Marina Bay.. the crossing changes every few minutes (when train jus left and before train arrives at platform) and then u see the corresponding movement of the trains when they pass through the crossing..<br><br>Common (or diamond) crossings are only found at Changi Airport Terminal Station where the trains change track to go to either platform.. it is the same as 2 SNCs placed together, meeting in the midddle and passing through each other at 90 degrees.. when the trains pass through the intersection it is particularly loud.. try noticing it the next time u go there..<br><br><img src="http://www.nsmrc.org/mr86/MR86-nickless%20cross.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Swing Nose Crossing at bottom left, Common Crossing at top right</span><br><br>A middle overrun tunnel/track is simply an additional third tunnel/track in between two tunnels/tracks connected by crossovers.. they can hold a train temporaily while it reverse or jus park there awaiting instructions.. they can be found between these stations: Yishun - Sembawang (track), Farrer Park - Little India (tunnel), Woodleigh - Potong Pasir (tunnel).<br></div>

Many students take 74 from AMK and Hougang to Whitley Sec (along Marymount Rd), Nanyang Pri, Nanyang Girls' High Sch, The Chinese High Sch, Hwa Chong JC, National JC, Raffles' Girls Pri Sch (all along Bt Timah Rd), Ngee Ann Poly, Singapore Poly, ACS(I) and ACJC. I'm sure that if it were withdrawn, many students and their parents will protest strongly against it. Try taking 74 during peak hours when school reopens next year from Hougang and the bus will be packed for most of the whole journey.</div>

I hope not!<br><br>I did submit a feedback to TIBS to sound my unhappiness in cut back to Service 106. Till now, I still can't understand why TIBS cut back Service 106 to Suntec, here were my logic:<br><br>a. The ex-route of Service 106 was the only TIBS services that provide linkage between Orchard to Serangoon via Bencoolen St.<br><br>b. With Service 111 being cut back to Suntec, why TIBS 106 needs follow suit? I paid $1.33 from Commonwealth Ave West to Tekka if I take Service 147, I paid $1.13 from the same bus stop to Tekka. Till now I still prefer to make a bus transfer along Orchard Road, each time I make my trip to Sim Lim Square.<br><br>c. Service 77 has already provided the linkage between Orchard and Suntec. Why compete with own TIBS route for passenger?<br><br>d. Suddenly, Holland Road becomes so unconnected, we have TIBS 106, 75 and 77 running about same route to Suntec.<br><br>e. I had suggested to TIBS to amend Service 106 to loop at Bencoolen, rather then terminating at Suntec. Unfoutnately, they refused.<br><br>f. If they are being forced to terminate at Suntec, they should fight against it for the sake of shareholders (not passengers), shareholders deserve higher ROI.</div>
