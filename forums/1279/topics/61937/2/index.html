(turning left from Raffles Boulevard into Temasek Ave)Wonder if the train can turn at this angle?<br></div></blockquote>from what i know, Circle Line (CCL) is supposed to serve low to middle corridors unlike other MRT lines which serve heavy corridors - it is some sort of a hybrid between MRT and LRT line. so it will not use 6-car trains but will use 3 or 4-car trains, which means it can manouevre the 90-angle turn well. in fact, it has space to "jut out" a little bit onto the land between Temasek Avenue and Benjamin Shares Bridge Rochor Rd exit since it's been reserved by LTA for future road expansions (on some roads there is a wide strip of grass or pavement between road and buildings as they've been earmarked for future road expansions by LTA and property owners have their land acquired cos of that, not jus building new MRT lines) and thus no buildings can come up there above the tunnels without permission from LTA. don't worry, they have all the engineering stuff sorted out before releasing the tunnel and stations maps to the press and public.<br><br>there is no conclusive plans for Circle Line (CCL) Phase 6 from HarbourFront to Millenia. however, from what i know, Circle Line (CCL) Phase 5 will terminate at NE1 and interchange with North-East Line. (there's speculation that NE2 is actually the interchange with CCL as the age-old rule of SMRT that interchange stations cannot be terminals as interchanges are busy stations and terminals always have track faults 'cause their crossover is used many times a day and has a high chance of failure - that's why they built an "extra" station NS27 Marina Bay to accomodate terminating trains though there's no apparent demand. but with CCL terminating and interchanging at CC1/NS24/NE6 Dhoby Ghaut, i don't know if this policy exists anymore.) beyond that it could possibly require a "full" MRT line as the future New Downtown at Marina South surely requires a heavy-corridor MRT line to meet with the traffic. so that's the dilemma LTA is having. possibly they could extend North-South Line at Marina Bay towards New Downtown and let Circle Line terminate at Marina Bay since they have spare land there for a new station.<br><br>FYI, underground MRT stations are always built under roads or reserve sites so no one else can build anything above it since the foundations may cut into MRT lines. however to maximise land use, they jus build it under the roads anyway since there will be no possibility of having to build a foundation for a new building. tunnels follow the same theory so they tend to manouerve under roads or schools or state land or government buildings, accounting for weird turnings at some tunnels, like Somerset - Orchard, Braddell - Toa Payoh, Novena - Newton, Outram Park - Tiong Bahru and Raffles Place - Tanjong Pagar.<br><br>my plans for Circle Line (CCL) Phase 4:<br><br>CC17 MacRitchie Station: more like a supplementary station for park users and transferring to other buses at the MacRitchie "interchange" bus stop. also serves the flora shops along Thomson Road and Mount Alvernia Hospital. to be built jus next to the long overhead pedestrain bridge jus under junction of Lornie Rd and Thomson Rd between the two current bus stops.<br><br>CC18 Adam Station: this is built quite a distance way from MacRitchie station and will create the longest station-to-station travel time (now is Changi Airport - Expo, Kranji - Yew Tee and Yio Chu Kang - Khatib, all 5 minutes since SMRT tries to keep it to 5 minutes even if trains have to travel very fast for Airport tunnel route). serves as second connecting station to Bukit Timah area apart from Newton station on NSL. the tunnel will follow Lornie and Adam Roads deep in the ground before leaving Adam Road as Adam Road turns south towards Adam Food Centre and the tunnel travels straight towards Coronation Plaza. to be built under the Bukit Timah canal just in front of Coronation Plaza jus after the vehicular tunnels ended, which is an engineering feat (considering how difficult it took to build Chinatown station which is under a river) but better than to build it at Adam food centre, which has 1 flyover, 1 river and 2 underground vehicular tunnels.<br><br>CC19 Farrer Road: this serves the Farrer Estate and Farrer Court residents as well as the landed property behind (how fortunate they are!). the tunnel will follow Coronation Rd, before turning towards King's Rd below the new Nanyang Primary School. to be built at junction of Empress Rd and King's Road jus behind the Farrer Court HDB-privatised apartments, 100m away from Farrer Road, since they have more land there.<br><br>CC20 Holland Village: this serves Holland Village and supplements buses plying the Holland area. here, the tunnels could cut across the landed properties of Leedon Estate, Taman Warna and Chip Bee Gardens, of course the tunnels will go as deep as possible if necessary. expected to follow the road of Taman Warna after the tunnel crossed Holland Road towards Holland VIllage and curve into Holland Avenue before stopping at a long strip of land and current carpark next to Holland Rd Shopping Centre and Block 12. there are 2 connecting bus stops there.<br><br>CC21 Buona Vista Interchange: this serves as an interchange to the East-West Line (EWL). travel time from Bishan to Buona Vista is 17 mins (2+2+6+2+3+2mins, including Bishan - Marymount) only to make the line feasible. the tunnel will cut across the HDB's Holland Vista and Holland Drive Estates since it's state land and HDB wouldn't go that low below ground for foundations. to be built on current Malaysia-Singapore railway lines to make it close to Biopolis but one end will touch North Buona Vista Road (the station will be in a SW-NE orientation so it can travel along North Buona Vista Rd after CC21).<br><br>my plans for Circle Line (CCL) Phase 5: it will not cross Biopolis or have meandering route as they will be served by another LRT line. that is, MRT(heavy) -&gt; CCL(middle) -&gt; LRT(light), and BVLRT (Buona Vista LRT) will be more meandering than CCL.<br><br>CC22 Kent Ridge: this serves National University of Singapore (NUS) and National University Hopsital (NUH). the tunnel will follow North Buona Vista Road before cutting Anglo-Chinese Junior College's stadium and HDB's Dover Vista Zone before turning left and stopping at the current carparks of NUH opposite LT29 and MD10. the carparks are slated to go, but of course, who needs them by then when u can travel from Buona Vista to NUH/NUS in 3 minutes or less.<br><br>CC23 Science Park: this serves Science Park I. the government of couse puts economic growth as important and will surely wan a convenient link to their science parks. the tunnel of course follows Kent Ridge Rd before moving parallel with Ayer Rajah Expressway before turning into Science Park Drive just after The Fleming and before DSTA (Science Park). to be built at Reuters or DSO National Laboratories. do not expect Normanton Park station as it jus does not create enough demand.<br><br>CC24 Alexandra: to be built near or on the current Alexandra Fire Station (i think it's a bit old). to serve the Queensway area as well as Alexandra Village. the tunnel turns back onto Ayer Rajah Expressway before turning jus at Alexandra Hospital and travelling across it towards Alexandra station. the junction looks too busy for construction to go on, so LTA may wan to ask the government to rebuild the fire station together with the station (or course there's plenty of land next to it for a temporary fire station) but i'm not too sure if it'll go through with all the trouble to do that 'cause of possible funding problems - who should foot the bill for the fire station? LTA or SCDF or the govt? if not it could be under the road of Alexandra Road just in front of Alexandra Hospital in a north-south orientation.<br><br>CC25 Bukit Merah: to be built on the closed Bukit Merah Swimming Complex next to Bukit Merah Bus Interchange. there is still time for LTA to ask Singapore Sports Council (SSC) to release the land for a fee. and anyway, SSC did say they should be reserved for sports or leisure-related facilities, but since both are governmental agencies, their ministers could most possibly agree to this. if not it might have to be cramped somewhere along Jalan Bukit Merah, perhaps in front of Block 2 Redhill Close. there is a bit of spare land on roadside for road re-alignments, but it would have done a great deal of convenience for the old and poor residents at Redhill Close and the motorists. the tunnel should be along Jalan Bukit Merah until the Redhill Close stop or turn in under the HDB's hawker centre to the swimming complex.<br><br>CC26 Telok Blangah: to be built on Henderson Rd, next to Telok Blangah Estate. residents could walk or take feeder buses in if they leave away from Henderson Road. the tunnel follows Henderson Rd, of course.<br><br>CC27 HarbourFront: serves HarbourFront area. the tunnel follows Telok Blangah Rd after turning in from Henderson Rd. under-construction now, in front of Cable Car Towers.<br><br>CC28/NE2 HarbourFront Interchange: this is an interchange station with the North-East Line and terminal station for Circle Line. if for some reason the crossover equipment fails, passengers who need to transfer to North-East Line can exit at CC27 HarbourFront and walk over to NE1 HarbourFront, of course paying their fares as seperate trips. it could be somewhere at Keppel Road or at St. James Power Station. but it could a waste of resources having dupilcate stations like that. SBS Transit prohibits passengers from staying in the train at HarbourFront at Platform A if the train is to "go beyond" HarbourFront station due to worries that if the crossover equipment fails they could well be stuck in the train. but from what i know (and they do allow exceptions during the first days of opening) there are 3 tunnels where the southbound train can cross to the middle track before U-turning and reappearing on the northbound track at Platform B. there's even speculation the design of the 3 tunnels is for future links into Sentosa but i doubt it could turn that much to the south (remember it is a 6-car train).</div>

On National Day, I went up Benjamin Sheares Bridge and had the chance of looking at the construction of Millenia Station down below the viaduct. I think the station would be something like Orchard Station, where the station is in the middle of a curve. Since Convention Centre Station and Millenia Station is damn close, it would be like another twin stations of Clarke Quay/Chinatown stations.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

I have been to the Millenia station area, the station is being built opposite Millenia Tower/Centennial Tower, along Temasek Ave. Due to space constraint in the nearby area, the alignment of the tunnels towards Millenia station from Convention Centre station is more curved than the tunnels towards Orchard station, because the tunnels to and fro Orchard station is between Scotts Rd and Orchard Boulevard, not between Scotts Rd and Orchard Rd, which in this case, could be almost a L-shape alignment. The tunnels between Convention Centre station and Millenia station (towards Millenia) run under Raffles Boulevard, then left into Temasek Ave, the space constraints resulted in this alignment. Now, it is known that the CCL trains will use 3 carriage instead of 6, so in my opinion shouldn't be a big problem.<br></div>
