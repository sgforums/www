              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;">SINGAPORE - At least 15 commuters were left stranded on an SBS Transit bus after the driver stopped near a junction to make a phone call for directions.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;">Bus passenger Kelvin Lim on Nov 22 posted a Facebook video of the incident showing passengers advising the driver, while he called for help on his mobile phone.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;">The driver, who was speaking in Mandarin, appeared unsure if he should go straight or turn left at the junction. Some passengers could be heard telling him which way to go, while others complained that he should just let them alight.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;"> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;">The video has been shared over 3,000 times.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;">Mr Lim posted a second video of the incident on Thursday, in which he said the driver eventually insisted on going the wrong way, leading to many passengers having to walk back to the correct bus stop.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;">When asked about the incident, senior vice-president of corporate communications for SBS Transit Tammy Tan said, "We are investigating the incident and will take appropriate action against the driver."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 30.1587px;"> </p>

              <p>I think is because he don't know English and cannot remember the roads, that's why get lost.</p>
              <p>Bus drivers and Taxi drivers need to know the roads very well, especially Taxi drivers.</p>
              
               <p>It would be good if they are able to read and speak the English language.</p>
                           <p>As such, it is better to hire locals, especially homegrown talents who are born and bred here in Singapore, like me. :)</p>
                              <p>However, the bus driver's salary sux. Less than 2k a month, some more working hours so long. :( Give me 4k a month la, then maybe I will consider.</p>

              <p>Hmm...Im sure he would choose to listen if they would convince him better bah(if they haven't)..but it's not heard clearly if the way is the right one..</p>
              <p>Ever encounter a similar situation whereby a new BC is unsure to turn right/left..but an aunty simply managed to assisted him by telling him that she's a regular commuter..</p>
              <p>Thus, I assume they simply dk the routes..even if it's claimed by the Stomper but doesn't show (clearly) in the video..</p>

              <p>There is still local who willing to work 6 days provided the benefit and salary is great tandem with the sacrifice they do..One problem here bosses like to compared local and foreigner salaries and thats one problem they created.Dont even talk about the discrimination.Well its up to you to believe or not and im not in the position to elaborate further.</p>

              <p>I think the driver followed protocol. That's where the problem is.</p>
              <p>This incident is remarkably similar to something which happened four years ago:</p>

              <p>If having GPS solves the problem, then just utilize driverless buses next time lol ...</p>
              <p>Employing a senior bus captain will have manpower issues on other buses, especially if SBST is training a lot of new BCs. Unless they get the retirees on there, then maybe.</p>
