              <p>besides traffic jam, the delays during peak hours are also caused by passengers stubbornly clogging at the entrance door due to stubborn passengers refusing to move inwards</p>

              <p>Just a bit of history down here, 378 and 379 were originated from 214E and 214W way back in the 80s. These 2 feeders, together with other Jalan Kayu services, were handed over to Tibs in Dec 1995. Tibs renumbered these 2 feeders to 820 and 821 in Jan 1999. And in Dec 1999, 820 and 821 went back to SBS. 820 and 821 were then renumbered to 378 and 379 in Mar 2001.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Still remember in early 90s, feeders get only Volvo B57s and Merc OF1417s while trunks got upgrade. Feeders started getting minor upgrades to the 90s generation buses (Volvo MK2, Scania N113CRBs and Merc 0405s) only in 1994-96 while trunks get the new aircon VO3x/MK3/MK4. Those days feeders never get any aircon buses at all.</p>
              <p>Compare to nowdays, new Scania K230UBs on feeders. Even brand new Citaros and even Wrights can also debut on feeders. While some trunk routes in Hougang and NEL areas still with full fleet MK4 and VO3x.</p>

              <p>Current service 180 was renumbered from Tibs service 951 since Woodlands MRT rationalisation in Mar 1996. Tibs 951 was actually cutback to Bt Panjang and renumbered 180.</p>
              <p>There was another old Tibs 180 from Woodlands which was withdrawn way back in 1992. If I am not wrong that 180 was under SBS in the early 80s.</p>

              <p>Around 2000s, TIBS feeders are well treated, Yishun and Woodlands Feeders received new bendy buses while SBS feeders still using O405/CRB/MK2/MK3s.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>In fact Tibs started implementing aircon buses on feeders earlier than SBS in early 1998.</p>
              <p>SBS started implementing only in mid 1999 by selecting a few feeders to go PAC. I remember feeders 238 and 261 were among the 1st to go PAC.</p>

              <p>372 was renumbered to 903 straightaway when the new Woodlands Regional Int opened.</p>
              <p>343 was renumbered to 921 together with feeder 920 (which was Tibs first FAC feeder) introduction in Apr 2000. On that same day the renumbered 921 was also converted to PAC. Withdrawn and merged with 700 in mid 2006.</p>

              <p>Yep. But the old SBS 180 was already withdrawn and I'm talking about the current service 180 which was re-numbered from service 951 by TIBS. </p>
              <p>This was to reply to his post why isn't 951 re-numbered 780 instead of 180.</p>
