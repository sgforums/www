            <div class='col-md body'>This estate (now gone) used to have a bus terminal. Where was it exactly located? I have been there and seen a large carpark, but no facility for buses to park. Svcs 173 &amp; 193 used to start from there in the past. Any idea how did 193 operate? Was it superceded by 185? I remember 173 used to go to Orchard Rd. Took it from Orchard Emerald to People's Park ages ago.</div>

Prince Edward could be referring to her grandfather who abdicated in 1936 to marry a US divorcee. The current Prince Edward is her youngest son, who is also Earl of Wessex. Pity we have broken ties with the monarchy, if not we could have a condo project named Countess Park (in honour of Countess Sophie, wife of Edward). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
