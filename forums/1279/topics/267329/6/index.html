Since PIW taking buses during off-peak, then a SD would be gd enough..<br><br>//I was saying that to replace some B9TL with K230UB (not totally replace all).. I dun think this service require such a big amount of B9TL.. Deploying VO3x having more standing places and seating at the lower deck would help to solve the crowd.. It think it is because of B9TL that make a human congestion.. I can promise by replacing some B9TL with LO or VO would defintely solve the problem people squeezing.<br><br>//Pls la, PIW would know from the timetable that which WAB bus would be coming.. That was the reason why service 99 do not have B9TL buses.. Although I really hope that this service would have 4-5 WAB buses on these service.<br><br>//I dun want to argue wit u whether there is a PIW anot.. What I said are truth.. If u want to play around here and I would had nothing to say.<br><br>//Nvm, we would see whether there would be redeployment.. Maybe I should write in and ask why SBST do this arrangement..<br><br>//Sorry hor, Svc 143 serves both heartlands, schools, factory and ports..<br><br>//ok, like what I say earlier.. PIW communters would get hold of the timetable.. Just like sometimes you gotta to wait for an express service for 25mins to 30mins..<br><br>//hello mr, if u r the boss of SBST.. Which kind of communter would bring you more profit? think about it urself..<br><br>//peace <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>And if you are th boss of SBST, would you want to risk being fined and lose all your profit gained in the past few days from all services just because of people complaining on one service which you deem "unworthy" of having DDs/WAB?<br><br>Maybe you should write in and ask them to buy more King Longs for slbp since you are so despo for WABs.<br><br>If I go with your logic, I dun think sv198 require such a big amount of B9TL, can replace with some VO3xes.</div>

If svc 198 got 13 buses now, I suggest to reduce it to 7.. Replace 4 with VO3x as to meet the majority.. Another 3 with K230UB.. For PIW, they got timetable in control to know which PIW arriving.. NOT providing WAB buses would get fine? DD can deploy VO3x that can even contain more people then the current B9TL..</div>

SBST said that in 3 to 4 years time, half of the fleet will be WAB, by that time, B9TL can be more freely used, why do they want to mess up the deployment (which can incur fuel cost and any other opportunity costs they may have), when they know that they would have a lot of WABs soon.
