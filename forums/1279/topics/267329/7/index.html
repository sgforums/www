Firstly S174 and S157 plies Bt Batok and Bt Timah together, so its an either or thing. Secondly, S157 has S198 along Jurong East/West Ave 1. Chances are that PIWs seldom transfer buses due to the hassle of waiting and what nots.<br><br>S97 S197... S198 already plies AYE. So these 2 have very low chance of getting. S97 has S51 S143 S196 along its route to serve PIWs. S197 has S196 S2/S12 S7 S76 to serve along its route. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So I believe how SBST will deploy the K230 is based on one or more of the following factors<br>1.

Town served for connection to other current WAB services elsewhere say Chinatown, Bugis, Orchard or Shenton Way<br>3. As what u said earlier the polyclinics the centres and what-have-you.<br></div>
