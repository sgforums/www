That's why North East Line is built instead of North West Line. However, I am surprised that there are fewer residents residing in the North than in the Eastern due to the fact that Yishun int is definitely more bustling than Serangoon int and perhaps even Sengkang int even though I have made an assumption that the interchange residing in the respective areas reflect the number of people residing in that area.<br><br>Thanks for the effort to dig up the stats.</div>

Different areas, the way people travel are different. People living in Hougang or even Serangoon may not necessay passby their own hometown interchange. Reason might be that people in the northeast usually have direct buses to different location in Singapore and for Yishun, people usually take the feeder to YIS Int and make a transfer. People in the NorthEast dont usually take feeder then tranfer to another mode of transport.</div>
