Not to stuck these DD on these services, they can just deploy WAB SD..

What they are doing now, is to spread their buses  to as many services as possible. This way, the number of PIWs who can enjoy these services could then be greatly increase. Never mind the frequency of WAB arrival. At least, they have have an additional option other than taking the train or the other current WAB service. Thus, it is unlikely that Service 21 will go full WAB. At least not in the near future.</div>

It really seems that you want more B9TLs in slbp.... . Going through the list ah, which one of the above, except 165, isn't as packed as 21 during peak hours and do you think there is a demand from PIW? And many of the above services have almost the same frequency as 21, 174 can be worse during off peak.</div>

Theres a reason why the frequency is so good for some service even when it is the Off-Peak Hr. Take 147 / 238 for example. If thats the case, why dont i say, take away the 198's B9 and deploy on other service like 74 which has a better demand as compared to 198 since 198's demand is also not that good either.

BTW, every morning at about 8.15am along JW st 41 had a PIW communter onboard.. Come to the interchange and u would see the demand for svc 198... Svc 74 where got high frequency, off -peak that time only got 5-6 people.. Actually my statement is very easy, pls dun drag it further..

You may not realize, but the services you "recommend" for being WAB may have the same situation at that same time when you took 21. Also, you must consider how early the bus is, or how late the bus in front is.</div>

Dont you get it ? the reason that they are WAB is because 50% of the Fleet are WAB.<br><br>It is a common knowledge that Svc 88 would be 1 of the WAB service in near future. Whether you like it or not, you still gotta accept the fact. Thats something that we CANT change. Do you think they care about so many B9s on a particular service ? Answer is NO. As long as they put the buses on high demand route, Passengers are happy, revenues are high and at the same time serving the PIWs.<br><br>Why are you so "gan chiong" ? More WABs are coming in very soon within this few years. Cant you just wait ?</div>

FOr the first time, it should be dispersed  to others services.. I just feel pity for those PIW communter who are living in areas that do not even have a WAB bus on the service they are taking..</div>

I know that you want to spread out the WABs to as many services as possible. If thats the case, might as well we follow Rapid KL style. 1 or 2 WAB on EACH Service.<br><br>If this is the case, PIWs suffer. Might as well dont deploy them in the first place.<br><br>you get my point ?</div>
