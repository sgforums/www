You know that 88 only has 2 berths at Toa payoh but have a longer queue than 143. Schools ha, I think 88 can beat 143. 88 is a student+workers+residents route. Technopark already has a lot of workers, go to the bus stops in the area, packed, cos only got 72 and 88 serving, All the Alexandra and pasir Panjang distriparks you get much more alternatives, so demand is split among more services. CBD area is not a major factor, doesn't mean you pass by CBD then you get more load, doesn't mean you pass by CBD means you big, no such thing.</div>

You know that 88 only has 2 berths at Toa payoh but have a longer queue than 143. Schools ha, I think 88 can beat 143. 88 is a student+workers+residents route. Technopark already has a lot of workers, go to the bus stops in the area, packed, cos only got 72 and 88 serving, All the Alexandra and pasir Panjang distriparks you get much more alternatives, so demand is split among more services. CBD area is not a major factor, doesn't mean you pass by CBD then you get more load, doesn't mean you pass by CBD means you big, no such thing.</div></blockquote>After talking for so long, u r still so conservative.. If u see the frequency it is about the same. Svc 143 maybe longer a few mins cos they ply a longer route.. Do take Svc 143 between 7am to 9am.. west coast to science park direction.. CBD during that time dun need to say much.. u can go and take a look.. Somemore if a person work in the CBD and he is living in west coast, u would know how much he got to pay.. U need to see the difference, Svc 143 are mostly adults taking.. Svc 88 mostly are students and elderly.. Then, you would say also got adults heading to AMK for work.. But the fare stage still ok..</div>

Btw, they can leave 2 or 3 B9TL there and other exchange with SD..</div></blockquote>ok first we dont talk about the WABs first... we talk about DEMAND. the DDs are there for a reason and that is to cater to the demand of the pax load during peak hours. So if say u want the B9s out from 21 and replace them with the K230s, are you going to be responsible if the bus bursts at Eunos MRT stop? you would reply just add another SD bus in but I believe that is wasting resources.<br><br>And please la... PIWs are smart enough not to kaypoh the peak hour crowd unless whenever neccessary. Spot a PIW during peak hour and I say you are good. that is if its NOT on 147 196 198.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually seems they are so packed.. They should deploy VO3x or LO3x on these services.. Even if they deploy B9TL is useless as the PIW cannot even board the bus..</div></blockquote>Even if you put on other services it will still be packed. ok la maybe not as packed but STILL its PACKED! you put anywhere also still the same. We are not talking about a VO LO but a B9. Cannot anyhow suka suka place one B9 on one service and say its WAB or something to that tune. It must at least meet the fleet requirements with a healthy frequency range between the B9s.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">Ya lor.. since it is off-peak, a SD is sufficient..

Waste time and resources again....<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">Are u pretty sure Svc 198 got low demand? U live here? BTW, every morning at about 8.15am along JW st 41 had a PIW communter onboard.. Come to the interchange and u would see the demand for svc 198... Svc 74 where got high frequency, off -peak that time only got 5-6 people.. Actually my statement is very easy, pls dun drag it further.. Deploy SD and replace some WAB DD on other services which do not have any WAB buses.. I guess every service would have a PIW communter.. </div></blockquote>Why not I say this?<br><br>Are u pretty sure Svc 21 got low demand? U live here?

Anyway, i totally disagree svc 21 to be fully WAB.. That is waste of resources.. Just like Svc 88 having so many B9TL..</div></blockquote>88 has a fleet size of 28/29 buses. 50% means 14-15 B9s. Logical? That's why you see more B9s than anything else. About 7 of them are SDs meaning only 7 LO/VOs on the fleet, thus making the B9s are the prodominent model on the service.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sBs_boy:</div><div class="quote_body">1Hr45Mins.. Not much difference though.<br><br>If you compare, i would say 88 got more demand than 143. </div></blockquote>Both got their own demand and catchment areas. One serves heartlands and school students. The other serves places of employment and office/factory/psa workers.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">Firstly, I nv say their demand are bad.. Just dun know why they put most of the WAB bus resources on svc 88.. Same for svc 198..<br>Instead they should deploy evenly, of course not one or 2 but about 30 -35% of the fleets..</div></blockquote>you see ah.. 35% of the fleet... means every 20 buses I wait at the bus stop, only 7 buses are WAB. If frequency is a constant 10min, means I must wait 1hr for 1 WAB bus to come. You are nuts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">I nv twist ur words.. as those people going to heartlands are those children and elderly but adults would go to central district then the small mall in the heartlands..

It doesnt matter who uses the bus (except elderly for low floor buses and PIWs for B9s etc), but more of how MANY people uses the bus.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">Personally, every weekdays I would rather go home..

I dun think this service require such a big amount of B9TL.. Deploying VO3x having more standing places and seating at the lower deck would help to solve the crowd..
