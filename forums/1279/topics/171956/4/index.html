Credits for first hand knowledge is neither important nor essential here as we are not "working as reporters in a magazine, like those in drama shows".<br><br>As long as everyone is willing to share what they know and come together as bus fans, everything would be ok. I do believe we are nice people, who do not put credits above interests and friendships.<br><br>As for any misunderstandings, we friends should endeaveour to clarify any misunderstandings we might have. Those on the sidelines should also help make the situation better as everyone is and would be involved in one way or another.<br><br>We all have bad moods but i hope we could clam down and communicate peacefully, even if comments by anyone irritates us either intentionally or unintentionally.<br><br>No one is above or better than another; we are all capable of doing this.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! Just stumbled into this bus forums and didn't realised that our CNG buses will be such a hit among all here. These CNG buses are out on the roads today. Although there were many technical hiccups after we take out the buses after so long of storage, we managed to solve them and push the buses onto the road. I had a session with Volvo on Friday evening and came to understand how the CNG bus works in the aspects of fuel carburetion. The rest of the bus is the same as a normal diesel bus. Like the MK4, The CNG bus has a 'boxer' styled engine. This bus is indeed a safe vehicle to travel with. Even safer than the normal diesel buses. (Our diesel buses are already maintained in the best condition as much as our budget can allow. Already so safe, imagine our CNG buses. No matter what Safety is No:1, no efforts and costs will be spared to give the public the best experience in travelling with SBST in terms of any aspect.) And most impt its new! Never put on the road for driving though stored for quite long.<br><br>Thanks for all the support! This gives me more encouragement to give the best technical services to the buses for the greater good of the public.<br><br>Once again Thank You!<br><br>By the way, are you all also from this industry?</div>

Thank you very much! Because really many technical hiccups when we took out the vehicles from long term storage. My guys really put in their heart and soul to do up these buses so that the public can get to enjoy these CNG buses. No amount of thanks will be able to express my gratitude. I can only express my thanks by continue to maintain the best service my workshop can offer to everyone out there.<br><br>You can rest assured that all the buses (not only the CNG) you get to ride from SBST bears the trademark of every single technical personnel who dedicates their best professionalism and pride to ensure that the public gets to enjoy the best of our heart and soul.<br><br>Once again thank you very much.</div>
