            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MS:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi! Just stumbled into this bus forums and didn't realised that our CNG buses will be such a hit among all here. These CNG buses are out on the roads today. Although there were many technical hiccups after we take out the buses after so long of storage, we managed to solve them and push the buses onto the road. I had a session with Volvo on Friday evening and came to understand how the CNG bus works in the aspects of fuel carburetion. The rest of the bus is the same as a normal diesel bus. Like the MK4, The CNG bus has a 'boxer' styled engine. This bus is indeed a safe vehicle to travel with. Even safer than the normal diesel buses. (Our diesel buses are already maintained in the best condition as much as our budget can allow. Already so safe, imagine our CNG buses. No matter what Safety is No:1, no efforts and costs will be spared to give the public the best experience in travelling with SBST in terms of any aspect.) And most impt its new! Never put on the road for driving though stored for quite long.<br><br>Thanks for all the support! This gives me more encouragement to give the best technical services to the buses for the greater good of the public.<br><br>Once again Thank You!<br><br>By the way, are you all also from this industry?</div></blockquote>Hi MS, members from this (and some not from this) forum comes from all walks of life. Some are students, some are National Servicemen, some are professionals. Just that we all share the same passion as bus enthusiasts. Glad that you and your guys are so appreciative of our support! We are also honoured that we have a professional from SBST as a guest in the forum! Hope you can be part of our family of bus enthusiasts!</div>

I was under HQ MES also. This company is the best choice for ORD personnel with experience and skills. The workshop frontline status changes frequently. So more could be out by afternoon or maybe tomorrow. I need to get back to office before I'm updated. All the CNG now belongs to Soon Lee. Since you're in this line, you should know if vehicles parked for long periods and not using, the rubber seals, belts etc will be damaged. So we need to replace them to ensure only the best parts goes on the roads. On top of that we also have other buses to take care of. So its really a tight race against time.</div>

At least you don't get charged or sign extra duties for longer than 'standard' hair. But in civilian, your results mean everything. In military some carry balls will mean easier promotion. But in civilian, its the survival of the fittest. Thats why I feel that in SBS, the challenges are there. Much more than I was in SAF. Because every decision that I make will affect the end users which are the passengers. So I must at all cost place the safety and comfort of my passengers and BC as top priority. Not forgetting also to give my workshop staff a safe environment to provide the best results to present to all the passengers.<br><br>We do run in the engines. If we do not run in, then our engines won't last. This is applicable to all engines regardless its a car or bus or motorcycle. Engines are very costly. I'm not sure whether there're any preservative chemicals as when I joined SBST, the buses were already in storage. But the CNG buses do not have fuel tanks for preservative chemicals like the Vappro anti-Corrosion Inhibitors which SAF is using. The fuel tanks are replaced by 8 gas tanks on the roof of the bus. These gas are ignited by spark plugs. So the engine is somewhat similar to a petrol engine. The CNG bus engine is 'boxer'styled like a BMW motorcycle as the engine is mounted lying down. (pistons move horizontally.) But it's also technically correct to say its an inline 6 cylinder turbo charged petrol/CNG engine. If pple were to say CNG buses are not safe as these gas will detonate if leak, it is not true. For the CNG to detonate, we need to have 10%-15% CNG and the rest normal atmospheric air, plus a condition of minimum 680 degress celcius, plus a mode of ignition (spark). Only 1 place in this world are we able to achieve such a condition. That is inside the combustion chamber of the engine where temperatures can hit as high as 2000 degree C. There is no way anyone other than God can create such a condition in the normal atmosphere. If there is indeed a leakage, then all that it will cause is a reduced mileage. But such problems will be tackled when the bus returns to the depot for PM servicing frequently. All workshop staffs will do our best to ensure only the best goes to the route groups which in turn are presented to passengers by our BC.<br><br>I'm monitoring the performance and camouflaged problems of the CNG buses while its on the road. And will keep tabs on all technical problems that might create any possibilities to cause discomfort or danger. I'd rather react to a false alarm rather than to let go any possible risk to any of my passenger's safety or comfort.<br><br>Thanks a lot.</div>

The idling should be at the 1.2krpm region. This is the stall test RPM. The bus should be able to hit 1.2krpm region during stall test in order to be deemed as with power. This is for the 2 axle Volvo Olympian. For exact details, I need to check with the Leading Hands because different vehicles may differ. A 1 litre sportsbike may be just half clutch at 1.8krpm but 1.8krpm for a bus will be too powerful to remain stationery.<br><br>Anyway when I told my colleague that the public is very concerned with our CNG and positively reacting, he was smiling very happily. My guys are touched to know that the public actually appreciates our hard work. Every organisation has their problems. Even SBS is not spared this fact. So it is not easy to maintain the fleet. The success of the buses daily that goes on the road everyday, is the credit of the entire workshop. When the bus returns as breakdowns, our heart sinks with the vehicle. My guys hold pride in the way they work and I'm really proud to say that I am a member of this organisation.<br></div>
