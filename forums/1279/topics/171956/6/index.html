The success of the buses daily that goes on the road everyday, is the credit of the entire workshop. When the bus returns as breakdowns, our heart sinks with the vehicle.

Must depend on the seriousness of the faults, has it affected other things (no matter what I dunwan to dida-apa solve the fault then let go without realising that there're other faults undetected.) the spares availability, the manpower status, whether there're more urgent buses that awaits attention, many factors contributes.<br><br>Sad to say as technical personnels in the industries, we all know that when vehicles all kept in storage for long periods, workshop will suffer once the vehicle comes on the roads. The rubbers will start to crack and things will start to leak or break. This was also one of those harsh factors that hit the SAF preservation vehicles badly. There is no way to eliminate this problem other than to apply preservatives which can only slow down the decay not eliminate. Before the buses come out after so long, we all have already predicted that the first 6 months will be hell for us. On top of that, we also have many other buses to take care of. So my workshop guys are really putting in extra efforts to repair the buses. But the faults always have their way to catch us unaware. So this becomes a cat and mouse game. While we chase after the faults with our every possible effort, we nail the fault with our claws and the next mouse will pop out of the next hole. Until we finally manage to solve all problems then the faults will start to slow down.<br><br>However, the best part despite the hardships we're facing, you all have been showering your concerns positively on our efforts which acts as an extra boost to our morales. My guys though they don't know how to express, were smiling and happy to know that their efforts are not in vain.<br><br>Now everytime you see a CNG bus running on the road, bears an invisible word painted with our hearts that reads: "Thank you all!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe SBST can paste small CNG decals on these 10 buses to create awareness about the fact that they run on CNG and are cleaner. many people cannot differentiate, or does not know what the tank on the roof signifies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>on a side note, buses (and heavy vehicles in general) have idling at 600-900/min, right? 1800/min is probably where gearshift occurs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MS!<br><br>Sure enlightening to read your first-hand insights on the CNG buses. Not anything technical, but I've a question nevertheless.<br><br>I stumbled upon an NEA Press Release, and in that release, SBST signed an agreement with ENV and SembCorp Gas to buy and operate up to 30 CNG buses in the project. Will SBST continue to purchase other makes of CNG buses, under this project, after the pioneer batch of Volvo CNGs?</div>

Idle speeds can also fluctuate due to the constantly changing power demands from air-conditioning, compressors, etc.  CNG and LPG engines (particularly ones that rely on venturi mixers for fuel metering) are particularly sensitive to abrupt changes in power demand and therefore have a tendancy to vary their idle speed considerably (i.e. revving up and down when stopped) - differences can be greater than 100 r/min and can be quite audibly noticeable.<br><br>Today, bus engines, whether diesel or CNG-powered, run at their best between 1000 r/min and 1700 r/min ("Green Zone" - best fuel economy, peak torque, and maximum turbo boost are achieved somewhere during the above engine speeds).  Rated speed (engine speed where peak power is achieved) is usually around 2000 r/min.  Of course, all this above depends greatly on the engine manufacturer, engine displacement, etc.....<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</div>
