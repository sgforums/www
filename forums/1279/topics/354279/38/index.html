              I prefer photographing buses along the roadside when they are moving.
              However, for buses with camera unfriendly EDS 'forces' me to photograph at bus-stops.
              Thank God the new batches of Scania are not like that!
              I remember seeing photos of K230UB buses on the move; with the EDS captured perfectly (not panning) - i think got to do with very fast shutter speeds?
              Anyone can further advise on this? and which camera good for K230UB on the move?

              <p><br>You can if you are using a DSLR. With shutter speed 1/50 with clear shots, you need higher ISO to compensate, as a result you will need veri high F value.</p>
