              <p>In fact, skills takes up a larger percentage of such bus photography. It's better to learn those features in your camera first, experiment with basic settings (ie exposure, ISO, shutter speed etc) and then get the suitable settings for sunlight/backlight/EDS/night shots, then proceed on with angles and all that. Phone camera ain't recommended, because there're higher chance of the photo getting distorted. </p>
              <p>It's like when I'm using my camera for the first time, I use ISO-1600 with angles that are not too bad, but in the end, my photos were spoilt by the noise.</p>

              <p>if you guys know so much, why not learn to impart whatever you have with sole willingness to teach the willing, instead of condemning them and leaving them to rot. have you ever thought of that?</p>
              <p>i don't mean just to ngjy22, but the rest who pretty much uglied my thread again in the earlier pages.</p>
              <p>i believe some people have the same shots over and over is also because they are comfortable at where they are at, everyone has their own preferences, even though it doesnt have a wow factor, they find pleasure to share it with the community instead of keeping it to themselves which i feel is already a very good step to see that there are really passionate bus fans. whether they want to improve themselves, its up to them, we should not force others to conform to the patterns of others or to learn a lot to seem "pro", basically its just a hobby, not a career. but if they really want to learn, which is a good thing, its good that we take the patience to slowly teach. also i'm not talking about those who just want to create a bad name out of themselves for their stubbornness and poor attitude despite peoples advice though. i wont point our names.</p>
              <p>IMPT: no offence to anyone though and i aplogise if i sounded so. just some of my thoughts.</p>
              <p>OT: notice my thread always gets the flames and it gets locked and restarted =.=</p>

              <p>get a grip. it doesnt mean someone is liddat, means the community will be liddat. its when people keep nitpicking each other's faults, that this happens. focus on the positives in the person over the negatives. by ranting over other forumnites isnt gonna solve the problem.</p>

              <p>Your ATTITUDE is DISGUSTING. It doesn't mean though you are a
              SENIOR and a MOD in the forum, you have the right to put down
              people. I don't see how the comments on which camera is better at

              <p>I have been observing the going-ons on this thread for quite
              some time and I am disturbed with what you wrote. That PATRONISING
              attitude of yours... Granted I am new to SG-f and a bus enthusiast,
              but the way you DEMEAN OTHERS by saying their posts are useless is
              out of place. This is a photo thread, yes. Why are the comments
              about comparing cameras to take photos of buses are childish and
              boorish? Why does the comments not matter to this thread? Is such a
              LOGICAL DEBATE SO STUPID???</p>

              Granted the comments there were less than satisfactory, but there
              is no need for such a blatant disregard of other forum members own
              opinions. Are you such a control freak that wants others to think

              <p>" It seems to me that after homework is done (or maybe there is
              no homework at all), what you guys would do is to discuss things
              that are off-topics and pulls down the fame of this forum! Do you
              know how many PAIRS OF EYES have been looking through this forum
              and HOW MUCH CRITICISM has come to me with regards to how

              <p>Now before people claim I deviate too much from the topic. My
              photos. Brought over from earlier(or was it this thread's
              predeccessor???) due to some problems I don't see the previous
              photos here. Someone double check please.</p>

              <p>I think you got the wrong idea. I don't have any reason to fight
              about some camera stuff. In fact I don't really care about cameras.
              I also hardly take photos of buses. I am just disgusted by the
              mod's attitude towards others. Note that I don't post on this
              thread very much before I got mad with anger last night...</p>

              <p>I am not replying to the people who posted before, about buses
              or not. I am only giving my two cents worth to the mod who gave
              such a patronising attitude towards others.</p>

              <p>I don't get what you mean by my attitude. I have å¿� this for

                  out of place. This is a photo thread, yes. Why are the comments

                  Granted the comments there were less than satisfactory, but there
                  is no need for such a blatant disregard of other forum members own

                  that? Your comments irk me and I do believe it irks others as well.

              <p>Disclamer: Some of my photos here (and subsequent photos in future) here are cropped in this kind of way for a purpose... Not that it's a noob shot but sometimes I just feel that bus photography is more than just focusing on the bus solely and what I hope to achieve is to bring out the background of the photos etc to make the photo looks more interesting...</p>

              <p>Ok lah let's just cool it down.</p>
              <p>@Fryderyk : Mods wanna keep this place neat tidy and I don't blame them for doing so. But after all they are mods, no use argueing with them over some trivial matters. But i understand your point because I don't see anything wrong in discussing the best settings or the best camera here either.<br><br>@Mod : Maybe you do not see the bigger picture but after all this is a photo thread. Surely you can close one eye on people discussing about cameras because as a mod you should be a little flexible, if not it's dictatorship already. I'm not blaming you or what but as a Mod, you should know better than most of us here.<br><br>For both of you, next time you all should watch your tone and esp the person who started it. If you wanna start it, please just tell them nicely.<br><br>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Disclamer: Some of my photos here (and subsequent photos in
              future) here are cropped in this kind of way for a purpose... Not
              that it's a noob shot but sometimes I just feel that bus
              photography is more than just focusing on the bus solely and what I
              hope to achieve is to bring out the background of the photos etc to
              make the photo looks more interesting...</p>

              <p>Actually, I like it when it comes with some varying backgrounds. Camp at same place a bit boring. Personal preference ah! =3</p>

              <p>But in this case the mod is the reason behind the flamings. He
              asked for it when he gave that disgusting haughty attitude towards

              <p>Just close one eye la. If I remember correctly, 9861E is serving the Army and just managed to book-out. Probably aggrevated by the stress inside. Just don't do it too often.</p>

              <p>there are always debates and flamings if bus fans, be it "seniors" or "juniors", don't learn to cooperate with each other. some "seniors" bus fans stereotyping "juniors". "juniors" feel that they are being ignored by "seniors". the "seniors-juniors" divide and etc.</p>
              <p>what's wrong with everyone who does all these to the "juniors"? need such a hobby be divided into different categories? can't we all work as together? can't we let each other one step at a time? can't we just trash that "seniors-juniors" divide? about "seniors" knowing more knowledge than "juniors"? which "seniors" starts out knowing everything? need these people be stereotyping the juniors for that?</p>
              <p>the result? "juniors" flaming "seniors" now?</p>
              <p>before correcting me, the attitude of some bus fans (not only some seniors, but a few other bus fans whose attitude i felt was redundant here, mostly those tantamount to being flamed uncountable times, excludes those who were flamed for a few times or less) should just change towards the "seniors" or "juniors (whichever applies), otherwise you lose the respect or attention due to you. apologies to those unaffected. kudos to those "seniors" bus fans who doesn't display such attitude, you certainly have my respect.</p>
