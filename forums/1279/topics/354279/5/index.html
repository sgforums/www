              <p>Has SMB32T being retroffitted with the driver's window already? Can't see clearly. Unable to determine today as SMB33R cameoed today, which had its new driver's window retrofitted.</p>
              <p>Another unsure one is SMB31X, only seen a UMW Lance with a new Tiger Beer ad cameo driven by the perm BC <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>Vic. Nt sure if u noticed or nt. ALMOST ALL photos taken using Sanyo Xacti <strong>S</strong>6 are static shots. (I.E. Bus not moving). Sanyo Xacti S6 Sanyo Xacti does not allow the user to set anything using manual execpt White balance, exposure and ISO. The rest will be Full Auto. (No shuttle speed setting... so when the bus chiongs down in bright daylight.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) Not sure about the Sanyo Xacti E6.<br><br>Also tried using Panosonic Lumix LZ5, Nikkon P50/60/80, Canon Pwrsht S5, Canon EOS 450D/500D. All beat the Sanyo Xacti <strong>S</strong>6 hands down <strong>in my opinion</strong>.</p>

              moving). Sanyo Xacti S6 Sanyo Xacti does not allow the user to set
              anything using manual execpt White balance, exposure and ISO. The
              rest will be Full Auto. Not sure about the Sanyo Xacti E6.<br> <br> Also tried using Panosonic Lumix LZ5, Nikkon P50/60/80, Canon
              Pwrsht S5, Canon EOS 450D/500D. All beat the Sanyo Xacti
              <strong>S</strong>6 hands down <strong>in my opinion</strong>.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... Static shots also shots ma... It's still photos after all regardless whether the object (bus in this case) is moving or not... </p>
              <p>So what if all beat the Sanyo Xacti S6? You are still able to produce good photos ma... Just that whether you want to do it or not... At least yours is better than those handphone shots...</p>

              people. I don't see how the comments on which camera is better at

              some time and I am disturbed with what you wrote. That PATRONISING
              attitude of yours... Granted I am new to SG-f and a bus enthusiast,
              but the way you DEMEAN OTHERS by saying their posts are useless is
              out of place. This is a photo thread, yes. Why are the comments
              about comparing cameras to take photos of buses are childish and
              boorish? Why does the comments not matter to this thread? Is such a
              LOGICAL DEBATE SO STUPID???</p>

              Granted the comments there were less than satisfactory, but there
              is no need for such a blatant disregard of other forum members own
              opinions. Are you such a control freak that wants others to think
