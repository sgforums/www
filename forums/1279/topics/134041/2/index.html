Never seen this before on any other bus or coach &amp; it was somewhat vibrasive &amp; making louder than 'normal' squeaking noises from there ! Notable too was the boat rocking sensation from left to right many times when stationary which i suspect due to suspension momentarily releasing too air on 1 bellow then followed by more air pumped in compensate &amp; when overdone the vehicle rocks to the right etc. !<br>Any kneeling function on this unit ?? Whether or not if so, they need to do some maintenence work on the suspension !<br><br></div></blockquote>Volgren "quality".  This is a reason why I do not like Volgren bodies.  Call me unpatriotic (you wouldn't be the only one to call me that), but it is true.

The suspension has a kneeling mechanism, but I'm sure the driver's don't use it, or it has been disabled (like on all the B10M fleet).  I remember driving an O.405NH and as it self-levels when stationary and only when I release my foot from the brake pedal (when the maxi-brake has been applied, of course), and this old lady smacked me telling me to stop playing with the bus!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Among the 3rd party bodies, i find overall quality appeal of the Volgren body better to the Alexander &amp; Duple Metsec, though still not as good as the Hispano or Van Hool.<br><br>In that Scania's case, i don't think that behaviour is that simply explained away as due to self-leveling functioning. Because the bus is already stationary &amp; 'level' then suddenly it tilts downwards to the left then tilts upwards over to the right &amp; it's repeated &amp; the vehicle hardly can keep still &amp; level !! So much so i overheard another passenger remark it's like sitting on a boat, which i have to agree !<br><br>If you release then quickly re-apply the footbrakes it's normal the bus would dip forwards then backwards, unlike the lateral (sideways from left to right) movement above ! So i'm almost 100 % sure there's some suspension problem with that unit &amp; that it's behaviour surely isn't 'normal' in any bus, especially a more reputed one like Saab-Scania !<br><br>In the O 405 (O 305 too) they have a bus-stop valve feature, which reduces air consumption when the bus is stationary so that the brakes are more responsive when released prior to accelerating off. I believe that explains the rather unique sound made whenever the bus stops &amp; either door is opened. This sound not to be confused with the other more 'normal' sound when the doors are opened due to the locally added on door-interlock feature, which the various makes all have here in their fleet.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">Volgren "quality".

This model's instrumentation looks very similar to the Travego coach but i don't think the model of bus-chassi used is Travego in chassi-form &amp; has only 1 but big exhaust pipe pointed straight out on the right, in contrast to the other of the new generation M-B models here which has the single pipe pointed downwards &amp; with a different instrumentation which appears 'lower end' than this model i'm taking. Appears HI uses exclusively this model on their JB-KL route. The coachwork is similar to their other buses except these use bigger reclining seats with head &amp; arm rests, woodgrain interior trimming, seat belts &amp; only 3 seat across configuration.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, when I rode it on the 518, it had the normal self-levelling characteristics.<br><br>P.S.
