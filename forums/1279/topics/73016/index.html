However, do not reply with things like "VSOs are slow", "VSOs are crap" etc etc. Many flame wars of similar nature has occured and if doesn't stop now, it will just go on never ending. I have learnt to respect other people's preference (for those who know I trashed Scanias / Lances last time with my posts).<br><br>For those who are unhappy with a reply, you can choose to ignore it or reply graciously instead of using a "brute force" reply.<br><br>Your experiences on buses and expertise are welcomed, but please, make this a fun-filled and non flame war thread. It will make everything easier for all of us.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact respective directly to the concerned bus company to feedback their services.</span><br><br>For those who want to have suggestions or unhappiness with a certain service, please contact the concerned bus company.
