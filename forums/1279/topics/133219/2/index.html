I saw 92A arriving with one passenger on board. The bus was not from BBDEP but was from Science Park (I was in 111 SBS 9200 G by then). It was SBS 1749 T. I also noticed that there is no signboard at the bus stop for 92A (Ghim Moh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Science Park) maybe coz itz not needed...but there is still 92A plying from Ghim Moh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Science Park.</div>
