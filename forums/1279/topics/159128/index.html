            <div class='col-md body'>Letter from Goh Rong Kai<br><br>.<br>"As an independent regulator, the Public Transport Council (PTC) is entrusted with the challenging mission of both safeguarding the interest of the public and ensuring the long-term viability of public transport operators. It aims to strike an optimum balance between the two,'' says the Mission Statement of the PTC.<br>.<br>So, I was surprised by the PTC rushing to support public transport operators.<br>.<br>Firstly, by accepting the statistics provided by the operators as is, it fails in its mission statement.<br>.<br>I would suggest that the PTC commission an independent audit to provide a more transparent figure instead. The PTC should also regulate closely the services of the public transport operators.<br>.<br>For example, <span style="color: red;">if bus operators design routes that are extremely long, commuters are indirectly forced to pay extra. What has the PTC done to ensure commuters get a fair deal? </span>.<br>What surprised me was the decision to create another "fine" situation and add to the many fines Singapore has. How then can one learn to be responsible for oneself?<br>.<br>In the 1960s and 70s, when we had bus conductors, the problem of underpaying existed.<br>.<br>With today's technology, we should be able to eliminate the problem. We need to study why and how it happens, not just rush to implement fines.<br>.<br><span style="color: blue;">TransitLink, the PTC and transport operators must work together to enhance the system, resolve the issue of overcharging commuters and improve the long waiting times (especially during off-peak hours) before pointing a finger at commuters</span><br><br>Extracted from Today 24th Oct 2005<br><br>Feel free to commment, and follow up with the replies .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Surely they've seen a reduction in loss after switching from the old Transitlink cards to the current EZ-link cards. It's not practically possible to see a 0% loss. Some people are bound to find ways to cheat. Could it be possible that making an effort to eliminate that slight loss actually cost them money?<br><br>And how come it's ok that some people are overcharged and not know about it?

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt the authorities will be able to enforce the fine on fare evaders effectively.  Fare evaders can always choose to:<br>- alight the bus before the inspector reaches him/her<br>- always choose to alight the bus immediately even if caught red-handed by the inspector (instead of paying the fine)<br>- what can the inspector do is the fare evader says he got no money?<br>- even if the inspector insists on taking down his/her NRIC no. and particulars, they can always say they don't have it with them.<br><br>And the most funny thing is :<br>- Fare evaders will be fined $20 if caught for non-payment or underpayment<br>- Fined $50 for using of concession cards.<br>I find this really stupid. If you were the fare evader, which would you admit? Of course I'd rather admit non-payment as the fine will be only $20, instead of admitting that I've been abusing the concession pass ($50 fine) right?<br><br>In Melbourne(Australia)(case study) :<br>A group of about 2-5 inspectors conduct ticket inspections as a group (to "surround the passengers") and fare evaders face a $100 summon (to be paid at the centre). Most of these inspectors look tough and big size, unlike Singapore's inspectors who had to work alone. Australian ticket inspectors can detain the fare evader and even call the police to arrest them if they try to escape or fail to produce their proof of identification. Sometimes, Australian police also conduct ticket inspections on trains!!<br><br></div>

He did not want to pay for his bus trip which was supposed to be rather long and BC refused to move out of Toa Payoh Int till he pays or get down the bus. The BC did not resort to legal action as a woman stood up to pay for his bus fare and asked him to keep the ticket. How incondersirate of him!!!</div></blockquote>Who knows? The BC might have been observing this old man for quite some time for failing to pay his fares repeatedly till he cannot tahan anymore and insisted that he pay up for the journey this time round...(maybe kanna "marked" by the BC leow..)</div>

Fare evaders can always choose to:<br>- alight the bus before the inspector reaches him/her<br>- always choose to alight the bus immediately even if caught red-handed by the inspector (instead of paying the fine)<br>- what can the inspector do is the fare evader says he got no money?<br>- even if the inspector insists on taking down his/her NRIC no. and particulars, they can always say they don't have it with them.<br><br>And the most funny thing is :<br>- Fare evaders will be fined $20 if caught for non-payment or underpayment<br>- Fined $50 for using of concession cards.<br>I find this really stupid. If you were the fare evader, which would you admit? Of course I'd rather admit non-payment as the fine will be only $20, instead of admitting that I've been abusing the concession pass ($50 fine) right?<br><br>In Melbourne(Australia)(case study) :<br>A group of about 2-5 inspectors conduct ticket inspections as a group (to "surround the passengers") and fare evaders face a $100 summon (to be paid at the centre). Most of these inspectors look tough and big size, unlike Singapore's inspectors who had to work alone. Australian ticket inspectors can detain the fare evader and even call the police to arrest them if they try to escape or fail to produce their proof of identification. Sometimes, Australian police also conduct ticket inspections on trains!!<br><br></div></blockquote>Thats scary being arrested by the police for just not paying the correct fare.</div>

In fact, I came across a newspaper article in Melbourne that the court sentenced a man to a day's jail for refusing to pay his $100 summon for fare evasion repeatedly.<br><br></div>
