Similarly, inspectors cam detain you call police and add another offence</span><br>And the most funny thing is :<br>- Fare evaders will be fined $20 if caught for non-payment or underpayment<br>- Fined $50 for using of concession cards.<br>I find this really stupid. If you were the fare evader, which would you admit? Of course I'd rather admit non-payment as the fine will be only $20, instead of admitting that I've been abusing the concession pass ($50 fine) right?<br><br><span style="color: orange;">This is prob another of the loop holes they need to patch up. But $20 very siong already, imagine 1 day kanna twice = whole month bus fare.</span><br><br>In Melbourne(Australia)(case study) :<br>A group of about 2-5 inspectors conduct ticket inspections as a group (to "surround the passengers") and fare evaders face a $100 summon (to be paid at the centre). Most of these inspectors look tough and big size, unlike Singapore's inspectors who had to work alone. Australian ticket inspectors can detain the fare evader and even call the police to arrest them if they try to escape or fail to produce their proof of identification. Sometimes, Australian police also conduct ticket inspections on trains!!<br><br><span style="color: red;">Whats new?

            <div class='col-md body'>Extract from Today 29th Oct 2005<br><br><strong>Not always cost effective to have most direct bus route </strong><br>Letter from LOH CHOW KUANG<br>Secretary, Public Transport Council<br><br>WE REFER to Mr Benny Tien's letter "<strong>Are bus operators taking commuters for a ride?" on Oct 20. </strong>.<br>The Public Transport Council (PTC) is an independent body that regulates bus services and also bus and train fares in Singapore.<br>.<br>PTC is required to balance commuters' interests with the long-term viability of the public transport operators, and to ensure that the costs of public transport provision are managed and fares remain affordable to the general public.<br>.<br>Basic bus operators (SBS Transit and SMRT Buses) are responsible for providing a comprehensive and efficient network of daily scheduled services within their areas of responsibility.<br>.<br>In particular, the operators are required to comply with the quality of service standards stipulated by the PTC and to seek PTC's approval to introduce a new service or to amend or withdraw an existing service.<br>.<br>To safeguard commuters' interests, the PTC has from time to time directed the bus operators to revise or withdraw their proposals for bus route changes.<br>.<br>The PTC has also required the operators to provide bus services to less developed areas even though the services may not be profitable.<br>.<br>Mr Tien has asked why some trunk services take longer routes.<br>.<br>We wish to clarify that the directness of bus routes was measured using a proxy, by comparing the one-way, terminal-to-terminal distance of a bus route with that of the shortest route by car.<br>.<br>In practice, most commuters do not travel from one terminal to another.<br>.<br>While the average one-way distance of trunk bus services is about 18km, the average travelling distance of bus passengers is only about one third of this.<br>.<br>Public transport caters to the masses and passenger demand and trip distribution vary widely across the island.<br>.<br>It is therefore, not always practical and cost effective to provide every commuter with the most direct bus service.<br>.<br>Route deviations are sometimes necessary, to better serve the commuters in certain areas.<br>.<br>In fact, commuters often request for an existing bus service to be diverted closer to their origin/destination.<br>.<br>In the absence of a direct link and where a transfer is necessary, the existing fare structure facilitates this by providing for a transfer rebate to minimise the cost of making the transfer.<br>.<br>We assure Mr Tien that we will continue to ensure the bus operators improve on the current bus network.<br><span style="color: red;">How they ensure this??? Talk is cheap.</span><br>.<br>Mr Tien and members of the public may direct any further queries or feedback to PTC's feedback e-mail address at ptc@www.ptc.gov.sg.<br>.<br>We also invite them to visit our website at www.ptc.gov.sg for more information.<br>.<br>We thank Mr Tien for his feedback and the opportunity to clarify.<br>Letter from LOH CHOW KUANG<br>Secretary, Public Transport Council<br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
