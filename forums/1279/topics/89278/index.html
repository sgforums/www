            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, non-aircon buses are ligher. An air-condition port weighs around 500 KG. This would eventually cut down the performance of the bus by a certain %. I agree that non-aircon buses do perform well in certain manner, however it would be a hassle when the weather isn't kind.</div>
