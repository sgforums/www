              <p>I have reading this forum since 2005 although i only created an account in 2007. Even before tamago was made a moderator.</p>

              <p>This forum was much much more active in the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess i can attribute this to the influx of new users who think they set the rules here.</p>
