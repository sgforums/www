              <p>Hi Friends,</p>
              <p>I took svc 17 from Bedok Interchange on Friday at 6.30 pm all the way to Pasir Ris Interchange as I wanted to try out this route.</p>
              <p>The headway was about 14 minutes, and the next bus was 15 minutes away. Even then the peak loading of the bus was at Tampines Ave 2 till Tampines Ave 7 of about 45 pax. It was around 40 pax from Bedok to North Depot, and 30 pax till Tampines Ave 2. From Loyang to Pasir Ris, the loading was not more than 30 pax again.</p>
              <p>I was confused with 8 DDs deployed, how during peak hours the loading is so poor? Is it a one off case or the load on 17 has really fallen in the past few months? Or is it more of a school service?</p>
              <p>Want to hear your experiences on this.</p>

              now...
              
              some prior background info... There was ever a Sv 227 feeder bus in the Bedok New Town leg. 
              
              Seriously... I can see a pattern w/ your kind of post... You're trying to say you only spotted based on the bus ride.
              
              Now, do you know of impulse loading situation in the first place based on whatever facilities the bus passes by?

              <p>1. You chose a friday to take</p>

              <p>3. You chose a day when people is very likely to be on leave to take</p>
              <p>I would suggest you to take on another weekday that all the above do not apply. I cant advice on timing for that, but I would prefer you to take during morning peak. Its more representative of the loading. OTOT for you.</p>
              <p>And for every bus service you take, you can't possibly expect the bus to be of a load that is justified by your standards. Humans choose the time to take the bus, not the bus choose how much capacity I ferry to fetch you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>17 easily has the highest demand at Pasir Ris Interchange during the evening peak and at night, on par with 88 and 359. Even with a frequency that is better than services like 12 and 21, the queue for 17 can get really long. So yes, 17 definitely deserves the DDs. Demand from students on school days is strong as well, and the Bedok Interchange - Bedok North Ave 4 sector is obviously high in demand, or why else would there be 17A? Really, I'm surprised to hear you question whether 17 deserves DDs. It functions as an important and indispensable feeder service at both of its interchanges and as a frequent rider of 17, I daresay it deserves an even better frequency than what it has now - long queues are seen at Pasir Ris Interchange during off-peak hours, especially at night, when all the S-shift buses have gone off service.</p></div>
