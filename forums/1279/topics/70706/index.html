            <div class='col-md body'>Tibs brand to make way for SMRT's<br>by Christopher Tan<br><br>IF YOU see a Tibs bus, take a good look at it. It may be one of the last times you see that yellow and orange carriage.<br><br>The name Trans-Island Bus, or Tibs, will be dropped soon. Train operator SMRT Corp, Tibs' parent company, will replace it with its own name and its corporate colours of red, black and grey, completing its 2001 takeover.<br><br>Tibs was started by sportsman-entrepreneur Ng Ser Miang in 1982, soon after the Government said it wanted a competitor for giant SBS.<br><br>It started operations in 1983 with 37 buses plying two services in Yishun and Sembawang. It was a David muscling in on Goliath then, with the company eking out an early existence in cargo containers-turned-offices.<br><br>Growth came from the expansion of new Housing Board towns as well as transfers of SBS routes.<br><br>In 1987, Tibs was publicly listed. When it became part of SMRT, it had about 70 routes, about one-third of SBS'.<br><br>The 'merger' followed a call from the Government for transport operators to be 'multi-modal', so as to provide seamless travel.<br><br>But SMRT chief executive Saw Phaik Hwa said the merger might not have been totally necessary.<br><br>At the time of union, though, former SMRT chairman Chew Choon Seng said it was to 'facilitate the meshing of bus and train services, shorten overall travel time, encourage usage of public transport and enhance revenue growth'.<br><br>Ms Saw told The Straits Times: 'Logistically, a totally seamless transport system doesn't work... Each time the train comes, it's 1,000-over people getting off. You can't have buses waiting for 1,000-over people. They'd jam up the whole bus stop.'<br><br>Realistically, the scenario would be 'get off, wait a few minutes, and get on'.<br><br>'That is the model,' she said. 'So being one company or being two companies really doesn't have any material effects.'<br><br>So why did SMRT pay $194 million for Tibs?<br><br>'I don't know the full rationale behind the acquisition. My priority is now to maximise the situation,' Ms Saw said, explaining that her task is to optimise synergy between the two companies.<br><br>And she is pleased that two years after taking over Tibs, integration with SMRT has finally taken place.<br><br>Backroom operations, such as finance, human resource and information technology, have all been merged.<br><br>The final piece to be put in place is the name change, which will affect about 800 Tibs buses and more than 2,000 taxis.<br><br>But Ms Saw said the change would be done gradually and cost-effectively.<br><br>From Straits Times Interactive (<a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, there is a 5% possibility that SMRT has actually merged with SBS Transit secretly. And when TIBS buses are repainted, it will be painted in the SBST livery. That would be cool ,huh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been a big fan and supporter of Tibs ever since i was young. Watching their buses pass by the roads of Singapore brings a smile on my face. Their bright and oustanding livery brings out a sense of friendliness and comfort when u're travelling onboard their buses. Of course, there were disappointments such as them losing the NEL contract and losing Sengkang and Punggol to SBS. In exchange, they gained Bt Batok and Choa Chu Kang, which i must say isn't such a bad thing as these two were towns were occupied and already swarming with bus services unlike in the case of Sengkang and Punggol, which were relatively new. I guess, there's a reason for everything that happens. Then, SMRT bought over them for a value of $194 million. Their once flowery uniforms have been replaced with that of a floral plain one instead. Very soon, their name will be changed. To me, it's like saying goodbye to a friend who has grown up with me all this while and suddenly, he's changing identities. What i want to say is that i will always miss Tibs and its old livery. TIBS- Trans Island Bus Services.<br><br>Goodbye, Tibs. May u have a prospective future with a new name, new uniform and a new parent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
