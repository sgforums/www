              <p>I dislike SMRT intensely.</p>
              <p>But SBST had quite a lot of such cases as well.</p>
              <p>In the most extreme case I knew of, 9844Z's right rear main wheel came COMPLETELY off at Woodlands Int. Bus was left tilted on the ramp.</p>

              <p>But to be honest, i wouldnt put the full blame on Smrt or its mechanics.</p>
              <p>Looking closely at the photo, its not the wheel nuts that came off, but the entire bolt that's connected to the axle is broken.</p>
              <p>Even preventive maintainence checks or first parades checks by mechanics or the sl can only detect loose wheel nuts, but not damaged/cracked bolts.</p>
              <p>But of course, there would be a reason why the bolts were damaged in the first place but its better not to jump to any conclusion.</p>

              <p>Thats true that their image will surely be affected, but anyone with some technical knowledge with axles and a little common sense would be able to figure out that its not the wheel nuts that came off, but the entire bolt which means more than just loose wheelnuts.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A former 
              SMRT bus driver was jailed Tuesday for six weeks and fined S$6,000 for a
               fatal hit-and-run accident along Woodlands Avenue 7 on 5 October last 
              year.<br> <br>Sixty-year-old Tan Joo Ngang was also disqualified from driving for five years.<br><br>He pleaded guilty to one charge of causing the death of a 73-year-old pedestrian through a negligent act. <br> <br>Tan
               was also found guilty of two more charges under the Road Traffic Act, 
              after he failed to stop and give assistance after the accident.<br><br>He
               was driving along Gambas Avenue towards Yishun Avenue 7 at about 4.30am
               on 5 October last year when he knocked down Bintat Hassan.<br> <br>Tan had failed to keep a proper lookout for Mr Bintat who was crossing the road at the time.<br> <br>The impact was so strong that Mr Bintat was flung 25 metres from the pedestrian crossing and died shortly after. <br> <br>Tan, who did not stop, made a U-turn at the next junction and drove back to the bus depot at Woodlands. <br> <br>Investigation revealed Tan later passed by the accident area while operating on another bus along the same route.<br> <br>He noticed the road was blocked and there were police around, but he continued driving.<br> <br>Tan was arrested at home the next day, about 20 hours after the incident.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>SMRT
               is taking disciplinary action against a bus driver who was ill but 
              continued to drive, potentially endangering the lives of 20 passengers 
              onboard bus service 857. <br><br>SMRT had received complaints from 
              passengers on the 58-year-old bus driver's conduct after the incident on
               Monday night, reported<em> Channel NewsAsia</em>.<br><br>Passengers who
               rode on the bus from Boon Keng Road to Yio Chu Kang had claimed that 
              they were hurt from the swinging motion of the bus.<br><br>According to 
              the transport operator, the bus driver had made an incorrect judgment 
              and continued to drive, instead of reporting to the bus Bus Operations 
              Control Center (BOCC).<br><br>It added that the driver should have 
              pulled the bus over immediately in a safe manner, and the BOCC will 
              arrange for another bus to the location for passengers to continue their
               journey.</p>

              <p><strong>Does the PTC not feel any obligation to respond?' </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MR RICHARD SEAH: 'It has been more than a month since it was reported that the Public Transport Council (PTC) penalised the two main bus operators ('SBS, SMRT fined over service'; Oct 22). There have been a few letters questioning how the PTC arrived at the sums of $700 for SBS Transit and $300 for SMRT, and how it expects such meagre penalties to spur higher standards. Yet the PTC has, to date, not uttered a word of explanation. Does the PTC, which represents the interests of the commuting public, not feel any obligation to respond to public views?</p>

              <p>Make commuters an offer they cannot refuse</p>
              <p>IT REMAINS to be seen if 30 new trains in four years will solve the commuting crunch ('30 new MRT trains on the way'; Tuesday).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not just about having more trains but enough trains to move commuters every two minutes at peak hours and at longer intervals during non-peak hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am also unconvinced by Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo's argument that parallel bus services are not feasible because of longer travelling times. </span></strong></p>

              <div class="backgroundStory">Once we take into account the time taken to reach MRT stations and catch a train, it may not be much quicker than taking a bus. Parallel bus services will at least offer commuters an alternative should the need arise.</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Commuters may opt for buses if parallel services are available and the same discount is offered before 7.45am on weekdays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regard to early morning rebates, I beg to differ on the feedback that commuters value their sleep more than what they have to pay. The tipping point is to offer enough of a discount that would act as an incentive for commuters to wake up earlier and save on commuting expenses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 30-cent discount before 7.45am is not enough. If train operators genuinely wish to ease the peak-hour crunch, they should offer something worth forgoing the extra sleeping time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One option is to offer half-price fares before 8.10am and a flat fare of 80 cents before 7.40am. Such incentives will encourage more commuters to forgo some sleep to catch value- for-money train rides to start the working day.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why Singapore having a minister of state for transport who draw high pay using her backside to think one?</span></p>

              <p>I dunno is it because ppl thinks they're getting educated, the basic prinicples of going off for work/ school early dun get into the mind.</p>
              <p>There can be accidents, rain and so on. So any harm of leaving early, getting early than getting to work/ school late?</p>
              <p>Everyone's going to school, to work at the same time unless we start staggering everything. This is something tat goes into the micro level.</p>

              <div class="article-body">
              <p>An elderly couple is complaining about an encounter with very poor service on the bus.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen, 75, and his wife, 73, were at Moulmein Road last Saturday on 26 November.</p>
              <p>There, they decided to take a bus to Orchard Road but Mrs Chen realised that she had forgotten to bring her senior citizen ez-link card.</p>
              <p>The couple had $1.10 on them, which was sufficient only for a bus ticket from Moulmein Road to Newton.</p>
              <p>The bus fare to Orchard Road is $1.50.</p>
              <p>The couple decided to board bus 124 anyway and make their way to Newton first.</p>
              <p>But after they boarded the bus, they decided to try their luck and asked the bus driver if they could get a discount to their bus fare and go directly to Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>The bus driver became very agitated and shouted at them, "Are you going to pay? If not, get off the bus! Otherwise I'll call the police!"</p>
              <p>But Mrs Chen had already put her money into the fare collection machine so they decided to take the bus anyway.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Chen was very unhappy with the bus driver's attitude and began to argue with the man.</p>
              <p>The commotion also startled the other passengers on the bus.</p>
              <p>Eventually, the couple decided to ignore the bus driver and went to get a seat, but the bus driver continued to scold them.</p>
              <p>Furious with the bus driver's poor attitude, the couple got off at the very next stop, where they walked to the front door of the bus and began to berate the driver again.</p>
              <p>This time, the bus driver ignored them and drove off.</p>
              <p>Still angry at how they were treated, Mr Chen tried to lodge a complaint about the driver's poor service attitude.</p>
              <p>But he got even more angry when he discovered that the complaint hotline for the bus company, SBS Transit, did not even work.</p>
              <p>He called the hotline countless times for his complaint, but the line was either engaged, or no one ever answered it.</p>
              <p>On the incident, Mr Chen feels that the bus driver could have shown some compassion towards elderly folk.</p>
              <p>The bus driver had shouted at them to get off the bus, even though they were only short of forty cents and it was raining heavily at the time.</p>
              <p>He is also very unhappy with the state of SBS Transit's complain hotline, which seemed more like a dummy number than a real avenue for feedback.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit says that it will be investigating this incident.</p>

              <div>
              <p>An elderly couple is complaining about an encounter with very
              poor service on the bus.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen, 75, and his wife, 73, were at Moulmein Road last
              Saturday on 26 November.</p>
              <p>There, they decided to take a bus to Orchard Road but Mrs Chen
              realised that she had forgotten to bring her senior citizen ez-link
              card.</p>
              <p>The couple had $1.10 on them, which was sufficient only for a
              bus ticket from Moulmein Road to Newton.</p>
              <p>The bus fare to Orchard Road is $1.50.</p>
              <p>The couple decided to board bus 124 anyway and make their way to
              Newton first.</p>
              <p>But after they boarded the bus, they decided to try their luck
              and asked the bus driver if they could get a discount to their bus
              fare and go directly to Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>The bus driver became very agitated and shouted at them, "Are
              you going to pay? If not, get off the bus! Otherwise I'll call the
              police!"</p>
              <p>But Mrs Chen had already put her money into the fare collection
              machine so they decided to take the bus anyway.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Chen was very unhappy with the bus driver's attitude
              and began to argue with the man.</p>
              <p>The commotion also startled the other passengers on the bus.</p>
              <p>Eventually, the couple decided to ignore the bus driver and went
              to get a seat, but the bus driver continued to scold them.</p>
              <p>Furious with the bus driver's poor attitude, the couple got off
              at the very next stop, where they walked to the front door of the
              bus and began to berate the driver again.</p>
              <p>This time, the bus driver ignored them and drove off.</p>
              <p>Still angry at how they were treated, Mr Chen tried to lodge a
              complaint about the driver's poor service attitude.</p>
              <p>But he got even more angry when he discovered that the complaint
              hotline for the bus company, SBS Transit, did not even work.</p>
              <p>He called the hotline countless times for his complaint, but the
              line was either engaged, or no one ever answered it.</p>
              <p>On the incident, Mr Chen feels that the bus driver could have
              shown some compassion towards elderly folk.</p>
              <p>The bus driver had shouted at them to get off the bus, even
              though they were only short of forty cents and it was raining
              heavily at the time.</p>
              <p>He is also very unhappy with the state of SBS Transit's complain
              hotline, which seemed more like a dummy number than a real avenue
              for feedback.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit says that it will be investigating this
              incident.</p>

              <p>Please read my post properly.   I did not mention about enjoy cash concession.    </p>

              <li>For point 1 I feel is ok.</li>
              <li>For point 2 (<em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Pemandu bas juga harus mempunyai...</span></em>) which Mr Rahman mentioned, I think that's too much for the role of bus driver.  He siao arh?    I think his head kuku liao to think that bus driver to have such a heavy responsibility.  If now he wants all bus driver to know all the roads, next, he will declare bus driver to know all the bus numbers to help all the passengers to go to any place also.</li>
              <li>For point 3 (<em><span style="color: #dc2292;">Pemandu bas awam diwajibkan tahu...</span></em>),  I think he is trying to insinuate that Singapore nowadays have a lot of Cheena China drivers who maybe cannot even hold 1 proper English conversation?   What do you think?</li>
