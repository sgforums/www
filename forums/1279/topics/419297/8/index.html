              <p>Just like you mentioned good aircon as one of the aspects you desire for your rides, there may be others who think that a quieter radiator is equally important as well. No doubt that SBST buses are generally well-maintained, it still needs to do something about the radiator problems plaguing the KUBs and CDGEs.</p>

              <p>Public clamour for <span id="lw_1324109272_0" class="yshortcuts">SMRT</span> CEO <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=131v5vn8q/EXP=1325341908/**http%3A//sg.search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp=Saw%2BPhaik%2BHwa%26fr=fp-today%26cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Saw Phaik Hwa</span></a> grew on Saturday when the third <span id="lw_1324109612_1" class="yshortcuts">train disruption</span> in the week hit the North-South MRT line in the morning.</p>
              <p>Just the day before, Saw said in a press briefing that no effort would be spared to stop a recurrence of the massive outage that hit the same line on Thursday evening and which affected an estimated 127,000 commuters.</p>
              <p>Petitions for her ouster circulated online and members of the public posted comments on social media sites and Yahoo! calling on her to resign.</p>
              <p>When asked about calls for her to step down on Friday, Saw said customers had the right to make judgments, and she would consider resigning if it was necessary.</p>
              <p>Yahoo! user CHAN said, "I feel that the <span id="lw_1324109272_1" class="yshortcuts">CEO</span> should step after so many breakdown. Saying sorry is not enough. A new leadership should be taking over from her, its time for her to resign."<br><br><span class="commentBody">On Facebook, user Erika Ng said in a comment on Yahoo! Singapore Newsroom's page, "The CEO said she will seriously consider resigning at the press conference yesterday. She can tender her resignation right now, need no consideration anymore</span>."</p>
              <p><span class="commentBody">Another user, Skyee Alfonso, said, "Didn't they check all tracks after the major disruption on Thursday? It show(s) that they haven't learn(t) their lessons."<br></span></p>

              <p><br> I do remember coming across screeching Mk 4s, albeit at a far lower

              the number of KUBs and CDGEs around far exceeds the Mk 4s.</p>

              <p>What about the Dennis Tridents? Every time they rumbled past it felt like a tank had just gone by. The American engines all have the same sound, whether it is Cummins (found in Tridents), CAT (used by many US trucks) or Detroit Diesel (used in SAF tanks).</p>

              <p>how about putting the ratio that Scania Buses has the most bus in SBS that is why more accidents happen?</p>
              <p>you cannot blame on Scania bus or the parts alone as the factor of accidents that happened.. with 70-80% of SBS Scania buses therefore it is reasonable that they have more accidents ratios.</p>
              <p>maybe we can wait till the time when Vovlo or Mercedes buses has more than Scania Bus and then compare the ratio of accidents. its vice-versa.</p>
              <p>Look at the MRT for example,</p>
              <p>4 MRT line, 3 of which is SMRT's and 1 is SBST. The breakdown ratios are simply too obvious for me to even further explain.</p>

              <p>How do you explain the high accident and spontaneous combustion rates of the Scania N113s in the mid-late 90s? At least 7 of them were written off under such circumstances.</p>

The experience is uncomfortable and, for some, nauseating.<br><br>While I am unsure if there is any engineering issue, the skills and attitudes of bus captains would be major factors. Improper control of the brakes and clutch would lead to a jerky ride. Sudden braking could compromise commuter safety, as we have just seen.</span>" <br><br>Most of the rides are jerky...K230UB?</p>
