              <h1 class="storyheadline">New routes for buses</h1>
              <p>FOUR bus services will be re-routed in the coming weeks to stop along
               HDB blocks with elderly residents, an industrial estate, a hawker 
              centre and a hospital.</p>
              <p>But some commuters who used to take services 76, 315, 410 and 853 
              will find that their bus no longer stops at their street or will take 
              longer to get there.</p>
              <p>These changes are the first to be made by the Land Transport Authority in its new role as the planner of bus routes islandwide.</p>
              <p>Service 76, which runs between Yio Chu Kang Terminal and 
              Siglap Road, will make three new stops along Marine Crescent and Marine 
              Terrace, but skip nine existing ones.</p>
              <p>Service 315 will be re-routed to serve workers in Serangoon 
              North Industrial Estate, while service 410 will call at five new stops 
              to connect residents to Shunfu Mart, Sin Ming Plaza and Marymount MRT 
              station.</p>
              <p>Changes to these three services by SBS Transit will take 
              effect on Jan 30, and from Feb 13, Service 853, run by SMRT, will serve 
              two more bus stops near Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun.</p>

A single-deck, off-duty Service 74 bus was turning in his direction at the same time. He expected it to stop but it did not.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mr Li’s left foot was smashed. The sock he was wearing held the crushed bone and tissue together until paramedics arrived, he said. At the Changi General Hospital, he was told that he might lose all five toes. Eventually, three were amputated by Dec 12 last year. He has been in three hospitals since the incident, and does not know when he can be discharged. Speaking to my paper from his bed in an Ang Mo Kio community hospital yesterday, Mr Li, who earns $1,200 a month, said that his second and fourth toes are intact, but he can no longer move them.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">He is expected to be able to walk again using both feet, but must wear a special shoe fitted for his left foot. I will be walking with a permanent limp, said Mr Li, who now needs the help of a wheelchair to negotiate longer distances.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">A letter from the NSman’s doctor to the Singapore Armed Forces states that Mr Li has sustained fractures and extensive de-gloving injuries to his left foot. This means that the skin and subcutaneous tissue have been torn off in glove-like fashion.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">He has undergone five operations, with a plastic surgeon attaching to his wound a 20cm by 8cm skin graft taken from his left thigh, and a 20cm-long muscle flap from his back.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">When contacted, Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit’s corporate-communications senior vice-president, said the transport company has been assisting Mr Li with his medical and hospitalisation expenses.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">We are deeply sorry for the pain caused to Mr Li and his family, she said in an e-mail. When asked about compensation, she added: It is imperative that Mr Li quantifies the components of his claim. Due to a conflict of interest, we are not able to assist him in this regard.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">We have, however, suggested that he approach the Legal Aid Bureau for assistance in this matter. We will continue to assist him where possible. Mr Li, whose parents are divorced, lives in a two-room flat with his mother, a factory worker. His father is a lorry driver He hopes that SBS Transit will offer compensation of at least $500,000.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I have at least 40 more years ahead of me. How am I supposed to go on? My boss says I can go back to work any time, but even the thought of taking public transport to work is daunting, said the Institute of Technical Education graduate.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Source: MyPaper</span></p></div>

              <p><strong>Passenger spits, bus driver hits </strong></p>
              <p>A rowdy bus passenger was punched in the face by an angry bus driver. But before he was punched, the had allegedly acted in an abusive manner towards the SBS Transit bus driver while onboard the bus and afterwards.</p>
              <p>The two continued arguing after the bus had reached Bedok Bus Interchange. The driver lost his cool and punched him, after the man had failed to punch him in a few attempts.</p>
              <p>The incident, which took place at about 6pm on Thursday on route 225, drew a crowd of curious commuters and passer-bys.</p>
              <p>Witnesses said the passenger, who is in his 20s, was being difficult and had refused to leave the interchange after alighting from the bus.</p>
              <p>Madam G T Ng, 45, a saleswoman, said in Mandarin: "I saw the bus driver approach 3 of his colleagues for help. It seems like he was having problems with the passenger."</p>
              <p>When they returned, the passenger continued with his aggressive behaviour, she said, and there was an argument between both parties. The passenger then started swinging punches at the driver but missed.</p>
              <p>"He was egging him on," she said, adding that the last straw was when the passenger spat at the driver.</p>
              <p>"I think the driver just lost his temper and punched him at the face. The man fell to the ground and the driver punched him again two to three times."</p>
              <p>After hitting him, the driver left while the passenger was left bleeding from his nose.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Ms Tammy Tan, senior vice-president for coprorate communications at SBS Transit, said that the passenger did not have enough money on his ez-link card when he boarded bus service 225.</p>
              <p>She said: "He was not happy when asked to pay cash instead. He started scolding the bus captain and showed him offensive hand gestures."</p>
              <p>She said the passenger punched at the driver, who retaliated by punching him back.</p>
              <p>What happened next stunned people at the interchange. First, the injured man took off his white long-sleeved shirt and blue jeans. Clad only in a pair of boxers, he then kicked at a rubbish bin and tore down banners from their stands.</p>
              <p>A middle-aged man, who was watching the commotion, was almost hit in the face when the passenger swung at him with the back of his hand, said Mdm Ng.</p>
              <p>Shop attendant Sina Amid, 31, told TNP that she saw the man kicking the cash register at a shop selling CNY decorations. The cash register fell to the floor. He also started pacing up and down the bus interchange, looking angry and spewing expletives.</p>
              <p>The passenger's unusual behaviour continued for about 20 mins before he wear his clothes back and left in the direction of Bedok MRT station. Witnesses later saw him talking to policemen at Bedok Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Confirming the incident, a police spokesman said that a man in his 20s was takent to Changi General Hospital for treatment. The police are investigating. No arrests have been made.</p>
              <p>Said Ms Tan: " Despite having been provoked, we do not condone the retaliatory actions of our bus captain and will be taking disciplinary actions against him."</p>

              <p>STOMPer <strong>Michael</strong> fell off an SBS Transit bus when the

               Jan 18, at about 7.35am, the double-decker SBS Transit bus number 25 
              arrived at the bus-stop near my workplace in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3.<br><br>"I
               was the last person to alight, but before I could completely alight 
              from the bus, I could feel with my right leg that the bus was already 
              moving off, causing me to lose my balance and fall onto the pavement.<br><br>"The bus captain did not stop the bus to render assistance to me. <br><br>"I lay bloodied and injured on the pavement for a good 5 to 10 minutes before a kind lady and gentleman offered their help.<br><br>"As
               I was too dazed to take note of their names, I would like to take this 
              opportunity to thank them for their kind help and gesture! Greatly
