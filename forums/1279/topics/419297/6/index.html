They like to talks about history, people complaining in July cannot board the buses, they brought up their enhancement which was implemented in February, 5 month difference.

              <p>The glass screen in question seems to the be glass between the right door and the first 3 seats. Does it happen that she was leaning on the glass screen instead?</p>
              <p>Probably her weight broke the glass instead because if the glass broke naturally, more fragments would have landed on the seats which there's just a few now.</p>

              <div>
              <p>A glass screen in an SBS bus shattered violently this afternoon, sending shards of glass flying all over the place.</p>
              <p>The incident occurred on a double-decker bus 64 at 120pm. The bus was turning into Aljunied Road. Its license plate is SBS9233L.</p>
              <p>An inSing editor was sitting right next to the glass screen when she heard a loud crack. The next minute, the glass had shattered all over the place.</p>
              <p>It seemed like a scene from Final Destination - The movie where strange incidents lead to sudden deaths.</p>
              <p>Nothing had hit the glass earlier, so the screen had shattered for no apparent reason.</p>
              <p>It took a few seconds for the inSing editor to register what had happened. Some glass bits had cascaded all over her.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, apart from some mild scratches on her leg, she was fine.</p>
              <p>Commuters were shocked and asked if she was okay. A man advised her to change seats.</p>
              <p>The bus driver was seen making a phone call reporting the incident, asking SBS for assistance.</p>
              <p>Fearing for her life, the inSing editor alighted the bus shortly after. She managed to dig out the few remaining glass pieces stuck on her foot and limped home.</p>
              <p><strong>If public transport fares are set to rise, perhaps the operators can do more to ensure that buses are safe (and clean too) and hopefully, such freak accidents will not happen again</strong>.</p>

              <p>Hope it'll never get into news reports</p>
              <p>SMRT buses are waiting for accident to occur on raining days. The SLs are still braking as though it's a typical normal day, not slowing down n braking early. Common to see tyre locking up.</p>
              <p>Somemore travelling close to 80km/hr along PIE for a bendy bus on raining day + following so close behind people's car.</p>
              <p>Hopefully it'll never appear 'SMRT bus skidded at PIE due to slippery surface and suspected speeding'.</p>

              <p>Major problem come from the SL itself.Especially WL/AM ones.KJ ones seem quite okay as some of them are former SBS drivers from BBT/CCK/BPJ svc.The SL taking over duties from AM shift also dun bother to check body condition of the bus.I've seen AM 168 BC checking bus condition after taking over from AM BC @ WDL int b4</p>
