Of course, I like the routes alot. Service 169 is the first service to use 1178Y in my memory.<br><br>For services 858 and 969, they provided a fast link for me to the Eastern part of Singapore.<br><br>Service 962 is one of the services to bring me home, with my favourite TIB 1234 T!!<br><br>Service 168 has Volvo Super Olympians, with my favourite SBS 9846 T on it. My favourite part is the express sector between Tampines Ave 12 and Woodlands Ave 2.<br><br>Of course, I must agree that service 30 gives a wonderful view of the CBD from Benjamin Sheares Bridge.</div>

The terminal used to be a landmark but was isolated since the operation of W'lands Regional Interchange. Since then, this town became liveless and businesses suffered greatly. The same applied to Marsiling Terminal; esp those coffeeshops next to the terminal.<br><br>Many M'sians and Sporeans used to shop around these vicinities, and with the closing of W'lands Checkpoint terminal, the businesses and hawker centres there are going to be further hit, as more passengers bypass the town; as they now wait for buses along W'lands Ctr Rd...</span></div></blockquote>I believe Marsiling Terminal was not too far away from Old Woodlands Terminal, isn't it? Yes, the place really became a ghost town once WRI opened for business.</div>

It more or less travel uninterrupted between Yishun and Bukit Panjang. Try riding on a Sunday morning and you can enjoy a nice relaxing ride along Mandai Rd / Ave. There's lush greeneries and you can even get a glimpse of Seletar Reservoir. Sv. 138 is nice too.<br><br>Sv. 30 is the only one that travels the whole stretch of Benjamin Sheares Bridge. Get a SuperBus and sit on top, first row for a spectacular view of the Singapore City skyline or the Singapore Harbour. Look down and you'll see just how high up you are, which you don't realise when travelling in a car.<br><br></div>

Sv. 188 was also introduced in 1988 but a couple of months earlier than 99. It ran between Jurong Interchange and Jurong West St 91. The last of the Merc O306 buses were used on this service. When the O306 retired, NZMB Merc OF1417 were the main buses.<br><br>When Jurong Interchange was demolished in 1990, sv. 188 ended at Jurong Bus Park (recently demolished), which was just beside the old interchange. Sv. 188 was one of the first to have validators installed. I recalled that a minister took sv. 188 from Lakeside Station at the official launch of the farecard system.<br><br>Sv. 188 was finally withdrawn in 1992 due to poor demand.</div>

My favourite service is Tibs Svc 184A. It is very special to me as this bendy bus goes into Ngee Ann Polytechnic campus. The drama of Svc 184A wowed me with 90 angle bending! And even can be able to turn right to the bus bay where Svc 74A parked outside Blk 73. Cool... However, Service 184A is gone after 17 March 2003  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>
