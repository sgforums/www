              <p>Okay everyone. Today had my first OC500LE ride on S854 SMB9L 2.30pm trip from Bedok Int.<br><br>interior-wise, nice, clean, pleasing 3-colour tone with red/black and grey aircon ducts. Aircon also strong. so everything good.<br><br>the ride started fine. the female SL was very careful with the bus but i dont have complaints about that. she gave herself a very long braking distance and wide clearances too entering/exiting bus stops. reach SBST HG depot, S854 behind, a MB0405 caught up and overtake the OC500LE.<br><br>it clearly wasnt as jerky as the scania k230ub. even the 3rd batch of scanias jerk more than the OC500LE. so plus points for the merc.<br><br>to say the truth, this is not yet the time to talk abt the optimal performance of the bus as the SLs are still very cautious when they drive the OC500LE. maybe we've to give it a few more months. then they'll start to be more aggressive with their driving lol.<br><br>ride back to the east was a Scania K230UB on S39. obviously, the difference could be felt in the short span of time and my vote goes to the OC500LE. for fast rides on Scanias, one can try S27 late at night. 2nd last bus would be good(last bus must follow timetable mah).<br><br>to conclude, if you still havent ride it, take it! reading mine and other people's long comments are not similar to the personal experience you'll get. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Expected service 854 will get Merc OC500LEs one day, based on its route popularity.</p>
              <p>Unlike SBST's practice which will have only selected bus services to have Scania K230UB deployments. SMRT deploys its new OC500LEs as normal cameo buses on its different bus routes (except WLDEP which has none).</p>

              <p>where are the <strong>next stop annoucnements</strong>?!these are the most important  announcements needed in a  bus but yet its not annoucned? <br>Also the nice LED PIDS screen showing next stop locations  found on other SMRTbuses are not in the new buses?

              <p><br>No lah, as long as you don't look suspicious they wouldn't care. :P</p>
              <p>Have been viewing the rosters for many months already, sometimes even SLs chat with me about the roster.</p>
              <p>The whole system under SMRT is that the drivers follow this timesheet system called (Block + 1). They do so every Sunday, say if Saturday drives block 10, Sunday drives block 11. They do so until reaching the highest block number, then go back to block 01.</p>

              <p>where are the <strong>next stop annoucnements</strong>?!these are the most important  announcements needed in a  bus but yet its not annoucned?<br>Also the nice LED PIDS screen showing next stop locations  found on other SMRTbuses are not in the new buses? I like the screens as they tell me the next  stop by flashing it. i used it the other day and did not get lost while taking 975 in CCK to a certain block 464.</p>

              <p><br>I'm also wondering why they never fit them before putting it to revenue service? at least, fit the LED boxes first so that the depot guys can tweak it when maintanience.</p>
              <p>They may really use it in conjunction with the voice announcements. That time i took the SGH shuttle (by SMRT's premium bus service), got next stop announcement saying "Next Stop : National Heart Centre." Follow HK Style =/</p>

              <p>Okay everyone. Today had my first OC500LE ride on S854 SMB9L 2.30pm trip from Bedok Int.<br><br>interior-wise, nice, clean, pleasing 3-colour tone with red/black and grey aircon ducts. Aircon also strong. so everything good.<br><br>the ride started fine. the female SL was very careful with the bus but i dont have complaints about that. she gave herself a very long braking distance and wide clearances too entering/exiting bus stops. reach SBST HG depot, S854 behind, a MB0405 caught up and overtake the OC500LE.<br><br>it clearly wasnt as jerky as the scania k230ub. even the 3rd batch of scanias jerk more than the OC500LE. so plus points for the merc.<br><br>to say the truth, this is not yet the time to talk abt the optimal performance of the bus as the SLs are still very cautious when they drive the OC500LE. maybe we've to give it a few more months. then they'll start to be more aggressive with their driving lol.<br><br>ride back to the east was a Scania K230UB on S39. obviously, the difference could be felt in the short span of time and my vote goes to the OC500LE. for fast rides on Scanias, one can try S27 late at night. 2nd last bus would be good(last bus must follow timetable mah).<br><br>to conclude, if you still havent ride it, take it! reading mine and other people's long comments are not similar to the personal experience you'll get. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
