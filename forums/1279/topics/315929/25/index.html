              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Would just like to add on to some of the points raised by SBS9816E.</p>
              <p>I hope you guys have not forgotten what is the primary purpose of a bus - i.e. a mode of transport to bring passengers to work and back home.  Thus, I do hope that when spotting buses (in particular, new buses and rare cameos) during the peak periods, please spare a thought for the genuine commuters on the bus. </p>
              <p>A few simple pointers I felt we should observe, which forms the very basic of commuting etiquette that everybody should be observing:<br>- Refrain from talking to the driver.  Doing so not only distracts him and poses a safety hazard to other commuters, you are also affecting the smooth boarding of passengers through the aisles during peak hours.<br>- Don't cluster around in large groups in the bus, in the front area, or hog too many seats as a group (particularly if you are taking the full route from end to end).  Spare a thought for other commuters who need those seats or who need to move through the bus.<br>- Refrain from talking or commenting too loudly.  Spare a thought for others, both for the genuine commuters who want a quiet ride, as well as other fellow bus fans who many want to listen closely to the engine and other sounds of the bus.<br>- Refrain from too many distractive and unnatural actions that may affect the bus commute, such as taking pictures, walking up and down the bus examining the parts, etc.</p>
              <p>I understand that when it comes to the first day service of a new bus, or extremely rare split-shift cameos, and given how easy it is for timings to be communicated to everyone, large groups of bus enthusiasts will descend on the bus at the same time.  Naturally, everybody gets excited over the bus.  But please bear in mind that the bus is still there to serve its purpose, particularly so during peak hours. </p>
              <p>I hope everyone of you would be more mindful of these pointers the next time you spot a bus.  As bus enthusiasts, we have the duty to be the role models of bus commuters and help make the journey a better one for all.</p>

              <p>I just want to close this on a final note...</p>
              <p>Regards to the incident, Tintinspartan, you are the one who talked loudly at the back and this had caused unhappiness to some passengers onboard during the said day and time.  Not only that you also have incur the wrath of some folks in this forum, including the moderator, SBS9816E.</p>
              <p>Personally, if I am onboard the bus, I would have straightaway flash my staff pass and will ask you to lower down your volume, even if another fellow passenger did not voice out his anger.  This will not only cause distraction to the Service Leader who will disrupt his journey and will call BOCC at the press of the TALK button on the IDFC and you will find yourself in unnecessary trouble. I am sure you don't want that to happen, do you?</p>
              <p>And one thing I would like to emphasize, do NOT stand at the driver cabin and engage in unnecessary conversation with the Service Leader as this is considered a breach of traffic safety regulations. I am not stopping you bus fans from talking to the Service Leaders or BCs, but please do so when he is not driving i.e. during layover breaks at interchange/terminals.</p>
              <p>I hope I have make myself clear to all of you guys in the forum, like it or not, I must stress this to all.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>If you're wrong, you apologise. Simple as that. Don't have to think. But make sure you do not repeat the mistake. Your credibility will only go south if you keep repeating your mistakes.</p>
              <p>I'm bemused when you say you can't do anything about your voice. Yes you can't change it, but you can, obviously, adjust the volume. You always do that in school. Adjust it whenever necessary.</p>
              <p>Let this be a lesson that will change your attitude and behaviour. You don't wanna live your life as a bus fan who is hated and despised by his comrades, do you?</p>

              <p>I don't think there was any single person at fault in this issue...  Tintinspartan should not be feeling guilty about this, neither should anybody else feel good about himself and point fingers at tintin, because it is possible for any one of us, myself included to behave in such ways.</p>
              <p>What I would like to emphasise though, is that everybody should be more mindful of how our actions may implicate others, either directly as a form of inconvenience or nuisance towards staff and the commuting public, or indirectly through portraying a negative image of us. Talking loudly is but one of the acts we have to be mindful of, there are many others which I'm quite sure everybody is guilty of at least a few. Think about it.</p>
              <p>Neither am I suggesting that some of us should just abstain from taking the bus on the first day, and let "some other people" ruin the ride. That won't solve the problem. Instead, we can constantly remind each other to watch out or refrain from doing inconsiderate acts. Where individual self-discipline fails, the rest of the group can step in to help.</p>
              <p>I'm quite sure that with the right amount of etiquette and self-awareness, it is still possible for us to "pong" the bus as a big group, enjoy the journey with other commuters, and reserve our excitement and chatter for the dinner table and/or coffee outlet afterwards. That'll be a much more enjoyable outcome for such outings, and I hope to see more of that.</p>
              <p>Did you know that it is against the law in several countries for passengers to talk to the bus captain while he is driving? In Hong Kong, there is a yellow line drawn across the front aisle and passengers must remain behind it when the bus is in motion. As 877M has emphasised, I hope you guys do realise there is a safety implication. (Some of the more "senior" ones around here are guilty of this too.. you know it yourselves).</p>
              <p>Lastly, may I suggest that in order not to attract too much attention to the fact that we are bus fans, perhaps we can cut down on actions such as photo-taking or inspecting the various parts of the bus during the journey.</p>
              <p>I'm sure with MSN and internet, we don't need the whole crowd of us taking turns or lining up to take the identical same shots at the same place, which sometimes holds up the bus even if it is at its layover point.</p>
              <p>That's a lot that I have said... I do hope you guys would put some thought into it, and think about how others are viewing you before thinking about yourself. That's all.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Kai Guan</p>

              <p>I just want to close this on a final note...</p>
              <p>Regards to the incident, Tintinspartan, you are the one who
              talked loudly at the back and this had caused unhappiness to some
              passengers onboard during the said day and time.  Not only
              that you also have incur the wrath of some folks in this forum,
              including the moderator, SBS9816E.</p>
              <p>Personally, if I am onboard the bus, I would have straightaway
              flash my staff pass and will ask you to lower down your volume,
              even if another fellow passenger did not voice out his anger. 
              This will not only cause distraction to the Service Leader who will
              disrupt his journey and will call BOCC at the press of the TALK
              button on the IDFC and you will find yourself in
              unnecessary trouble. I am sure you don't want that to happen,
              do you?</p>
              <p>And one thing I would like to emphasize, do NOT stand at the
              driver cabin and engage in unnecessary conversation with the
              Service Leader as this is considered a breach of traffic safety
              regulations. I am not stopping you bus fans from talking to the
              Service Leaders or BCs, but please do so when he is not driving
              i.e. during layover breaks at interchange/terminals.</p>
              <p>I hope I have make myself clear to all of you guys in the forum,
              like it or not, I must stress this to all.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Oh come on. Surely it takes more than one person to cause a commotion. You know, as they say it takes two hand to clap.</p>
              <p>Okay, no offence but how does talking loudly on the bus gets one into trouble? I think there are no rules and regulations that do not permit talking loudly. After all, SL's are expected to be able to drive in a noisy bus. It is just basic social ettiquite to talk softly.</p>
              <p>Yes, got to agree with you that safety is the priority when on the roads.</p>
