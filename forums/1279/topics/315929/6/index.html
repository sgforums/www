              <p>I don't get it when people keep saying that this body is a
              Gemilang copy xxx or a Gemilang copy yyy.  "Copy" is a very
              sensitive word to use and can involve huge lawsuits and lots of
              money if a company is really found to be infringing on another's
              copyright designs.</p>
              <p>While the SBST K230, MAN 18.240 and this O500LE from SMRT are
              all bodied by Gemilang, each one of them sport a front design that
              has been customised in consultation with their respective chassis
              makers.  As a self-respecting company in its own right,
              Scania, MAN and Mercedes Benz would all want to promote their
              products, and what better way than to have the local bodywork of
              the buses designed in accordance to what they have elsewhere. 
              This is part of their brand-building so as to achieve a consistent
              image in their vehicles sold. </p>
              <p>So we see a Gemilang with an Omnicity design requested by Scania
              for the K230s, one with a Lion City design specified by MAN for the
              18.240, and a Citaro-lookalike specified by Mercedes Benz for the
              O500LE.</p>
              <p>"Copy" is just soooo... the wrong word to use in this
              instance.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>in regards to this matter, it is best then to refer to the bodywork as gemilang Lion's City, gemilang Omnicity or gemilang Citaro so as to reflect the status of the bodywork styles.</p>
              <p>by using the above nomeculture, u will reflect that the bus design itself will refer to a particular model of bus. DO NOT add the word copy when saying the above names.</p>
              <p>so from now on when we say gemialng Lion;s City, there is NO NEED to continue on by saying it is a MAN bus. in the same way when u say Lion;s City, u will know the bus is a MAN and not other bus models.</p>
              <p>=).<br><br>Still i am not too happy with the use of gemilang Omnicity in Auastralia for a certain batch of China buses. the bodywork was exclusive for Scania buses...and should be exclusive for the Scania range of products.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p><br>More information on the engine: it is a Mercedes-Benz model OM 457 hLA Euro 5/EEV 11.967-litre, inline 6-cylinder turbocharged, intercooled engine with SCR exhaust aftertreatment.  Power is 220kW (299 PS) @ 2000rpm and torque is 1250Nm (922 lb-ft) @ 1100rpm which is significantly greater than the Scania K230UB.  Gearbox can be either a ZF 6HP 592C or Voith D864.3E, whichever the operator has specified.  The axles are Mercedes-Benz products, as opposed to ZF axles used on the CItaros in Europe.  The rear axle is a low-noise single-ratio hypoid axle as opposed to a traditional spiral bevel hub reduction axle.</p>

                              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p><br>
              More information on the engine: it is a Mercedes-Benz model OM 457
              hLA Euro 5/EEV 11.967-litre, inline 6-cylinder turbocharged,
              intercooled engine with SCR exhaust aftertreatment.  Power is
              220kW (299 PS) @ 2000rpm and torque is 1250Nm (922 lb-ft) @ 1100rpm
              which is significantly greater than the Scania K230UB. 
              Gearbox can be either a ZF 6HP 592C or Voith D864.3E, whichever the
              operator has specified.  The axles are Mercedes-Benz products,
              as opposed to ZF axles used on the CItaros in Europe.  The
              rear axle is a low-noise single-ratio hypoid axle as opposed to a
              traditional spiral bevel hub reduction axle.</p>

              <p>No, the ZF Ecolife has not been homogolated with the Mercedes-Benz OM 457 hLA / M 447 hLAG engines.  At this stage there doesn't seem to be a timeframe for homogolation of the ZF Ecolife (or even ZF Ecomat 4) or the Voith DIWA.5 with the Mercedes-Benz engines unfortunately, so Ecomat 2 will have to do for now.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p>It is pointless for a company to install an announcement system and use it only for 2.5 hours each day. I'm pretty sure the announcements will be made appropriately. You need to spare a thought for passengers who are visually impaired too. I find your thought a little selfish.</p>

              <p><br> Are you trying to say that the visually impaired cannot take the
                  bus if the annoucement system breaks down one day? Then how do our
                  visually impared passengers take the bus now without annoucements?
                  We're all used to not having any annoucements on buses. I believe
                  the visually impared passengers who take the bus will be
                  familiar with the route or have a service guide with them. On
                  a side note, I think the annoucement system came with the bus
                  itself.</p>

              <p>as a bus service provider, u provide bus service to anybody that includes the blind. a audio PIS is necessary these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PIS = passenger info system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also the audio PIS is useful to those who do not know the route. <br><br>and FYi i AM visiually impaired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok true the visually impaired will be able to sort of feel where he is at certain points of the route. of course the sense of inertia and momentum can tell him when the bus turn left and right so he cna track the route. still ahving the audio annoucnement will greatly help him/her adjust to the route n know where he/she is<br><br>also the sens of smell and sound will also be able to catch certain key locations. for example passing by chaintwon mrt one cna hear loads of people baording the bus and alighting. this can tell him/her is one of those main-sih bus stops. f course with audio announcmenet cna confirm lor.</p>
