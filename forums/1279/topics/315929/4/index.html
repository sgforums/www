              <p>SMRT will roll out the first Euro V bus in South-east Asia by the middle of next month as part of its drive to go green.</p>
              <p>Another 66 Euro V buses will replace part of the SMRT's fleet between August and December this year.</p>
              <p>Currently, authorities here have only set the guideline for 40 per cent of buses here to be Euro IV compliant by 2010.</p>
              <p>Euro V buses emit even less greenhouse gases than their Euro IV counterparts.</p>
              <p>SMRT will also bring in 200 taxis which will run on compressed
                      natural gas (CNG) and 100 taxis which will meet the Euro IV emission
                      standards by mid-year.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Community
                      Development, Youth and Sports and Transport, announced these details at
                      the launch of 'SMRT is Green' event on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>He said the transport sector is a major contributor of greenhouse
                      gases, accounting for 19 per cent of Singapore's total carbon dioxide
                      emissions.</p>
              <p>To ensure that the city remains liveable, Singapore has to
                      make a decisive shift to make its transport sector as 'green' as
                      possible.</p>
              <p>'Public transport is by far the most energy-efficient means
                      to move people, and contributes the least to traffic congestion and to
                      air pollution,' said Mr Teo.</p>
              <p>'For example, a single-deck bus can transport about 80
                      passengers at any one time, whereas the average occupancy of our cars
                      is only about 1.5 persons per car.</p>
              <p>'Taking the bus or train is far better for the environment than driving a fuel-efficient car.'</p>
              <p>He added that the target of raising public transport's share to
                      70 per cent of morning peak-hour journeys, announced in the
                      recently-launched Land Transport Masterplan, is also an environmental
                      goal.</p>
              <p>He urged more Singaporeans to shift to public transport and do their bit to protect the environment.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">SMRT introduces new ’green’ Euro V bus</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : SMRT has introduced the new Euro V bus to join its fleet of
              buses, in a move that marks the transport company’s latest initiative
              to go green.</p>
              <p>The new bus, which produces less pollutants, was launched by Senior
              Parliamentary Secretary for the Transport Ministry Teo Ser Luck on
              Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The Euro V bus is the first of its kind in the region
              and will be plying on Singapore’s roads from May 14. This model
              produces 42 percent less nitrous oxide pollutants than its predecessor
              — the Euro IV.</p>
              <p>SMRT said it has bought 66 Euro V buses to replace
              its old fleet, and the new busses will be rolled out between August and
              December this year.</p>
              <p>The Euro V bus costs about S$300,000 and SMRT expects to reap greater financial rewards by going green.</p>
              <p>"Going
              green is not something (we should do)... generations later, (after)
              something goes wrong... Even when we choose Euro IV for our vehicles
              and CNG (compressed natural gas) for our taxi drivers, (these will
              help) save on energy costs. So there is a business case for them. We
              hope that by making these choices, which is good for the environment,
              it will also be good for them," said SMRT’s CEO Saw Phaik Hwa.</p>
              <p>That is why SMRT will be buying an additional 130 Euro V buses in the next two years .</p>
              <p>The
              company will also add 300 new environmentally—friendly taxis to its
              fleet later this year. These include 200 that use compressed natural
              gas (CNG), and 100 taxis that meet the Euro IV standards.</p>
              <p>Also
              going green is Singapore’s other big transport provider, ComfortDelGro,
              which launched the country’s first Euro IV buses in November 2007.
              ComfortDelGro has converted 2,600 of its taxis with engines that emit
              less pollution. — CNA /ls</p>

              <p>To be precise,</p>
              <p>ST/LHWB states 67 buses, CNA quotes 66 by end year and another 130 within next 2 years.</p>
              <p>I seriously wonder what's the problem with our local reporters when it comes to public transport. Always full of errors. SBST put SMRT and vice versa.</p>

              <p>- Interior configuration: Aircon duct &amp; panelling design follows that of SBST Scania K230, MINUS the eyeball outlets.  Outlets are replaced with Habit-style.</p>
              <p>- Seating: has 4 more seats over the K230.  Centre exit is shifted forward, 4-seater bench-seats in the low-floor area converted to front-facing, slightly tighter legroom in the rear seats allowing for an additional row to be placed in (seven rows instead of six, including the last row)</p>

              <p>- On board voice annoucement/PA system using computerised voice (Welcome on board SMRT, please move to the rear, etc) or though BC speaking into mic</p>
              <p>- The same door closing annoucement used on trains is played as the door closing chime</p>
