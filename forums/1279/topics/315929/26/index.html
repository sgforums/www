              <p>I think SMRT should just openly annouce the timings for SMB1H if they are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong> intrested to promote this bus to the public.</p>

              <p>C'mon, it's just another bus; there'll be more of them sooner or later. It's not as if promoting SMB1H extensively is going to rake in more profits for them right? Imagine the chaos at New Bridge Rd or CCK if SMRT were to make the timings known, since many people would want to board it.</p>

              <p><br>I remember TIBS also had this tradition of bodying their buses overseas before shipping here for better quality vehicles. Seems that the tradition still sticks with SMRT.</p>
              <p>Was wondering why SMRT couldn't ask to have bodied up more units before launching say, the first 20 buses on the first day? This way, they can make a little bit more impact to the frequency on the first day of their service.</p>
              <p>Trivia - Imagine in about 20 more years, the TIB rego will really walk into history with the retirement of the hispano habits and TIBS will really be a memory. By that time, SMRT Buses should have a full WAB fleet or something. :(</p>

              <p>REVIEW  of the bus</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>I chance upon a ride in the all new SMb1H , a mercedes benz OC500LE of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I already had a preview of the bus on my Campus grounds on 28 apr 2008 (NUS). Already noted some extra features (no ride then)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the wheellchair user will have seatbelts for xtra safety. this feature CAN ONLY be found in Hong Kong buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the door closing chime might get irritating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the pls move to the rear announcement is cute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of ride comfort, i chose a outer seat on my first ride. someone feedback to me that a inner seat ride will not be so good. I also tried a inner seat ride few days ago. i found the feedback to be true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also at the rear, there is no jutting out wheel curve, so ur leg dun feel chui after a long ride in an awkward postion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i will cocnentrate on the ride i had in a outer seat at rear middle.  the bus is soft. (dun sit at rearmost seats!), engine sounds like a Hino crossed with a Scania L113. however posesses much of a australian OC500LE sound as well. the retarding -final stage- ZF whine is very nice to my ears.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still find that the bus revving engine like mad when we slow down. it is bit rather irritating. much like how i found it irritating whilst on TP1854.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when the bus managed to shift to 5th gear, we can hear a sort of a hub reduction sound. very in line with any Zf 6 speed bus. However what stunned me the most was when the bus hit the 6th gear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>at 6th gear, IF you sit in a outer seat at the rear middle, u get this floating sensation. this is attributed to the engine coming down to a very low revolution rate, coupled with a superior suspension, u literally feel like you are floating on BKE. upon exiting form 6th gar, the bus does not have a pronnouned cat-call. this floating sensation CANNOT be found in any citybus in Singapore perhaps except TIb840 when u sit in front. floating sensation an be easily felt in good suspension scania coaches of the SJE Scania L113 (sit in front)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the very loud whine ptiching before exiting form 6th gar rminds us that other units may have potential to have cat calls. i look forward to rides on other units when they come out. just for the floating sensations.</p>

              <p>CAT CALLS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some buses are tuned/the gears r such that no cat call . many of the scanias i took dun catcall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why do i have this fascination with cat calls? it has to do with a cat mewing on a SBS8057 ride i had on 123 once long ago. i thought, hey we have a stowaway cat on bus..i look around..erm no kitten or cat  leh... then it hit me..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THAT WAS THE CAT CALL as told to me by many Austrlian bus fans. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from then on, i loved the cat calls, just because they make the sound of a lovely cat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>note that cat calls can also be made when a bus shift from 2nd to thrid in certain situations. but commonly, before a cat call, u are in 6th gear, u hear a high pitch whine building up , it reaches a very high pitch. when the bus finally starts to engage slow down gear, a cat call is produced.</p>
