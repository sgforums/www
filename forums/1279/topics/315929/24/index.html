              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Occurences on
              SMB 1 H (01 July 2008, 1830 hours)</span></strong></p>
              <p>I was onboard SMB 1 H on its trip travelling towards Choa Chu
              Kang. I was observing things around, and to my horrid, I have
              found out something, and it has also been identified by the
              commuters onboard as well.</p>
              <p>A bus fan feedbacked to me that a couple of passengers telling
              him this:<br> <br> Pax 1: "Hey, are you part of the group? Are you able to get them to
              <em><strong>shut up?</strong> It's getting onto my
              nerve!!!</em></p>
              <p>Pax 2: "It has been a stressful day for me! I've been slogging
              for the whole day and I wanted a peaceful ride on it. Hear the
              noises coming from the back of the bus! It's f***ing irritating!
              <strong>CAN I HAVE SOME PEACE</strong>?!"</p>
              <p>THIS, has become a rising concern with this <strong>handful of
              bus fan</strong> who have been <strong>seating at the rear</strong> of the bus to become much 'outstanding' in the sense that they have
              been interrupting the peace, or even sleep for some of these poor
              working people.</p>
              <p>WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE <strong>SITUATION AWARENESS</strong> OF
              BUS FANS?! IS THIS A SIGN THAT FOR SOME THAT IT HAS
              <strong>WEAKENED</strong>?!</p>
              <p>Upon knowing that, I was <strong>furiously ashamed</strong> with
              their wrongdoings. Isn't it a basic courtesy that one <strong>MUST
              NOT</strong> have loud conversation on buses?</p>
              <p>Yes... it has been an exciting day for some of us to be boarding
              it, but does it have to <strong>AMPLIFIED</strong> and becomes a
              form of inconvenience to others? And how much impact has this
              handful of people created and have never feel ashamed with their
              inconsiderate actions??!!</p>
              <p>I hope that this <strong>handful of them</strong> who have

              again. Not only that it brings us shame, the bad image portrayed to
              other commuters would be magnified as well!</p>
              <p>As a bus enthusiast, I hope that all of us should carry out the
              right disposition onboard, as well as to have the right moral
              values and considerate acts while onboard.</p>
              <p>Again, I hope that this incident would <strong>never</strong> be

              <p>Would just like to add on to some of the points raised by SBS9816E.</p>
              <p>I hope you guys have not forgotten what is the primary purpose of a bus - i.e. a mode of transport to bring passengers to work and back home.  Thus, I do hope that when spotting buses (in particular, new buses and rare cameos) during the peak periods, please spare a thought for the genuine commuters on the bus. </p>
              <p>A few simple pointers I felt we should observe, which forms the very basic of commuting etiquette that everybody should be observing: <br>- Refrain from talking to the driver.  Doing so not only distracts him and poses a safety hazard to other commuters, you are also affecting the smooth boarding of passengers through the aisles during peak hours. <br>- Don't cluster around in large groups in the bus, in the front area, or hog too many seats as a group (particularly if you are taking the full route from end to end).  Spare a thought for other commuters who need those seats or who need to move through the bus. <br>- Refrain from talking or commenting too loudly.  Spare a thought for others, both for the genuine commuters who want a quiet ride, as well as other fellow bus fans who many want to listen closely to the engine and other sounds of the bus. <br>- Refrain from too many distractive and unnatural actions that may affect the bus commute, such as taking pictures, walking up and down the bus examining the parts, etc.</p>
              <p>I understand that when it comes to the first day service of a new bus, or extremely rare split-shift cameos, and given how easy it is for timings to be communicated to everyone, large groups of bus enthusiasts will descend on the bus at the same time.  Naturally, everybody gets excited over the bus.  But please bear in mind that the bus is still there to serve its purpose, particularly so during peak hours. </p>
              <p>I hope everyone of you would be more mindful of these pointers the next time you spot a bus.  As bus enthusiasts, we have the duty to be the role models of bus commuters and help make the journey a better one for all.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Would just like to add on to some of the points raised by SBS9816E.</p>
              <p>I hope you guys have not forgotten what is the primary purpose of a bus - i.e. a mode of transport to bring passengers to work and back home.  Thus, I do hope that when spotting buses (in particular, new buses and rare cameos) during the peak periods, please spare a thought for the genuine commuters on the bus. </p>
              <p>A few simple pointers I felt we should observe, which forms the very basic of commuting etiquette that everybody should be observing:<br>- Refrain from talking to the driver.  Doing so not only distracts him and poses a safety hazard to other commuters, you are also affecting the smooth boarding of passengers through the aisles during peak hours.<br>- Don't cluster around in large groups in the bus, in the front area, or hog too many seats as a group (particularly if you are taking the full route from end to end).  Spare a thought for other commuters who need those seats or who need to move through the bus.<br>- Refrain from talking or commenting too loudly.  Spare a thought for others, both for the genuine commuters who want a quiet ride, as well as other fellow bus fans who many want to listen closely to the engine and other sounds of the bus.<br>- Refrain from too many distractive and unnatural actions that may affect the bus commute, such as taking pictures, walking up and down the bus examining the parts, etc.</p>
              <p>I understand that when it comes to the first day service of a new bus, or extremely rare split-shift cameos, and given how easy it is for timings to be communicated to everyone, large groups of bus enthusiasts will descend on the bus at the same time.  Naturally, everybody gets excited over the bus.  But please bear in mind that the bus is still there to serve its purpose, particularly so during peak hours. </p>
              <p>I hope everyone of you would be more mindful of these pointers the next time you spot a bus.  As bus enthusiasts, we have the duty to be the role models of bus commuters and help make the journey a better one for all.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Agreed with you and 9816E. That's why I never like hopping on a new bus on the first day of service. There will always be a big group of people at the back chattering happily, and loudly.</p>

              <p><br>Ok. So next time when the bus has a huge grp of bus fans, keep a lower tone in the bus. We must protray a positive image to the rest of the passenger as a bus fan or just a normal passenger. <br><br>Thinking hard of the way you behave, i don't think you will like it if there is a huge crowd making loud noises and behaving like monkeys in the bus.
