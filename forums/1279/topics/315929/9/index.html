              <p>Please get your facts right before saying such things. If SMRT doesnt bother about their driver , they wouldnt have done a survey* with the drivers about what bus they prefered. Majority chose MB as their choice, hence SMRT bought MB. If they are really tight on budget like what most of us has presumed, why didnt they choose Scania? Also (IMO), by choosing MB, they hope that they can attract more drivers to come and drive their buses, snce MB are long known for its luxury and comfort.</p>

              <p>u tink a bus driver's job very easy izzit? BC oso hav to ensure the pax safety leh. if the bus kena accident and got pax injured, they might be held responsible too. my friend ytd met a very great problem on his first trip on 912. onli done the first half trip and reached the int at Berth 12, all 3 doors can't open! front door onli opened a little hole, and my poor friend had to squeeze out of the door and use the emergency cock to activate the rear doors! in the end, he declared off svc and drove back to depot, after which going back home for split break. in the afternoon, when i met him again, he was driving another bus liao. after split break, he told me, he did another few trips to compensate for the time lost in the morning, including the other 1/2 trip that he did not complete. and on one day, when TIB808U cameoed on 960 and he happened to cameo on that bus, he cleaned the bus so clean when resting at the int that an auntie kissed the bus! although he complains to me sometimes abt the poor performances of particular buses, he also praised about the ex buses that he had drove, one of which was TIB667J which was his perm S-shift bus on 75 when he first joined the then TIBS. anyway, the bus that brokedown happened to be TIB1041H. my friend later drove TIB1043C, most likely TIB981B replacing its slot on 960.</p>

              <p>I once heard from BCs that they love to drive Mercedes because of their good pickup and although Lances are ok, some don't like to drive them as some of the Lances have a very slow pickup especially on services like 167 and 171.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least SBS and SMRT tried their best to recruit BCs. You have no right to say 'ALOT of train drivers and ALOT of taxi drivers'. Because they both have their pros and cons. For taxis, you have to bear the cost of rental fees, petrol and minor servicing. For trains, I have a friend working as SMRT TO and he earns less than $2000 a month and their start-up salary is not well. Buses is a different thing altogether. If you want to say, they dun care of Bus Drivers, then who are we now? Without them, there's no bus and when there's no bus, there's no us, even this forum would have not been created without us. That is cause and effect.</p>

              <p>Different BC got different perspective about the buses that they like to drive. I've come across 985 SLs who told me that they prefer DAFs than Merc. 853 SLs who prefer Lance than Merc.</p>
              <p>By talking to 1 or 2 SLs who like Merc doesnt mean that they represent the whole population of SMRTB SLs. Dont u feel that it is baised ??</p>
              <p>Anyway, i dont believe they bought the buses based solely on the SLs preference. There are alot of other factors that they also need to consider before they choose to buy the most suitable model for the co.</p>
              <p>If they were thinking about saving money...<br>I guess, we would be seeing a King Long or Yu Tong bus at the launch. not a Merc O500.</p>

              <p>It was a government decision. TIBS did not sell themselves. I believe Ng Ser Miang wouldn't just let something he start from scratch land into the hands of a company which was supposed to be a "competitor" previously.</p>

              <p>Hmm IMO i feel that SMRT maintains their trains better. I took before a fully crowded SMRT train as well as a NEL train before and SMRT one wins in terms of aircon effectiveness. NEL one was a let down, passengers were sweating profusely. SMRT can still feel cool.</p>
