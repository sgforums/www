              <p>Note: I am not condoning nor condemning his actions, nor am I supportive or unsupportive of it. This is <strong>not</strong> directly targetted at Oceane either.</p>
              <p>I honestly do not think he's trying to showoff looking at how the message was phrased...it's just information that he wants to share...don't see anything wrong in sharing information even though people may already know it - there are definitely people that may not know it. It's just that sometimes we may already know the information he has posted, yet someone else does not know. It's a little  like, somebody asking another person, do you know that <em>a certain event</em> happened? If the person says no, then he goes on to respond to it, but if the person says yes, then he stops there or comments/discusses about it. We certainly cannot expect - as we all should know - the same to be done in an internet forum. In a forum, you're facing a wide audience of people, and I'm sure not everyone knows about <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> event, but there are certainly people whom already knows about it. Whilst this may appear irritating to people whom already know about it, it is still useful information about the event for people whom don't know.</p>
              <p>However, as for credibility of the poster, I shan't comment on that, but neither do I see a reason to flame him in a public forum. It makes the victim and the perpetrator both look bad, and certainly doesn't create a good impression for a 3rd party who does not know anything about TTS nor the problems that happened before hand.</p>
              <p>If he wants to snoop around KJDEP, we can only warn him not to (if there is a security risk or what-so-ever), but we cannot force him not to - it's his legs and not ours. If he gets caught for what-so-ever reason, it is definitely not our problem, but his problem. We have already warned him at hand, and if he refuses to heed the advice, there is nothing we can do about it. We can bring a horse to the river, but we cannot force the horse to drink.</p>
              <p>I <strong>believe</strong> some of us also do the same (walk around, spot new buses, post them on the forum, etc etc, and if its something that some of us already know, we'd probably be more toned down than how we treat TTS).</p>
              <p>As for busybody-ness, I've nothing to say.</p>

It's a little  like, somebody asking another person, do you know that <em>a certain event</em> happened? If the person says no, then he goes on to respond to it, but if the person says yes, then he stops there or comments/discusses about it. We certainly cannot expect - as we all should know - the same to be done in an internet forum. In a forum, you're facing a wide audience of people, and I'm sure not everyone knows about <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> event, but there are certainly people whom already knows about it. Whilst this may appear irritating to people whom already know about it, it is still useful information about the event for people whom don't know.</p>
              <p>However, as for credibility of the poster, I shan't comment on that, but neither do I see a reason to flame him in a public forum. It makes the victim and the perpetrator both look bad, and certainly doesn't create a good impression for a 3rd party who does not know anything about TTS nor the problems that happened before hand.</p>
              <p>If he wants to snoop around KJDEP, we can only warn him not to (if there is a security risk or what-so-ever), but we cannot force him not to - it's his legs and not ours. I believe some of us also do the same (walk around, spot new buses, post them on the forum, etc etc, and if its something that some of us already know, we'd probably be more toned down than how we treat TTS).</p>
              <p>As for busybody-ness, I've nothing to say.</p>

              <p>Credibility of the OP is another case <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">. It's a case by case judgement based on the content of the posts. I'm confident that TTS will learn his lesson sooner or later himself. But I really think he does need to make sure that he states that he is <strong>speculating</strong> clearly.</p>
              <p>All fans like to speculate about what they like - it's in our nature. Be it fans of a certain pop-singer, or people whom are extremely interested in politics. They will speculate, but I personally feel that this is a line that has to be drawn clearly, instead of posting it such that it sounds like as if it was <strong>actual, confirmed</strong> information. Chatting/disseminating information over text is different as to communiating face-to-face in person.</p>

              <p>I do agree with your viewpoint. However, there are <strong>extremists</strong> in all cases of idolism - for example, the girl who went so crazy over Andy Lau that she wanted to kill herself because she couldn't meet him (or something along those lines, happened a year back or so). Does it make it seem like as though everyone started thinking "hey, all Andy Lau fans are crazy"? :) Or if you want to push something closer to transport - there was this train fan in NYC who went to the extent of stealing train keys and even impersonating train officals!</p>
              <p>However TTS wants to present himself to others is his problem. But I do see that there are times when his posts are alright in tone, it's just that we already have a prejudice towards him and thus we take it in a negative light - maybe we could change this, and look at his posts from another point of view. There is no need to get angry nor agitated over it. Why <strong>bother</strong> about him? In every group, there are bound to be black sheeps, you can't expect a bed of roses =)</p>
              <p>He'll tone down his actions sooner or later, when he grows up. As for ourselves, let's keep ourselves in check and give others a good impression of us (i.e. when we're joyriding on new buses, please - keep quiet for the sake of the other passengers. There's no need to announce that you know 171s timetable to the world over the phone).</p>
              <p>Do note that I do not know the connections (i.e. who's friends with TTS and who's not and stuff) in the forum. I only know a handful of people (I can probably count it with 1 hand) as I don't bother meeting up.</p>
