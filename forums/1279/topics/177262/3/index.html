            <div class='col-md body'>School kids, the elderly etc. who don't use private cars it's 'implictly' assumed that these lot are catered for by others who drive a car be it parents, friends, helpers etc.<br><br>Of course no situation would ever be 'perfect' so there'll ultimately be some above who would unfortunately be 'left out' ! The ideal goal i'll say is to minimise people in such situations but this being an imperfect world there'll always be some in this boat.<br><br>In this real world NOTHING would ever be perfect. I do NOT believe such a state can/would ever be achieved anywhere BUT people can progress closer to perfection, that's all. So i don't believe in such a thing as perfect public transport system.<br><br>However that does NOT mean complacency can set in with no bothers to make improvements ! My central point has always been in making relative comparisons among the various alternatives to public transport WITHIN a certain country &amp; comparing it to another such relative comparisions from another country, irrespective whether that other place is overall more 'advanced' or not. This way, differences in income levels &amp; purchasing power of money etc. would have been taken into consideration &amp; 'cancelled out' as such, leaving more clearly the 'nett picture' for people to figure if indeed improvements can/should be made in their own countries to make up for any shortcomings when compared this way with another country's.<br><br>The bottom line would be like say the cost of taking bus here is so much &amp; the cost of taking the alternative forms of transport here would be so much. (In the 1st case) If the costs of the private alternatives seem cheap compared to the bus within the same place, then i'll consider it as being less of a case for complains/improvements. However (in the 2nd case) if the costs of the alternative transport seem expensive relative to the bus within the same place being evaluated, then it's more of a case for complains/improvements ! Having understood these, therefore that's why i consider places like Malaysia, Australia, Germany in case 1 while Singapore i have to put under case 2 !!!!<br>If private car costs in Singapore are as cheap as in these other places, then only i place Singapore under case 1 i.e. then less case for complains/improvements !<br><br>As for any increases in bus fares, i've already written number of posts since quite long time ago in this &amp; perhaps other forums saying why such a situation need NOT develop. That's i'll classify under another subject area so i'll not repeat myself here.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by elawee:</div><div class="quote_body">true tt cars in aussie is very much cheaper than in singapore.<br><br>an avg 1.6 or even a 2 litres car from popular brands like honda or toyota will cost nothing above $30K.<br><br>even a brand new merc is abt $60k only.<br><br>but is tt the reason y public transport can be less than perfect there?<br><br>how abt the school kids? how abt the old who cannot drive?<br><br>n then again, wat is perfect?<br><br>having a bus run every 5mins so there would be no queues? or not running any buses when there is no queue but instead deploying only when there are ppl waiting for buses.<br><br>if tt is the former, then more drivers would need to be hired, resulting in higher cost, which in turn result in an increase in fare prices to keep the company profitable.<br><br>n the increased in fare prices will then spark another outrage altogether.<br><br>so pray tell me, wat, in ur opinion, is a perfect public transport system.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a subject area as public as public transport, it's inevitable that some comparisons be made with other places. Otherwise, difficult to have some overview of how well or not the local situation really is.<br><br>I'll say the underlying causes of such long queues is the MISMATCH between the passenger load on the trains versus the buses !! It's not too difficult to imagine what happens when a train full of passengers dumps off a sizable load of them @ the station, implying that in order for no queues or little queues to form @ the bus station later, there must be buses (singlely or in aggregate) of similar passenger capacity to 'swallow' up the load quickly !<br><br>Deploying even a few units of ultra-high capacity buses in such situations would narrow the mismatch between the train &amp; bus passenger capacities, leading to lesser long queues / enables a longer time before the queue builds up again.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 105090:</div><div class="quote_body">erm.. lets not compare with US, UK, HK, OZ, JB etc.<br><br>we keep the woes within Singapore mainland.. so.. well.. as said, no traffic jam, no breakdowns etc. Theres no excuse for such long Q.. what if that day was a stormy day?<br><br>Sure, its a terminal, smaller in size, and definitely frequency-compromising!<br><br>ahh..  i am getting sick of 72 sometimes.. i had decided to take a bicycle instead to get to YCK already!

            <div class='col-md body'>Since 20 years ago the articulated double-decker existed, but in coach form i.e. only seated passengers. But i don't know of any ever used as citybus with standing passengers.<br><br>The 'problem' of double-decker design i'll say (whether rigid or articulated) is that the c.g. tends to be on the high side, obviously not so good in active safety aspects ! So while the single-deck articulated bus can be relatively more dynamically stable &amp; almost as swift &amp; flexible like a snake, the double-deckers tend to be more top heavy, directionally clumsy as such hence more dynamically unstable in comparison.<br><br>Unless there's some breakthroughs in automotive technology (likely achieved thru high-tech electronics in the suspension system i'll say) which reduces/eliminates the inferior stability up to now inherent with double-decker body designs, then i don't believe there's likely to see articulated double-deckers as citybuses with seating &amp; standing passengers on both floors !<br>The most might be standing &amp; seating on the lower deck with only seating no standing on the upper deck, but in that case then the overall passenger capacity on even an articulated double-decker may not reach your 300 figure.<br><br>On the more practical front, i notice the new M-B CapaCity 4-acle single-deck articulated (purpose built) city-bus can take in around 200 passengers in Europe i.e. expected with the more generous European allowances for seating spaciousness, implying that if such allowances were somewhat reduced to account for the 'smaller' physical size of Asians here, then the passenger capacity can be increased somewhat beyond 200 to 1 driver ratio ?!! making it the closest to your 300 figure compared to any other design of city-bus currently here.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tanjun:</div><div class="quote_body">Unless someone invents a new bus (bendy + dd integrated) which can hold probably up to 300 passengers.
