Empty buses brunching? I ask you which services have high terminating point to terminating point traffic? You like to twist your words to defend your own opinions, but it always ends up short.

Passengers do not accept that "Because I provide FAC on Weekend mah"... If Singapore wants to have good customer service, bus operators should stop all these excuses...
