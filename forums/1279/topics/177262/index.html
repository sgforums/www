            <div class='col-md body'>oh btw, cars are really cheap now if u r not too big on the prestigious-ness of the car.<br><br>a picanto or a aveo is going for less than $40k, matrix n getz for less than $50k.<br><br>Alot more afforable in my opinion as compared to before.<br><br>To digress a little...<br><br>High prices of private cars in singapore is due to the lack of space though I dun really agree with the govt implementing ERPs as a mean to curb traffic flow during peak hrs.<br><br>Personally i feel they are trying to EARN MONEY from those who dun have a choice but to take routes like CTE to work every morning simply because they are working in town area. I mean, that is what CEO is for isn't it? To up the prices of cars to deter ppl from buying.<br><br>N now they are punishing those who have to take the CTE home by having ERP along braddell too?<br><br>RIDICULOUS!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we cannot compare this to India/ Malaysia etc.. why? cos Singapore is advanced-developing country. its not 3rd world.. so we leave out the prices part.<br><br>sv72 at 5 mins..? more likely 5 mins when its at the end of its journey. seeing the Q, well, they are all rush hour crowd, not leisure-crowd like 161, 168, 969 etc.<br><br>or at least, operate 72A!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and.. malaysia.. bus 180 may take 1 hour agree, but ppl can take taxi at only a small difference to the bus fare.<br><br>then, in JB, we have 3 or even 4 buses duplicating each other. so if frequency is 30mins, 4 services will mean a person waits very quickly for the bus.<br><br>oh man! 170 jams we can understand from Causeway..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>sometimes, the website says 5 mins,but hardly its 5 mins. The passenger and traffic conditions are more or less the same daily.  once i waited for 72 for 15mins under normal road conditions.......<br><br>But like i said, 1 full paked bus is better than 2 half-filled buses isnt it.. this explains! so.. continue to wait for your jam packed buses!</div>
