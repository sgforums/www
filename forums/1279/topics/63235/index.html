            <div class='col-md body'>do u all think there will be new bus service in bishan to other places? bishan is already a  town for quite a<br>number of years but i personally think the bus service is not adequate especially in bishan bus interchange. there is only 53,54,55,56 and 410.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally find Bishan does not need new services, unless the services are introduced by TIBS. Services 54 56 &amp; 162 provides town coverage while Service 13 &amp; 55 provides eastern coverage. For the west, there is Service 156 and for the north and north-east, there is Service 88.<br><br>The pair of bus stops outside Bishan MRT acts like a mini central stop. Moreover most people in Bishan are young adults to middle-aged people who often rely on the train to get to town where most of them are working.<br><br>The fewer number of bus services might be due to a few factors<br>1. Bishan town is not as big as AMK or TP.<br>2. Bishan town is a newer estate than AMK &amp; TP<br>3. Many places within Bishan North &amp; Bishan East are within walking distances.<br><br>Besides if they want to get to places that are served by buses only, they can take 56 or 88 to AMK or TP before transferring to another bus.</div>
