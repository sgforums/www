            <div class='col-md body'>1. I just recently met a young BC (specifically on 3 August 2007) who is a BRBP bus driver. He once drove SBS 0499X on Service 26 as cameo (<span style="color: white;">my favourite Merc OAC</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ), and I was on that bus. I noted about the fact that he was young when I requested that I take the photo of the interior of the bus (which was then parked at Bedok Interchange at that time).<br><br>He rejected my request and also kindly explained that I could seek permission from the office to get a photo of the inside of the bus. All descriptions fit and he is most likely a young BC.<br><br>2. It was during the Chinese New Year (last year) when I met a BC who is quite unusual. Was on SBS 3659G on Townlink 293 when I met him and most of the time when he was resting, he would normally do hand stretches and even makes barking noises to simulate a dog (because last year was the year of the dog). But that's not all. He would say auspicious words relating to Chinese New Year. That's nice!</div>
