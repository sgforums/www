            <div class='col-md body'>For Bedok, Bendies park by the road side. 12m buses have their own parking lots. I think 3 of them.<br><br>Tampines, I believe there is a lack of space, so TIBS buses park by road side.<br><br>In Eunos a few years back before the renovation, TIBS bendies park by road side and 12m buses park on the west portion of the interchange.

SBST doesnt like them to use the parking lots?<br><br></div></blockquote>1. yes, i dun see any problem with that. n it will jus have to turn as slow like other 12m buses.<br><br>2. Ghim Moh: while bendies are unlikely to touch Ghim Moh Ter, bendies are not suitable for this terminal as there is insufficient (imo) parking space for it and U-turning back after alighting pax at the rubbish dump is not easy.<br><br>Buona Vista: while bendies are unlikely to touch Buona Vista Ter too, bendies may pose a hazard to other SBST 12m buses when parking in the end-on lots. however, this was possible in Boon Lay Int, prob cos 172 &amp; 178 "sandwich" 187's bendies, so any collision with those bendies will be SMRTB's problem.<br><br>Shenton Way: bendies from 700 are known to serve shenton way route during evening peak hours. however i have never observed if the bendies start a new trip from anson rd or do a normal return trip from bt panjang. but i dun expect shenton way to pose a problem to bendies, jus that they might have to be given roadside lots &amp; not end-on lots.<br><br>3. while the allocation is partly due to the fact that bendies are used by SMRTB, i suppose it is mainly because SBST wants to set aside exclusive lots for SMRTB to use so that it won't conflict with SBST buses, for example during heavy parking times there is the issue of who should have priority over parking lots if they are all shared, which involves a lot of politics &amp; not simple first-come-first-serve logic. SBST, who is in-charge of Tampines &amp; Bedok Interchanges, have to take care of SBST drivers first. so setting aside exclusive lots for SMRTB buses make sense, and it happens that the only space left that can be let out are those lots by the roadside. note that there is a non-roadside lot for a 12m SMRTB bus at Tampines Int at the edge of the bend next to where the other SMRTB buses park.</div>
