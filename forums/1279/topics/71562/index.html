He would not name the entrepreneur.<br><br>The free shuttle service never got off the ground as LTA moved in on the day the service started.<br><br>It impounded a Malaysian-registered bus which had just arrived from Senai and a Singaporean-registered bus which was about to leave for Senai.<br><br>Passengers heading for Senai were asked to disembark.<br><br>Mr Fernandes said that AirAsia's Tuesday flights from Senai were not affected and neither were yesterday's flights.<br><br>According to LTA, the two impounded buses were authorised only to carry tourists between Singapore and Malaysia and were not licensed by LTA to operate scheduled services or ferry passengers between designated pick-up points.<br><br>Last December, LTA had turned down applications from Comfort Bus - a subsidiary of ComfortDelGro - and a Malaysian bus operator to ferry people between Singapore and Senai.<br><br>Mr Fernandes said: "Impounding the buses is an over-reaction. It's a sad day for entrepreneurship."<br><br>"Singapore must learn how to deal with entrepreneurs and ideas need to be fostered."<br><br>But irrepressible as ever, he added: "This is just a glitch and entrepreneurs are fighters who will bounce back."<br><br>In a more humorous vein, he said: "It was fortunate that our ad appeared yesterday on Page Two of The Straits Times and news of the shuttle buses being impounded came out on Page Three."<br><br>"Readers would immediately discover that there will be no more free bus service."<br><br>In a statement released on Tuesday, LTA warned that passengers on unlicensed buses risk not being covered by insurance if they were involved in an accident.<br><br>Operators of unlicensed bus services face a fine of up to $1,000 and a jail term of not exceeding three months.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Article published in Streats - Thursday Edition, 4th March 2004</span></div>
