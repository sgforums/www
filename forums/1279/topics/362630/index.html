              <p>Common 21st Century problem I would say... In the past, when steam liners and propeller planes are the norm, people have the patience to wait for a letter from their friends or family members, couple or husband and wife. This wait may be months or even years...</p>
              <p>Now? Wait also cannot wait, flame all away... Patience and respect is what many lack as well. How to cope these problems? If you have a solution perhaps you can make big money already, but not much people like to admit that they have such problems.</p>
              <p>Okay, lets not talk about waiting. I bet very few guys here really meet up often. When you don't meet up, you only talk on internet, messengers and forums. Less face to face talking, more misunderstanding. You treat that guy as a number, XXX, YYY, just a number, no feelings, maybe not even a human, so naturally you will flame away again.</p>
              <p>Remember, use the internet and its resources with responsibility. It does not mean that a forum flame will not hurt anyone; it might not hurt if its really a number (only) or an autobot, but it would if its a human.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Teenaeg in the modern era had these problems...<br><br>- Patience. One of the most commonly seen is that people are impatient about something that haven't release or make its debut. In the past, people wait patiently for the MRT opening in 1987 for example, where large crowds are waiting at the MRT entrance, eagerly making their 1st trip on the MRT from Toa Payoh to Yio Chu Kang.<br><br>- Flaming/Trolling. I guess this is common in the online forums or the BBS. When someone makes mistakes, people make no hesitation to scold or flame someone becuase of its wrongdoings whether the matter is big or small, wanting that person to either change himself or herself and learn from it but now the trouble is that they repeat all over again, from name calling to harassment, which is equivalent to cyber bully. In the past, people scold in front of someone in real life and had to learn their mistakes and follow their good examples from the adults.<br><br>- Behavious in public. I had read articles in STOMP about misbehaviour in buses or trains, its bad habits and causes that make the person wanting to report into STOMP. Misbehaving in public could include talking loudly or turning on loud music on phone. In the past, no such thing, in the MRT, was very quiet and smooth without any distractions.<br><br>Quote: "Respect begets Respect."</div>
