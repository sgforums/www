              <p>Some add-on tips on night phototaking at somerset stn over my past experience. At night, the backgroud of somerset stn bus stop is rather dark as it if full of trees as compared to the bright lighting effect on the bus. Therefore if you use your auto/prirority mode setting on your camera, the camera may tend to give an exposure value to expose the tress bright enough, thereby causing your bus &amp; the bus's desto/EDS to be overexposed. This is the time where you need to use the full manual mode and then adjust values accordingly. There are also times when I get stuck with a choice of not blowing out the EDS but with a slightly darker picture ot blowing out the EDS with a bright picture. Some examples of slightly darker pics but EDS not blowed at all.</p>

              <p>U should not be using night mmode lah, sports mode or whatever mode when night shooting. experince  tells me those all modes are</p>

              <p>Use the <strong>P mode and overexpose the settings</strong>. Hold the cam steady and see if you can shooot a shot clearly. Dun forget u can always shoot at big MP and later crop the pic to make it clear.</p>

              <p>Shooting at night takes practice. You dun get it right in the first three months. i learned the hard way how to handle night shooting. Of course then i had a friend who taught me well. and pointed out tips as we go for "learning sessions". My first few night shots were horrid. But once you got the han gof it you cna get a clear shot 60 percent chance. You will still get blurry shots...</p>

              <p>Ok lah i talk talk talk all the <strong>camera lingo</strong>.. can make ppl blur one. Maybe u read the following b4 going back to PAGE 1 to properly read the setting ideas...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Camera Term Origins : Film Camera</strong></p>
              <p>This one will be about the character called <strong>Film Camera.</strong> i will BOLD camera terms so that you cna catch them while seeing the article.</p>
              <p>In the late 18xxs, people were beginning to discover that when you <strong>expose</strong> light to some paper laced with a certain chemcial X (this dumb guy dunno what they use actually, so feel free to fill this in for me). , ah hem,<strong> expose</strong> light to paper laced with certain chemicals, you get some marks and images to initate the process it was found that a <strong>flash</strong> of light was needed to agitate the paper with chemicals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A further process was needed to <strong>develop</strong> out the pciture from the film.</p>
              <p> this seemed a cool way to capture what you are looking at. the process is later called takking a photograph. the laced chemicals paper came to be called <strong>film</strong>.</p>
              <p>So it was then they built the first <strong>camera</strong>. Chuck the film into the back behind a hole called <strong>aperature</strong> . build a <strong>flash bulb</strong> above the hole and voila the thing that cna capture images that u want.</p>
              <p>naturally as it progressed, people found that sometimes their pictures came out all white or <strong> overexposed</strong>.  or when have too little light, the pictures when <strong>developed</strong> were just kinda dark.</p>
              <p>So they thought, how about we make the hole bigger and smaller , and thus <strong>aperature could be adjusted</strong> to let in the right amount of light they wanted. But still it was not enough and pixs were still not good...Ok so we control the hole size, what are we missing here... ah time. i wish to <strong>contol the amount of time light strikes my film</strong>..</p>
              <p>So to solve this they invented the <strong>shutter</strong> to control the amount of light based on time( lest you get those bright overexposed pictures again. So it was that shutter measurements came about in times particualrly in small amounts of time like seconds, eg : 1/5 seconds shutter. meaning based on the light conditions we control that only 1/5 seconds of time, light falls on the film. <br><br>And so as picture taking progressed and and more and more <strong>sensitive</strong> film was developed  for better pixsand i a not sure if <strong>sensivitivty</strong> cna be adjusted on todays film cameras then came</p>
              <p>the digital camera</p>
              <p>The digital camera basic set up followed closely to its forefathers the film camera. In replacement of film was a light senstive <strong>electronic film</strong> called the CCD. ...With digital technology, the "film" could be made <strong>more sensitive or less sensitive to light</strong> bby use of electornics. Thus came the ISO settings on digital cameras. <br><br>conclusion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>with the understanding of how the good OLD camera works, u will understand how todays modern digi cam works</p>

              <p>Yeap i think i have mentioned already u need at most a 1/50 shutter setting to snap Scania</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and dun get too suprised if overseas buses too need this setting</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>before singapore got their KUB with such difficult EDS to snap, i viisted Hokkaido in 2006 and learned the hard way how to snap a good 1/50 EDS pix.</p>
              <p>It was in Hokkaido that i trained msyelf to set high shutter to capture EDS. At that insatnce i already had a mannual camera for a few months so i knew i ahd to be steady n not let a bbus move when i shoot at low shhutter. (i was already trained at night shot by then also =) )<br><br>At one instance i was facing a Fuji heavy industries (FHI) bodyworked bus in some part of Asahikawa near the ramen village. I had finsihed my ramen meal early and so could come out for a while to snap bus pixs.</p>
              <p>The bus had EDS on. ok great. I llike EDS bus... i set my cam to P mode. snap.</p>
              <p>Whey why no EDS?</p>
              <p>the bus was caught at a light and the japs drivers were smart enough to know I wuz a bus fan so he din creep up behind the car in front.</p>
              <p>i had a whole 24 secs to snap the pix.</p>
              <p>I tried all sorts of aperature shutter and ISO settings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after approximately 10 shots the bus moved. I HAD NOT CHECKED MY PIX YET.</p>
              <p>upon review later in the tour coach, i found that the pics of the bus shot below1/50 shutter, the EDS came out clear. I learned the hard way...no one told me abt this EDS problem ...</p>
              <p>So when it came that Singapore get the KUBs in 2007, i was already well prepared and could snap Scania EDS but the first few weeks were toruture as i started to learned i needed aperature to stop up to <strong>compensate</strong> for slow shutter lest i <strong>over expose </strong>the pic. I began to befreind the tiny exposure meter on screen at this point.</p>

              <p>P mode in such settings can shoot Scania EDS. it means those with point and shoot camera can also take KUB pix without loss of EDS pixels in such rain and dark settings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then hor if you think abbout it, With a higher shhutter setting of 1/3 , (I suspect the 1/3 is based on the darkness of the place n not rain drops problem...?)</p>
              <p>with such high 1/3, dun you think the rain drop will elongate as u capture the rain drop at such long shutter?</p>
              <p>I ean its like u matrix the raindrop and it froze there for more than 1/3 a second.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks =) can share some tips &amp; tatics on getting a nice white balance for night shots? By experience if use I normal tungsten, can be quite yellow. My camera actually has this thingy to adjust colour balance manually, wonder if anyone here uses such a feature.</p>
