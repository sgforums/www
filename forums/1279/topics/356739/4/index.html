              <p>all my skills in taking bus photographs, ok. not only buses, was from the way of shooting things in a different perspective.</p>
              <p>shoot according to rule of thirds. try not to place the subject, as in this case, the bus, in the middle frame of the picture. can try to put it into one of the boxes in the rule of third to make it nicer.</p>
              <p>photos wont be processed just like that. like you take, then post. go through some editing processes. touch up abit, but not too much or else you will spoil the true image you want to show.</p>

              <p>Although Interception_7 is technically correct, to have the bus as the bigger subject (of course, not literally bigger as in your picture <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif">) or he suddenly pop out saying he not promoting TTS work (don't care him) , but there are other ways to make the bus as the subject without compromising on the background. Here are a few shots i think can help you get the general idea.</p>
              <p>This shot, the bus is the bigger subject, but not literally.</p>
              <p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/Se3_dtZ2ktI/AAAAAAAABJ8/oiUVPDSRhng/s800/P4210142.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Don't try to use this kind of angle cuz the shot will turn out ugly. I literally stood in front of the bus the BC looked at me before turning <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/SesJ7I_BKRI/AAAAAAAABFQ/5twwrddRM1A/s800/P4160045.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Using soft sunset light. A romantic moment between your...*ahem* i going off topic lol. Well, the picture sometimes turn out pretty nicely</p>
              <p><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/Se4A9y3jmvI/AAAAAAAABM8/z4p3gMupymA/s800/P4210178.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>And of course, there's the squat and shoot angle</p>
              <p><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/SfWUKYclG6I/AAAAAAAABm4/KcHfTE_nSjs/s800/P4270382.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>More obvious squat and shoot, although you may attract looks from passerbys :p. And of course when the front axle of the bus is turned, it'll look even better.</p>
              <p><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/SgRKrjIhD7I/AAAAAAAACd4/7YcTgsle6sg/s800/P5080870.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>And lastly, interception_7's boring shots -_-. I feel it's too common an angle that's why it's probably look until boring. It isn't boring. at all</p>
              <p><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/SfHaFnDb_EI/AAAAAAAABRo/MC-_ilqx7K0/s800/P4240221.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Although i may have to defend rk2010. In what way is my shot and his shot boring, since it's both shot at the same angle?</p>
              <p><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_trXTGRQ_ytQ/SgRKksAp7WI/AAAAAAAACd0/lfuyz4GYaSs/s800/P5080869.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>Put in manual mode, set ISO to 100, autofocus ready, put the AF box to the bus, while following the bus in the AF box, press the shoot button and capture the shot. i think this is the steps lol. But abit hard to take. Seems like the bus must be moving quite fast too.</p>

              <p>Put in manual mode, set ISO to 100, autofocus ready, put the AF box to the bus, while following the bus in the AF box, press the shoot button and capture the shot. i think this is the steps lol. But abit hard to take. Seems like the bus must be moving quite fast too.</p>

              <p>its always the bus popping out first. cant you guys find another way to photograph things? must it always be buses as the main subject?</p>
              <p>use abstract shots la. LoL.</p>
              <p>panning, just need set shutter speed. focus on the subject. drag along yr camera according the subject. press the shutter. walla, you get one. need more practice when doing panning. try to set 1/80 to give the background a sense of speed. if subject is blur, ensure you focus on the subject when its coming nearer. not focusing from far then the subject come then you snap.</p>
              <p>too bad, my prosumer is under repair. no shots to show you all.</p>

              <p>i mean, this is a bus forum, usually you'll find photos of buses. Didn't you have your own Photography forum? i believe you can find the abstract shots there.</p>

              <p><br>uh huh, i also got take the bus shots in a different way, sometimes need luck and calculation too. It's evident up there at the post, although lately i haven't post such pictures. This isnt Singapore Photography forum.</p>
              <p>And yes, although the buses are photographed in a general way, general angle there is no need to say it is boring.</p>
              <p>And interception_7, the pictures and shots are not boring as boring is -&gt; Uninteresting and tiresome and dull. It's just that it is common that is why you feel that there's no excitement.</p>

              <p>1. .....</p>
              <p>2. Don't be afraid to break all the rules of photography.  Take photos at unusual angles.  Experiment with perspective/point-of-view.  Who said the horizon needs to be horizontal?  Who said wide-angle lenses should only be used for landscapes?  Who said telephoto lenses should only be used for portraits and wildlife?</p>
              <p>3. .....</p>
              <p>4.And my biggest piece of advice yet, don't be afraid of anything.  Just go out there and take photographs.  The best way to learn how to photograph transport vehicles is by going out there and photographic them!</p>

              <p>Don't follow all the rules, as photography is a live art, there is no hard and fast rules to follow.  What is acceptable to you may not be acceptable to somebody else.  Just listen the advice, and see what you can learn from there.</p>
              <p>As for TTS' photos, I only have the following comments:-</p>
              <p>1) Some of the photos are resized too small to see any details of the bus itself.</p>
              <p>2) Don't use photoshop or other photo editing software to edit the photos until the contrast looks way out of this world.  If you have it, you have it, no point in using software to correct flaws in your photo taking techniques.</p>
