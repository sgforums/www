            <div class='col-md body'>2811P, I advise you to watch your words.  Your behaviour will not be tolerated.<br><br>At the same time, I like to question the motive of 105090.  What is it that you want?  To turn the whole of Singapore Buses here upside down, before you are satisfied.  I've already given you warnings more than once, and I don't want to repeat the same warnings incessantly.  Don't make anyone here play the name and shame game with you.<br><br>As for the editing of posts, I shall say this once and for all.  Editing your posts doesn't mean I lost to you.  Frankly, it's not all about winning or losing.  Does it mean that you edit your post before I did, it means that you have won me; or when I edit your post does it mean that I've lost to you?  Well, I tell you solemnly then, only insecure and childish people like you care about winning or losing.  If you want to be victorious, here you go, I proclaim you a victor then.  Satisfied?  There you go, enough said.<br><br>As to why I edit posts, there's a need for protocol to be observed.  And you happen not to observe that protocol.  It's that simple.  And it's not only your posts that have been edited.<br><br>I know you, iveco, sbst275, SBS1908B, SBS9828X (the list can go on) and a lot others hate me.  I'm fine with that.  This is why you, iveco and gang are maliciously intent on causing trouble to SGForums.  Do you all seriously think that you trouble makers could go on with your wanton ways and creating havoc here forever?  Well then, you are so wrong.  Let this be a final warning to you.  The next time anyone of you give trouble, the name and shame list will be up.<br><br>If you are not happy with me hanging around on Singapore buses here on SGForums, fine, pack up and go to www.s14.invisionfree.com/SINbus.  I have nothing to do with that place.  Whatever you want to do there, I won't interfere.<br></div>

I've only checked that place out as a guest.<br><br>Well, SBS1908B, i can fully understand and empathise what you are going through, given that iveco has betrayed out and all that, and that you have been mistaken to be part of their gang.  But I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for deciding not be part of their gang and switching sides.  The information which you had provided me about iveco and 105090 such as information about their clones and all that has certaintly to be helpful.  It is indeed good you have sold out iveco and 105090.  </div></blockquote>Never mind.</div>

It's up to you whether you want to go and join, it seems like u have some kind of loyalty to this place, but there are some pretty good discussions going on there, with the experts helping out... it's your choice, ultimately![/b]</blockquote>this is only my view, if i offended someone, i will apologise here.<br>The new forum can get so much popularity is because it has been posted here, with so many bus enthu here. As also 1 of the bus enthu, i will surely go to tat forum and see. But in the case of SGforums, it is really very difficult to gain its popularity with nothing to promote the forum at its beginning! So its really sad if SGforums closes down.<br><br>I agree that SINbus is a very user-friendly forum, with no argument, no quarrels. But don't u see taht the topic there are repeated like the topics here. For example bus guides, off topics etc. If you basically go to the 2 forums, u might see the same thing, same content. Moreover, the topics here are more and much more member here can provide information about buses. And u will surely see that a topic can have a lot of reply ( do not count the arguments).<br><br>A lot of memebers doesn't mean there's a lot of suggestins/reply. I signed up like a memeber there too. But i have only written one reply at the off-topic columm.<br><br>Although SINbus have a lot of experts, it doesn't mean it will be as so bustly as SGforums.<br><br>These are only my views and i do not mean to say bad things of SINbus.</div>
