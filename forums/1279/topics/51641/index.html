He landed too far down Runway 13, couldn't stop in time and plunged into Hung Hom Bay(furthermore it was raining!)<br><br>The last statement is logical. The bus will more likely tip over the highway due to a combination of forces at work(momentum, etc). Although there will be chain collision, it is not as bad as a bus plunging down into the sea(anyone remember the cable car accident 20 yrs ago?)</div>

Their safety and fingerpointing record is so outstanding that it requires no explanation or doubt whatsoever.<br><br>I agree about Bishan MRT, any Osama can just allow a grenade or molotov cocktail to follow projectile motion onto a passing train during peak hour....Accuracy is too high, and the carnage is also too great to imagine.

Even 9V-SPK died at an age of almost 4 years.<br><br>Yes, if a projectile were thrown down from Bishan Rd into Bishan MRT the accuracy would be so great that many would perish if it were a bomb.
