            <div class='col-md body'>Guys , which bus services do you think should have better frequencies ?<br><br>Bus 103, bus 168 and bus 518.<br><br>Bus 103 : Sometimes I have to wait for more then half an hour for a bus, when the bus comes the bus will stop at the bus stop just outside the camp for 5 minutes before she proceeds.<br><br>Bus 168: The waiting time for this service is a killer but at least SBST puts more DD buses but still, they could improve the frequency by putting more buses especially in peak hours.<br><br>Bus 518: I feel that during peak hours, they could use 2 buses at one time since this service can't used DD buses. Everytime I want to take 518 home from orchard during the evening, the bus will be super packed and even sometimes have to skipped the bus for the next one and you guys should roughly know how is express bus's frequency is liked. I hope SBST considering reducing the waiting time for this service. Who knows.<br><br>How about you guys? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>103 is low demand, hence the freq really sucks. From my visits at Jln Kayu (aft TPE), at most 1-3 people will be on 103.<br><br>168 should either beef up freq or have a full DD fleet during weekends / peak hours. Off peak hours it is doing quite fine, you can sometimes see half empty VSOs.<br><br>Why cant 518 use DDs? 518 demand is quite miserable in Pasir Ris and during off peak, they might as well cut it back to Tampines.<br><br></div>
