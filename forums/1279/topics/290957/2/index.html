The engine weight would tend to pressurize the rear axle, making the axle 'sink' down, and the air escapes from the compressed cylinders supporting the axle and that particular section of the bus.

If I was standing beside them I would definitely give them a slap. Surely suspension problems and worn out tyres are problems, but they are naturally-occuring problems. It doesn't make any sense to link them with fare increase.</div>
