            <div class='col-md body'>Ya true. Once i boarded the bus i realize all the passengers are sitting at the outside seats while i sat at the inside seat beside the window. I look ard and realized the horrendous situation where the windows are very dirty and have dead cockroaches and dust and dead flies all that. Then the floor also so much rubbish and the seats full of vandalism.... and a strange smell... But i still prefer to take bus 307 to CCK interchange cos i hate LRTs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i must agree that 190 is horrible!! I was at orchard road (opp. Far East plaza) last christmas. I was waiting for 132(has quite a long freq.) The only 190 came before the second 132( i missed the first one because i didn't notice the bus). The 190 is a bendy and yet so many people are waiting to squeeze into the bus when the bus is already packed like sardine! Many are very frustrated and showed unhappy looks when they can't board the bus. The driver opened the back doors and some of the ppl entered via the back door (is it right to do so?). After 190 left, my 132 came. when i reached the next bus stop, i realised that 190 is stuck there.</div>
