            <div class='col-md body'>6th of OCT 06<br>An accident happened near the cross junction between Sembawang Road and Mandai Ave. The lorry crashes to the railings and the traffic lights at the divider, causing the sembawang road towards yishun direction to be blocked. As a result, svc 167, 169, 980 are diverted temporarily from using sembawang road to sembawang airbase, dieppe barracks and khatib camp and uses yishun ave 1 instead.<br>Time: in the morning.<br><br>At around 0702, the lorry is shifted and one lane is clear. One of the SMRT ppl comes up to the bus and tells us that the road in front is blocked because of an accident. Those going to Sembawang airbase or dieppe barracks have to alight. So I alight. Later when I arrive at the scene of the accident, I realise that one lane is clear and that bus 169 drives straight using that lane of Sembawang road.<br><br>HE TRICKED ME.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>892T 027 involved in what appears to be a pretty horrific chain accident involving a cement-mixer truck, several cars and the bus. The bus was in the bus-bay at the stop near the Budget Ter at Changi Airport when it occured. The bumper was half-hanging and the rear window was shattered on the floor. But the worst-hit was the truck which had the entire driver cabin folded in and mangled. No idea how it got into that state although I doubt it was due to the bus given that the bus does not appear to be <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> seriously damaged. Saw the truck 2 more times, once when I left airport and another time when 952D 027 I was on overtook the truck and the tow-truck. The damage was truly horrific, but the passenger side appeared to have borne the brunt of the damage. But the driver side was also a gone-case and there are evidence of what appears to be cutters cutting through the roof to extricate the driver because it was missing.</div>
