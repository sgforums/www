            <div class='col-md body'>These 2 services were etched in my memory during my 4 years of living in Jurong East St. 24 (1984-198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><strong>76 (OMO 40c) - Clementi Interchange to Jurong East Ave 1 (loop)</strong><br>76 was the first service to Jurong East New Town. It was introduced in 1984 and provided a vital connection from the infant town to the nearest developed town (ie. Clementi). When Jurong East Interchange was opened in June 1985, sv. 76 was amended to start from Jurong East and loop at Clementi Interchange. It was withdrawn by years' end because there were other services (namely 7, 147 and 333) which shared its route.<br><br><strong>79 - Jurong East Terminal to Bras Basah Rd (loop)</strong><br>79 got the dubious honour of being the first trunk service in Jurong East. It was also introduced in 1984 and mostly followed the route of 147. In fact, its demise was due to its integration with 147. 79 made a comeback in June 1985, plying from the new Jurong East Interchange to Empress Place, its route similar to that of 97 today (ie. via AYE and Alexandra Rd). The second demise of 79 was caused when 97 (which originally plied via Clementi Rd and Pasir Panjang Rd) was amended to ply 79's route instead. Seemingly attached to Jurong East, it made its second comeback there in 1993, this time going to Boon Lay Interchange. Its present route came after an amendment made in 1994.</div>
