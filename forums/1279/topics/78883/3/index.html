            <div class='col-md body'>97 - Hougang to Jurong East -&gt; Hougang Central to Jurong East -&gt; Jurong East to Suntec City/Marina Centre<br><br>97 is one of the first and the longest serving bus in Jurong East. Introduced in 1984, its original route was via Pasir Panjang Rd and Clementi Rd before entering the AYE (then known as Ayer Rajah Road). It was amended via Alexandra Rd when 79 was withdrawn circa. 1986/87. In 1994, it was extended to the new Hougang Central Interchange via Hougang Ave 2 and 10. In 2003, it was shortened to loop at Suntec City/Marina Centre as part of SBS's bus rationalisation with the commencement of the NEL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>98 - Jurong East Interchange to Jurong Interchange -&gt; Jln Ahmad Ibrahim -&gt; Jurong Pier Rd<br><br>98 is another old timer in Jurong East. Introduced in 1985, it was originally a loop service to the old Jurong Interchange. Its original route was via Corporation Rd from Jurong West Ave 1. In 1990, when Jurong Interchange was closed, it was made to loop at Jln Ahmad Ibrahim like the present 98A. In 1992, 247, which runs from Boon Lay to Jurong Pier Rd, was integrated with 98. At the same time, it was amended via Jurong West St 51 and Boon Lay Way to form the present route.</div>

What I know was that in 1988, it was doing its present destinations. Route was slightly different. From Boon Lay Ave, it went via Boon Lay Dr, Boon Lay Way, Jln Boon Lay, Upp Jurong Rd and Pioneer Rd North. In 1990, it was amended via Jurong West St 72 and Ave 5 when flats in that neighbourhood were completed and occupied. At the same time, it skipped turning into Boon Lay Dr as the traffic light junction of Jln Boon Lay and Boon Lay Ave was ready.</div>

(When did Paya Lebar Airport open, anyway?) It originally looped?/terminated? outside Alexandra Hospital but in 1983 it was made to loop at Depot Rd (os HUDC, where 274 now makes a u-turn). In 1985, it was amended to start from Clementi and loop at Paya Lebar. 92 was integrated with 14 in 1993.<br><br>92 - Science Park Dr to Mt Sinai Dr<br><br>Sv. M1 was re-numbered as 92 in 1997.</div>

Although its point to point destinations have changed but its route, for most part, has been intact since the 70s. One of the so called airport bus, it originally plied from Paya Lebar Airport to Labrador. When Paya Lebar Airport was turned into a military airport in 1981, it was made to loop there instead. In 1985, it was extended to the new World Trade Centre Terminal (now known as Harbourfront). In 1993, it stopped going to the airport and was extended to terminate at Eunos.</div>

I have seen students who didn't realise this fact waiting forlornly at Clementi Interchange after the last bus had departed. So in 2000, it was extended to 2300 hrs.</div>
