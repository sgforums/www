            <div class='col-md body'>AMK Feeders:<br>260: Introduced before 1979 when AMK was a brand new town then. Served St 24 and 22 where the current AMK CC now stands. Withdrawn sometime in 1980.<br><br>261: Introduced before 1979. Current route is still the exact original route except that it had an additional loop at St 22/24 before terminating along the current AMK Ave 3 (in front of Blk 700A). Loop withdrawn in 1983.<br><br>262: Introduced before 1979. Looped somewhere in Ave 4. Extended to loop at Ave 2 in the 80s. Plied St 22/24 before amendment of route which is the current route.<br><br>263: Introduced in 1981. Original route to start from AMK and loop at St 61 via Ave 4. Sort of like the current 269. Terminated at AMK Depot when the depot when it was opened in 1985 and plied Ind Pk 2 later. 269 replaced the deleted sector of 263 in 1984. Renumbered as svc 268 as a townlink svc in 1997 as it could no longer charge the former Jurong Industrial fares of 45c and in the same year, fare stage fares are charged for Jurong Ind svcs.<br><br>264 was not used.<br><br>265: Introduced in 1980. Also had an additional loop as svc 261. Interesting fact about the olden route was that it could ply through from St 53 to Ave 8 until 1983 when works began for the NS line of MRT. Terminated at Blk 555 in 1982 and looped at St 22/24 until 1983/4 when it terminated at AMK Int. Route amended again in 2002 when AMK Int shifted. 265 merged with 266 and became a townlink svc and terminated at AMDEP.<br><br>266: Introduced in 1981. Retained original route until 2002 when merged with 265 as a townlink svc.<br><br>268: Reincarnation of svc 263. Merged with 267 in 2002 and looped at AMK Ave 5. Had several amendments in 2003 when part of AMK Ave 12 was closed.<br><br>269: Route introduced sometime in 1983/4. Plied on the deleted sectors of svc 263 and also AMK Ave 6. Amended in 2002 and was amended to ply Ave 4 &amp; 5 to cover deleted sectors of 266 and 138 covered the deleted sectors of AMK Ave 6.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>i myself was at the upp bt timah bus ter bef bt panjang circus along upp bt timah road ytd. lots of old strucutres around. hint: the bus ter is opp the bt panjang lrt stn facing upp bt timah rd</strong><br><br>&gt;&gt;Are you talking about the small parking area near the overhead bridge? Quite small, isn't it? Refer back to the 1980 Guide and you'll find that there were 4 services which terminated at Upp Bt Timah Rd (near Bt Panjang Circus); 178, 181, 193 and 200.<br><br><strong>service that used to call there i know is 177<br>(177 UPP BT TIMAH (bt panjang) - CHOA CHU KANG RD END)<br><br>now only this 405 goes to cck rd end<br>i guesss back then it was a bustling village there and so 172 and 177 duplicated each other<br><br>see 172<br><br>172 LIM CHU KANG RD END via cck rd - SHENTON WAy</strong><br><br>&gt;&gt;172 in 1980 went to Prince Edward Rd. It moved to Shenton Way in 1987. Besides 172 and 177, 206 also went to CCK Rd (End). There was a village there called Kg Berih. In fact, the buses made a u-turn at Kg Berih Rd. I see 177 as a supporting role to 172. Seems like most of the demand from the villages along CCK Rd was to get to Bt Panjang or Bt Timah where there were more buses to get elsewhere.<br><br><strong>195 existed back then as<br>195 CRAWFURD ST - JLN BT MERAh near lower delta rd<br><br>not sure if there was terminus at the other terminal of 195 lolz<br>but this 195 i know goes via orchard rd and tiong bahru</strong><br><br>&gt;&gt;Yes, there was but there's no trace of it today (methinks). Besides 195, sv. 65 also terminated there. It was called Lower Delta Terminal but was actually located along Jln Bt Merah. It was between Henderson Rd and Lower Delta Rd but I don't know where exactly. Anyone out there can help?</div>
