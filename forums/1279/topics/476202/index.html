              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I refer to the micro blogging Chinese site “Is it so easy to become a SMRT Bus Driver”. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-no110-13493261-1.shtml"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-no110-13493261-1.shtml</span></span></a></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Just as a year has elapsed since SMRT’s strike episode in November 2012 and evidence of foreigner overreliance is again brewing. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This time with a further dimension of concern, coming from a potential driver who flagrantly boasts how easy it is to become a</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> SMRT Bus Driver.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In his post, the potential driver congratulates his fellow hired friends who will be ‘bravely venturing’ to Singapore together. He shamelessly describes how his driving skills went untested and were spoon-fed answers. He is surprised but exhilarated to become hired for work by SMRT. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">While he fears that he may fail certain tests in Singapore and be sent back home, he is still taking his chances. Perhaps, he is also taking his chances with the Singapore public’s lives and safety on the road. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He certainly looks forward to see his other hired friends when they are in Singapore. As if one is not enough, how many more of such bad eggs are there coming to Singapore? Again?</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As we are aware, SMRT’s buses have been involved in many high profile accidents in recent years. Just a few months ago, a bus overturned while traveling at high speed during a corner, killing an innocent passenger and injuring more. Last year, SMRT buses have on many occasions slammed into busstops or vehicles. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Besides accidents, the lack of safety consciousness in SMRT’s drivers has also been called into question. It was recently reported that SMRT drivers were photographed by passengers to be ‘nail-clipping’, ‘closing eyes’ and even ‘dozing-off’ as they drive on the road. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Reckless driving, without any thought for passenger safety and poor service quality has repeatedly plagued the company and its workforce over the years. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">While SMRT looks to rebuild the company’s reputation and make being a bus driver more attractive through its newly announced Progressive Career Scheme, the company advances one step but retracts more by what it seems to be poor corporate practices and evidently, a serious lack of standards. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Is this what Singaporeans want of our public transport system? </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Can we tolerate such poor standards and blatant disregard for public safety? </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I am appalled.</span></p>

              <p>We dont have a choice what!</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">That's thanks to the societal views influenced by the SG govt! Nowadays you tell me who would want to drive a bus for his life. You try telling your son to drive bus when he grow up lah. All these PSLE and O/A level shit you tell me what are those for? And so unless you invent driverless buses the govt will have no choice but to deploy more PRCs and anehs to come over and drive the buses! And so if this is what SG govt wants, this is what they get! More people dying in SG from reckless BCs. </span></p>
              <p>And SG govt take this as one of the ways to bootlick China, to open more job opportunities without regarding the safety of the general public. While us SGreans continue to be white-tie office workers! So don't just blame SMRT, if you are to make the last statement, because who knows one of the culprits may be you or me! It is the SG govt that is not encouraging the locals to take up the low-income jobs, and also is SGreans who continue to have higher and higher expectations!</p>

              <p>Exactly so what choices are there? SG is that influential what. And that's what I've been saying: would SGreans want to take up jobs like driving bus since the pay is so low? And taxes keep going up??</p>

              We take such allegations very seriously and are conducting an investigation regarding the post. Necessary action will be taken should these allegations prove true.
              <p>
              At present, SMRT Bus Captains go through a stringent hiring process be it in China or Singapore. In China, agency candidates are subject to two levels of screening before they are considered for employment. When they arrive in Singapore, selected candidates must pass a nine-week training program before he or she becomes a full-fledged Bus Captain. Amongst the tests administered are the 4A driving test conducted by the Traffic Police, routes training, and a basic English test. Applicants must pass all these tests before they are hired.
              </p><p>
              We are consistently working to improve the service quality and increased public demand. We appreciate the time youâ€™ve taken to contact us and will continue to work on ensuring that all our passengers continue to enjoy safe rides with SMRT.
