              <p>winning designs do not translate into winning production
                  contracts - there is a significant difference between design
                  capability and production capability, and you seem to be
                  assuming:<br> 1) LTA should award the production contract to the company that
                  designed it (goes against tender rules!)<br> 2) the bidders for the design contract can BOTH design well and
                  produce cheaply (how true??)</p>
              <p>there is NO play-out involved because, by virtue of the
                  contract, LTA has to renumerate the bidder with the best possible
                  design, and expect LTA to purchase the winning design (IP rights,
                  TDPs and the related) at the conclusion of the contract. once that
                  is done, the design does not belong to the company that designed
                  it, but instead belongs to LTA.</p>
              <p>when LTA decides, further down the road, to issue a
                  manufacturing contract, there is no sell-out because LTA is merely
                  having people tender to build their design, yes LTA's design. it
                  can be argued that LTA's design is a defacto design from a bus
                  company, but the design, legally, still belongs to LTA. </p>

              <p>Here is the thing, bus manufacturers don't earn money by coming out with concepts and selling IPs to authorities, design firms, like those in NBFL design competition, can as that is what they do for a living, but in the NBFL the design firms didn't had to care about the engineering design and TFL wasn't looking for experienced bus manufactuers during this phase. When the TFL wanted the buses to be built (ie the next phase), they required the bus manufacturers to come out with the engineering design, in return for building the buses.</p>
              <p>A bus manufacturer on the other hand, has to manufacture buses to make money. Selling IPs to authorities and letting them use it while not getting any actual deals is simply unfair to the bus manufacturers, especially when they no longer hold legal rights to what they have created.</p>
              <p>Its like creating a whole new bus, just that there is a chance that you can't get the business. Manufacturers (not just bus manufacturers) usually recoup their design costs only after a certain X amount of units produced, either the costs they are tendering has to be so high that they recoup the whole design cost (that it makes more sense for the authority to buy a lot of buses using the money instead) or they can choose to bid lower and hope that the authorities award a future bus tender to them.</p>
              <p>This is why I would rather they skip this whole concept bus bullshit, and evaluate bus manufacturers when they actually need the buses.</p>

              <p>Alternatively, it is possible to argue the other way round.</p>
              <p>If I were a manufacturer and I wanted to keep other
                      manufacturers out for the next round, I would propose a mock-up
                      with technologies that other manufactures find it difficult or are
                      unable to replicate (e.g. steel structure or cutting edge aluminum
                      structure design). That will put many of my competitors out of the
                      game for the next round.</p>
              <p>That is why this looks like Masterchef if you have watched
                      episodes of it, "whoever wins this challenge will gain a
                      significant advantage in the next round". The winner of the first
                      challenge will usually pick ingredients/choices for their
                      competitors for the elimination round that put them in an very
                      vulnerable position.</p>

              <p>One thing is, bus manufacturing (in terms of body as this contract looks like its focusing more on the body) doesn't really involve much precision engineering. A lot of stuffs regarding buses are very easy to replicate, the Chinese are very good at doing such replicating, why do you think you see a lot of Chinese at European bus shows snooping at booths other than their own when most buses in China are domestically made? This is why bus manufacturers turn to patents, but if you sell your design to LTA, then the patents will be owned by LTA, wouldn't you as a manufacturer lose out then as there isn't any contractual agreement to buy your buses?</p>

              <p>Based on LTA's experience with rolling stock procurements, I do not think LTA did or will buy patents or any other intellectual property.</p>
              <p>If there is a risk of intellectual property of one manufactuer stolen by another, then the outcome is already obvious. The tender will close either with no prospective bidders (forcing LTA to redesign the tender), or only the Chinese manufactuers will bid.</p>

              <p>What kind of renumeration can you get out of this? This is not going to bring in the kind of money you would expect from a bus order (ie VERY significantly lower profit margins), and yet you have to do the same designing work, which takes a large portion of the cost, and then you probably have to give the design up to the authority. And even if you get to keep the design rights, there's no stopping LTA from speccing something similar to your design (this is what Chinese bus manufacturers do - come out with something similar but not 100% to circumvent patents). What bus manufacturers need are actual orders, not concepts.</p>
              <p>If I'm a bus manufacturer, I'm stuck in between a rock and hard place, on one hand I have to enter this because you'll never know whether this design tender forms a prequalification for future tenders (ie only companies who have entered this tender can tender for future tenders - whether stated explicity or as an informal gesture). On another hand, there is a chance that I am giving out the design, but not winning a future tender for bus orders.</p>
              <p>If you are thinking of joint bids, all I can say is this industry is a man for his own. Don't expect joint bids between companies of the same field. You could expect joint chassis manufacturer and body manufacturer bids but don't expect body and body, or chassis and chassis working with each other.</p>

              <p>I still don't think joint bids are going to be possible. Its just not so easy for manufacturers to work together over so many years, much less within a period of one month. Even VW as the majority shareholder, took years trying to force MAN and Scania together and they've only started looking at synergies regarding transmissions.</p>
              <p>And apart from all these comments I have made, I hope LTA isn't looking for an iconic external design ala NBFL, the travelling public doesn't care and don't need it. they just need buses running.</p>

              <p><b>Designing a better ride on public buses</b><br>
              <i>Catering to various commuter groups part of LTA tender requirements</i></p>
              
              <p>PUBLIC buses will offer a better ride in the future as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) studies how to improve their design.</p>
              
              <p>It is looking at tweaks to improve commuter flow, for instance getting passengers to move to the back of the bus, and to minimise the time they take to board and alight.</p>
              
              <p>It will also look at catering to different groups of commuters, including the elderly who need seats, the visually challenged with guide dogs, and travellers with bulky items.</p>
              
              <p>Last week, the LTA called a tender asking manufacturers and suppliers to submit design proposals based on these considerations, and to build actual-size mockups of prototype buses.</p>
              
              <p>â€œLTA is studying what enhancements in design and features could be incorporated for future bus purchases and are best suited to operations in Singapore,â€� a spokesman said.</p>
              
              <p>The concept models must have passenger seats, driverâ€™s cabin, handrails and other interior and exterior fittings, according to the tender documents.</p>
              
              <p>A workable door system, interior lighting and air-conditioning will also have to be installed.</p>
              
              <p>The tender, which closes next month, requires companies to consider factors such as comfort, safety and carrying capacity during peak hours.</p>
              
              <p>These concept buses â€“ two single-deckers and two double-deckers â€“ will be shown to the public to gather their feedback.</p>
              
              <p>This will be valuable when deciding on future bus purchases, LTA said.</p>
              
              <p>As the bus industry transits into a state contracting model, all fleets and infrastructure will be government-owned, with routes tendered out to operators to run.</p>
              
              <p>The first tender package for 24 routes in the western part of the island is expected to be awarded soon. Eight companies shortlisted include local operators SBS Transit and SMRT, and players from Australia, Britain and France.</p>
              
              <p>A poll of 30 bus commuters found that enhancements relating to safety, accessibility and comfort were top of their wishlists.</p>
              
              <p>â€œI hope for more handrails, especially in the middle of the bus,â€� said undergraduate Alison Ong, 20. Ms Clare Wong, 51, a homemaker, wanted more space for big items like market trolleys and luggage. Others suggested wider seats and more seating set aside for the elderly and disabled.</p>
              
              <p>Retiree Lee Ley Lun, 60, said: â€œHow about some piped music and brighter (interior) colours to cheer everyone up?â€� -ST</p>

              <p>Since the contract asks for experienced bus manufacturers rather than design firms,  it is asking for an engineering rather than conceptual/aesthetic design. The outcome is more likely to be similar to currently available buses on the market, with modifications here and there such as an extra rear door (for RHD), wider aisles, optimised seating configuration/ interior layout etc, or even exploring electric or hybrid buses on a commercial scale (though unlikely).</p>
              <p>The purpose is to explore various ideas and find out what is feasible and suitable for Sg's market, so that LTA has a basis for procuring buses in future. This could be similar to the Bombardier mockup for Downtown Line MRT trains, which was modified into what we see today. I suspect this exercise is also for LTA to get some in-house expertise on bus design and procurement, since that is currently under the 2 PTOs.</p>
              <p>As for the issue of IP rights to the design and the possibility of a different company doing the actual mass production of buses, that's perfectly ok from LTA's point of view because the company with the winning design may not be the most cost-efficient manufacturer. If you know how LTA and stat boards work, they are focused on protecting the authority's (and public's) interest, which numerous clauses in tenders specifying the conditions to be met and the tenderer's obligations in the event of various difficult circumstances, in some cases disclaiming the authority from liability, and the work done by others becoming the authority's property.</p>
              <p>It's tough for the manufacturers because this concept bus mockup is likely crucial to procuring huge orders under GCM in future, but they may get undercut by more cost-efficient rivals when it comes to the large orders.</p>

              <p>3. LE/LF bus got space to put mainframe that runs the computers? also ar, if the individual computers overheat and catch fire how ar? :D </p>
              <p>4. then ppl will kpkb and want the operator to play justin bieber/one direction/maroon 5 so on so forth :D </p>
              <p>5. air freshener empty you refill ar? also ar, who pays for the refill? :D </p>
              <p>6. when you have a rooftop AC, how much solar panel can you install on the roof without overloading it? </p>
              <p>7. if you can find space on an LE bus to mount the AC underneath, kudos :D </p>
              <p>my dear friends<span style="line-height: 1.231;">, this is why we are destined to pay $4 for a feeder ride, and maybe $15 for a trunk ride. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> </p>

              <p><strong>Designing a better ride on public buses</strong><br> <em>Catering to various commuter groups part of LTA tender
                  requirements</em></p>
              <p>PUBLIC buses will offer a better ride in the future as the Land
                  Transport Authority (LTA) studies how to improve their design.</p>
              <p>It is looking at tweaks to improve commuter flow, for instance
                  getting passengers to move to the back of the bus, and to minimise
                  the time they take to board and alight.</p>
              <p>It will also look at catering to different groups of commuters,
                  including the elderly who need seats, the visually challenged with
                  guide dogs, and travellers with bulky items.</p>
              <p>Last week, the LTA called a tender asking manufacturers and
                  suppliers to submit design proposals based on these considerations,
                  and to build actual-size mockups of prototype buses.</p>
              <p>“LTA is studying what enhancements in design and features could
                  be incorporated for future bus purchases and are best suited to
                  operations in Singapore,” a spokesman said.</p>
              <p>The concept models must have passenger seats, driver’s cabin,
                  handrails and other interior and exterior fittings, according to
                  the tender documents.</p>
              <p>A workable door system, interior lighting and air-conditioning
                  will also have to be installed.</p>
              <p>The tender, which closes next month, requires companies to
                  consider factors such as comfort, safety and carrying capacity
                  during peak hours.</p>
              <p>These concept buses – two single-deckers and two double-deckers
                  – will be shown to the public to gather their feedback.</p>
              <p>This will be valuable when deciding on future bus purchases, LTA
                  said.</p>
              <p>As the bus industry transits into a state contracting model, all
                  fleets and infrastructure will be government-owned, with routes
                  tendered out to operators to run.</p>
              <p>The first tender package for 24 routes in the western part of
                  the island is expected to be awarded soon. Eight companies
                  shortlisted include local operators SBS Transit and SMRT, and
                  players from Australia, Britain and France.</p>
              <p>A poll of 30 bus commuters found that enhancements relating to
                  safety, accessibility and comfort were top of their wishlists.</p>
              <p>“I hope for more handrails, especially in the middle of the
                  bus,” said undergraduate Alison Ong, 20. Ms Clare Wong, 51, a
                  homemaker, wanted more space for big items like market trolleys and
                  luggage. Others suggested wider seats and more seating set aside
                  for the elderly and disabled.</p>
              <p>Retiree Lee Ley Lun, 60, said: “How about some piped music and
                  brighter (interior) colours to cheer everyone up?” -ST</p>
