              <p><strong>Designing a better ride on public buses</strong><br> <em>Catering to various commuter groups part of LTA tender
                      requirements</em></p>
              <p>PUBLIC buses will offer a better ride in the future as the Land
                      Transport Authority (LTA) studies how to improve their design.</p>
              <p>It is looking at tweaks to improve commuter flow, for instance
                      getting passengers to move to the back of the bus, and to minimise
                      the time they take to board and alight.</p>
              <p>It will also look at catering to different groups of commuters,
                      including the elderly who need seats, the visually challenged with
                      guide dogs, and travellers with bulky items.</p>
              <p>Last week, the LTA called a tender asking manufacturers and
                      suppliers to submit design proposals based on these considerations,
                      and to build actual-size mockups of prototype buses.</p>
              <p>“LTA is studying what enhancements in design and features could
                      be incorporated for future bus purchases and are best suited to
                      operations in Singapore,” a spokesman said.</p>
              <p>The concept models must have passenger seats, driver’s cabin,
                      handrails and other interior and exterior fittings, according to
                      the tender documents.</p>
              <p>A workable door system, interior lighting and air-conditioning
                      will also have to be installed.</p>
              <p>The tender, which closes next month, requires companies to
                      consider factors such as comfort, safety and carrying capacity
                      during peak hours.</p>
              <p>These concept buses – two single-deckers and two double-deckers
                      – will be shown to the public to gather their feedback.</p>
              <p>This will be valuable when deciding on future bus purchases, LTA
                      said.</p>
              <p>As the bus industry transits into a state contracting model, all
                      fleets and infrastructure will be government-owned, with routes
                      tendered out to operators to run.</p>
              <p>The first tender package for 24 routes in the western part of
                      the island is expected to be awarded soon. Eight companies
                      shortlisted include local operators SBS Transit and SMRT, and
                      players from Australia, Britain and France.</p>
              <p>A poll of 30 bus commuters found that enhancements relating to
                      safety, accessibility and comfort were top of their wishlists.</p>
              <p>“I hope for more handrails, especially in the middle of the
                      bus,” said undergraduate Alison Ong, 20. Ms Clare Wong, 51, a
                      homemaker, wanted more space for big items like market trolleys and
                      luggage. Others suggested wider seats and more seating set aside
                      for the elderly and disabled.</p>
              <p>Retiree Lee Ley Lun, 60, said: “How about some piped music and
                      brighter (interior) colours to cheer everyone up?” -ST</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Two single-deck and two double-deck choices, that is identical to how new buses are currently procured under BSEP.</p>
              <p>In that case and considering the relatively short timeline, don't expect the status quo to change too much.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong operators seem to be sticking to this trend when it comes to bulk purchases as well.</p>

              <p>The more feasible build up now will be the 12.8m double deckers used in Hong Kong now. Adding the 3rd door after the rear axle to  encourage people to move to the back and alighting at the back.</p>
              <p>Same single deckers, for 3rd door 12.5-12.8m single deckers. I doubt 14.5m single deckers will be used again. </p>

              <p>ok la. for now, let's forget about all the extra features, such as television, elevator, escalator - until next time. </p>
              <p>if want luxury, I guess what we really need is a very cool bus, where inside the aircon is very strong. why? because Singapore is so hot. :( </p>
              <p>for the seats, it does not matter if it's leather or cushion. I think what we should try to work on is the seat arrangements. if we arrange the seats differently, maybe the flow of people inside the bus will be smoother? </p>
              <p>if we want it to be elderly friendly, the bus should have hand grips, at least in the lower deck. try to have seats in the lower deck in the same level, so don't have to climb stairs.</p>
              <p>apart from that, we can consider having in the lower deck a compartment at the top of the buses where we can put our bags. #bagdownbenny then more people can stand. more people can board.</p>
              <p>if want a bit high tech, what we can do is to have electronic route map inside the bus. if the bus is permanent deployment, can have route map in paper format.</p>

              <p>I think there are buses that has the door at the rear, such as three door varient or the London Bus... But again LTA doesnt wanna invest in them...</p>
              <p>I was always wondering, if we could install faregates at entrances of bus ints... That way, ppl need not waste time tap in tap out on buses at the int... Can work in SG also given its disdance-based fares</p>

              <p>Actually, if they want, they should engage the Polytechnics to help them design the concept bus.</p>
                  <p>This can easily become the Final-Year Project for many groups of students, for the school of Design, school of Engineering, etcetera.</p>
                  <p>Engineering students can help to create an electrical system that is energy efficient and cost effective, to power the bus, the lighting and the air-conditioning.</p>
                  <p>Design students can help to come up with the best possible seating arrangement, for maximum comfort (for both normal passengers and passengers with disabilities), capacity and flow.</p>
              <p>a Multi-Disciplinary project can be created for both Engineering and Design students, to help create features (eg. sensors) that make the bus friendly to the elderly, the people in wheelchair, etcetera.</p>
                  <p>It's quite a huge talent pool, yet they did not tap on it. Instead they choose to engage companies to do it for them.</p>
