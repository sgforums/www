              <p>My opinion is for LTA to stop the "we should not be operating buses but we know better than PTO" mantra.</p>
              <p>It is contradictory and counter-productive, especially at this transition point. The PTOs are not going to be particularly cooperative, and the public will suffer.</p>
              <p>Anybody noticed that with the upgrade to the bus arrival times to mytransport, the estimations have gotten even worse?</p>
              <p>My guess is that the data supply is now controlled by LTA. Not from PTOs, and the algorithms are not as correct as previously before.</p>
              <p>Will the PTOs help sort this out? I doubt it.</p>
              <p>I would like to see the industry nationalised - the true cost may become more transparent, and there would be less oddities such as having "packages" on this rather small island.</p>
              <p>And yes, GCM or nationalisation, the bus-fan hobby stuff will be dead very soon either way.</p>
              <p>And bendies will be gone. As simple as that. The signs have been there for so long.</p>

              <p>It is true that the competitive tendering model has no guarantee of being better. You are right that compliance involves costs, and there are risks involved in GCM (including bankrupcy and labour disruption). There is no shortage of literature out there arguging <a href="https://audit.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1997-Insert-BusReform.pdf">for</a> and <a href="http://www.busvic.asn.au/images/uploads/public/Contracting%20regimes%20for%20bus%20services.pdf">against</a> this model.</p>
              <p>I am more inclined to think that all these changes are highly driven by national politics. Public transportation is one of the hottest political hot potato in the last election (and the most visible impact of Singapore's immigration policies), and the government probably felt the need to just something about it to placate the voters.</p>
              <p>In a way it's a political gamble, and so it will be very interesting to see how this eventually plays out.</p>
              <p>P.S. I don't like mytransport either. It gives me a lot less information than I could get out the previous publictransport.sg portal.</p>

              <p>I was hoping to set the record straight with solid information
                                  to clear the high seas of rumours and disinformation prevalent in
                                  this community. I was expecting older folks with some institutional
                                  knowledge to offer some useful comment.</p>
              <p>Clearly, I was wrong. There are lobbyists who even belittle the
                                  significance of this news.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the only explanation is that we now live in a new
                                  generation of young lobbyists who possess zero institutional
                                  knowledge (because it no longer exists) and assume that they know
                                  everything. Hence the responses which IMO is worse than asking any
                                  passerby who possess no prior knowledge of buses.</p>

              <p>Not sure if this is useful,</p>
              <p>a few weeks ago, I went onto Ask.fm and asked my friends (around 18/19 yrs old) this question.</p>
              <p>Q: In terms of transportion, do you want speed or comfort.</p>
              <p>Many of them say they want both speed and comfort.</p>
              <p>Some say speed.</p>
              <p>Some say it depends on the distance. If short distance, speed. If long distance, comfort.</p>
              <p>In short, we know what we want. Tbh, regarding transport, we just want to get from point A to point B in the best possible way. </p>
              <p>Well, you know, "best" can mean many things, depending on each point of view. #justsaying</p>
              <p>but really, I do not think we really care what kind of bus is used. so long as we can board and can go to where we want, can already.</p>
              <p>but still, it really feels good to say that "I am so poor. I can only take Mercedes to school."ã€€:)</p>

              <p>The saving grace however would be the new data mall, which allows developers to get hold of some critical data (such as bus routes) to develop minor spin-offs.</p>
              <p>Those who had learnt IT-related engineering stand to benefit from these recent events. The new systems such as the IBMS and beeline.sg are clear trends towards the use of big data in many of the public transport problems.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I am sure we will do a thorough read up on the case studies. whatever good, use it. whatever bad, prevent it. Rest assured, we have been doing that since the beginning of time. I'm sure by now we are very good and very experienced at it. :)</p>

              <p>Not sure if this is useful,</p>
              <p>a few weeks ago, I went onto Ask.fm and asked my friends (around
                  18/19 yrs old) this question.</p>
              <p>Q: In terms of transportion, do you want speed or comfort.</p>
              <p>Many of them say they want both speed and comfort.</p>
              <p>Some say speed.</p>
              <p>Some say it depends on the distance. If short distance, speed.
                  If long distance, comfort.</p>
              <p>In short, we know what we want. Tbh, regarding transport, we
                  just want to get from point A to point B in the best possible
                  way. </p>
              <p>Well, you know, "best" can mean many things, depending on each
                  point of view. #justsaying</p>
              <p>but really, I do not think we really care what kind of bus is
                  used. so long as we can board and can go to where we want, can
                  already.</p>
              <p>but still, it really feels good to say that "I am so poor. I can
                  only take Mercedes to school."ã€€:)</p>

              <p>The only main difference between Singapore and other cities is that Singapore has much larger population of captive audiences taking public transport, by virtue of COE.</p>
              <p>In academia, most experts will advise transport planners that the needs of captive audiences is to be ignored and the focus should be on incentivizing car owners to switch to public transport. Clearly, that is not happening in Singapore for reasons already mentioned.</p>
              <p>That is why, and this is especially true for bus lobbyists, if passengers are stuck with a choice (taking the bus) then they will do whatever they can to make the conditions of that choice better for themselves.</p>

What's an assessment? Well its an unprejudiced observe an item. Evaluates have a tendency to be done even or by outsiders by those people who have gone for something.

                  <p>Here is the BIGGEST issue of it all, what this means is that LTA has the upper hand in playing manufacturers out. Imagine if LTA awarded this contract to manufacturer A, feels happy about the mockup, then puts the good aspects in the specs of a subsequent tender for buses, and awards it to manufacturer B who has bidded lower than A in the contract. I highly doubt there is any contractual commitment to purchase buses out of this contract. As a manufacturer, congratulations, you've been played out by a government agency who may be a bastard but you can't do anything about it but to try harder next time round, even though it was your ideas and your blood and sweat.</p>
                  <p>Point to note that the NBFL design competition's entrys were designed by design firms, ie there was no bus manufacturer involved (LTA's one stated they have to be experienced bus manufacturers), bus manufacturers were only called in after the winning concept was decided to provide the engineering design and manufacture of the buses.</p>

                          As a manufacturer, congratulations, you've been played out by a
                          government agency who may be a bastard but you can't do anything
                          about it but to try harder next time round, even though it was your
                          ideas and your blood and sweat.</p>
              <p>Point to note that the NBFL design
                          competition's entrys were designed by design firms, ie
                          there was no bus manufacturer involved (LTA's one stated they have
                          to be experienced bus manufacturers), bus manufacturers were only
                          called in after the winning concept was decided to provide the
                          engineering design and manufacture of the buses.</p>

              <p>winning designs do not translate into winning production contracts - there is a significant difference between design capability and production capability, and you seem to be assuming:<br>1) LTA should award the production contract to the company that designed it (goes against tender rules!) <br>2) the bidders for the design contract can BOTH design well and produce cheaply (how true??)</p>
              <p>there is NO play-out involved because, by virtue of the contract, LTA has to renumerate the bidder with the best possible design, and expect LTA to purchase the winning design (IP rights, TDPs and the related) at the conclusion of the contract. once that is done, the design does not belong to the company that designed it, but instead belongs to LTA.</p>
              <p>when LTA decides, further down the road, to issue a manufacturing contract, there is no sell-out because LTA is merely having people tender to build their design, yes LTA's design. it can be argued that LTA's design is a defacto design from a bus company, but the design, legally, still belongs to LTA. </p>

              <p>There is no confidential information involved. A simple search over GeBiz (with the word "bus") will yield information on the tender eligibility which anyone can view.</p>
              <p>Pasting the direct URL didn't work on this forum. It resulted in a broken link. Sometimes even pasting URLs of LTA press releases does not work. It is frustrating, but you will have look it up manually. But the tender eligibility information is available and online to anyone.</p>
              <p>A lot of these "feedback" (I call it lobbying) has spilled over to the mainstream media over the past five years.</p>
              <p>All you needed to do is to Google for it. It is all over the public domain in the last five years.</p>

              <p>its tragic the pen, or rather the internet, does not discriminate between the informed and the un-informed. often enough, its the un-informed who resort to persuasion above their weight to effect changes that are often detrimental to the system. </p>
              <p>kid, you underestimate the power of the media. If you havent been reading your Social Studies textbooks properly, re-read them and also singapore's history. how did LKY influence the masses against British Colonial rule, and eventually against the Barisan Socialis? </p>
              <p>Edit - to better put this whole issue of 'forum public discussions are harmless' into context, remember rumours of the B10M Mk5 many years back? How did Volvo respond to such suggestions of a Mk5 B10M then? </p>

              <p>Alternatively, it is possible to argue the other way round.</p>
              <p>If I were a manufacturer and I wanted to keep other manufacturers out for the next round, I would propose a mock-up with technologies that other manufactures find it difficult or are unable to replicate (e.g. steel structure or cutting edge aluminum structure design). That will put many of my competitors out of the game for the next round.</p>
              <p>That is why this looks like Masterchef if you have watched episodes of it, "whoever wins this challenge will
                          gain a significant advantage in the next round". The winner of the first challenge will usually pick ingredients/choices for their competitors for the elimination round that put them in an very vulnerable position.</p>

              <p>i think still a BRT system combine with MRT will be the best for
              the public. and for those road that never big enough for BRT or MRT
              to be build on, a fleet of normal public buses could provide the
              link. in short if LTA want people to give up driving cars it is
              impossible, but at least some kind of interconnection between
              journey and on time transport service is possible. not point asking
              contractor to come whatever bus concept for the public. LRT system
              is a not a every good system compare to BRT. </p>

              <p>Generally, a rail system is preferred to a BRT if it exists.</p>
              <p>I have seen at least one major urban city tear down BRT facilities to substitute it for a metro system. Taichung is <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/03/24/2003614288">tearing down theirs</a> in a few months.</p>
              <p>The main benefits of a BRT system is its flexibility and shorter period of construction.</p>
