What they simply needed to do was to wait for whenever they need the buses, come out with a tender, then evaluate from there, which is what most bus companies and transit authorities are doing now, and even if they really wanted to see how different buses perform before making a purchase, they could have gave their specifications and asked for demonstrators.</p>
              <p>You don't see a lot of other cities with concept buses. Coupled with the fact that the main issue with public transport now is connectivity and overcrowding, a concept bus ala NBFL is really just a waste of money then, its simply a prestige project for certain civil servants to show that they have done a part to improve public transport, when they really haven't touched the root issues.</p>

              <p>If they are really looking for a 3 door configuration RHD bus, with a one month tender period, it really shows how much they know about buses (or the lack of knowledge). There are very few products in the market that suit that requirement, in fact all the big European manufacturers don't have it and it will take many months to come out with such a product. I can only think of the NBFL and the 3 door Optare Tempo, the former made possible with a small engine, and the latter having a design which will not solve the issue of people not moving back, whilst taking up more space where seats could have been, in fact the door position of the 3rd door doesn't look significantly further back as compared to the rear door of the A22.</p>
              <p>And if they are still trying to see which layout of buses are best suited for this country, I suggest that they look closer at SBS and SMRT. It just reeks of arrogance that civil servants think they can find a better choice than what SBS and SMRT have; what makes them think SBS and SMRT haven't been trying their best in terms of configuration - especially when LTA did nothing to improve the situation until they came out with BSEP, the bus companies are a step ahead, I'm afraid.</p>

              <p>The whole point of a mock-up is to evaluate potential new features and invite potential feedback. LTA has done this before with the DTL rolling stock:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/downtown-line-train-mock-up-goes-on-display.html">http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/downtown-line-train-mock-up-goes-on-display.html</a></p>
              <p>If you recall last year, there was considerable academic and public criticism relating to the interior configuration of the existing buses, especially double-deck buses, operating in Singapore:</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1279/topics/487180">http://sgforums.com/forums/1279/topics/487180</a></p>
              <p>A concept bus mock-up may be an attempt to address these issues and get the specifications right before calling tender for actual procurements.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, both operators took very different approaches when it comes to deciding the interior configuration of their latest buses (e.g. longitudinal vs traverse seating, swing-out door vs sliding plug door, fold-up seats vs standing space, passenger information systems, etc.). It is also possible that these design choices remain proprietary information within the operators, or/and there is a need to reconcile these differences to come up with a new common standard.</p>

              <p>1 staircase take up 12 seats, 1 door take up 4 seats. we would have only 66 seats left. Faster alighting as compared to the current E50s and Wrights but lesser seats. Stairs is why our current DDs have slightly longer dwell times.</p>

              <p>i'm amazed at how many people are 'playing expert' once word about LTA asking for 'concept buses' has spread on the forums <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>12.4/5m buses, 14.5m buses, PIW lifts, double staircases??? even 3 door RHD designs, are these the things that we really need to fine-tune our transportation system? </p>
              <p>keep your disdain of the civil service to yourself, because they are trying to solve issues (or improve on) whatever the PTOs may have been lacking in in the past decades. similarly, how LTA is handling the 'concept bus' issue is akin to 'industry days' in the USA where the US government sources the best from what the industry can offer for its requirements, the latest of one such example being the Individual Carbine Project. </p>
              <p>also, dont let your fanboyism of the PTOs cloud your judgement. The PTOs are clearly capable of more, but something's gone wrong somewhere that we'll leave LTA to fix. </p>

              <p>Hard to say here. We have three types of buses. For SBST, B10Ms, KUBs are Single Decks (SD) while CDGE, Wright, VO2x, VO3x are Double Decks (DD).

              <p>If they really needed to evaluate different choices of buses,
              they wouldn't need to come out with a concept for buses. What they

              come out with a tender, then evaluate from there, which is what

              even if they really wanted to see how different buses

              <p>If they are really looking for a 3 door configuration RHD bus,
              with a one month tender period, it really shows how much they know
              about buses (or the lack of knowledge). There are very few products
              in the market that suit that requirement, in fact all the big
              European manufacturers don't have it and it will take many months
              to come out with such a product. I can only think of the NBFL and
              the 3 door Optare Tempo, the former made possible with a small
              engine, and the latter having a design which will not solve the
              issue of people not moving back, whilst taking up more space
              where seats could have been, in fact the door position of the
              3rd door doesn't look significantly further back
              as compared to the rear door of the A22.</p>
              <p>And if they are still trying to see which layout of buses are
              best suited for this country, I suggest that they look closer at
              SBS and SMRT. It just reeks of arrogance that civil servants think
              they can find a better choice than what SBS and SMRT have;
              what makes them think SBS and SMRT haven't been trying their best
              in terms of configuration - especially when LTA did nothing to
              improve the situation until they came out with BSEP, the bus
              companies are a step ahead, I'm afraid.</p>

              <p>Tender open =/= tender implementation.</p>
              <p>The idea of a tender is for submission of rough proposals and cost and evaluate based on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proposed</span> deliverables.</p>
              <p>Existing ideas can be combined and re-packaged to make an awesome proposal. But the proposals aren't 100% cast-in-stone and are usually intentionally made vague at times to allow flexibility. And there is always <span style="text-decoration: underline;">requirements-gathering</span> as well to further refine the design.</p>

              <p>Since Wright/A22/Citaro are currently still under production, it would be nice if each of these model can come with only exterior assembled, then the teams to do mock up interiors see what can they do.</p>

              <p>Fine.</p>
              <p>You can go and register a company under GeBiz, bid for the
              tender with a bendy, and then you come back and tell us whether you
              win or not.</p>
              <p>If the Authority is really bandy-ing words as you seem to
              imagine, then good for you.</p>
              <p>If not they will just call your bid <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-compliant</span> and out you
              go.</p>

              <p>Simple - when they use computer to see your commuter pattern,

              <p>Now get hand dirty, you all will say wayang and too

              <p>Case of damned if you do, damned if you don't.</p>
              <p>I may also add that the mock-up can be used for bus fans to give
                                  their hundred and one opinions. Can open up to public to touch and
                                  rub and poke and give comments ma.</p>
              <p>Wasn't that what good sgbuses had already mentioned in an
                                  earlier post??</p>
              <p>Sgbuses - I can never understand why you wanna share such tasty
                                  news nuggets to these people. Clearly they don't bother reading
                                  carefully whatever you post.</p>
              <p>I don't care about being popular, but it bothers me slightly
                                  when people try to share good things, and it gets very
                                  underwhelming responses.</p>

              <p>I was hoping to set the record straight with solid information to clear the high seas of rumours and disinformation prevalent in this community. I was expecting older folks with some institutional knowledge to offer some useful comment.</p>
              <p>Clearly, I was wrong. There are lobbyists who even belittle the significance of this news.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the only explanation is that we now live in a new generation of young lobbyists who possess zero institutional knowledge (because it no longer exists) and assume that they know everything. Hence the responses which IMO is worse than asking any passerby who possess no prior knowledge of buses.</p>
              <p>I truly fear for Singapore's future of public bus transportation.</p>
