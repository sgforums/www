I agree that the current bus services is more than adequate to cope with the students. The bus companies should focus more on beefing up the frequencies rather than introduce new services. Furthermore, if new service(s) are to be introduce, for the sake of students per se, these services will become redundant come the school holidays in particular.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my idea, some colleges/polys served by a little more services would be easier for the students. the timings can be adjusted during the jc/poly holidays, especially in future the holiday timing is different.<br><br>MI have a swing in enrolment as i got to know from my juniors who were there for the first three months. the size balloons to about 1000+ ppl for year 1s, then deflates to 200+ after first three months. they'll be shifting to bukit batok east ave 3 when the building's complete, any bus services serving that road and how is its frequency? i hope it's not as lousy as that at the present toh tuck campus. in future when "first three months" becomes a historical phrase, we can have a suitable timing for the students there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i'll extend the topic to include the universities then. smu's having a city campus meaning it's going to be well serviced, even better than ntu and nus. how is the possiblity of some routes realigned? also the future national library can also have more routes to connect it to more parts of the island just like the former national library.</div>

Then it can do a U turn and go back to Clementi Road, following the usual 96 route.......Thereafter it can do a few rounds of 96, but bringing people to and from Dover station. After that it can terminate by doing the last trip from Dover station to Clementi Road, this time not turning into Kent Ridge Cresent but going straight on to Kent Ridge Terminal.<br><br></div></blockquote>Just extend SBST 32 or 145 to Kent Ridge via Commonwealth Ave West and Clementi Road....  Unfortunately that was rejected by SBST.</div>
