              <p>History questions again.</p>
              <p>1) In the early 1990s' when the old Boon Lay Int and MRT just opened, the area around it was still undeveloped and all services started their trips by turning right from the interchange as it was the only way out. And from the mid 1990s' the area started to develop and new roads were being built. So which bus service was the first one to amend its route by turning left from the interchange and ply the newly paved road?</p>
              <p>2) During somewhere in between late 2006 and early 2007 four services from Bukit Merah: 123, 139, 153 and 198 have their boarding berths relocated to a bus temperaory bus stop outside the multi stroey car park beside the interchange along Bukit Merah Central due to upgrading of their boarding berths inside the interchange. One of the services mentioned above was relocated first and the 3 remaining services followed suits weeks later. Identity the service which have its boarding berth relocated first.</p>
              <p>3) Which of the below mentioned trunk services from the old Ang Mo Kio bus interchange used to parked at the sawtooth berth?<br>25<br>86<br>133<br>135<br>166</p>
              <p>4) Name the only trunk service from Bukit Batok Interchange which used to parked in the sawtooth berth of the interchange during its SBS days.<br><br>5) Is it true that there were ever LO2X permers on Choa Chu Kang feeders 302 and 303 in the mid 1990s'?</p>
              <p>6) Are there any trunk services which parked at the sawtooth berths at the old Hougang South Interchange before its closure?</p>

              <p>Repost:<br> <br> Services A, B, C and D are single depot controlled. No 2 services

              I.<br> <br> Service A, after splitting with Service C, will proceed to its
              terminating point. without meeting anyone here, though it'll meet
              C, which is travelling at different direction for a short while
              before turning to its terminating point.<br> <br> Service B, after splitting with A and C, travels to its looping
              point together with D. At its looping point, it will meet A and C
              but A and C are going different direction. and all 4 will travel to
              till they reach Road J where C and D will split with A and B. After
              splitting A and B will travel with D, but this D is travelling at
              different direction. They will travel together until they reach F,
              D will split from them. B will travel with A until they reach MRT
              Station E, B will split with A, and will travel and will meet
              initially splitted C(that means the split before C proceeded to its
              looping point) and D which came out from F near MRT Station K.
              However B meets D only briefly and will split at a junction and
              travel with C at Road L. Both services will travel till they reach
              Road M where both will split. B will remain at Road M while C will
              turn into Road N and proceed to its looping point. After travelling
              alone for awhile(in this question's context), B meets D again at
              Road O and will travel together D till they reach Road P. Both will
              travel at same road name P but different ways. B will then proceed
              to its Terminating point.<br> <br> Service C, after splitting with A at Road I meets D at MRT Station

              will split with D, and does not meet D again until its looping
              point, which is the same as D.<br> <br> Service D, after splitting with A and C at Lorong H, accompanies B
              to its looping point. At Service B's looping point, D will
              meet <span style="line-height: 1.231;">A and C but A and C are
              going different direction. and all 4 will travel to till they reach

              flyover then the 2 services will split and respective terminating

              <p>History questions again.</p>
              <p>1) In the early 1990s' when the old Boon Lay Int and MRT just opened, the area around it was still undeveloped and all services started their trips by turning right from the interchange as it was the only way out. And from the mid 1990s' the area started to develop and new roads were being built. So which bus service was the first one to amend its route by turning left from the interchange and ply the newly paved road?</p>
              <p>2) During somewhere in between late 2006 and early 2007 four services from Bukit Merah: 123, 139, 153 and 198 have their boarding berths relocated to a bus temperaory bus stop outside the multi stroey car park beside the interchange along Bukit Merah Central due to upgrading of their boarding berths inside the interchange. One of the services mentioned above was relocated first and the 3 remaining services followed suits weeks later. Identity the service which have its boarding berth relocated first.</p>
              <p>3) Which of the below mentioned trunk services from the old Ang Mo Kio bus interchange used to parked at the sawtooth berth?<br>25<br>86<br>133<br>135<br>166</p>
              <p>4) Name the only trunk service from Bukit Batok Interchange which used to parked in the sawtooth berth of the interchange during its SBS days.<br><br>5) Is it true that there were ever LO2X permers on Choa Chu Kang feeders 302 and 303 in the mid 1990s'?</p>
              <p>6) Are there any trunk services which parked at the sawtooth berths at the old Hougang South Interchange before its closure?</p>
