              1) 10 years ago, this service A was withdrawn due to rationalization. Few years later, this svc  was introduced again connecting from Interchange B and C. This new service until present passed by its old neighbourhood where Service A used to ply before it was withdrawn. 
              
              Name this service.
              
              2) This service D in the late 1990s was from TIBS. It was withdrawn during the TIBS era before the merger with SMRT. Then some years back this service was introduced as a SBST Trunk Svc and it passed by Expressway F as part of its route. 
              
              Name this service
              
              3) This service was renumbered some years back but the route remains the same till present. the original number was introduced as a SBST Trunk svc like Service D, This service passed by an Expressway as part of its route. What is the service number of the original service?
              
              4) This service G was part of the MRT Rationalization, its route was shortened 10 years ago to loop at this place. Few years ago, this route was amended to terminate at Terminal H. The route before rationalization and after rationalization remains the same but only slight modification towards the end. 
              
              What is this service?
              
              5) This Service was given to TIBS in 2000, this service like Service G was amended to loop at this place due to rationalization. Few years ago, this service was told to terminate at Terminal I. What is this service? Till now it is still under SMRT
              
              6) This service was amended to terminate at Interchange J due to rationalization, few years ago when the interchange became air-conditioned, this service was told to loop around Interchange J instead of terminating there. There are 2 service with consecutive numbers that once ended at Interchange J.
              
              Ok history lesson time, no hints given, all hints on the question itself.
