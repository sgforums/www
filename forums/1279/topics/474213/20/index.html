              <p>New year's eve question! In celebration of 2014. </p>
              <p>Svc A is a loop svc. One digit of its service number can be
              found by adding up the digits of the new year. It meets up with
              three services here throughout its route.</p>
              <p>Svc B is quite closely related to svc A. It runs parallel to it
              from svc A's looping point to a junction near a well-known old
              overhead bridge. It then meets with svc A at two places: one near
              an MRT station; and secondly at a place where a BSEP svc
              plies. </p>
              <p>Svc C shares one of its terminus with another svc here. Its
              fleet currently holds a special DD that used to belong to another
              svc terminating at the terminus of two other svcs here. It meets
              svc E somewhere along its route. </p>
              <p>Svc D shares both of its terminus with one other svc here each.
              It is also the only SMRT svc at one of its ends. It meets with a
              svc that has the same two ending points with another svc here near
              a reservoir. </p>
              <p>Svc E takes express sectors and while on an expressway it passes
              through the terminating point of two svcs here. At its looping
              point it meets with svc C. </p>
              <p>Svc F does not meet with any of the svcs here, however one of
              its terminus has a svc terminating at the terminus of some svcs
              here. Lots of army beng take this service.  </p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Svc A is a loop svc. One digit of its service number can be found
              by adding up the digits of the new year. It meets up with three
              services here throughout its route.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Svc B is quite closely related to svc A. It runs parallel to it
              from svc A's looping point to a junction near a well-known old
              overhead bridge. It then meets with svc A at two places: one near
              an MRT station; and secondly at a place where a BSEP svc
              plies. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Svc <strong>31</strong> shares one of its terminus with another svc
              here. Its fleet currently holds <strong>the only CDGE
              B10TL </strong>that used to belong to another svc terminating
              at the terminus of two other svcs here. It meets svc E somewhere
              along its route. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Svc <strong>169 </strong>shares both of its terminus with one
              other svc here each. It is also the only SMRT svc at one of its
              ends. It meets with a svc that has the same two ending points with
              another svc here near a reservoir. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Svc E takes express sectors and while on an expressway it passes
              through the terminating point of two svcs here. At its looping
              point it meets with svc <strong>31</strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Svc F does not meet with any of the svcs here, however one of its
