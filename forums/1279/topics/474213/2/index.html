              <p>Don't be daft. 882 does NOT need fleet add. Go and look at the svc. Even during peak hours the bus isn't half filled. Leave alone off-peak. And that svc is not for the HDB residents there since it's only max 3 stops. 882 main load comes from Sembawang Park and the camp sites there, which unfortunately does not give much load to svc 882. I find its fleet more than alright, it is okay as of status quo since this svc is more or less like svc 84 and that svc only has 1 perm.Â </p>

              <p>The Montreal Dr residents seldom take 882. They rather take the faster and more frequent 169 from Yishun instead. I know this coz I take 169 sometimes. Many board at Yishun and alight at Montreal Dr there. Now I ask you: imagine you are a white collar office worker. Would you save one MRT stop and board 169 right outside the station which comes at 9 mins per bus during peak, or take to Sembawang, walk to the int, wait 16 mins and go a big round before returning home?</p>
              <p>As for those at Wellington Circle, well most just chose to walk since by the time the bus comes they would alr be nearly home.Â </p>
              <p>Regarding your question on whether poor freq is caused by low demand... Idk, but if it is really so then adding buses will just be a further waste of resource.Â </p>

              <p>354 is different. Look at how many people go to Downtown East everyday. And now even the tourists occupy a large proportion too. When you go to PSR MRT you will know why 354 is so crowded. Why? Coz of the signs there. At the station big words saying "Take svc 354 to Downtown East" can be clearly seen around the information counter. And also at the int too. "354: Downtown East/Jln Loyang Besar" and for those who don't stay at PSR (which is the majority of Downtown East visitors) will not know Downtown east is within walking distance and there are at least 3 other alt svcs to get there. It's thanks to this tactic that svc 354 gets to survive and in fact receive fleet add.Â </p>
              <p>But 882 is different. Why did I compare to 84? Becoz both buses well served the faraway northern ends of Singapore. And both pass by parks and only served that bit of HDB. And not to forget, both has little perms and horrible freq. Using svc 84 I am trying to say that 882 DOES have demand, but that it does not need more buses becoz the current fleet is handling the pax well.Â </p>

              <p>354 is different. Look at how many people go to Downtown East
              everyday. And now even the tourists occupy a large proportion too.
              When you go to PSR MRT you will know why 354 is so crowded. Why?
              Coz of the signs there. At the station big words saying "Take svc
              354 to Downtown East" can be clearly seen around the information
              counter. And also at the int too. "354: Downtown East/Jln Loyang
              Besar" and for those who don't stay at PSR (which is the majority
              of Downtown East visitors) will not know Downtown east is within
              walking distance and there are at least 3 other alt svcs to get
              there. It's thanks to this tactic that svc 354 gets to survive and
              in fact receive fleet add.Â </p>
              <p>But 882 is different. Why did I compare to 84? Becoz both buses
              well served the faraway northern ends of Singapore. And both pass
              by parks and only served that bit of HDB. And not to forget, both
              has little perms and horrible freq. Using svc 84 I am trying to say
              that 882 DOES have demand, but that it does not need more buses
              becoz the current fleet is handling the pax well.Â </p>

              <p>882 provides the link formerly covered by 167 and 84 provides the link formerly covered by 82.</p>
              <p>BTOs on both SBW and PGL would most likely to affect 882 and 84 respectively</p>
