              <p>Yes I may not have done my Maths properly, I have not phrase the question properly and as a result cause confusion between my expected answer and the given answer, but from the way you speak it seems like you are acting like you are my supervisor somehow, and if I further elaborate on it it is definitely going to get overboard.</p>
              <p>The sentence "why you alway like to act smart" is actually a direct insult to people who do not phrase their questions properly (I believe many people have some unexpected mistakes when creating questions in previous topics of the same kind)...even if this is a different situation compared to other types of questions, but I guess the same logic still applies. Is this even a place for people to simply rephrase questions for the purpose of pretending to know everything?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I am just opening a question here and I don't see the point why the question will make me smarter (especially when people is able to answer the question at first glance correctly, based on your correct logic), how are you going to explain with your sentence that opening questions will make me smarter?</p>
              <p>By doing so you have also make me feel as if you have the right to interfere in my affairs, regardless of whether it is right or wrong. I don't even sense the existence of freedom in this forums - you may want to say that I should be responsible, but that's another story.</p>
              <p>Right now, I don't want to hear anymore of this kind of comments here that will eventually result in a war, in fact I don't ever see signs of a war in this kind of topic in ages.</p>

              <p>dun post those illogical things... think before you post (dun
              keep think that SBST's poster have no space to input more WAB
              service number) ... dun post for the sake of post... some posts
              just make ppl think u r stupid.... i am very frank on this...n many
              ppl think this way as well...</p>

              <p>If you are still thinking that I am just posting for the sake for posting as per what you see out of me since 1.5 years ago, that is surely going to be a sign of disappointment and sadness as well. I don't really see the reason why people can't just see through the differences.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you first, the first point that I posted as such is out of unexplainable doubt, and eventually some other ignorant facts and posts may have aggravated you, but if the main logic is actually wrong how can I bear the full responsibility?</p>
              <p>In summary of all this, I don't wish for people to think that this forums is becoming a place for wrongful act of comments against ignorant posts...you can't expect people to know everything and don't use the wrong way to correct them (I'm sure you know what I mean). I also don't want to see another sort of 'vengeful flaming acts' that started out somewhere during the time I joined this forums.</p>
