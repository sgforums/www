              <p>Random Quiz:</p>
              <p>There are two bus services (A and B) which are controlled by the same depot. A travels parallel with B till Road C, although Service A skips some stops. From Road C, B will leave A, which goes onto Expressway G at Exit H (Service A). Although they separate, B will come onto Expressway G, but by Exit I. B will leave Expressway G by Exit J and A will stay on the expressway, until Exit K. A will go express along Road L and will meet B again at Road M. B will terminate at Interchange N, but A will pass Interchange N and head to its terminating point.</p>

              <p>This question is very difficult unlike last one of yours. The hints you have given do not really lead to the answer. Also, different ways to interpret the question. Is A the looping service or C that meets at Road D? Are you saying A will proceed to its terminating point or C after meeting B?</p>
              <p>The point on terraces is very vague... Also center can be even Tampines CC is a center.... so many of them in every town... So specify something stronger over here...</p>

              <p>I meant like 868, 951E, but this service is not a Weekday AM/PM peak express... Also, it stops at normal bus stops, just skipping certain ones... It's also bi-directional</p>

              different ways to interpret the question. Is A the looping service
              or C that meets at Road D? Are you saying A will proceed to its
              terminating point or C after meeting B?</p>

              If it's Shopping Centre I would've said Shopping Centre. If it's Community Centre I would've said Community Centre. The name of the place is something centre.
