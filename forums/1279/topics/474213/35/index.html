              <p>A, B, C are three consecutive services. B meets C at a T junction, and then both travel together meeting A at Road D and then all three travel together until stop near MRT E. Here, C takes right and will not meet A, B again while A and B continue to travel together until MRT F where A turns left and travels some distance after which it meets B again only for one stop. After this stop A turns right and goes to it's looping point where it is the only service.</p>
              <p>A is single depot controlled, B and C are dual depot controlled. All three services have NO depot in common. Identify all letters.</p>
