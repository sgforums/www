              <p>Question:<br>A and B are from the same interchange D while B and C are from the same interchange E too while C is a loop service. All 3 are SBS Transit services and all are single depot controlled services from different depots/bus parks. Area covered is West, South and City area.</p>
              <p>After leaving interchange D, A and B travels together until a traffic junction where A turns left and B turns right to continue its journey and A and B doesn't meet again in their journey. After travelling some distance A meets C and both travels together for a distance until a traffic junction where A goes straight and C turns right.</p>
