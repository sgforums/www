              <p>I find it ironic that we have to pay for the EZ Link Card.</p>
              <p>This system was implemented for the convenience of the transport service providers. They should actually give out the card free, for commuters to top up and use the "public' transport. After all it is for their convenience.</p>
              <p>Now we have the EZ Reload.</p>
              <p>One time application fee of $1.50? Each auto top up $0.25?</p>
              <p>Shouldn't they be like some bank, that charges for over-the-counter service for their electronic banking accounts, but do not charge for transactions done electronically?</p>
              <p>Giro lessens the work of the ticketing booth staff.</p>
              <p>We pay for the service providers' convenience?</p>

              <p>LTA (administered by TransitLink) does not charge for GIRO, but charges 25 cents for credit-card auto top-ups.</p>
              <p>Too bad LTA does not issue Adult CEPAS cards, otherwise we would also have free GIRO auto top-ups.</p>
              <p>I wonder what NETS might have in store once CEPAS FlashPay is open to the general public. Right now, topping up NETS FlashPay can only be done at selected outlets and Transitlink Office Counters.</p>

              <p>Don't you get the realization that we all were conned into accepting this EZ Link card system.</p>
              <p>First it was a "refundable deposit" of $5.00 for the card. To start off, only $3.00 for early birds and to gain acceptance.</p>
              <p>Then, a life span for the cards was introduced. This life span incidentally is stretchable.</p>
              <p>Now we are made to buy the card to use for their convenience, (but presented as for our convenience).</p>
              <p>I don't think the Corporate honchos were short sighted when they implemented the EZ Link fare collection system. The whole thing was phased for our acceptance.</p>

              <p>Changed my last EZlink. A Giro linked card. I have two other cards changed earlier.</p>
              <p>Decided not to link the new card with Giro because I do not like the deal.</p>
              <p>But on second thought, I feel I should take the application fee waiver and have the Giro  top up facililty, just in case. Giro top up enabled cards can still be top uped manually, thus saving the 25cents charge for each auto top up. Giro for when caught in <em>bo pian</em> situations only.</p>

              <p><strong>NE</strong><strong>TS launches FlashPay card that allows payments for transport, retail services</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Electronic payment provider NETS has launched a new
              smartcard called the FlashPay card offering Singaporeans more cashless
              payment possibilities.
              <br> <br> The new stored-value card promises to bring convenience in a flash.
              <br> <br> The NETS FlashPay card can be used for public transport, ERP gantries and carparks, as well as at over 2,500 retail outlets.
              <br> <br> NETS currently has 37,000 merchant partners with some 2,500 of them already FlashPay enabled.
              <br> <br> Singapore's other smartcard, EZ-Link has about 70 merchant partners.
              <br> <br>In a statement issued to MediaCorp, Ez-Link said it welcomes the
              competition and we believe that competition is good for the industry.
              <br> <br>With the launch of this new card, NETS is hoping to tap into small
              value payments at convenience stores, food and retail outlets and
              supermarkets. <br> <br> It estimates that about S$1 billion worth of cash-based transactions in
              this segment could be converted into electronic payments.
              <br> <br> The CEPAS-enabled FlashPay card can store a value of up to S$500.
              <br> <br> It's also the company's entry into the S$1.3 billion transit market where it's confident of capturing a significant share.
              <br> <br>The company is also working with banks to roll out ATM and debit
              cards that will be integrated with FlashPay's stored value capacity.
              <br> <br> OCBC and UOB banks will start issuing these cards in November while DBS bank will issue theirs in March next year.
              <br> <br> This unique feature is a world first and will allow cardholders to top up while they pay for purchases.
              <br> <br>Poh Mui Hoon, chief executive officer, NETS, said: "We look at it
              as a lifestyle card in the sense that we look at what our consumers
              will need in their busy lives and how we can make it easier for them.
              We also look at our merchants and how do we make their business
              easier."
              <br> <br>To celebrate the launch, the company is offering cards with S$5 of
              bonus transit value and you get a S$7 bonus if the card is purchased at
              iNETS kiosks.
              <br> <br> The promotion runs while stocks last.
              <br> <br>Each card also comes with a complimentary one-year insurance of up
              to S$20 for lost cards and up to S$5,000 for permanent disability due
              to a public transport accident.<br> </span></p>

              <p>Don't you get the realization that we all were conned into accepting this EZ Link card system.</p>
              <p>First it was a "refundable deposit" of $5.00 for the card. To start off, only $3.00 for early birds and to gain acceptance.</p>
              <p>Then, a life span for the cards was introduced. This life span incidentally is stretchable.</p>

              <p>I don't think the Corporate honchos were short sighted when they implemented the EZ Link fare collection system. The whole thing was phased for our acceptance.</p>
