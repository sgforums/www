Initially the all GREEN theme was a refreshing change from TIB's traditional egg-white yellow theme of all the jap buses. But it turned out that the green was only suitable on the boxy MB's because it can get real unsightly if not properly cleaned like in the DAF's and Scania's (terrible). So they experimented with the blue-orange theme of the Habits and the white with the 21 Volgren Citaro G's and 2 Lance 245's.<br><br>Actually at first I thought the Habit interior looked like some brightly furbished public washroom especially with the deodorant which smelled like some toilet deodorant in those colours. The light blue really looked like a wall colour in some toilet in east coast park or some other public park (cant remember which one) combined with the bright orange cubicle door frames. But now used to it liao and quite grew to like it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, I agree. The Hino Volgrens have special one-of-a-kind seats, they are the only buses with these seats. As far as I remember, the only TIBS MB405 Bus which had such seats was TIB 505 T. Sadly, after the refurbishment of seats in TIBS Buses, TIB 505 T no longer sports such a unique interior anymore, but the usual, green coloured pattern seats in every TIBS Bus. The Hino Volgren's comfort level, I have to agree, is one of the best: Cool, yet quiet air-cons, peaceful engines(listen to 927 as it cruises the KJE to the zoo), and stylish, black doors with both a nice interior and exterior.<br><br>By the way, I saw a Scania L113 ELBO leaving Yishun Interchange, it was on Service 857. Really rare, TIBS usually puts Scania L113's on this route at the most, but it's the first time I have seen an ELBO on this route. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It was and i think it is still perm on svc 855, and is one of my favourite 0405s, and it kenna converted late last yr to the normal seats.....Hope TIBS doesnt does that to the Hinos!<br><br>When 954 appeared on svc 852 one afternoon last term instead of the Lance 211, many regular pax ( students mainly ) were rather thrilled by it, the reason is that the engine emits minimal heat unlike the C211 engine, and it is a refreshing break for the ears as it is much smoother, quieter with significantly less vibration than the Lances. The only fault that i can find is that it is not damped enough...there is still a bit of light oscillation when the bus goes over the bumps.</div>

Too bad if you don't like them. If I feel comfortable enough along Lentor Ave and Lornie Rd it should be good enough along the CTE. At least it can accelerate faster than pathetic B10TLs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pathetic ? We have a different view of the word " Pathetic ".<br><br>Riding on the Lance 211 especially sitting at a rear is very hot !! . The faster it goes , the hotter the rear is and the air con at the rear is one of thw worst i ever seen . How some people can tahan the sitting at the back for long journeys I really wonder.  Same goes to Scania OAC ,the bus is shakey never mind  if the air con is cold , I wouldnt be complaining so much about the bus , you know it .  Why do  I dislike the bus ?  Mainly because its too shakey and often I get headache riding on long journeys . Volvo buses pathetic ? At least they are more comfortable , better air con then the ones that the bus that i just mention .<br><br>Just my 2 cents .<br><br>Back to the topic<br><br>I dont like SBS refublished buses , i find them "boring" . I hope they do not do the same thing to the mark 4s and the first generation VOs .</div>
