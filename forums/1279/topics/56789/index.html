The old carpet-like aircon bins is so-so lousy. At least the aircon is better with the new bins. However, if u wish to sit on an unrefurbished Mark 3, fret not. Hop on Service 18 or 31. There's one left. I think it's SBS857.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

However, the solvent smell in an enclosed Mk3 just after retrofitting leaves much to be desired.<br><br>The seats are all quite modern and up-to-date actually, i can't think of any other colours that would suit SBST's purpose......unless u want the yucky and butt pain vogelsitze seats that are used on TIBS that dun even have cushion.....At least the refurbished seats got more cushion than the old blue or green seats<br><br>According to my knowledge, there is one unrefurbished Mk3 based at BNDEP? I think, and another at BBDEP. The one at BBDEP often serves svc 170, maybe i keep a lookout for it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

Air con not cold on a HOT sunny day when one is sweating like mad, that is something worth making noise about. Interior is indeed ugly, TIBS interiors are much nicer-decorated IMO. Just look at the amount of PURPLE/RED in refurbished SBST buses.</div>
