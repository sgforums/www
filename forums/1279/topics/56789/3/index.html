We have a different view of the word " Pathetic ".<br><br>Riding on the Lance 211 especially sitting at a rear is very hot !! . The faster it goes , the hotter the rear is and the air con at the rear is one of thw worst i ever seen . How some people can tahan the sitting at the back for long journeys I really wonder.  Same goes to Scania OAC ,the bus is shakey never mind  if the air con is cold , I wouldnt be complaining so much about the bus , you know it .  Why do  I dislike the bus ?  Mainly because its too shakey and often I get headache riding on long journeys . Volvo buses pathetic ? At least they are more comfortable , better air con then the ones that the bus that i just mention .<br><br>Just my 2 cents .<br><br>Back to the topic<br><br>I dont like SBS refublished buses , i find them "boring" . I hope they do not do the same thing to the mark 4s and the first generation VOs . </div></blockquote>For me, the faster the Lance 211 goes, the colder and smoother it gets. That's from my experiences. If I were you I'd gladly take an OAC N113CRB for long journey, rather than a B10M Mk III. At least the N113CRB has a much colder a/c and is not as insipid as the Mk III.<br><br>With regards to refurbishment, the purple turns me off. The gray used in CAC O405s and N113CRBs are much better, IMO. Less eyesore.</div>

However, the heat vs speed curve is definitely concave upwards.....ie the rate of heat increase increases with the speed. As the A/C control is fixed, the transmission to the A/C belt should be constant, hence it does not get colder, rather, due to the engine heat from the rear, the interior temp remains const at the front, but rises towards the rear, that's why drivers dun know the bus at the rear is so damn hot.<br><br>I agree with you, Scanias make a better choice for long haul than MK IIIs, but i prefer svc 39 Mk IIIs to LAnce 211s any time</div>

At least the gray shades brighten up the bus interior and blends well with the light coloured interior wall, not too contrasting compared to the purple ones.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

How many times must I tell you the engine heat is not cause by the engine but by LTA's stupid idealogy of "Singapore is too small to support high-speed bus services so we shall govern all our buses to 60km/h). I'd take any bus except a Mk III if so possible.</div>
