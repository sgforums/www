              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I'm new here and would like to learn more.</p>
              <p>I have a question. I have noticed that for the earlier KUBs, namely with rego starting 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, and earlier 85s, that the engine sounds different when decelerating from gear 5 and above. When they decelerate from gear 5 or above, it sounds as if someone had stepped on the clutch in a manual transmission bus, semmingly like free wheeling. They used to shift down gear by gear down to gear 2, but now all of them are like that.</p>
              <p>As for the later 85s, 86, 87, 88, 89, 50, 51 regos, the engline is perfectly alright. I would like to find out more about this issue, cause when these buses came out in 2008, they didn't sound like that.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, SBST should not have tampered with the engine, and most irritatingly, the KUB horn, which I am sure we all miss.</p>

              <p>I feel that the bus is quieter that way.</p>
              <p>It's noisy enough when accelerating, plus that really awful radiator is headache-inducing.</p>
              <p>With all that noise already, I'm sure it's better to have quiet deceleration.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A quiet deceleration like most of the batch 1 (Euro 4) KUBs will translate to more stress on the friction brakes (the front axle's disc brakes). I too find that the design is to rely more on the friction brakes than the engine brake, although easier to control, somehow gives a stronger brake response (if stepping the brake using strength like on the older O405, passengers may fall down). However the disc brake would encounter more wear this way.</p></div>

              <p>The engine braking is only used for gears 5, 4 and 3. That's assuming you brake from 5th/6th. Typically the only time you get engine braking for 1st or 2nd is when you're in the respective gears when you brake.</p>
              <p>What I'm more curious is what appears to be a lack of clutch action for transition in 4th to 5th gear. If you had paid special attention, there is a lack of pause in this particular transition. Totally different from the rest of the transitions, including 5th to 6th. This is not only for the K230UBs but for all other buses using the ZF6. Also, correspondingly, the free-wheeling time in the transition from 5th to 4th is the longest, as well as the jerkiest, indicating a different set of actions before the clutch reconnects the engine with the gearbox.</p>
