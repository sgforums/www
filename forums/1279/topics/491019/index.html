              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, frequency for sbs 14 is it as follows. 6.30-8.30am -10-13 min. Quite accurate to your 10 mins. But from 8.31am to 4.59pm, it is 7-16 min. So I put it as average 11.5min. Not 15 min as what you state. Frequency is certainly not that bad until 15 mins. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, I checked it from SBST. That is why I find huge discrepancies between posts by others and the site. So as a point to all users, please also take note to check the companies site or app before basing on your trips or observances which may not be that accurate. Cheers. Thank.</p>

              <p>I feel the frequencies reported on company websites are NOT accurate. This is from personal experience. Sv 14 for instance I am confident of how the frequency works. During school timing in afternoon, there is time slot when 2-3 buses are departed at 7-8 min interval, but rest of the time, frequency off-peak remains at 15-18 mins.</p>
              <p>Also company website usually have not taken into account the traffic condition. The frequency is based on regular travel time, and many times traffic/road conditions change and it does not get reflected immediately. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, you cannot say that you are more accurate than the company sites/apps. Many people all over singapore are looking at the frequencies. Have they been wrong, they will have been lambasted badly by the general public. They are divided into 4 different timing zones. 6.30-8.30am, 8.31am-4.59pm, 5-7pm, after 7pm. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I am sorry if you don't agree. It is everyone's personal observation here. I also feel you do not understand how frequency works. Let me explain you.</p>
              <p>sv 87 has 05 min departure frequency from Bedok Interchange between 5.15 - 5.50pm, after which frequency drops to 10 mins. This means if you observe at HCI at 5.15 the frequency will not be 05 mins but will be at 10 mins. Likewise at Kaki Bukit the frequency at 6pm will be 05 mins but at 6.30pm will already start becoming 10 mins. </p>
              <p>Hence, this is just to reflect our personal observations of services tracked on regular basis.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, your sort of frequency is quite subjective type. So you should indicate service frequency at certain timings in your subject in this thread. This is to prevent people from mistaking that it is the actual frequency of a particular bus service. For me, I rather trust the bus companies frequencies. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, you cannot say that you are more accurate than the company sites/apps. Many people all over singapore are looking at the frequencies. Have they been wrong, they will have been lambasted badly by the general public. They are divided into 4 different timing zones. 6.30-8.30am, 8.31am-4.59pm, 5-7pm, after 7pm. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The 4 time zones are for general services and may not be that applicable for some specific services. For example, those services passing by educational institutions (whether it is primary/secondary schools/JC, or poly / ITE / universities) usually have a different peak hour compared to most services, as students travel at different timings compared to working crowds. Thus some services maintain high frequency until 9am or even 10am. In this case, the general "8.31am-4.59pm" do not accurately reflect its frequency during off-peak hours.  (Same case for PM, just look at let's say 158A)</p>
              <p>Moreover, what I was suggesting above was to check the timetables (arrival/departure times) for specific services - you need to go to SBST website, click on route details, and click on specific bus stops to check their timetables. Not the 4-column table with these 4 categories only.</p>

              "7-16" because 7 mins is the minimum time interval. But this
              doesn't mean that svc 14 is running at a frequency of 7 mins, or
              11.5 mins, all the while from 0831 to 1659.</p>
              <p>In short, always check specific timetables for more detailed
              frequencies and timings, not just based on the 4 generic time
              zones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Additionally, even with these departure timings from SBST
              website, you can never say they will be the real departure timings
              from interchanges/terminals. There can be various reasons for trips
              to be delayed, added or cancelled.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, that is why I say must put Service frequency at certain timings in the subject title thread. If not, by just putting as Service frequencies, it may mislead people to represent average frequencies for services. This will imply the 4 column table which sbs transit used. Hope you understand. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr proudtobeme, the frequencies stated on website are true. The number of buses is fixed. The bus companies put the frequencies at 4 different categories of timings and cater the required number of buses for the specified timing. </p>
              <p>What mr busanalayser is referring to is the frequencies for the services at certain 1-2 hrs zoning. What sbs transit is using is the range of frequencies according to the 4 different categories. Note that there is a difference in the way the two parties view 'frequencies'. </p>
              <p>Frequencies of feeder sbs 382 and 386 in Punggol is about 10 min per bus. Read from the LTA release that there is a higher standard for feeder services. By 2017, all feeder services (I mean 100%) have to meet stringent quota of 8 min or less. No joke. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p><br> The 4 time zones are for general services and may not be that
              applicable for some specific services. For example, those services
              passing by educational institutions (whether it is
              primary/secondary schools/JC, or poly / ITE / universities) usually
              have a different peak hour compared to most services, as students
              travel at different timings compared to working crowds. Thus some
              services maintain high frequency until 9am or even 10am. In this
              case, the general "8.31am-4.59pm" do not accurately reflect its
              frequency during off-peak hours.  (Same case for PM, just look
              at let's say 158A)</p>
              <p>Moreover, what I was suggesting above was to check the
              timetables (arrival/departure times) for specific services -
              you need to go to SBST website, click on route details, and click
              on specific bus stops to check their timetables. Not the 4-column
              table with these 4 categories only.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, this is where you are wrong. All sbs transit services use the 4 time zones to specify frequency ranges for bus services, irregardless of services passing by schools or not. For those passing by schools. The 4 times zones are just a representative of the frequency range. This means during a specific time zone, the frequency of 1 hr can be more than that of another hr. Which means from 8.31 to 4.59pm, 1-2pm may be more than 2-3pm, etc. However sbs transit will give a representative range such as 7-16 min. It just cannot possibly give a frequency range to represent every hour. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
