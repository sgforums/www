              compared at Sembawang where rest time is around 11-22 mins.The paid

              <p>Nobody cares. You're assisting in this by intervening in this matter.<br>Don't feed the trolls. Thanks.<br><br>Some frequencies of bus services I've observed during weekdays peak hours.<br><br><strong>50 Bishan: AM</strong><br><strong>10 - 13 minutes</strong><br>Frequent bunching, with some 22 minutes headway between groups.</p>
              <p><strong>58 Bishan: PM<br>6 - 13 minutes.</strong> Kinda disappointing that the bus after 13 minutes wait is an SD while DDs have a headway of 6 minutes.</p>
              <p><strong>70 Yio Chu Kang: PM<br>9 - 13 minutes,</strong> with some buses doing B07*. <br><br><strong>78 Jurong East: PM<br>4 - 9 minutes, </strong>doing well.<br><br><strong>106 Shenton Way: PM<br>10 - 15 minutes,</strong> but fresh buses should be supplemented to Shenton Way so the frequency on the opposite direction isn't this bad.<br><br><strong>173 Bukit Batok: PM<br></strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>13 - 15 minutes,</strong> god bless you.<br></span></p>

              <p>Hi mr ihate853, you can continue with your tirade. Everybody knows you create a new nickname just to pick on me. So no matter what I say, you will be there to nitpick on it. I know my conscience is clear. The facts are there for all to see. Already let bygones be bygones. Cheers and good luck in your future endeavours. No point talking to somebody who creates such a nickname as a false pretense on the front. Cheers. Thanks. Goodbye.</p>
