The yellowish handstraps really attracted me too!<br><br>- CSS727 using one-door minibus with manual gear; from AMK to Airport during the early 80s... and I remembered CSS introduced svc737,747,757 to and from Airport is it??<br><br>- Buses with a ticket conductor in the early 80s...and they would come to u, punch a hole in your ticket...and they even provide change!! I was attracted to the double-sided stainless steel ticket holder that holds many different colours of tickets together using a special rubber band in the middle of the ticket holder and also the ticket puncher(resembles a plier).<br><br>- I even remembered taking SBS svc64 in the early 80s,,,and the driver drives into the fuel station midway to top-up the fuel!!!<br><br>- And the coin boxes on OMO buses in the early 80s...The top of the coin-box is made of transparent plastic. You drop the coins into the box with a cringing sound, as the coins land on the stainless steel horizontal surface of the coin box. Then the driver activates the lever; the stainless steel surface depress and the coins drop into the box! I've seen a couple of such coin-boxes on Scheme B buses...<br><br>- I remembered the early ticket machine since its introduction on svc 130...The ticket paper was white, thicker than the current ones, with a longitudinal rectangle shape..and when the ticket is dispensed, it is "protruded/cantilevered out" from the machine??....but this type of machine only serviced for a short period of time b4 being replaced by the normal one that was used till the late 90s..<br><br></div>

I remember some of these private buses running on SBS routes.</div>

And the rear roor is located at the rear; in front of the rear bench seats. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
