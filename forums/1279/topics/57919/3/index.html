Okay hold your breath and see below.<br><br>1. One or two B57's were fitted with driver a/c units. Appeared on some bedok/tampines feeder services.<br><br>2. At least ONE B57 had its interior refurbished. I did not manage to catch the rego but it was sometime between 1993 - 1996. I saw it outside the Ngee Ann Poly bus stop while I was going home from school at Ngee Ann. Hence it would be one of the SBS (including ex-SBS) services currently plying that bus stop. The interior was refurbished to the original SBS DM/O405 scheme (blue floor, new seats with blue cushion cover and thick plastic handles, grey walls, white ceiling)</div></blockquote>yes u r right. i see that bus all the time when i go to sch (sec sch that is) . uh it serves bus 202 in fact. i did not get the rego but i vaguely remember it was SBS4720<br><br>ZYX<br></div>

Buses have a habit of waiting at bus stops for passengers.<br><br>Unlike in Singapore, farecards for buses cannot be used on trains. And different bus companies have different farecards.<br><br>There is no proper bus/train guide.
