Okay hold your breath and see below.<br><br>1. One or two B57's were fitted with driver a/c units. Appeared on some bedok/tampines feeder services.<br><br>2. At least ONE B57 had its interior refurbished. I did not manage to catch the rego but it was sometime between 1993 - 1996. I saw it outside the Ngee Ann Poly bus stop while I was going home from school at Ngee Ann. Hence it would be one of the SBS (including ex-SBS) services currently plying that bus stop. The interior was refurbished to the original SBS DM/O405 scheme (blue floor, new seats with blue cushion cover and thick plastic handles, grey walls, white ceiling)</div>

Usually, we would take sv. 7, which was shorter, but I pestered my dad until he obliged.<br><br>At first, I was filled with glee. Slowly, the bus got very crowded. The mid-day sun was scorching and the a/c lost its effectiveness.

They have their own unique characteristics which are missing in the newer buses. Some of my favourites:<br><br>Albion Viking EVK41L - Very loud engine. Crash gearbox which makes a loud crunch sound while changing gears. And when engaging 1st gear, there's a nice "DUNK!" sound.<br><br>Leyland Victory - Very fast. Only bus with semi-auto gears.  Love to see the driver flick through 'em. Most drivers 'flat-change' ie. keeping the gas pedal pressed while shifting gears, resulting in  jerky movements and rapid engine / gearbox wear.<br><br>Merc O306 - Doors open and shut with a shocking slam. Nice high seats over the wheel arches.<br><br>Merc OF1413 - The DM bodied ones were re-fitted with auto gears. The torque converter makes a very loud howl.<br><br>Merc OF1417 - Nice, loud exhaust brakes.<br><br>Volvo B57 - ditto<br><br>Leyland Atlantean - They look clumsy but I like them. At speed, there's a ghostly whistle.<br><br>Merc O305 - Ah, the cream of the crop. Very powerful, very fast. Loud hub-reduction axle. Nice retarders too.</div>
