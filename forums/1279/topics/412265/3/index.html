              <p>I've got a feelings that BPJ Feeders will go to KJDEP while 700/700A to WLDEP cause WLDEP got many spare bendys to play with.As for 190 partly shared between WL &amp; KJ is better to ease the parking problems at KJDEP.925 to WLDEP also better.</p>

              <p>To conclude,</p>
              <p>Services 75 and 184 have their fleet reduction.</p>
              <p>75 only has 10 A/P buses + 7S, compared to 19 to 20 last
              time</p>
              <p>184 only has 6 A/P buses, compared to 8 A/P last time</p>
              <p>Encourage people to take 960 instead? Don't really understand
              why 184 needs fleet reduction. Last Sat I took 553D on 184, many

              <p>Since SMRT is into going green, by properly allocating their buses to start/end at their various depots, it will not only save their bottomline which can be used for staff incentive, buy better buses and also less work fatigue for SLs.<br>imagine for sv966, driving from WLDEP to Marine Parade Rd to layover till the shift starts!?<br>Wouldnt it be better for the SL to start from GLBP/AMDEP to get to Marine Parade Rd and start immediately rather than layover, it will allow the SL more rest and he be focused on the job of driving his commuters safely to their destination.<br><br>ACx<br></p>
