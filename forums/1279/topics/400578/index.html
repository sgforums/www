              <p>A Singaporean by the name of Ginny Chia has written to the Straits Times Forum today complaining about the inability of PRC bus drivers to communicate in English.</p>
              <p>She recounted a personal unpleasant experience with a PRC bus driver:</p>
              <p><em>“I write with great concern over my recent unpleasant incidents with SMRT’s bus drivers. On one occasion, I inquired if the bus – service 970 – would take me to Jalan Jurong Kechil, to which the bus driver, a Chinese national, simply shot me a blank stare. When I asked in Mandarin, he finally gave me a nod.”</em></p>
              <p>This is not the first time such a complaint is being aired publicly. The Straits Times Forum has received a deluge of letters from its readers over the last few months about the “attitude” of PRC bus drivers.</p>
              <p>Ms Chia is incensed that bus drivers who are unable to speak English are offered jobs in Singapore:</p>
              <p><em>“It is the basic role of bus drivers to not only drive along the correct routes but also be able to communicate with passengers. And is English not our working language? Are the information boards at bus stops not printed in English?”</em></p>
              <p>Despite some unhappiness from the commuters, Singapore bus companies continue to mass recruit bus drivers from China, the latest being a recruitment exercise launched in Chengdu two months ago.</p>
              <p>The news was reported in a Sichuan newspaper, but censored by the Singapore media. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/03/25/%e6%96%b0%e5%8a%a0%e5%9d%a1%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e5%88%b0%e6%88%90%e9%83%bd%e6%8b%9b%e8%81%98%e5%8f%b8%e6%9c%ba/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Ms Chia felt that the PRC bus drivers are employed due lower labor costs:</p>
              <p><em>“It may be cheaper to hire foreign labour; doing so may increase profits and make up for the decreasing number of Singaporeans who are willing to take on these jobs. However, it should in no way alienate the local community, many of whom do not understand Mandarin.”</em></p>
              <p>However, the reality is that they are offered comparable salaries to Singaporeans who will be otherwise keen to take up the job.</p>
              <p>According to the same Sichuan report, the PRC bus drivers are offered annual salaries ranging between RMB90,000 and RMB120,000 (approximately $1,562 – $2,082 monthly taking S$1 = RMB4.80) On top of the attractive wages, they are also given free lodging, transport allowances and medical insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>Not only are they offered attractive terms to work in Singapore, they are also eligible to apply for Singapore PR and eventually citizenship in Singapore which must be the only developed country in the world to give citizenships to bus drivers.</p>
              <p>With the PAP’s mass “integration” exercise underway, Ms Chia should consider herself fortunate that she understands basic Mandarin to communicate with the newcomers.</p>

              <p>To me,</p>
              <p>It is rather disingenious that these types of letters would always without fail, mention about how the inability of speaking English would affect the other races, or those who cannot understand Mandarin.</p>
              <p>I notice closely, that 9 out of 10 of these letters, are written by Chinese Singaporeans who are actually able to converse in Mandarin, and able to switch, but it is just that they are annoyed and prefer not to.</p>
              <p>Actually I do not wish to blame them if they insist on speaking in English as their preferred primary communication method, and I wont blame them if they insist that bus workers and other service providers should be bilingual and should be proficient in English. However, what I do blame them, is that they never want to say it out directly, but pretend and use other roundabout reasons to beautify their arguments and make them look better / look good in the mirror. So they always say "how about other races who cannot speak Mandarin / those who dont understand Mandarin", they always like to take up the mantle to be the spokespersons of some others, instead of directly telling their own personal objections.</p>
              <p>I think if they can write letters, they should tell the truth, and stop adding spices and flowers.</p>

              <p>I just would like to make a small and quick comment.</p>
              <p>To me,</p>
              <p>It is rather disingenious that these types of letters would always without fail, mention about how the inability of speaking English would affect the other races, or those who cannot understand Mandarin.</p>
              <p>I notice closely, that 9 out of 10 of these letters, are written by Chinese Singaporeans who are actually able to converse in Mandarin, and able to switch, but it is just that they are annoyed and prefer not to.</p>
              <p>Actually I do not wish to blame them if they insist on speaking in English as their preferred primary communication method, and I wont blame them if they insist that bus workers and other service providers should be bilingual and should be proficient in English. However, what I do blame them, is that they never want to say it out directly, but pretend and use other roundabout reasons to beautify their arguments and make them look better / look good in the mirror. So they always say "how about other races who cannot speak Mandarin / those who dont understand Mandarin", they always like to take up the mantle to be the spokespersons of some others, instead of directly telling their own personal objections.</p>
              <p>I think if they can write letters, they should tell the truth, and stop adding spices and flowers.</p>

              <p>There are after all other races in this country that commute by public bus the median language is thru English. </p>

              <h2><a title="Permanent Link to Another Singaporean complains about PRC bus drivers" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/05/26/another-singaporean-complains-about-prc-bus-drivers/"><span style="color: #778888;">Another Singaporean
              complains about PRC bus drivers</span></a></h2>
              <p>A Singaporean by the name of Ginny Chia has written to the
              Straits Times Forum today complaining about the inability of PRC
              bus drivers to communicate in English.</p>
              <p>She recounted a personal unpleasant experience with a PRC bus
              driver:</p>
              <p><em>“I write with great concern over my recent unpleasant
              incidents with SMRT’s bus drivers. On one occasion, I inquired if
              the bus – service 970 – would take me to Jalan Jurong Kechil, to
              which the bus driver, a Chinese national, simply shot me a blank
              stare. When I asked in Mandarin, he finally gave me a
              nod.”</em></p>
              <p>This is not the first time such a complaint is being aired
              publicly. The Straits Times Forum has received a deluge of letters
              from its readers over the last few months about the “attitude” of
              PRC bus drivers.</p>
              <p>Ms Chia is incensed that bus drivers who are unable to speak
              English are offered jobs in Singapore:</p>
              <p><em>“It is the basic role of bus drivers to not only drive along
              the correct routes but also be able to communicate with passengers.
              And is English not our working language? Are the information boards
              at bus stops not printed in English?”</em></p>
              <p>Despite some unhappiness from the commuters, Singapore bus
              companies continue to mass recruit bus drivers from China, the
              latest being a recruitment exercise launched in Chengdu two months
              ago.</p>
              <p>The news was reported in a Sichuan newspaper, but censored by
              the Singapore media. (read article <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/03/25/%e6%96%b0%e5%8a%a0%e5%9d%a1%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e5%88%b0%e6%88%90%e9%83%bd%e6%8b%9b%e8%81%98%e5%8f%b8%e6%9c%ba/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Ms Chia felt that the PRC bus drivers are employed due lower
              labor costs:</p>
              <p><em>“It may be cheaper to hire foreign labour; doing so may
              increase profits and make up for the decreasing number of
              Singaporeans who are willing to take on these jobs. However, it
              should in no way alienate the local community, many of whom do not
              understand Mandarin.”</em></p>
              <p>However, the reality is that they are offered comparable
              salaries to Singaporeans who will be otherwise keen to take up
              the job.</p>
              <p>According to the same Sichuan report, the PRC bus
              drivers are offered annual salaries ranging between RMB90,000
              and RMB120,000 (approximately $1,562 – $2,082 monthly taking S$1 =
              RMB4.80) On top of the attractive wages, they are also given free
              lodging, transport allowances and medical insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>Not only are they offered attractive terms to work in Singapore,
              they are also eligible to apply for Singapore PR and eventually
              citizenship in Singapore which must be the only developed country
              in the world to give citizenships to bus drivers.</p>
              <p>With the PAP’s mass “integration” exercise underway, Ms Chia
              should consider herself fortunate that she understands basic
              Mandarin to communicate with the newcomers.</p>
