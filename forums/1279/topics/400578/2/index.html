              <p>Look @ the bigger picture, plz.</p>
              <p>Imagine going to a MacDonalds and asking for "coke", N "less ice", and the counter staff goes "huh?". Maybe, we singaporeans are already too used to having English as our common median, but isn't that our 1st lang?</p>

              <p>This is time for the communters to stand up for themselves so that they are not bullied every time with fare increase and no service standard improvement.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The hiring of China BC are good because they drive quicker. However, SBST and SMRT should do more in providing them with training in English so that they can answer questions posed by commuters. China BC have another problem though, they do not seem to have the guts to ask a non-paying passenger to come forward and pay the fare and usually shrug it off. I am really perplexed by this. How can the PTOs earn money when more commuters are taking advantage of this ignorance? Rising fares are caused by these bastards who don't pay, because PTOs don't have enough money. When they don't have enough money, there will always be poor bus maintenance and no money to buy new buses! SBST should at least try to match up to KMB in terms of getting new buses!</p></div>
