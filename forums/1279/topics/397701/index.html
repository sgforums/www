              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I would like to know if there is anything that is making bus captains drive at a ridiculously low speed? That time i board 87. It was so slow that from the window, i can see this guy running pass us -.- </p>
              <p>And thanks to his low speed, I took 35mins instead of the usual 15mins to reach my destination and cause me to be late for my appointment and kena forfeited of my money. That time, my friend went up to the bus driver to ask him to speed up, the bus driver just rev up the accelerator and went back to the old slow speed. </p>
              <p>Kindly explain to me as I believe there are some bus captains or many bus enthusiasts around here?? </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>it happens all the time. there was once.. the driver was so slow that an old man riding bicycle by the pavement was faster than the bus. another time, the bloody driver actually stopped at the pedestrian crossing when the traffic light was still GREEN. he even signalled to the drivers on the opposite side to go ahead to turn right.  -.-"</p>

              <p>If the bus driver left the interchange punctually, how would they have so much time on the road to spare so that they could reach in time!!? Even if add in the fact that there is very good road conditions, all his traffic light all green, not possible he will be that early right. And I board the bus just one bus stop away from the interchange, that i can see it coming out. From there, its already cruising at snail pace. -.-</p>

              <p>Do you think that BC driving at dragging speed meant that is considered safe ? There are more road safey issues than just the speed. Bus driving so slowly (hogging) can frustrate other road users, but also the commuting customers.</p>
              <p>Comparing SMRT and SBST buses, there are relative more cases of dragging speed with SBST buses.</p>

              <p>Sometimes the bus has a mechanical fault. As it can still move albeit at a slow speed, the driver may have been instructed to continue.</p>
              <p>Also it they arrive at the interchange too early, they must be speeding. Too late, they are slack. It has to be just right.</p>

              <p>its 95% due to schedule. all the time. just compare a sv 25 and 854 bus. 45min for 25 and 28min for 854 from hg ave 2 to bedok int taking the same route during peak hours.</p>
              <p>sbst problem is that they add time during 3-5pm when there is no jam. den the poor BC got to drive very slowly. den mealbreak at 6plus runtime still the same, bigger headways causing higher loading along with the hardcore jams become not enough time. problem is with the meal break period not 3-5pm. 6plus trips tend to be late with the exception of crazy runtime services like 25 and 72 which you can practically head 30kph per stop.</p>

              <p>Yea True.</p>
              <p>I Live Along Jalan Bukit Merah, Every Morning When i go to school i'll nid a bus Ride(961,14,147,196,197). If 961 Comes Behind any of the SBST Buses i'll take e 961 Bcos Everytime Without Fail, 961 Will OVERTAKE the SBST Bus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh And yea Sometimes Bus Drivers Just Drive VEERY SLOW. Once i boarded 33, at Redhill MRT towards Tiong Bahru Plaza, The Bus Went Off Very Slow and STOP AT A GREEN LIGHT. My Friend Was Like WTF is rong with the Bus ? Stop at Green Light? But i noticed the 63 Infront Passed with no problem. after a few seconds the 33 move off from the junction and reach the next bus stop. it stopped and doesnt want to open the doors for the passenger to board until 30 seconds later, den when finishing boarding le 15 sec later den close de door. den it move off to the next traffic light which was also green and stopped agn? 10 seconds later it moved off and went to the next bus stop and slowly proceed on to Tiong Bahru.</p>

              <p>Yes. After I get that damn license, I'm not going to take the bus anymore -.- Suaysuay that day also forget to bring out my nets card, if not can have board a cab instead. </p>
              <p>Anyway, SMRT buses are really faster. Base on experience, the speed taken in SMRT buses are usually much quicker than that of SBS. All my snail pace bus experience comes from SBS!</p>
              <p>Don't mean to pin point at bus drivers who are doing their job, going by what some of you guys say, it should be the management dai ji alr -.- </p>
