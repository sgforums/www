              <p>I never made any assumptions, neither did I imply that I did not know interchange photos were not allowed. There was no facts given by my post other than just one. So I don't know and don't understand why you are asking me to get my facts right. The one and only fact I was bringing across was that, you were rude about it. That's all. I am not talking about how great a favour you are doing us here. I am talking about the fact that you were rude. Again, you say everything but acknowlege that you were rude. Hope you understand what was my point in the first place. It has nothing to do with the forum rules, but it has got to do with the way you brought across the message.</p>

              <p>I believe every member is smart enough to weigh the consequences of their actions based on the situation they were in, as different as they may be. If a person is being flagged down by a security personnel for their actions, I'm sure they'll know where the OB markers are and will comply with orders to prevent themselves from getting into trouble. While we are certainly not in a position to tell people off (cos we are here to educate as well), I'd hope every of the bus fans to lead by example, especially for new incoming members, by trying not to post such pictures again. If it's just once in a while, just a gentle reminder, as a gesture, will do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
