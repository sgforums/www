              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I am new here. Was formerly a bus driver with SBS more than 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>Its a real shame that the Mercedes O405 has to go. It was one of the buses which I had really enjoy driving it.</p>
              <p>Although the acceleration leaves much to be desired, especially when taking steep slopes, driving it is quite easy and comfortable.</p>
              <p>Corners taking were good, when they were on bigger tires (formerly 11R22.5x16, now 275/80x22.5).</p>
              <p>I had driven SBS302E, SBS488C,SBS88Z and SBS93D. I had served on services 174, 190 and 66.</p>

              <p>Think very very few people know that it was using a different engine. All the O405 is using the naturally aspirated OM447 engine, while 302E is using a turbocharged one with 250hp.</p>
              <p>Anyway the bus specs in sgwiki is not entirely correct. All SBST O405 (except 302E) gives out 220hp and 890Nm, while the SMRT O405 gives out 255hp and 1190Nm, not 890Nm.</p>

              yup they are deployed from depot to depot. in this case ARBP is like a subsidary of BBDEP. They are located at two different locations but they are interchangeable. If you check, ARBP actually has no spare buses. All spare are BBDEP SP.

              <p>I see.</p>
              <p>Actually the control of buses between arbp/bbdep and slbp is the same. Yeah, I agree somehow buses in slbp and bbdep do not cross over often. I actually did not notice that when I was with SBS.</p>
              <p>During my time both locations was under the same superintendent, or depot manager. I do not know about now. I saw many buses parked at the interchanges. Seems that the population of the buses has grown significantly. Back then, arbp/bbdep/jrbp combined has slightly less than 800 buses.</p>

              <p>Actually the control of buses between arbp/bbdep and slbp is the
              same. Yeah, I agree somehow buses in slbp and bbdep do not cross
              over often. I actually did not notice that when I was with SBS.</p>
              <p>During my time both locations was under the same superintendent,
              or depot manager. I do not know about now. I saw many buses parked
              at the interchanges. Seems that the population of the buses has
              grown significantly. Back then, arbp/bbdep/jrbp combined has
              slightly less than 800 buses.</p>

              SLBP and BBDEP are no longer together. only BBDEP and ARBP. SLBP service can only use SLBP bus.

              <p>Think very very few people know that it was using a different engine. All the O405 is using the naturally aspirated OM447 engine, while 302E is using a turbocharged one with 250hp.</p>
              <p>Anyway the bus specs in sgwiki is not entirely correct. All SBST O405 (except 302E) gives out 220hp and 890Nm, while the SMRT O405 gives out 255hp and 1190Nm, not 890Nm.</p>

              <p>No doubt it is true that slbp has its own spare buses, this is the only reason why it does not swap buses between the bus parks. slbp being termed as a bus park is not without reason.</p>

              <p>I am new here. Was formerly a bus driver with SBS more than 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>Its a real shame that the Mercedes O405 has to go. It was one of the buses which I had really enjoy driving it.</p>
              <p>Although the acceleration leaves much to be desired, especially when taking steep slopes, driving it is quite easy and comfortable.</p>
              <p>Corners taking were good, when they were on bigger tires (formerly 11R22.5x16, now 275/80x22.5).</p>
              <p>I had driven SBS302E, SBS488C,SBS88Z and SBS93D. I had served on services 174, 190 and 66.</p>

              <p>Yeah it's really sad but wat to do?All this is that LTA's decisions and no one can stop them unless if they wish to be like Johor and use the Mercs for over 20 years.But that would nvr happen in singapore.So no matter how powerful the Mercs and the other buses are in singapore,their life is very limited and they have to go off very quickly unlike in other countries where buses serve for more than 20 years.The Mercs and the other buses in singapore are really very unlucky.This Mercs power could last for abt another 10 years.A pity that they are not allowed to serve more than 19 years.<img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt=""><img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt=""><img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt=""><img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt=""></p>
