              <p>Euro 4 got 500 on the roads compared to Euro 5 got 400. isn't it is important to take gd care of euro 4 too? I mean u should be able to compare the scania in svc 157 and actually euro 5 is really too early to say if the vibration reduced.</p>

              <p>Regarding SBS110S &amp; SBS120M since they have long time 2 go off, they can use the good parts of SBS82P and/or SBS86D in order to 'resume' on the road.</p>
              <p>So, SBS86D can start to take out all the good parts b4 the de-registration date on August.</p>
