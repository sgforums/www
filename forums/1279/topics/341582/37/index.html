              <p>Shamless idiot still unrepentent. Till now you are still blaming others for your mistakes. How are you going to face the society in future? You are already at least 19 years of age and still behaving like a childish ill mannered brat crying in public. Hooligans only know how to pick up a fight and bash people. Hopeless. Are you one?</p>
              <p>You still don't understand why you get flamed for? When will you learn to discipline that mouth of yours before you get into more trouble? Do you want the whole world to turn against you then you see yourself in the mirror? In the first place no one told you to go anddie until the foolish comment you came out with in your facebook. Have you ever ask yourself why are you so unpopular?</p>
              <p>No one wants to pit themselves against you, but you brought this upon yourself.</p>
              <p>You seem to know nothing about TTS incident. At least I find him more humble than you, after flaming he know how to keep himself out from this trouble. Not like you, not even least of shame. I seem to see more maturity in TTS than in you, seriously.</p>
              <p>If people here are gonna hear more foolish comments by you, we will hesitate no more and continue to ADVISE you until you wake up from your ideas.</p>
              <p>Let us see how much stubborn can you be and how much ADVISES you need to wake up. You better learn to accept helpful advices. If not you canalways choose the miserable way, young man.</p>

              <p>Shamless idiot still unrepentent. Till now you are still blaming
              others for your mistakes. How are you going to face the society in
              future? You are already at least 19 years of age and still behaving
              like a childish ill mannered brat crying in public. Hooligans only
              know how to pick up a fight and bash people. Hopeless. Are you
              one?</p>
              <p>You still don't understand why you get flamed for? When will you
              learn to discipline that mouth of yours before you get into more
              trouble? Do you want the whole world to turn against you then you
              see yourself in the mirror? In the first place no one told you to
              go anddie until the foolish comment you came out with in your
              facebook. Have you ever ask yourself why are you so unpopular?</p>
              <p>No one wants to pit themselves against you, but you brought this
              upon yourself.</p>
              <p>You seem to know nothing about TTS incident. At least I find him
              more humble than you, after flaming he know how to keep himself out
              from this trouble. Not like you, not even least of shame. I seem to
              see more maturity in TTS than in you, seriously.</p>
              <p>If people here are gonna hear more foolish comments by
              you, we will hesitate no more and continue to ADVISE you until you
              wake up from your ideas.</p>
              <p>Let us see how much stubborn can you be and how much ADVISES you

              <p>Honestly you should just reflect on yourself, what you have done and what you owe everyone. Now you even resort to threatening someone. Who's the coward here?</p>
              <p>And it seems like you've been asking ppl for fights when they flame you. You sure you're up for it? You æ–­å¥¶ already or not? What is this SIAL?</p>

              <p><br>this is really astonishing, i should say. someone just revealed his true colours and is so stubborn to learn from mistakes. just a simple task to read the lines properly also dont understand.</p>
              <p>and the name "<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chong Yee Ruen</span></strong>" is being made famous overnight. i dont know whether to laugh or to show sympathy. someone who thinks he is a judge and if he were to be one, he would have sentenced those he knew to death! i dont wish to bring up any irrelevant stuff prior to the current topic.</p>
              <p>most of our fellow bus enthusiasts have tried to tell you your mistake, but you simply dont listen but instead gave death threats.</p>
