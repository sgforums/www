              <p>People like TTS won't learnt his lesson, can u guys stop talking about SBS9364S? He's a new comer <strong>since 2008</strong> but<strong> he need to get used to the discussions here and gain experience from others</strong>. If you keep talking about him especially his school life/ personal life or sort of things, you might pull down not only his reputation, but the way you discuss or treat anything about him. I've already spoken to him what to do and advise him the correct way. Do you want to bring someone a bad name just because you like to shoot around with harsh and hatred words just like that? Think about it. That's why the flaming / trolling is lurking around the forums.<br><br>Like what I've said, the forums is for BUSES discussions, not for HUMANS.</p>

              <p>His rep ar already gg. look at how many people talking about him. SBS9364S's aka CYR's actions have is the starting point telling people that he's willing to go great extremes to get his points, <em>including death threats.</em> How's that for you defending someone like him whom we, including sbs&amp;tibs have fervently tried numerous times to correct him yet he still come back at us yesterday saying he wants to hang sbs&amp;tibs.</p>
              <p>Flaming and trolling lurk in this forum mainly because of people like him &gt; i'm suprised you can't see that.</p>
              <p>Buses discussion ar, we tried to discuss buses and that joker SBS9364S came in with his joke idea and after that issue death threats on facebook. Good <strong>sial</strong></p>

              <p>Hmm...I think when sbs&amp;tibs got threatened by SBS9364S, he wouldn't feel safe to go out. Who knows if someone here is to kidnap him and then hang him? If CYR is to threaten him, I think we should also inform the police, maybe CYR should just go admit that he threatened sbs&amp;tibs to the police, if he is NOT a coward, since he said that sbs&amp;tibs is a coward.</p>
              <p>If you can say somebody is a coward, does that means you are not a coward?</p>
              <p>Come on, 19 year old gentleman, it'll benefit you if you learn from your mistakes. Stop dreaming in your own world, ask questions instead of assuming some of the things, those who are even newer than you may confused because of your statement. I don't know what is your gender (M/F), but I assume that you are a female. At the same time, edit sgwiki that you are a girl, everybody who reads the source thought that you are really a girl. How would you feel?  Would you try to correct me?</p>
              <p>For example, you don't correct your mistake. You decided to bring your overseas friends to Toa Payoh, to let say, visit your house by bus from Changi Airport, they knew that you are a bus fan. You remember that there's a SMRT service which provides direct link from CGA to TPY. You asked people here and everyone tells you that sv989 is withdrawn, but you insist on taking the SMRT service. You took 858 instead, you ended up at Yishun. Time wasted. Should you have listened to us by learning from your mistake? </p>
              <p>When you're wrong, just correct yourself, nobody will do anything to you. At the very most, you only embarass yourself, I don't think your name will be remembered because you didn't make a big mark. It's only when you're so stubborn and so thick skin to fight for your own mistakes, people will then remember you well because of your stupidity. Or is it that you want to gain your popularity in such a way? </p>
              <p>If you aren't happy with somebody who tries to correct you and want to kill them, you really give me an impression that you hate your parents, your teachers, your mentors and everyone who bother to correct your mistakes. <strong>It's only you, who is at the losing end</strong>, we can just don't bother about you, go ahead and hang him to death, caught by police and who is the one going to lose the rest of his life because of this? We all? Or just you?</p>
              <p>I'm sure you don't need someone who is younger than you to tell you all these. Shame on you.</p>
