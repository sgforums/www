              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Transport operators will need to hire about 1,600 
              more bus drivers for the 800 new buses that will go on the roads over 
              five years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking in 
              Parliament on Monday, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said the 
              government will not micro-manage wages or employment terms to attract 
              and retain sufficient manpower.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>He added that 
              operators must also ensure drivers - no matter what their nationality - 
              are given adequate training and are appropriately qualified.<br><br>Mr 
              Lui said 1,600 bus drivers needed for the 800 additional buses will be a
               significant increase in the overall manpower requirement facing the 
              public bus industry.  <br><br>And operators will have to overcome the challenges on their own.<br> <br>He
               said: "The public bus operators  will also have to compete with other 
              companies that similarly have to target locals in the face of a 
              reduction in intake of foreign labour. <br><br>"Nonetheless, how the 
              public bus operators intend to improve their wages and employment terms 
              to attract and retain sufficient bus drivers are ultimately matters for 
              the PTOs (public transport operators) to decide as the government will 
              not micro-manage such matters. However, this is clearly a top priority 
              for both bus operators, and I understand they are currently in talks 
              with the unions on this.'  <br><br>MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC Zaqy Mohamad
               raised concerns about foreign bus drivers, following the fatal accident
               involving a SBS transit bus driver in Sengkang last week.<br><br>He 
              said: "Because I am quite certain that a significant number of this 
              increase would include bus drivers. Just last week, we had an accident 
              involving two foreign bus drivers. I would like to ask the minister what
               are the measures put in place to ensure our foreign bus drivers are 
              well qualified, adaptable and can assimilate as well and do their job 
              effectively here and without compromising the safety of other other road
               users and pedestrians."<br><br>Mr Lui said that currently, about 61 per
               cent of bus drivers are locals or Permanent Residents. About 26 per 
              cent are Malaysians and about 13 per cent are from China.<br><br>He said training of drivers must go beyond equipping them with skills for the job. <br><br>Mr
               Lui said: "Indeed, we are all saddened by that incident that happened 
              in Sengkang last week, and regardless whether it is a local driver or 
              foreign driver, I think it is something that we want to very much avoid 
              as much possible. <br><br>"The more important thing actually is to make 
              sure (that), regardless of nationality, every driver is adequately 
              trained, appropriately qualified, and especially if they come from 
              abroad, then they are given the kind of orientation that will help them 
              familiarise themselves with the peculiarities of the system in 
              Singapore.<br><br>"We must not only train the drivers in terms of 
              equipping them with the skills, but preparing them for life in Singapore
               which may be very different from what they are accustomed to in the 
              past, hence part of the training programme is to make sure we infuse 
              them with the responsibility that they carry when they drive a vehicle 
              like a bus and to make sure that they pay stringent attention to road 
              conditions (and make) sure that they operate their vehicles in a safe 
              manner as possible."<br><br>There were concerns over bus drivers working
               long hours and if a review of working conditions is needed to enhance 
              public safety.<br><br>Mr Lui said he believes the ratio of two drivers to operate each bus is adequate. <br><br>He
               said what is important is to emphasise safety and ensure drivers are 
              properly trained and are familiar with routes and road conditions.<br><br>Similar
               to the public bus operators, there is a limit to how much the 
              government can and should intervene in the labour market for the wider 
              private bus industry.  <br><br>Mr Lui said in particular, bus driver 
              salaries for this sector should remain market-driven, and private bus 
              operators should make their own commercial decisions on how to ensure 
              that their businesses remain viable in the face of a tightening labour 
              market.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ms</span></span></p>

              <p>So what about the Anak Bukit Mercedes accident? So what's the theory.. In fact that one is worst to be honest, for that junction has alrdy clocked a lot of all sorts of accident for Clementi Rd approach.</p>
              <p>End of the day, they're all traffic related accidents.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To be honest both companies training are not adequate for locals let alone foreigners,The training module are mostly short cut.Seriously the newbies must learn more about local driving habits and to expect the unexpected rather than to employ these people's just for the sake of quotas!Just imagine those lousy drivers can take bendy/DDs training if they have no accident for the past 6 mths?Really absurd when the trainers itself sleep when the trainee drive??The TP for the final test also need to rotate and not the familiar old faces with connection with the companies too.Transport ministar also made a mistake saying 61% are locals/PRs it's 61% are either Chinamans or Malaysians...Those locals are either uncles or above 45 years old.Seriously Chinamans should learn more English better before they are qualified to drive a bus...And the way they drive also just waiting accident to happen anytime...</p></div>

              <p>Hi Bus Fans,</p>
              <p>When it comes to <strong>foreign bus drivers</strong>:</p>
              <p>I am a '<em>well mannered</em>' bus driver from Berlin, Germany, with more than a decade worth of experience.</p>
              <p>Once again, I would like to offer my services to SBST or SMRT.</p>
              <p>I have applied a couple of times, but it seems that Europeans cannot be employed as Bus Captains in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I am <strong>NOT</strong> an <em>economic migrant</em>, as I can earn <strong>more money here in Germany</strong>, and life is cheaper here as well. Instead, I like Singapore so much that I'd like to live there permanently, even if it means less pay.</p>
              <p>SBST got my e-mail address; please contact me if employment opportunities for Europeans should arise sometime in the future ...</p>
