              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, press release shows sembawang-yishun to be
              correct as up until the day the article was released 1 yr ago. It
              is unable to predict every new service after the day the release is
              official. So we can only deduce every new bus service to be
              separatedly negotiated with the various bus service provider.
              Agree? </p>
              <p>Since there is no official news release about which contract 110
              is under, it remains subjected to various discussions. Cheers.
              Thanks.</p>

              <p>true.. so why are you concluding that it is  under Sem-yishun contract then? when did you found that info that sem-yishun have 25 services.</p>
              <p>i believe that this 110 is newly planned service, (thus it is not under BSEP as well). </p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, when they launch service 137 and 298, they introduced them as the 78th and 79th bus service under BSEP. However, nothing is said for 110. So we just wait till end of this yr when they will surely mention which is the 80th bus and the end of the 5 yr BSEP campaign since yr 2012. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>My observations on svc 137 (on a weekend afternoon):</p>
              <p>I agree 137 is slow and so far not many people are taking 137 (maybe because people are still not familiar with the route).</p>
              <p>Between UEC terminal and UEC Rd/Bedok South Ave 3: Demand not high as commuters going to Bedok MRT can take 25, which is more frequent and faster</p>
              <p>Between UEC Rd/Bedok South Ave 3 and Bedok South Ave 1: Demand not high as commuters changing to EWL can take 14/48 to Tanah Merah MRT, 55 to Eunos MRT, 48 to Bugis MRT, or 10/14 to City Hall.</p>
              <p>Between Bedok MRT and Bedok North St 3: Demand not high because commuters can take 225G/W, which is faster and more direct. 137 is supposed to serve Heartbeat @ Bedok but the nearest stops along Bedok North St 1 and Bedok North Ave 2 are quite far away (200m). </p>
              <p>Between Bedok North St 3 and Bedok North MRT: Probably the portion with the heaviest load. Even so, the seats are not fully filled.</p>
              <p>Between Bedok North MRT and Ubi MRT: Demand not high. Most bus stops in Kaki Bukit estate has only 1-3 people boarding or alighting. As the route is designed to primarily connect to DTL stations, it awkwardly avoids the bus stops along Bedok Reservoir Rd and Eunos Link, making it difficult to transfer between 137 and bus services along Bedok Reservoir Rd and Eunos Link (unless you walk). </p>
              <p>Between Ubi MRT and Paya Lebar MRT: No demand between Ubi MRT and Ubi Ave 1, but moderate load between Ubi Ave 1 and Paya Lebar MRT.</p>
              <p>Between Paya Lebar MRT &amp; Sims Place: moderate load (I'm amazed that it took LTA so long to introduce a direct service from Paya Lebar MRT to Geylang Rd (between Paya Lebar and Aljunied) after svc 71 was withdrawn in the early 1990s) </p>
              <p>Travel time from Bedok MRT<br>- to Bedok North St 3: about 10 min<br>- to Bedok North MRT: about 15 min<br>- to Ubi MRT: more than 30 min<br>- to Paya Lebar MRT: more than 45 min (on 137) or less than 10 min (on EWL)</p>

              <p>Give it some time. It is too early to say anything. And 137 is mainly for connecting Bayshore to Bedok MRT, where 25 does not ply. If you want to bash services, you should do that to 46 which after couple years also has poor loading. </p>

              <p>To all who have always said bus fares will keep increasing, this
              news release today will be a damper on your spirits. There will be
              no increase and bus fares will be the same in the next year (Yr
              2018) to come. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Haha. Recently our gahmen said they want zero car growth. If they raise transport fare, ppl sure make noise. I hope the gahmen will maintain zero growth in transport fare, to keep the zero car growth vision.</p>
              <p>According to the <a title="news" href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/morning-pre-peak-travel-fares-be-reduced-ptc">news</a>, the gahmen is also scrapping the morning pre-peak hour free MRT trips, and is rolling out a 50 cents discount for all MRT/LRT commuters who tap in before 7:45am, regardless of destination. I feel that it's more fair, esp to those who work outside the CBD.</p>
              <p>To be more fair to all commuters, maybe the gahmen should expand the 50 cent discount to buses as well. </p>
