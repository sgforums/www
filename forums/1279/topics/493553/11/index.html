              <p>Hi dupdup77, you take svc 89E often?</p>
              <p>I would say that the root cause is really too many cars trying
              to go back to Punggol during peak hours, the buses don't really
              cause much delay because there's the two-lane bus bays. Nowadays,
              LTA got change the traffic light signal timing so that cars going
              to Punggol can turn right and keep on going, instead of stopping
              again at the bridge (which is the usual signal cycle on weekday
              mornings or weekends), but when they don't change the signal cycle
              to optimize for the flow of cars exiting TPE, then you get the
              massive jams ...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The biggest problem is LTA don't build exit slip roads from TPE to Sengkang East Drive and Punggol East, thus the nearest exit point for everyone is via Punggol Rd, causing a bottleneck during peak hours. </p>
              <p>Instead they widen the lanes for slip roads to Punggol Rd. Big mistake indeed.</p>

              <p>Hi mr vicamour, wait 1 yr 8 months more. Direct connection from Punggol central and Punggol east to TPE is on the cards.</p>
              <p>As for exit slips roads from TPE to sengkang east and Punggol east, they have done engineering analysis and deduced not viable due to the length required. This was reported in the print few years ago. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes nowadays I have already changed and toned
              down and I don't shoot down other people proposals anymore. I just
              leave it as it is. All I do is to reemphasize a point that I was
              correct when mr busanalyser said I was wrong months ago.</p>
              <p>The amendment of Sbs 129 to serve the 1 and only extra stop it
              left out initially but amended from 28 may 2017 goes to show that
              my point was correct. However unfortunately mr SMB128B goes and
              brings out the 3 stops which is not part of 129 route since 129
              goes by Bartley underpass. This causes a mini uproar. That was
              really unfortunate as this did not really affect the point that a
              bus service will ply all the stops of its route. Cheers.
              Thanks.</p>

              <p>Well dupdup...you were WRONG then... it was introduced without those bus stops... now if 129 needs them, they have been re-instated. I am back after long and I have NO interest in arguing with your "cock-up" ways. I have better things to do. </p>

              <p>No, you cannot withdraw that kind of service. It is written on the bus package that 256 and 258 is there; but 256 may be extended to Tuas South (or Bulim Industrial Estate) and handed to Bulim Bus Package. 258 has acceptable demand everyday.</p>
              <p>But 700 is still the same. 973 is there to bring passengers from Hume Avenue to Hillion Mall. The only bus services withdrawn is Premium 555, 563 and 598.</p>
              <p>Park Service got no choice due to low demand.</p>
              <p>Premiums are allowed to withdraw or handed to other operators.</p>
              <p>Chinatown Direct is always kept with the exception of CT28, which has severely low demand.</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, so you still not satisfied with this? This is what you get when you want to get rid of 256 due to its low loading. No matter how poor a bus loading it can get, the links cannot be totally destroyed. Now they have to amend 2 services (192 and 258) to cover back 256. They just cannot please everybody. This is about as good as it can get. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Whoever that makes the argument that 256 cannot be withdrawn because it is part of a bus package, it is plainly without merit. From a practical perspective, I don't see why the bus services in any package cannot be subjected to any changes even before all of them are tendered out. When new developments rise, are we expecting them to stick to the same services? If a service has low demand, why can't it be withdrawn and resources put to better use?</p>
              <p>As to the argument that there was no need for 258 to be amended, my position was neutral. Firstly, I highly doubted there is any need for it to stick to Upp Jurong Road when 99 and 192 did the two sided job. Looping outside of instead of going into Boon Lay Interchange is an indication that we would be seeing more of services like 177/180/983 (in fact, at least two of them would most likely retain such routes after Bukit Panjang Interchange reopened). I do not see anything wrong with that. Apart from that, I initially misconcepted that 256 is much shorter than 258 going from Pioneer to Joo Koon, that the end result was actually 258 plying 1km longer for that sector. Nevertheless, allowing 258 to connect to other services outside Joo Koon would incline me to support the move.</p>

                              <p>Whoever that makes the argument that 256 cannot be withdrawn
              because it is part of a bus package, it is plainly without merit.
              From a practical perspective, I don't see why the bus services in
              any package cannot be subjected to any changes even before all of
              them are tendered out. When new developments rise, are we expecting
              them to stick to the same services? If a service has low demand,
              why can't it be withdrawn and resources put to better use?</p>
              <p>As to the argument that there was no need for 258 to be amended,
              my position was neutral. Firstly, I highly doubted there is any
              need for it to stick to Upp Jurong Road when 99 and 192 did the two
              sided job. Looping outside of instead of going into Boon Lay
              Interchange is an indication that we would be seeing more of
              services like 177/180/983 (in fact, at least two of them would most
              likely retain such routes after Bukit Panjang Interchange
              reopened). I do not see anything wrong with that. Apart from that,
              I initially misconcepted that 256 is much shorter than 258 going
              from Pioneer to Joo Koon, that the end result was actually 258
              plying 1km longer for that sector. Nevertheless, allowing 258 to
              connect to other services outside Joo Koon would incline me to
              support the move.</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, so you still not satisfied with this? This is
              what you get when you want to get rid of 256 due to its low
              loading. No matter how poor a bus loading it can get, the links
              cannot be totally destroyed. Now they have to amend 2 services (192
              and 258) to cover back 256. They just cannot please everybody. This
              is about as good as it can get. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>No, 256 withdrawal is justifiable, because the loading has all these while been very low. In fact, it's obvious that 256 would be withdrawn.</p>
              
              <p>I can accept the amendment of 258 to ply Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, instead of Upper Jurong Road, because I do not work there. A longer journey to Joo Koon Bus Interchange does not matter to me, because I do not work need to go to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>
              
              <p>But, the amendment to skip Boon Lay Bus Interchange really upset me...</p>
              
              <p>I don't think anyone here understands my concerns. Maybe nobody here takes 258, that's why everyone here is okay with 258 skipping Boon Lay Bus Interchange and loop around Boon Lay MRT Station.</p>
              
              <p>But if you live in Jurong West and take 258 regularly, I'm sure you will know what I mean.</p>
              
              <p>I mean, just look at the Facebook post at LTA's Facebook page. The picture about 258 amendment attracted "shock" and "sad" responses. The people who take 258 everyday are upset.</p>
              
              <p>Nonetheless, it's okay if you do not understand.</p>
