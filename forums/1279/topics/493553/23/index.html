              <p>Anyway, taking 123 from Tiong Bahru MRT exit A ($1.80) is cheaper than taking Sentosa Express from HarbourFront MRT ($5.70).</p>
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                      <p>But the travel time could actually be 30 minutes longer, when taking 123 at Tiong Bahru (120 mins), instead of Sentosa Express at HarbourFront (90 mins).</p>
                                                                                          
                                                                                          <p>Nonetheless, those on budget but still want to go Sentosa can take 123... because thanks to distance fares, the cost on bus 123 itself is only $0.20...</p>
                                                                                          
                                                                                          <p>Considering the difference is about $3.90, effectively you are saving on the Sentosa Express, which costs $4...</p>
                                                                                  
                                                                                  <p>Nevertheless, Sentosa Express is free-of-charge when travelling back to Singapore.</p>
                                                                              
                                                                              <p>When traveling back to Singapore, it's better to take Sentosa Express and then transfer to MRT at HarbourFront... because without the Sentosa Express, the travel fare is only $1.70, cheaper than taking 123 to Tiong Bahru and then take MRT back home ($1.80).. and somemore the travel time is shorter...</p>

              <p>With regards to the bus route 123 from Tiong Bahru MRT to
              Sentosa, just wondering, is it the same route as the one that ran
              to Sentosa 20 years ago?</p>
              <p>Because as I was viewing videos of 123 from Tiong Bahru MRT
              (exit A) to Sentosa, I seem to find the scene very familiar,
              especially the roundabout part, like I have seen it before... just
              wondering is this was the same route that went to Sentosa many
              years ago...</p>
              <p>Also, is there a possibility that it was actually 123 that went
              to Sentosa many years ago, only to be rerouted to HarbourFront when
              HarbourFront MRT opened.... I'm not sure about the HarbourFront MRT
              part... because it could actually be 123 all along.</p>
              <p>Those who have memories or recordings of the 123 historical
              route, please help to verify if this was actually the route that
              went to Sentosa many years ago...</p>
              <p>Because if our memories tally with one another, then most likely
              it's true, that it was actually 123 that went to Sentosa in the
              past, and now they are reverting back the connection that was taken
              away 20 years ago...</p>
              <p>anyway, if I remember correctly, the bus that went to Sentosa
              many years ago only went to the visitor arrival centre, which is
              around the present-day RWS entrance... from there, the bus turned
              around and returned to Singapore...</p>
              <p>also, if I'm not wrong, the bus was the Volvo B10M... cuz I
              remember the steps was very tall, and that time I was only like 3-4
              years old... it was the part I dreaded most whenever I come to
              Sentosa in the past.... because that time I was very small... and I
              always have to be carried up to board the bus... as I couldn't walk
              up the stairs on my own...</p>
              <p>anyway, those who know, please help to verify. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I would say svc 1 may be better as a Punggol - CBD service
              ...</p>
              <p>AsÂ svc 1,Â the last-to-be-introducedÂ single-digit
              service,Â its importance and demand may be expected to exceed
              svc 2 ... and having a Punggol - CBD link that's currently lacking
              (sans City Directs) would be suitable. Along with the fact that svc
              3 also serves Punggol.</p>
              <p>Imagine the disappointment if 1 ends up with a route like
              127.</p>

              <p>5 does not go to the west as BM is within central area, so west side effectively only has 7 as the sole single-digit service. If 1 were ever to be introduced, it should preferably serve the east as it would complete the 1-9 set serving the east area. If anyone notice, the first 39 services in consecutive numerical order (2-40) have a terminus in the east side with the exception of 11, though some argue Geylang can be considered to be part of east side because of its geographical proximity to Bedok.</p>
