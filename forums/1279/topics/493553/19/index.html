              <p>Hi Mr. randomguy,</p>
              <p>Yes, it might seem to make sense that people prefer
              CBD-directional journeys, hence preferring to take 43/43M. However,
              leaving a complete new BTO estate (i.e. Buangkok Crescent estate
              with approx 2000? households shifting in) with just one service to
              Hougang MRT, which is 10 bus stops + many traffic lights away (with
              AM/PM traffic I would presume it takes 15-20minutes) is pretty
              uncalled for, no?</p>
              <p>I do acknowledge that it brings about useful links to Hougang 1,
              which Buangkok residents never had, but do note that the residents
              staying at the outer area of Buangkok estate (served by 101), as
              you mentioned, have the alternative of 43 which brings them to both
              Buangkok and Serangoon. But I find that it is pretty ridiculous to
              have 329 as the sole service in the estate, which: </p>
              <p>(i) isn't near the main road (Buangkok green) at all (hence NO
              alternatives);</p>
              <p>(ii) highly possibly will take a long journey to the nearest
              MRT, having to ply Hougang avenue 4 with high people volume;</p>
              <p>(iii) Buangkok MRT area obviously has lighter traffic than the
              Hougang Central area which has so many buses + traffic
              lights </p>
              <p>I find that it is good, and necessary to have 329 to provide
              useful links, but I don't think that it should be the ONLY service
              in the Buangkok crescent area. Of course, wishing for authorities
              to divert 43M inside seems like the most feasible solution, but the
              other residents along Buangkok green might complain about the
              frequency of relying on only 43 - but which Buangkok crescent
              resident wouldn't want a direct link to Serangoon and Buangkok?
              FYI, I will be shifting in to one of the BTOs as well, and I find
              that a link to Buangkok and not Hougang will be the best and most
              efficient solution - both to improve the utilization of Buangkok as
              many have pointed out and to save the time for residents
              significantly! </p>
              <p>Especially with the lack of direct links and express services to
              CBD in estates along NEL, it is only important to ensure that
              residents have the fastest link to a train station - if Punggol/SK
              can have LRTs, and existing Buangkok area residents have buses to
              Serangoon and Hougang, why should the route planning division in
              LTA have discounted the residents along Buangkok crescent to only
              have ONE service to Hougang which is so far away? This just doesn't
              make lots of sense to me. And I don't think the saving of time will
              just be a meager 2-3 minutes. Let me do the math for you:</p>
              <p>Buangkok Crescent - Dhoby Ghaut (example)</p>
              <p>329 Buangkok crescent -  Hougang MRT : estimated time
              during AM peak - 20 minutes with traffic conditions etc</p>
              <p>Hougang - Dhoby - 17 mins </p>
              <p>total : 37 mins</p>
              <p>Assuming a new service that links to Buangkok MRT directly from
              the new Buangkok Link area being built, I'm pretty sure it will
              only take 8-10 minutes - assuming it only passes by say 4-5 bus
              stops</p>
              <p>Buangkok - Dhoby - 19 mins</p>
              <p>total: 27-29 mins</p>
              <p>Please note that the only walkable alternative is for residents
              to walk to Gerald drive area to take bus 50 to AMK or 70/103 to
              Serangoon (500 meters walk away which isn't very near at all for a
              bus stop). Everyday this saves residents potentially 20 mins for a
              2-way trip and clearly this is much more efficient. I know that I
              might be the only one wishing for the stars here by hoping that a
              service can be introduced to link to both Serangoon and Buangkok,
              but I really do hope that authorities will consider the needs and
              importance of providing a link to the nearest MRT, or else I can't
              imagine how bad the crowd will be like on 329 and Hougang MRT when
              all the houses are built finish (around 3Q 2018). Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sgxiaobusguy, they did not say service 329 is the only new service to buangkok link/crescent. Service 101 is also extended by a pair of bus stops on the same day. They will keep monitoring the public transport around the whole area and in time to come, will slowly introduce new bus services when demand necessitates it. Don't expect sudden launch of many new services at 1 go.</p>
              <p>Look at fernvale area for example. In the beginning, there is only 163/163M. Over 5-7 years now, 50, 85, 102, 374 have joined Sengkang west area. It takes time. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Well if u stay at Blk 911/opp Blk 910 or Blk 969/opp block 968
              busstops along Buangkok green, you will know that vast majority of
              people there going to CBD will still take 43 to Serangoon instead
              of 43 to Buangkok even though 43 is faster to Buangkok. This is
              even worth the improved frequency with 43M. LTA shld have
              considered that ez-link data when planning too. 43 from opp Blk 910
              to Buangkok MRT is a good 7-8mins and 101 is 12-13mins to Hougang
              from that same busstop Buangkok to Hougang is another 3mins, so at
              best u save 2mins?</p>
              <p>thats why like I mentioned, if it is a route to Buangkok MRT via
              Buangkok green, people in Buangkok link/crescent will still mostly
              opt Hougang MRT. When the Buangkok drive extension is completed and
              there is a route by the back of Buangkok link, it might change
              things.</p>

              <p>Agree and disagree. Most take 43/43M to Serangoon to change to CCL in addition to NEL. At same time, you see a good number of people taking 43 to Buangkok MRT. Wait at Buangkok MRT stop between 1745-1930 and you will see a good 40-60 people board the bus unless there is bunching. I have witnessed times when 43 DD can leave the bus stop with 90 people on board if the interval is around 10 mins. </p>
              <p>Also on your other point, 101 and 329 both are winding to Hougang MRT and will take approx. same time. So I don't see 101 loading reducing significantly. In fact, it will increase because those who want to go to Upper Serangoon Rd/CCL will take 101 in addition to those who take 101 to NEL.</p>

              <p>Yeah people won't take 101 till CCL or it is a very small minority. U will be better off taking NEL at Hougang then xfer. For me, I will walk to Buangkok green to take 43/43M or YCK road to take 70/103 since there is a shortcut to cut through the blocks. 101 is way too Long till Serangoon. </p>

              <p>I think you have no idea about the loading of 101. It's main loading is not Serangoon - Hougang, but is Hougang - HG St 51/53 &amp; Buangkok Link.</p>
              <p>101 in AM especially gets a good 60-70 pax on each bus towards HG, where around 40-50 pax alight at HG Central, another 20-30 will go further on Upper Serangoon Rd.</p>
              <p>People who use NEL will take 101/107/153 from Upp Serangoon Road. Those who take CCL opt for 81/82 or some use 101 from interchange. Not as simple as you put it. </p>

              <p>This is cos 101 is the former hougang feeder 328 from the former hougang south bus interchange. With the  closing of that interchange, 101 was extended to serangoon interchange on 1 end and extended to buangkok crescent with a 3-point turn loop on the other end. The former 328 used to make a left turn from buangkok green to hougang ave 4. It used to loop at Hougang street 51, turn left to buangkok green, turn left to hougang ave 4 and left back to hougang street 51.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              </span></p><p style="display: inline !important;">So i guess SBST kept all the busstops served by the former 328 and added in the 2 way extension on buangkok green/link/cresent, resulting in that weird loop. Hope this explains</p>

              <p>If Route 62 can be extended to Marina South ITH in future that would be awesome.</p>
              <p>Other candidates to operate from there are Routes 23 and 857. Possibly Route 970 too.</p>
              <p>Also, it would be nice if LTA can operate a ferry service between Clarke Quay and Marina South similar to the Transperth one between Elizabeth Quay in Perth CBD and Mends Street in South Perth.</p>
