              <p>Best case is 135 shorten to Sims Pl, then 125 merge with 47 and cover part of 135 route. at the same time 40 can serve Parkway Parade so the 
              merged entity of 47/125 can serve East Coast Rd in both directions.</p>
              <p>As for 25 being extended it came as a surprise. i would have preferred 26 to be extended to UEC, with 76 extended to Bedok via current 26 route.</p>
              <p>With 55 being extended to UEC it is better off being allocated to Bedok contract. 100 can go to Serangoon contract and 196 to Clementi contract.</p>

              <p>That's why the closure of Marine Parade Bus Terminal was a mistake from the start, and even if they did plan to close the terminus, the relocated site could have been better selected for the affected bus services.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, I think 854 journey is already much longer than 25. Thus 25 gets nod to be extended. Moreover, 853C is only at upper east coast terminal on weekends. So 853C not much of a satisfactory reason. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              South Avenue 3 and Upper East Coast Road.</p>
              <p>Service 25 will operate from Upper East Coast Bus Terminal from
              5.30am to 11.30pm daily. In addition, the first trip towards Ang Mo
              Kio from Bedok Station (Exit A) along New Upper Changi Road will
              start at 5.15am from Mondays to Saturdays and at 5.30am on Sundays

              55</span></strong> <br> Similarly, the route of Service 55 will be extended to terminate at
              Upper East Coast Bus Terminal. Currently, it loops at Siglap Road
              for its return journey to Bishan Bus Interchange. The extension
              will enhance connectivity for existing and upcoming developments in
              the Bayshore area with Eunos and Hougang. With the extension, it
              will ply Marine Parade Road, Bedok South Avenue 1 and Upper East
              Coast Road. It will, however, skip the bus stop opposite Mandarin
              Gardens (93199) along Siglap Road.</p>
              <p>Service 55 will operate from Bishan Bus Interchange from 5.30am

              Interchange and loops at Siglap Road for its return journey. The
              extension will enhance connectivity between Bedok and Telok Kurau
              and serve amenities such as the Parkway East Hospital and the new
              Heartbeat@Bedok Integrated Complex en-route. With the extended
              route, it will ply Marine Parade Road, Bedok South Avenue 1, New
              Upper Changi Road, Bedok North Avenue 3 and Bedok North Street 1,
              and skip the bus stop opposite Mandarin Gardens (93199) along

              <p>Service 155 will operate daily from 6.00am to midnight from Toa

              <p>Those who regularly take 25/854 from Bedok Interchange to Jalan Eunos, Eunos Link and Hougang Ave 3 &amp; 2 will be sad because in the future they can only take 854 from Bedok Interchange. Not only is the waiting time doubled, the chance of getting a seat also decreases as 854 uses more SDs and less DDs than svc 25.</p>
              <p>Also, with the extension of 25 to UEC, there is less incentive for SBST to improve the frequency and capacity for svc 45. As a Bedok North resident, I am often fed up by the waiting time of svc 45 (which can be 20 min or longer) and most of the time I take 225 to Bedok Interchange and change to 25/854 so that I can get a seat. Now, I have one less option from Bedok Interchange.  :(</p>
              <p>While Bedok South and Bayshore residents see more and more bus services, I and my neighbours can only watch with envy as we don't see any new bus services after the introduction of 45 in 2006. (The new svc 46, the amended svc 18 and the extended svc 155 all miss my area.) </p>

              <p>I foresee that one service in Bedok Interchange (which turns left upon leaving Bedok Interchange) will be moved to Berth 10 to replace svc 25 and to make space for svc 155 so that svc 155 can turn right upon leaving Bedok Interchange.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I feel that some of the queues in Bedok Interchange need to be rearranged. It is ridiculous for 66 and 228 to be 3 berths apart, 14 and 222 to be 2 berths apart, and 60 and 87 to be 5 berths apart! 9 and 35 can be moved towards Berth 10 since passengers can board 9 and 35 outside Bedok Mall.</p>

              <p>Best case is 135 shorten to Sims Pl, then 125 merge with 47 and
              cover part of 135 route. at the same time 40 can serve Parkway
              Parade so the merged entity of 47/125 can serve East Coast Rd in

              <p>As for 25 being extended it came as a surprise. i would have
              preferred 26 to be extended to UEC, with 76 extended to Bedok via
              current 26 route.</p>
              <p>With 55 being extended to UEC it is better off being allocated

              <p>True. This is what could happen:</p>
              <p>Ppl who use to take 25/854 to bedok and transfer to another bus, lets call them services A or B or C or etc. frm bedok int, will still continue to do so aft the changes, since the bedok mrt bus stop is close to the interchange.</p>
              <p>However, those who take A or B or C or etc. will take 854 instead of 25 to eunos/hougang area. The reason being that they have to cross the underpass if they intend to take 25 which is rly inconvenient, unless some of them take services like 9, 35 which stop opp the bedok mall/bedok int.
