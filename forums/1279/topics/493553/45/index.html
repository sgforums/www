              <p>True. 4 expressways in all, and fully covering the entire length of TPE. I think distance wise is still <em>barely</em> ok for the express sector coz there are also many other long dist buses like 506 and 51 to cite some as eg, but in fact i find is the stress it needs to take for travelling 3 plus hours on the road per trip, and high loadings that make things worse. It's the overall length of 858 route that is the root problem</p>
              <p>Talking abt overall route distance, isnt most, if not all, the CGA routes damn long?!</p>

              <p>Wonder why also..MB OC500LE,Scania K230UB is all 12m,MAN A22 is
              at 11.98m while Citaro is at 11.96m..Comfort and Power wise belong
              to A22 but the bus is notoriously known for sudden jerk upon
              acceleration and consume more fuel than others,OC &amp; KUB known
              for their jerky brakings and the high portion doesn’t favour senior
              citizens but can carry 2 PIWs..Citaro is the least powerful but

              <p>858 is the longest route with up to 3h travel time.. and yes Citaros have some intense heating issues when travelling long distance. </p>
              <p>Just look at how 36 buses throttles on the way back from Tomlinson to CGA.</p>

              <p>I took 110 today from Compassvale Int to Changi Airport T4 and a few observations:</p>
              <p>1. The entire fleet was MB Citaro - mixture of LG, SBSMRT and SMRT Pixel</p>
              <p>2. No A24 today for 110 - I think no point deploying HC buses on this service so fast, that too on day 1, but Im sure that the loading will go up quite soon. There were standing passengers on first day already even with no free rides on 110. Hope there will be A24s in future. O405Gs i doubt so because they were never cleared to negotiate the sharp bends at the PTBs.</p>
              <p>3. To what I observed, Compassvale Int and T4 should be bendy-friendly. SMRT as operator and Compassvale Int could also have been chosen because Sengkang Int is not bendy-friendly (though I know SK int is already at max capacity).</p>
              <p>4. T4 should not be DD-friendly. I saw a 3.8m height limit sign at the coach park. Though the public buses do not have to go under this height limit sign, the shelter for the public buses is only as high as the coach park shelter so I guess it should be 3.8m also and CGA didnt bother putting a height limit sign there because they know all public buses are SD only.</p>
              <p>5. I saw overcrowded Citaros on 858 today. WELL DONE IN SCREWING THINGS UP LAH LTA. If LTA is going to standardise the fleet as MB Citaro and MAN A24... there better be more MAN A24s deployed man. And it really doesnt make sense to remove MAN A22 when MAN A24s are plying Airport routes</p>

              <p>They think standardisation is good.. hey then why can't SMRT get
              their basics right by just spending a few dollars to buy some green

              <p>I'm seriously done with the rubbish SBSMRT Taros! Far inferior

              <p>I think after the new Airport and T4 hype has died down we'll start to see variety there again.  Like 860 initially full BSEP A22 fleet but after that we see a mixed type deployment.  Plus eventually there will not be enough Shitaros to go around when the KUB's and the first SBST shitaros retire. </p>
              <p>Painting the SBSMRT shitaros green wont change the shitty acceleration anyway so why waste paint on the shitaros. </p>
              <p>All SD's now have similar inferior capacity, far from the days of 44 seating pax per bus from the UD/B10M/O405 days.  I'm fine with having space for wheelchairs but not fine with removing seats to pack more standees into sardines.  All paxes pay the same fare, all pax deserve a seat.</p>
