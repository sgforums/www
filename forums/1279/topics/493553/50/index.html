              <p>All, I took service 110 this morning. I found an interesting scenario. A number of people boarded 110 at changi airport terminal 4 bus stop and alighted just 1 stop later at the bus stop further outside SATS flight kitchen bus stop and transferred to service 53. </p>
              <p>This shows most people will still take bus even for 1 bus stop instead of what most people think that they will walk. This also shows the awkward situation for those living around pasir ris area which has no direct service to terminal 4. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>While 137 connects Ubi and Kaki Bukit estates to DTL stations, it fails to connect with bus services from Tampines Ave 10 (e.g. 8, 15, 58, etc), Bedok Reservoir Rd (e.g. 21, 22, 65, 66, etc) and Eunos Link (e.g. 25, 51, 87, 854, etc). 137 provides more coverage to new areas but little integration with the existing bus network.</p>
              <p>But then, 137 is often full between Bedok North St 3 and Bedok North MRT during morning and evening peak hours. This sector alone probably generates enough revenue to cover for the low ridership in the other sectors.</p>
              <p>If 137 is amended to connect with more bus services, I believe the ridership will increase.</p>

              <p>I agree with your points. They should do minor tweaks to 137</p>
              <p>(1) Take left from Bedok North Road to Bedok Reservoir Road for bus interchange to svc 5, 21, 8, 65, 66, 228 etc. and then turn right on Ave 4 to go to Kaki bukit north industrial estate (following current route)</p>
              <p>(2) Take left onto Jalan Eunos and then right onto UBI Ave 2, do UBI MRT and then take left to connect to UBI Ave 1 and 63/63M. this will provide one stop transfer to 25, 45, 51, 854 and many other services. </p>

              <p>Since it was said that the terminal will open in end 2017 and the terminal looks more or less completed, the opening date could possibly be on Sunday December 31 since newer interchanges/terminals traditionally opens on Sundays.

              <p>They will need to introduce new services to newly developed areas such as Punggol Northshore, Tampines North, Bukit Batok West Town. This will need to happen either in form of new services or modification of exisiting services.</p>

              <p>Resources should also be diverted to areas served by only one MRT line or no MRT line, to provide more options for commuters. For example, instead of having multiple express services from Bukit Panjang to downtown (190, 700, 960, 972, DTL), why not divert one route to form an express service between Bukit Panjang/CCK and Jurong West/NTU? KJE is often congested, the NSL and EWL is often crowded esp at Jurong East, and the bus network in Jurong West really sucks when the EWL is closed. Jurong West residents and workers deserve a fast and direct route to DTL stations.</p>

              <p>While 137 connects Ubi and Kaki Bukit estates to DTL stations,
              it fails to connect with bus services from Tampines Ave 10 (e.g. 8,
              15, 58, etc), Bedok Reservoir Rd (e.g. 21, 22, 65, 66, etc) and
              Eunos Link (e.g. 25, 51, 87, 854, etc). 137 provides more coverage
              to new areas but little integration with the existing bus
              network.</p>
              <p>But then, 137 is often full between Bedok North St 3 and Bedok
              North MRT during morning and evening peak hours. This sector alone
              probably generates enough revenue to cover for the low ridership in
              the other sectors.</p>
              <p>If 137 is amended to connect with more bus services, I believe
