                  <p>Okay okay. This has been mentioned so many times, so let me just summarise, and let's move on afterwards.</p>
                  
                  <p>The reason why 110 goes to SMRT instead of other operators:</p>
                  <p>1. Changi Airport can only use bendy buses as high capacity buses; no double-deck. That's why award to SMRT, as only SMRT has bendy buses.</p>
                  <p>2. LTA pity SMRT because SMRT keep losing bus routes.</p>
                  
                  <p>Note: Bus drivers won't lose job because of BCM. The incoming operator must offer affected bus drivers a job at the new company, with conditions no worse than the incumbent operator.</p>

              <p>I don't expect the loading to be high, or even enough to sustain the operations for a number of years. It's probably temporary, and would be withdrawn, or integrated with 858 once they know what to do with 858.</p>
              <p>The purpose of 110 is probably to test water, to see whether 110 will reduce the number of commuters on 858 travelling along the sector towards the airport.</p>

              <p>Was there a mention of 27?</p>
              <p>Anyway, 27 is already at 10-20 minutes frequency during peak hours, and the loading is "standing available" for 2 single decker buses back-to-back.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, an increased in frequency to 5-10 minutes during peak hours may not be necessary, because this may lead to an excessive amount of unused resources during off-peak hours.</p>

                          <p>179 and 199 serve different areas, and there's little demand for bus connection within the NTU campus, especially during off-peak hours. What we need is a feeder connection to the MRT, which is already provided by 179 and 199.</p>
                          
                          <p>Nonetheless, the off-peak hour is not exactly low to the extent that the two services redundant. There's still a sizeable catchment, although they only require single decker buses.</p>
                          
                          <p>Fleet downgrades have been observed recently on 179 and 199, but the demand is not to the extent that it can be removed or anything. Furthermore, making them into a bi-directional bus service would actually require more resources, which is actually not wise. So, it's better to just keep it as it is.</p>
                          
                          <p>Thanks for the suggestion though.</p>

              <p>Anyway, 27 is already at 10-20 minutes frequency during peak

              <p>Nonetheless, an increased in frequency to 5-10 minutes during

                  <p>I believe what is required is a short working trip from Tampines to Compassvale, instead of an increased in frequency on the entire route.</p>

              <p>I don't expect the loading to be high, or even enough to sustain
                      the operations for a number of years. It's probably temporary, and
                      would be withdrawn, or integrated with 858 once they know what to
                      do with 858.</p>
              <p>The purpose of 110 is probably to test water, to see whether 110
                      will reduce the number of commuters on 858 travelling along the
                      sector towards the airport.</p>
              <p>Because once 858 loading drop significantly at that section
                      between Yishun and Changi, it could be merged with surrounding 965,
                      which plies about the same route from Woodlands to Sengkang.</p>
              <p>Sorry dupdup77, but I foresee a route amendment coming along, at
                      least for 858.</p>
              <p>The other one is 973 at Bukit Panjang. One of the routes may

              <p>I dun think 858 would be cut/slashed frm serving airport at all. It is an impt (but winding) service for ppl frm yishun and sembawang who needs to commute to the airport area, as well as for sengkang residents coz its DIRECT (unlike 27 and 34 which goes to tamp first). If you dont believe me u come to khatib mrt in the morning 858 is packed to the fullest in all of the buses. And where do they go? No they dont alight at jalan kayu or TPE bus stop. They all go towards airport. Asking them to change in Sengkang is going to create chaos when they have to transfer/cross street (if necessary depending how you forsee 858 might be amended). Yes ppl are struggling to board 858 at yishun/khatib area, if u want them to alight and then start squeezing onto 110, dude its not possible.</p>
              <p>Think abt it this way: 858 is already packed to the cap when it arrives at TPE bus stop. Sengkang/Punggol residents whoneed to work at changi/SATS, and they can even hardly squeeze in. Now, 110 will definitely relief this load and these ppl can board the bus. There's a reason why 858B is intrduced frm jalan kayu coz LTA saw that sengkang/punggol residents need to get to airport FAST (ppl cant get stranded at the bus stop coz all buses are full). So if you think cutting 858 in light of 110, it would create a heavoc nonetheless</p>
              <p>In fact, where 858 shld cut, ought to be somewhere between woodlands-yishun sector.</p>

                          <p>Serangoon-Eunos only has vacancy for 1 new route, according to the <a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/press/2016/20160811_Details_11_negotiated_packages_AnnexB.pdf">details of negotiated packages published last year.</a></p>
                          
                          <p>So, it's probably 137 that would be in the Serangoon-Eunos package, as 134 is there.</p>
                      
                      <p>As for 152, it's probably with the Sengkang-Hougang package.</p>
                      
                      <p>The Sengkang-Hougang package has 3 new routes, of which 329 was recently launched two months ago. 110 is probably with the Sengkang-Hougang package, considering 117 and several 110-series services is in the package.</p>
                      
                      <p>The third new route would probably be the 152 that you are writing about.</p>

              <p>Anyway, from my observation on the website, there is a period of
              time when the bus had "limited standing". It was until one minute
              before Compassvale LRT bus stop. I suspect it is from Tampines
              Avenue 10 to Compassvale Street.</p>
              <p>I believe what is required is a short working trip from Tampines
              to Compassvale, instead of an increased in frequency on the entire
              route.</p>

              I suggest you go down to the bus stop personally and observe the freq of the buses as bus apps are not 100% accurate.
              And take note 27 has pm peak downroutes from Century Square to Hougang. The only thing I want LTA to do with sv 27 is to deploy DDs on 27A/downroutes.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The problem with 858 is that it tags a winding feeder-style route within Woodlands - Yishun with a fast express route to the Airport. A best way to split it might be a route from Woodlands - KTPH (loop) and then a route from Sembawang - Airport that skip KTPH.</p></div>
