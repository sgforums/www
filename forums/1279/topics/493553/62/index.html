              <p>You have got it completely wrong. </p>
              <p>People would prefer spending 20 mins more on a direct bus from
              BPJ to Pioneer than do 3 transfers. Also CCK is a huge town in
              itself and can have a good patronage between JW and CCK/BPJ towns.
              In addition, NTU students will find this service extremely useful
              too.</p>
              <p>Moreover note 172 and 974 cater to completely different areas in
              CCK with only common stop is CCK MRT. From CCK MRT to JW, it is no
              brainer that 974 will be faster.</p>
              <p>I foresee heavy AM loading from CCK to JW but lower loading in
              opposite direction and vice versa.</p>

              <p>agree on this. Would rather go for direct bus service rather than transfering here and there. Its a hassle for some </p>

              <p>For the congestion, I am referring to the long queue of buses waiting to enter Boon Lay Interchange, thanks to the multiple traffic junctions outside the interchange and limited alighting berths inside the interchange.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I have checked.</p>
              <p>969 is popular, probably because it offers the same travel time
                  to Yishun, and just 10mins longer travel time to Woodlands, as
                  compared to the MRT.</p>
              <p>And, the distance per travel time is about 0.45km/min.</p>
              <p>Going by that basis, the maximum travel length for the following
                  inter-town bus routes (in order to be comparable to MRT) has to be
                  the following,</p>
              <p>Woodlands-Boon Lay 12.6km</p>
              <p>Choa Chu Kang-Tuas Link 14km</p>
              <p>Bukit Batok-Joo Koon 7.2km</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, none of the combinations can be provided under
                  the distance stated above.</p>
              <p>Woodlands to Boon Lay takes about 19km,</p>
              <p>Choa Chu Kang to Tuas Link takes about 17km, and</p>
              <p>Bukit Batok to Joo Koon takes about 12km.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the west, MRT is faster for inter-town travel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only exceptions are Boon Lay to King Albert Park, and Lim
                  Chu Kang to Jurong West and Woodlands.</p>
              <p>If LTA could provide a bus service that originates at Boon Lay
                  and loops at King Albert Park, via the shortest route, that bus
                  service would provide the fastest public transport connection
                  between Boon Lay and King Albert Park, and provide Jurong residents
                  an alternative to the East-West Line.</p>
              <p>Boon Lay to King Albert Park via the shortest route (10.8km; via
                  Boon Lay Way) would take about 24mins. On the MRT, it takes 36mins.
                  On bus 174, it takes 50mins.</p>
              <p>If LTA could introduce a bus service from Boon Lay to King
                  Albert Park, that bus service would be popular.</p>

                                      <p>154 from Boon Lay to King Albert Park - 62mins; longer than 174 (49mins), 157 (51mins) and MRT (36mins) to travel the same section.</p>
                                      <p>I understand that Google Maps suggests taking MRT to Clementi and transferring to 154. But this option takes about 37mins and is subjected to the traffic condition along Clementi Road.</p>
                                      <p>The bus service I recommended would be a better option.</p>

              <p>I feel that 171 can be rationalised and its YIS-BPJ section can go to 974, making it a YIS to JK through route. Hillview to CBD portion can be covered by 67, whose LTI-TAM portion can be easily covered by 65. There is always DTL and 66 to tank some of the load between Bedok Reservoir and CBD.</p>

              <p>There will be long-distance trunk routes in future.</p>
              <p>LTA has said that it is considering having more bus services along main MRT sections, especially during peak periods, to accommodate to the MRT maintenance and renewal works. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zaobao.com/news/singapore/story20180122-828892?xtor=CS2-8">Source</a>)</p>
              <p>Already, we have long-distance bus routes 12e, 147e and 974 launched after BSEP.</p>
              <p>True, 974 is the only long-distance trunk route launched so far, but I believe there will be more long-distance trunk routes launched in future.</p>

              <p>There will be long-distance trunk routes in future.</p>
              <p>LTA has said that it is considering having more bus services
              along main MRT sections, especially during peak periods, to
              accommodate to the MRT maintenance and renewal works. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zaobao.com/news/singapore/story20180122-828892?xtor=CS2-8">Source</a>)</p>
              <p>Already, we have long-distance bus routes 12e, 147e and 974
              launched after BSEP.</p>
              <p>True, 974 is the only long-distance trunk route launched so far,
              but I believe there will be more long-distance trunk routes
              launched in future.</p>

              <p>12e,147e is an express service,I don’t call 974 as long distance route.Its just only mid haul route with a portion using KJE.</p>
              <p>My definition of long routes is above 24km per direction.Svc like 5 etc..</p>

              <p>Chey. If thatâ€™s the case, going by the definition that â€œlong routes are above 24km per directionâ€�, yes, there is probably no long-distance trunk service in future.</p>

              <p>Yes,That’s we measured how long distance is.Sadly our so called long distance routes is too windings,Doesnt really supplement rail at all thus the need of more bridging buses.Examples svc 51 &amp; 61 which both I’ve drive before.We need something like 857,966 which is more direct.</p>

              <p>By the way my guess fleet for svc 68 is majority DD(A95/B9TL) and a couple of SD.</p>
              <p>For service 974 would be B9TL and Citaro </p>
