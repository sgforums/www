              <p>Best case is 135 shorten to Sims Pl, then 125 merge with 47 and
              cover part of 135 route. at the same time 40 can serve Parkway
              Parade so the merged entity of 47/125 can serve East Coast Rd in
              both directions.</p>
              <p>As for 25 being extended it came as a surprise. i would have
              preferred 26 to be extended to UEC, with 76 extended to Bedok via
              current 26 route.</p>
              <p>With 55 being extended to UEC it is better off being allocated
              to Bedok contract. 100 can go to Serangoon contract and 196 to
              Clementi contract.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I feel that some of the queues in Bedok Interchange

              <p>Bedok Int is what I call the epitome of failure. A regression, and a downgrade. </p>
              <p>14 and 222 was all the while stuck tgt even in the temp int. Why split them apart?? Esp KNOWING that they have to be tgt as seen from its prev allocations. This means that they are going BACK on the smart moves they have made. </p>
              <p>Then there is the traffic. Never have I seen such horrific traffic in any interchange. Its disgusting knowing the alighting berth of Bedok Int is no diff from that of Sengkang, who has half the no. Of svcs. </p>
              <p>In hindsight they might as well have kept the temp int and named it as an extension. </p>
              <p>Whoever designed the int should rly get sacked. Esp the one who did the berth allocations. A plain idiot that person is! He don't deserve his rice bowl if he doesnt use his brains. </p>

              <p>Those who regularly take 25/854 from Bedok Interchange to Jalan
              Eunos, Eunos Link and Hougang Ave 3 &amp; 2 will be sad because in
              the future they can only take 854 from Bedok Interchange. Not only
              is the waiting time doubled, the chance of getting a seat also
              decreases as 854 uses more SDs and less DDs than svc 25.</p>
              <p>Also, with the extension of 25 to UEC, there is less incentive
              for SBST to improve the frequency and capacity for svc 45. As a
              Bedok North resident, I am often fed up by the waiting time of svc
              45 (which can be 20 min or longer) and most of the time I take 225
              to Bedok Interchange and change to 25/854 so that I can get a seat.
              Now, I have one less option from Bedok Interchange.  :(</p>
              <p>While Bedok South and Bayshore residents see more and more bus
              services, I and my neighbours can only watch with envy as we don't
              see any new bus services after the introduction of 45 in 2006. (The
              new svc 46, the amended svc 18 and the extended svc 155 all miss my
              area.) </p>

              <p>Hi mr autumncs, this is exactly the problem passengers face with an amendment/extension of a bus service. Some passengers will benefit while some will lose out. LTA cannot satisfy everybody with limited resources. Some passengers have to be accustomed to alternative way of traveling while a new market of passengers will benefit. </p>
              <p>For your case, you lose out on the convenience portion only. You cannot take 25/854 at bedok interchange anymore soon. You have to choose 854 at bedok interchange or walk to outside bedok mrt take 25. Not too bad. You still can choose. If you don't want to walk, you still can take bus to any nearby bus stop with 25 to take it. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Its not as easy as you say. Not everyone has the time and ability to check which bus arrives first. Esp given that outbound 25 plies the stop opp the mall, means that esp for those taking the MRT, they now have to turn diff directions for diff services. Its rly rly inconvenient. </p>
              <p>For those transferring from services within bedok they now no longer have svc 25 departure timings, and now has essentially only one option in the int. Its also hard to guage arrival timings, given diff proximities and hence diff walking time needed to be allocated. </p>
              <p>Dont oversimplify the problem. You have the privilege to not be one of the crowds that have to rush to work at Eunos and Ubi. So I'd advise you to go check it.</p>

              <p>Hi mr AJQZC, without the MRT coming to this area yet, I don't expect too much of a bus rationalisation. Routes are even extended in this 9 April 2017 exercise. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>True. This is what could happen:</p>
              <p>Ppl who use to take 25/854 to bedok and transfer to another bus,
              lets call them services A or B or C or etc. frm bedok int, will
              still continue to do so aft the changes, since the bedok mrt bus
              stop is close to the interchange.</p>
              <p>However, those who take A or B or C or etc. will take 854
              instead of 25 to eunos/hougang area. The reason being that they
              have to cross the underpass if they intend to take 25 which is rly
              inconvenient, unless some of them take services like 9, 35 which
              stop opp the bedok mall/bedok int. It is hence understandable that
              Mr autumncs is worried as pointed out in the first paragraph</p>

              <p>Inbound travel will be negligible in impact as the boarding point will be the same for most commuters. Alighting points may be different but will not matter as much as both bring them to the same destination that is Bedok Ctrl. They just need to make diff ways to say the MRT. </p>
              <p>The effects can only be felt during outbound travel. When both svcs are torn apart and now have diff boarding points. This is only compounded by the fact that outbound 25 uses the stop opp Bedok Int instead of the one near it, meaning that MRT crowds must now turn in diff directions in the underpass. The stop is also much further away from bus-bus transfer pax. To add fuel to fire, outbound travel coincides with the primary load factor for both services: working crowds heading to Ubi. This means that the effects are much worse when they are affected during the time when they have no seconds to spare, rather than when they are relaxed and carefree after work. </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Actually, most residents in Bedok are not really affected by the change. Those who lives along Bedok North Avenue 3 can take 28 or 67 to New Upper Changi Road to catch both 25 and 854. Those who lives along Bedok North Road (between Ave 3 and New Upper Changi Road) and Chai Chee can take 222 to New Upper Changi Road too. Bedok South Ave 3 residents benefit the most as they can take 25 directly, and those who live along Bedok South Road can take 229 to New Upper Changi Road to catch both 25 and 854. Those who lives along Bedok North Ave 3 and Bedok North Road (between Ave 3 and PIE) can also take 45 to Jalan Eunos, although the frequency of 45 is horrible. </span></p>
              <p>Those who lose out the most are residents who have bus services to Bedok Interchange only and nowhere else - i.e. residents along Bedok North Street 3 and Bedok North Avenue 4. For these people, Bedok Interchange is an unavoidable transfer point. (Unfortunately I'm one of these people.)</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For those who don't live in Bedok, please don't underestimate the distance and time required to walk from Bedok Interchange to the bus stop on the other side of New Upper Changi Road. (The heavy human traffic in the underpass can significantly increase walking time.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Although I can take 7, 30, 32, 33 or 40 to the next bus stop to catch 25/854, there is a risk of not getting a seat, esp if the next 25/854 is a SD.</span></p>

              <p>Inbound travel will be negligible in impact as the boarding
              point will be the same for most commuters. Alighting points may be
              different but will not matter as much as both bring them to the
              same destination that is Bedok Ctrl. They just need to make diff
              ways to say the MRT. </p>
              <p>The effects can only be felt during outbound travel. When both
              svcs are torn apart and now have diff boarding points. This is only
              compounded by the fact that outbound 25 uses the stop opp Bedok Int
              instead of the one near it, meaning that MRT crowds must now turn
              in diff directions in the underpass. The stop is also much further
              away from bus-bus transfer pax. To add fuel to fire, outbound
              travel coincides with the primary load factor for both services:
              working crowds heading to Ubi. This means that the effects are much
              worse when they are affected during the time when they have no
              seconds to spare, rather than when they are relaxed and carefree
              after work. </p>

              <p>I agree. But at least 38 and 229 isnt as needy since they eventually ply different routes to the same destination. 14 and 222 however is just fuckin common sense! Why's it so hard to use a bit of it?</p>
