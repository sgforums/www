                      <p>Why so complicated? Why not just split it into two routes, considering there's a need to improve frequency and service reliability on both sides?</p>
                      
                      <p>I understand the rationale of combining them into one was to improve intra-town connectivity, but from the looks of it, there's a greater need for feeder connection than intra-town connection.</p>
              
              <p>Considering the situation has evolved to this state, it may be better to split the route into two, rather than create one or two route variants for both sides of the route.</p>

              <p>Same thing happened to my mother at PSR Int back in 1997 when SBS started TownLinks. She wanted to go to PSR St 21 that was served by 357 (following 352 alignment) but boarded at the queue for the direction towards St 71 (former 356 queue). Anyway, there were two different colours (green for St 71, yellow for St 21) for the respective queues, which were (and still are) located at adjacent sawtooth berths.</p>

              <p>Why so complicated? Why not just split it into two routes,

              <p>I understand the rationale of combining them into one was to
              improve intra-town connectivity, but from the looks of it, there's
              a greater need for feeder connection than intra-town

              <p>Nonetheless, the consolation is that 912A and 912B will operate at two times the frequency as 912, and they will occupy two different berths at Woodlands Bus Interchange.</p>
              
              <p>912 can be re-numbered, extended to Sembawang Bus Interchange and removed from Woodlands Bus Interchange to avoid confusion.</p>

              <p>Seriously there is no need for 856A,Wasted resources and in the

              <p>856A should have skipped WTCP instead, turning into Marsiling Road and Marsiling Drive.</p>
