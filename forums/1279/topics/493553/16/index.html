              <p>Problem with Marsiling is that many residents in the region
              (except those along MRT tracks) do not have a direct service to
              Marsiling MRT, even though it's the nearest station to them. There
              have been various suggestions of 911, 912 and 913's route variants
              to link residents to Marsiling MRT.</p>

              <p>Compassvale Int was meant as an expansion for Sengkang. It's also right opposite the existing interchange. It wasn't meant to be a new interchange.</p>
              <p>Also, when Compassvale Int was announced, I heard some people saying, "Of all parts of Sengkang, they chose to build it opposite the existing interchange! What about the big field at Buangkok MRT? Waste of government money!"</p>

              <p>That's out of the point bro. The route is actually good IMO, as
              it links to many key facilities in Hougang. Hougang 1 shopping
              mall, Ci Yuan CC/food centre, Hougang Stadium/Swimming Complex,
              Hougang Polyclinic, Blk 681 market, and a few primary and secondary
              schools.</p>
              <p>What many people here, including me, are not happy about about
              is the lack of direct connection to the nearest MRT, Buangkok.</p>

              <p>I think his point is that 329 is overly duplicative with 72 and 116 along Hougang Ave 4/9, especially when 72 already has robust frequency and 116 is still struggling to get decent loading (esp. if it comes after 72 during AM peak).</p>
              <p>With 329's introduction, it is probably time for some amendments to 116.</p>

              <p>The 3 routes have different purposes.</p>
              <p>72: Link Hougang residents to YCK/AMK and Tampines towns</p>
              <p>116: Link Serangoon North residents to facilities in Hougang, and Hougang MRT</p>
              <p>329: Link Buangkok Cres residents to facilities in Hougang, and Hougang MRT</p>
              <p>And these facilities in Hougang (Hougang 1 shopping mall, Ci Yuan CC, Hougang Polyclinic, Hougang Stadium/Sports Complex, Blk 681 market) are mostly located along Hougang Ave 4/9. This explains why the routes are so duplicative.</p>

              <p>101 has another catchment at Hougang Street 51. A mutual route

              <p>No one takes 325 from Hougang MRT to Hougang St 51/52. The route goes to Hougang Ave 10 and 8 first. Taking 27 or 161 to Hougang Ave 6/8 and walking is usually faster.</p>

                      <p>By the fact that the bus loops at Buangkok Link instead of Buangkok Crescent, it may be an indication that the route may be extended in future.</p>
                      <p>From Buangkok Link, the route can go two ways â€“ to Buangkok or Yio Chu Kang â€“ as the future extension of Buangkok Drive would connect Buangkok Green to Yio Chu Kang Road via Buangkok Link.</p> 
                      <p>Considering the route from Serangoon to Buangkok is only 8 kilometres, either way is possible as an extension to Yio Chu Kang bus interchange or Buangkok bus interchange would not make the route excessively long for trunk bus service 101.</p> 
                      <p>We should consider all options carefully before making a decision as an extension of bus service 101 could potentially enhance the overall public transport connectivity in the North-Eastern part of Singapore.</p>

                  <p>It's even worse if LTA didn't introduce 329 and just let 101
                  serve the area. What's the damn point of taking a more winding
                  route to the 2nd nearest MRT?</p>

              <p>I agree that Buangkok Crescent should have bus connection to other areas besides Hougang and Serangoon. Although the flats along Buangkok Green are within walking distance to many intra-town bus services, the other parts of Buangkok Crescent only have bus service 101 and 329 that connects them to Hougang and Serangoon. More could be done to connect Buangkok Crescent to other areas.</p>
              <p>If there are intra-town bus services in the area that have poor loading, we can consider re-routing them to Buangkok Crescent, to make up for the shortage of intra-town bus connections in that area.</p>

                              <p>Yes, I agree with the part about linking to Buangkok and
                              Serangoon MRTs. I have suggested a modified 43M that enters
                              Buangkok Link/Cres several times here.</p>
                              <p>LTA route planners should really be sacked for this lazy
                              planning. 2 services both linking to the 2nd nearest MRT won't be
                              able to serve every resident there! As someone posted on LTA
                              Facebook, they can't expect residents from Tropica (which is all
                              the way inside at Buangkok Dr, opposite Sengkang MRT/LRT depot) to
                              walk all the way out to Buangkok Green just to take 43 to the
                              nearest MRT! Might as well just walk straight to Buangkok MRT! I'm
                              99% sure those fuckers don't take public transport, which explains
                              their ignorance!</p>
                              <p>This new feeder isn't redundant though, it links to key
                              facilities in Hougang, and Hougang Town Centre. The problem is the
                              lack of connection to the nearest MRT station Buangkok, and there
                              being only 1 service (no one will take 101 anymore to Hougang MRT
                              with 329 now)</p>

              <p>Distance wise, it is better to take the train to Hougang MRT Station and transfer to bus service 329, when travelling from the Central Business District to Buangkok Crescent. Taking the train to Buangkok MRT Station and taking a bus from there would actually incur a longer travel distance.</p>
              
                              <p>Although transferring at Buangkok MRT Station may be faster, transferring at Hougang MRT Station would be better as most fare-paying adults travel towards the Central Business District, and every distance counts.</p>
                              
                              <p>Whereas for the journey between Buangkok Crescent and Hougang Bus Interchange, Bus service 329 would provide a shorter connection than bus service 101. Bus service 329 takes approximately 3.6 kilometres to get from Hougang MRT Station to Buangkok Crescent, whereas bus service 101 takes around 4.1 kilometres.</p>
                              
                              <p>The difference of 0.5 kilometres is around 3 minutes in travelling time. Although not a lot, itâ€™s still a service enhancement for the people at Buangkok Crescent as they would enjoy higher frequency on bus service 329, and a connection to community amenities along Hougang Avenue 9 that is currently not provided by bus service 101.</p>

              <p>Although the distance from Buangkok Cres to Buangkok MRT is not that much less than to Hougang MRT, do take note that the stretch of Buangkok Drive between Buangkok Green/Sengkang East Rd and Buangkok Link will be express. So, travelling time should be around 7-8 minutes.</p>
              <p>Also, don't forget that Buangkok MRT is under utilised, while Hougang is overcrowded. It would be better for the residents at Buangkok Cres to go to Buangkok MRT if they are heading to the CBD.</p>
