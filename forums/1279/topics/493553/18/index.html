              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, I think you are the real joker. They have used other avenues to feedback. This is the MP way of announcing to residents what she is going to look. You just need to see how many new services have been introduced In Punggol last few years to know the effects. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>As a resident at Buangkok link myself, let me tell you that I don't buy the idea of taking a bus to Buangkok MRT station if it is only slightly nearer than Hougang MRT. Simply because, it does not make sense in terms of distance and adult fare to take a bus in a backward direction when heading to CBD. Even when the busstop to take 43 is only 300-400m away for me and the journey to Buangkok MRT is shorter than to Serangoon. MRT, I always chose to cross over to take 43 to Serangoon instead. </p>
              <p>So although duplicative to a certain extent, 329 is good for what it is worth</p>
              <p>1) 101 is too Long and too slow and that always made me take 43 to Serangoon instead of 101 to Hougang. With 329, I may reconsider Hougang instead of 43 to Serangoon. </p>
              <p>2) 329 can ease some load off 72 although 116 can also do the job. With 329, I really think the service that will become most redundant will be 116. </p>
              <p>3) 329 connects to Hougang 1, a connection Buangkok residents never had. </p>
              <p>I would have preferred a link to Serangoon or AMK though since the banner put up by the MP of my area said BSEP for AMK GRC when this is actually a Hougang feeder. AMK and Serangoon MRT is more useful vs Buangkok. If Buangkok MRT is underutilised, LTA shld consider providing a bus from Sengkang west ave to Buangkok MRT (the secotors served by 163) as it makes more sense for them to go Buangkok than Sengkang. Don't use Buangkok crescent or link residents (if the route is going to be via Buangkok green)</p>
              <p>with 329, I think DDs on 101 will become quite redundant as people seldom go upper deck and even those who go are the longer distance Travelers to Buangkok link. But this group of people may switch to 329 now. </p>

              <p>What you said make some sense. Even though i'm not a resident there, i have this general feeling that LTA always give those CBD-going commuters greater convenience compared to other commuters going to other areas. I think routes created by LTA are 80% correct or load-worthy (20% for those failures like 256 haha), so i feel it is generally quite ok.</p>
              <p>With buangkok ITH coming within the next 5 to 10 years, im confident that there will be routes to areas like amk and serangoon.</p>
              <p>Anyways lets see how 116 works out aft 329 is rolled out. Who knows if 116 may be withdrawn or amended haha</p>

              <p>Makes sense. But for the residents at the upper end of Buangkok Cres (those opposite Sengkang MRT/LRT depot), going to Buangkok wouldn't be 'backward direction'.</p>
              <p>I do expect 43 loading to go down slightly, and 101 loading to go down massively.</p>

              <p>116 is still needed to give Serangoon North residents a direct connection to Hougang MRT. 116 is the fastest link for the inner parts of Serangoon North Ave 4 (those flats behind Rosyth School) to any MRT station.</p>

              <p>With buangkok ITH coming within the next 5 to 10 years, im
              confident that there will be routes to areas like amk and
              serangoon.</p>
              <p>Anyways lets see how 116 works out aft 329 is rolled out. Who
              knows if 116 may be withdrawn or amended haha</p>

              <p>As a resident at Buangkok link myself, let me tell you that I
              don't buy the idea of taking a bus to Buangkok MRT station if it is
              only slightly nearer than Hougang MRT. Simply because, it does not
              make sense in terms of distance and adult fare to take a bus in a
              backward direction when heading to CBD. Even when the busstop to
              take 43 is only 300-400m away for me and the journey to Buangkok
              MRT is shorter than to Serangoon. MRT, I always chose to cross over

              useful vs Buangkok. If Buangkok MRT is underutilised, LTA shld
              consider providing a bus from Sengkang west ave to Buangkok MRT
              (the secotors served by 163) as it makes more sense for them to go
              Buangkok than Sengkang. Don't use Buangkok crescent or link

              <p>There are other people who prefer convenience over distance fare, so Buangkok MRT would be their choice as the station is much more empty than Hougang and the trains are also more empty. And for some people, going to Buangkok MRT saves more time as it 1) avoids the multiple traffic lights and probable jam at Hougang Ctrl Int and 2) saves the walk from Hougang Ctrl Int alighting berths to MRT station.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Sbs3004X, this is happening consistently every night. I have been there and I witnessed it too. One point I will like to stress is that 116 is super near 1 exit of the hougang mrt station. This also shows that less and less people prefer to walk a super long way to catch bus. They prefer it at doorstep exit. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, if service 116 continues to use single deck bus, this service will just be an okay service with an okay SD loading. You don't expect every service to hit top demand anyway. Most importantly, you don't expect to amend or withdraw a service everytime it does not hit good loading at peak hours. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>There are other people who prefer convenience over distance
              fare, so Buangkok MRT would be their choice as the station is much
              more empty than Hougang and the trains are also more empty. And for
              some people, going to Buangkok MRT saves more time as it 1) avoids
              the multiple traffic lights and probable jam at Hougang Ctrl Int
              and 2) saves the walk from Hougang Ctrl Int alighting berths to MRT
              station.</p>

              <p>Well if u stay at Blk 911/opp Blk 910 or Blk 969/opp block 968 busstops along Buangkok green, you will know that vast majority of people there going to CBD will still take 43 to Serangoon instead of 43 to Buangkok even though 43 is faster to Buangkok. This is even worth the improved frequency with 43M. LTA shld have considered that ez-link data when planning too. 43 from opp Blk 910 to Buangkok MRT is a good 7-8mins and 101 is 12-13mins to Hougang from that same busstop Buangkok to Hougang is another 3mins, so at best u save 2mins?</p>
              <p>thats why like I mentioned, if it is a route to Buangkok MRT via Buangkok green, people in Buangkok link/crescent will still mostly opt Hougang MRT. When the Buangkok drive extension is completed and there is a route by the back of Buangkok link, it might change things.</p>

              <p>Yes. Same berth is 74 and 147. Right in front. I think it gives people a good option between 101 and 329. after all, if 101 comes 5mins before 329, it will still be a faster option to Buangkok even with a longer journey by distance. </p>

              <p>Hi Mr. randomguy,</p>
              <p>Yes, it might seem to make sense that people prefer CBD-directional journeys, hence preferring to take 43/43M. However, leaving a complete new BTO estate (i.e. Buangkok Crescent estate with approx 2000? households shifting in) with just one service to Hougang MRT, which is 10 bus stops + many traffic lights away (with AM/PM traffic I would presume it takes 15-20minutes) is pretty uncalled for, no?</p>
              <p>I do acknowledge that it brings about useful links to Hougang 1, which Buangkok residents never had, but do note that the residents staying at the outer area of Buangkok estate (served by 101), as you mentioned, have the alternative of 43 which brings them to both Buangkok and Serangoon. But I find that it is pretty ridiculous to have 329 as the sole service in the estate, which: </p>
              <p>(i) isn't near the main road (Buangkok green) at all (hence NO alternatives);</p>
              <p>(ii) highly possibly will take a long journey to the nearest MRT, having to ply Hougang avenue 4 with high people volume;</p>
              <p>(iii) Buangkok MRT area obviously has lighter traffic than the Hougang Central area which has so many buses + traffic lights </p>
              <p>I find that it is good, and necessary to have 329 to provide useful links, but I don't think that it should be the ONLY service in the Buangkok crescent area. Of course, wishing for authorities to divert 43M inside seems like the most feasible solution, but the other residents along Buangkok green might complain about the frequency of relying on only 43 - but which Buangkok crescent resident wouldn't want a direct link to Serangoon and Buangkok? FYI, I will be shifting in to one of the BTOs as well, and I find that a link to Buangkok and not Hougang will be the best and most efficient solution - both to improve the utilization of Buangkok as many have pointed out and to save the time for residents significantly! </p>
              <p>Especially with the lack of direct links and express services to CBD in estates along NEL, it is only important to ensure that residents have the fastest link to a train station - if Punggol/SK can have LRTs, and existing Buangkok area residents have buses to Serangoon and Hougang, why should the route planning division in LTA have discounted the residents along Buangkok crescent to only have ONE service to Hougang which is so far away? This just doesn't make lots of sense to me. And I don't think the saving of time will just be a meager 2-3 minutes. Let me do the math for you:</p>
              <p>Buangkok Crescent - Dhoby Ghaut (example)</p>
              <p>329 Buangkok crescent -  Hougang MRT : estimated time during AM peak - 20 minutes with traffic conditions etc</p>
              <p>Hougang - Dhoby - 17 mins </p>
              <p>total : 37 mins</p>
              <p>Assuming a new service that links to Buangkok MRT directly from the new Buangkok Link area being built, I'm pretty sure it will only take 8-10 minutes - assuming it only passes by say 4-5 bus stops</p>
              <p>Buangkok - Dhoby - 19 mins</p>
              <p>total: 27-29 mins</p>
              <p>Please note that the only walkable alternative is for residents to walk to Gerald drive area to take bus 50 to AMK or 70/103 to Serangoon (500 meters walk away which isn't very near at all for a bus stop). Everyday this saves residents potentially 20 mins for a 2-way trip and clearly this is much more efficient. I know that I might be the only one wishing for the stars here by hoping that a service can be introduced to link to both Serangoon and Buangkok, but I really do hope that authorities will consider the needs and importance of providing a link to the nearest MRT, or else I can't imagine how bad the crowd will be like on 329 and Hougang MRT when all the houses are built finish (around 3Q 2018). Thanks. </p>
