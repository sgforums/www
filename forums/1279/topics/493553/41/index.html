              <p>Both 137 and 298 are interesting. 20 is well expected.</p>

              <p>38 connects Simei residents (esp. those in inner roads) to Tampines East MRT. If 38 is touched, travel time would be significantly longer.</p>
              <p>118's skipped bus stop is within walking distance to Changi South Ave 1 iirc. If they're really lazy they can also take 47 to Ave 1 and transfer to 118.</p>
              <p>18's duplication to 28 is not a big concern IMO, as the routes between Tampines MRT and N3 are quite different (in fact, most of 28's loading from Tampines MRT are towards Ave 9 / St 45 only).</p>

              <p>293's amendment is really bad... Not only does it take away the only service at Tampines St 43, now St 42 residents will have an EXTREMELY long journey to/from Tampines MRT (unless they walk to Ave 7/9). Furthermore, Ave 9 (TPJC bus stop) now only has 29, and this svc is often unable to cope with the load further up Ave 9.</p>
              <p>I would suggest a new service (or extension) from Tampines MRT/Int, via Tampines Ave 7, Ave 9, St 42, St 43, Ave 9 and loop back. 46 can probably do the job.</p>

              <p>18 is a good choice as the service was under-utilized anyway.
              this will give it a boost. 4/19/37 cannot be touched. Already heavy
              loading. 38 is debatable as it will connect it to Simei but with 18
              it connects it to Tampines West like svc 28 (which is already
              overcrowded). </p>
              <p>I am surprised with 118 amendment as well. There is need for
              another service in CBP and I am surprised LTA does not want to
              introduce new service even when all 20, 47 and 118 are  super
              hit in the CBP area.</p>

              <p>I think either 47 or 118 will have to be amended anyway. If there are new services introduced in CBP, I'd rather see them cover more areas instead of simply following 47/118's route.</p>

              <p>I would suggest a new service (or extension) from Tampines
              MRT/Int, via Tampines Ave 7, Ave 9, St 42, St 43, Ave 9 and loop
              back. 46 can probably do the job.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes slightly agree. They did build a new bus stop at blk 444 just outside tampines ave 2 which is a short walk from the previous bus stop at blk 442 along tampines st 43. The affected residents can still take the amended 293 to tampines east mrt and transfer to mrt to reach tampines mrt/bus interchange. A bit troublesome. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>38 connects Simei residents (esp. those in inner roads) to
              Tampines East MRT. If 38 is touched, travel time would be
              significantly longer.</p>
              <p>118's skipped bus stop is within walking distance to Changi
              South Ave 1 iirc. If they're really lazy they can also take 47 to
              Ave 1 and transfer to 118.</p>
              <p>18's duplication to 28 is not a big concern IMO, as the routes
              between Tampines MRT and N3 are quite different (in fact, most of
              28's loading from Tampines MRT are towards Ave 9 / St 45 only).</p>

              <p>Agreed. Touching 38 may be one of the worst mistakes one could make. </p>
              <p>Anyway 18 is so low in demand now in tamp, maybe this extension would help a little</p>
              <p>Besides, the duplication isn't a problem when u realise half of that estate only has 28. And 28 can get horrendous in freq in terms of stability. </p>

              <p>People can drop at two bus stops for Tampines Avenue 7 and take 4, 8, 18, 19, 21, 37, 38 and 81 (8 routes). You can take the MRT across if you do not want the troublesome transfer. Cashless initiative is only a trial while we only adapt 90% and not 100% of the legal transfer.</p>

              <p>As a resident of Bedok North St 3, I am excited to see a new full-time trunk service. (137 is the first new full-time service along B.N. St 3 since svc 225 was introduced in the 1970s/1980s)...</p>
              <p>But when I look at the route of 137, I rolled my eyes... The route is so winding! The route is certainly useful for short-distance trips (e.g. B.N. St 3 to B.N. MRT, Kaki Bukit Estate to Ubi MRT or B.N. MRT, UEC Rd to Bedok MRT, etc) but I guess very few people will take travel more than 50% of the route unless they want to take a good nap. </p>
              <p>I am wondering about the frequency of svc 137. I hope it doesn't have a horrible frequency like svc 45 (20 minutes during off-peak). </p>
              <p>I am also wondering how 137 would be able to turn right from B.N. Ave 1 to B.N. Rd after the bus stop opp Blk 546. The bus stop is very close to the junction of B.N. Ave 1 and B.N. Rd and the roads leading to the junction are often jammed.</p>

              <p>Hi mr marvel68, this 293 amendment shows the first class problem of an mrt station being built for residents and bus services have to be amended to complement it. It is always the MRT first. In any way, residents should be overjoyed at having tampines east mrt nearby them. The amendment is not totally pointless. Service 293 connects them to tampines east mrt, giving residents a choice and for those who are unable to walk much. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
