For inter-town travel, itâ€™s actually better to take the MRT than to take 974 as travelling time is shorter.</p>

              <p>Considering thereâ€™s almost no time savings, can someone enlighten me, is relieving the loading of 172 the only reason for having 974? Because if thatâ€™s the case, it would be better to introduce limited-stops 172 instead.</p>

              1 Shoppers' Mall to Westwood Sec Sch and the Mosque at Jalan Bahar.
              For inter-town travel, it’s actually better to take the MRT than to
              take 974 as travelling time is shorter.</p>

              <p>Many commuters don't mind spending a longer time on the bus because...<br>- some of them just want to sit down<br>- some of them want to take a nap after a long day at work<br>- some of them don't want to be judged for sitting down (e.g. military personnel in uniform)<br>- some of them want more privacy and personal space (What is personal space in the MRT?)<br>- some of them want a quieter ride (without all the train announcements)<br>- some of them don't want to change trains (esp at Jurong East which is super-chaotic during peak hours)<br>- some of them are travelling to/from locations served by buses but not MRT (e.g. Jurong Camp, Westwood Sec Sch, etc)<br>- some of them are bus fans but not train fans</p>
              <p>Such commuters will be benefited by 974. These commuters are also the reason why many trunk routes that run parallel to MRT lines still exist today (e.g. svc 2, 70, 147).</p>
              <p>Of course, if the bus ride is ridiculously long and winding, the extra time will outweigh the benefits above. 974 is good in a sense that it has an express sector so that the travelling time is still reasonable.

              <p>By the way, transferring at Boon Lay and Jurong East can be quite stressful and slow. </p>
              <p>From Jurong West St 63, you need to pass through 3 traffic junctions to get into Boon Lay interchange, and there can be a long queue of buses waiting to enter Boon Lay interchange. (Waiting times of more than 5 minutes are common during peak hour.) Once the bus enters Boon Lay interchange, you may be dropped off at the alighting berth furthest away from Boon Lay MRT. The interchange and Jurong Point can be very crowded, the entrance to Boon Lay MRT is facing Boon Lay Way and not Jurong Point, and there is only one escalator going up to the platform, so it takes time to get from the interchange to the MRT platform. (It can be really bad during peak hours.) 99% of the time, you won't get a seat on the MRT at Boon Lay during peak hours. Sometimes you may not even be able to get onto the train.</p>
              <p>At Jurong East MRT during peak hours, your eastbound EWL train will arrive at platform B &amp; C. The next NSL train to Marina Bay may depart at platform A on the left, or platform D on the right. You may see a train waiting at platform A, but once you alight the EWL and walk towards platform A, the NSL train closes its doors in your face and leaves. You either have to go down to the concourse and then go up to Platform D for the next NSL train, or wait for the second next NSL train at Platform A. While waiting for your NSL train, loads and loads of people get off from the EWL and join you in the queue. Once the NSL train arrives, everyone rushes in like a mob. If you are slow, the train door may even close before you can get on.</p>
              <p>If you ask me to choose between 974 and the MRT, I will definitely choose 974. (I will only choose the MRT if I am in extreme hurry and KJE shows up as red on Google Map.)</p>

              <p>The fact that it reduces transfers is a very impt point till these days. Consider this as well: would u rather take a mid-haul flight to a destination direct, or have at least one transit when u have the option between the 2? (consider going to more small areas in regional countries like Indo and Aust)</p>

              <p>Considering there’s almost no time savings, can someone
              enlighten me, is relieving the loading of 172 the only reason for
              having 974? Because if that’s the case, it would be better to
              introduce limited-stops 172 instead.</p>
              <p>Because from what I see, 974 is going to be very un-utilised.
              With only additional capacity as the incentive, very few people
              would want to take 974 instead of 172 or the MRT.</p>
              <p>Also, 974 doesn’t exactly cover 172 areas in Choa Chu Kang, so
              how does this serve as a complementary service of 172?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, 974 may need re-routing in Choa Chu Kang and
              retracting to Boon Lay; going all the way to Joo Koon may not be
              necessary.</p>
              <p>974 can become a service that originates at Gali Batu,
              duplicates 172 at Choa Chu Kang and Jurong West, and loops around
              Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>You have got it completely wrong. </p>
              <p>People would prefer spending 20 mins more on a direct bus from BPJ to Pioneer than do 3 transfers. Also CCK is a huge town in itself and can have a good patronage between JW and CCK/BPJ towns. In addition, NTU students will find this service extremely useful too.</p>
              <p>Moreover note 172 and 974 cater to completely different areas in CCK with only common stop is CCK MRT. From CCK MRT to JW, it is no brainer that 974 will be faster.</p>
              <p>I foresee heavy AM loading from CCK to JW but lower loading in opposite direction and vice versa.</p>

              <p>58 slower than 68?? How can that be possible when 58 route is more direct while 68 is a little bit more winding?</p>
              <p>72 doesn't go to IKEA. It should be 27/168. Why would people take 68 when they get 27 and 168 outside Tampines MRT with superb frequency and they are used to it.</p>
              <p>Not sure there will be many takers from Tampines Int to Meridian JC when most will prefer to take 3/68/359 from Pasir Ris (their current travel pattern). </p>

              <p>Honestly, I hope 974 is not a one-off, but the first of many bus routes that use the KJE-PIE sector to enhance the North-West public transport connections, like those along the SLE-TPE sector in the North-East.</p>

                                              <p>And I think thatâ€™s about it. Unlike the North-East, the North-West has less areas.</p>
                                              
                                              <p>The demand for North-West connection is not as great as the demand for North-East connection.</p>

              <p>Route Length: 18km (D1) | 17.4km (D2)</p>

              <p>Express Duration: 22mins (D1) | 24mins (D2)</p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>- Fewer transfers required to get from Bukit Panjang and Choa
              Chu Kang to Jurong West.</p>
              <p>- Higher probability of getting a seat on the public
              transport.</p>
              <p>- Shorter travel distance for most intra-town connections (refer
              to the list above); potential lower fares for commuters.</p>
              <p>- Alternative route to bypass traffic on the MRT during peak
              hours.</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>- Longer travel time for all intra-town connections, except the
              one from Choa Chu Kang to Jalan Bahar.</p>
              <p>- Potentially long and winding during peak hours, as most of the
              route may experience heavy traffic.</p>

                              <p>The critical part is the expressway sector... the timing was derived from other bus services that have express sector.</p>
                              <p>I know you are referring to the Tower Transit comment on their Facebook page. Idk how they derived 50-60mins â€œbased on traffic conditionsâ€�, especially considering their buses have a device which restricts speed limit to 70km/h. But anyway, if the trip can be completed faster, then good la. The faster the better. Cuz honestly, if you are rushing for time, you will definitely opt for the fastest route, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.</p>
                              <p>I understand the concern by some forum-mers. I know how it feels. I used to take the MRT during morning peak hour 7-8am before. There were a few occasions when I was late, then I take taxi. Then got one time a taxi uncle told me... by the way, my school is in Clementi... the taxi uncle told me that at that hour, the fastest is to take MRT, cuz roads are congested... so yeah... canâ€™t talk now... sorry. But I hope Iâ€™ve replied adequately to your response.</p>

              <p>At best, the travelling time would be similar to taxi, at +/- 10mins, making the trip from end-to-end about 54-56mins. Even so, even if we reduce the express sector traveling time by 12-14mins, only the one from Boon Lay to ITE and Lot One to Westwood would be faster than other public transport options.</p>

              <p>Talking about congestion, this morning I was taking 137 from Bedok North Street 3 to Bedok North MRT. The bus (a Citaro) was already full at the bus stop at Blk 550 (Bedok North St 3). When the bus reached the next stop along Bedok North Ave 1, most passengers at the bus stop couldn't get on. The next 137 was more than 10 minutes away.</p>
              <p>It's time for SBS Transit to review the frequency of 137 during peak hour, or to add a short-working trip between Bedok MRT and Bedok North MRT.</p>

              <p>Time has come for 137 to get some DDs. Loading between UBI and Kaki Bukit also can be very high. A few DDs will do well. </p>
