              <p>Yup, the frequency is the main problem that make people want to avoid such express services. If such buses are more than 15 mins away, you can honestly already find alternative routes to your destination such as the MRT.</p>

              <p>Hi mr JKYY, very true. Utterly disappointing. From tampines to city hall area, it takes 1 hr 15 min including waiting time for service 12E. From 5.25pm to 6.40pm. Not worth. Think mrt will be much faster. This gonna shows express bus services is not worth taking. Even from stop to stop, it still goes slowly and waits at stops where there are no passengers boarding. The bus driver still needs to follow strictly to scheduling. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr JKYY, very true. Utterly disappointing. From tampines to
              city hall area, it takes 1 hr 15 min including waiting time for
              service 12E. From 5.25pm to 6.40pm. Not worth. Think mrt will be
              much faster. This gonna shows express bus services is not worth
              taking. Even from stop to stop, it still goes slowly and waits at
              stops where there are no passengers boarding. The bus driver still
              needs to follow strictly to scheduling. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Again, it is not the problem of the concept itself, but the flaws in its implementation. Just because of strict scheduling, doesn't mean express svcs are necessarily a failure. Strict scheduling is not a by-product of such svcs, it could've been v easily be done away with. I was never in approval of the DDU anyway. </p>

              <p>All, I took express bus service 12E from tampines east mrt at
              5.52pm. Very disappointed. Waited for the bus for 25 min before it
              came. See the bus app and find the timing too far apart. Will have
              been much faster if take a bus and transfer to Simei Mrt. Unless
              you boarded the bus within a few minutes for those express
              services, I believe you don’t save much time. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Yea that is exactly cause you missed the bus what.. in this case even I would have switched to the MRT..</p>
              <p>Idt you have ever understood the idea behind these sparse frequencies.. it is meant to attract long haul travellers who do their journey planning in advance, so they do not end up waiting at the bus stop for a long time.. the target commuters are never the last minute kind who just <em>happened</em> to want to take the svc.. those who don't know how to plan, end up missing their bus or, worst still, just walk to the bus stop without even knowing or bothering to find out when the bus comes with SG BusLeh, just go take the train..</p>
              <p>Those who can plan will reap great benefits. Journey time from Melville to Bugis is max 30 mins. By MRT it's a solid 45 min since you need to transfer to the MRT Stn..</p>
              <p>In practice the "long waiting time" shouldn't even count as part of journey time if you planned your journey in advance, since it could have otherwise been productive time spent. Whether is it that extra pile of laundry at home, that last paperwork, or some grocery shopping at a nearby store, are useful ways to spend that 25 mins you have ignorantly wasted..</p>
              <p>I've always believed in low-freq bus routes with accurate timings (which had always been the case for 12e) and a bit of technology. If one could plan 6 months in advance for a flight to KL that departs every hour, what's the problem with planning an hour or two before for a bus that departs every half an hour?</p>

              <p>Actually I feel that MRT is more reliable than express bus, as the waiting time is shorter.</p>
                                                  
                                                  <p>Nonetheless, if you travel between point A and point B often, you will tend to realise which is the better route to take to travel between the two locations.</p>
                                                  
                                                  <p>My suggestion is that you take all the possible routes between point A and point B during your regular commute, and over time decide which is the better route to take.</p>

              <p>Which is why I take 12e only when the bus is within 10 mins waiting time, or else I'm better off taking DTL from Tampines East.. The travel time from Tampines to the city on 12e is about the same as DTL actually (albeit about 10 mins longer) if you don't factor in waiting time and BC driving slowly to keep up with schedule as you mentioned. There was once a few weeks ago when the 12e BC waited up to like 5 mins at Tanah Merah MRT bus stop because I think he was ahead of schedule which 12e has a natural tendency since it has poor demand anyway, and not so much because its an express service.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday a typical 40 min journey from West Coast to Bukit Merah took me about an hour on 176 because BC was driving at average speed of just 30km/h throughout WC highway and would slow down to 20km/h about 50m before a green traffic light and immediately hit the brakes the moment it turns yellow. As frustrating it is, it shouldn't be conflated with bus being slower than MRT issues as SMB128B mentioned, such can be easily resolved.</p>
              <p>Out of curiousity, you waited 30 mins for 12e just for joyriding purposes or because you needed to head somewhere? If its the latter, my advice is please plan an alternative route next time because there are plenty of alternatives from Tampines East to the city including DTL, or there's 518.</p>

              <p>next one must have NEL-parallel bus routes too, and must undo the 2003 bus rationalisation.</p>
              <p>The next one could be 511 which is from Punggol via Sengkang West, Sengkang East, KPE to Marina Centre and Orchard.</p>
              <p>503 is a good candidate, but hopefully from Buona Vista to Tampines (which is another reincarnation of service 502).</p>
