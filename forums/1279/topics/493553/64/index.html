              While waiting for 974, got one Tower Transit staff pass me a flyer promoting 974.

              <p>Comment: It is a waste that 974 never go to the school cluster at Choa Chu Kang Drive. It would be good if 974 can be rerouted to serve the school cluster at Choa Chu Kang Drive, while retain the connection to Choa Chu Kang MRT / Lot One Shoppersâ€™ Mall and Bukit Panjang MRT.</p>
              
              <p>The question is, how?</p>
              <p>The obvious answer is to have 974 meander into Choa Chu Kang Drive when the bus is at Choa Chu Kang Way / Choa Chu Kang Road, via Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1 and Teck Whye Avenue. Like that write may be confusing, but if you look at the map, it would be clear.</p>
              
              <p>To the LTA, please consider rerouting 974 to the school cluster at Choa Chu Kang Drive. Not only would the school students benefit. The NSF at Stagmont Camp would also benefit, and this would make 974 really popular.</p>

              already three passengers onboard (one of them was actually from the
              previous trip, since I took the same bus for Bukit Panjang Bound
              and Joo Koon Bound, the other two probably board the bus at some
              stop after I alighted). This starts to make me think that this bus
              service could possibly be a loop service. This also makes me wonder
              whether the bus parks at the Bukit Panjang Temporary Bus
              Park.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>During the Joo Koon bound trip, the driver was
              telling a passenger that the bus starts from Joo Koon. Why didn’t
              the driver say the bus start at Bukit Panjang? I did not have the
              chance to clarify with the bus driver.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>When I am looking at the route map of 974 (as in
              the promotional poster), it also gives me the impression that this
              is a loop service, although this service is clearly promoted as a
              bi-directional service. Remember that when 258 was introduced it
              loops at Boon Lay Interchange, but it was introduced as a loop
              service.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>As for the parking lots in Joo Koon, there are
              two possibilities: there is either no lots reserved for TTS (since
              there is apparently no TTS office in JKBI, the bus will probably
              stop at any parking lots available) or the first lot (the one
              closest to the exit) is ‘reserved’ for TTS. Lot 2 was parked with
              an SBS bus when the TTS bus stops at lot 1. Lot 1 was also observed
              to park E500 from the Joo Koon-Gul Circle MRT Replacement Service a
              few months back, so this lot could potentially be reserved for
              ‘special uses’, in this case will be the presence of TTS buses in
              Joo Koon Interchange.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>

              <p>For now i think maybe not. 974 still serve joo koon and bp that JRL does not serve, which otherwise will mean pax still have to make 2-3 transfers by taking the MRT. There will still be ppl who prefers take a direct bus albeit onger travelling time. But do expect loading drop (SD sufficient)</p>

              <p>Previously, I did a loading observation of 974 in the direction towards Bukit Panjang, which I have posted on page 64 of the bus loading thread.</p>
                                              <p>Most of the passengers board the bus at Joo Koon Interchange and Upper Jurong Road, and they sit all the way to Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang. About 40% of the passengers alighted at the bus stop opposite Choa Chu Kang MRT, presumably to transfer to other bus services. Whereas the rest alighted along the way at Jurong West, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>974 connects Joo Koon Bus Interchange and Upper Jurong Road to Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang, which Jurong Region Line does not provide.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Furthermore, 974 does not actually duplicate Jurong Region Line in any way, besides also providing that Choa Chu Kang to Boon Lay connection.</p>
                                                      <p>With the two reasons stated above, I do not think 974 would be affected when Jurong Region Line opens.</p>
