              <p>To be fair, Buangkok is not the only 'white elephant' MRT with limited connections to flats in nearby town(s). Bukit Gombak and Marsiling both suffer from the same fate, and personally I think Caldecott and Chinese Garden are the worst.</p>
              <p>Although there's definitely A LOT to do for stations like Buangkok to catch up with good examples such as Tanah Merah and Lakeside. I thought LTA's mindset had changed when they introduced routes like 258 to Pioneer and 129 to Braddell, but now it's clear they haven't. </p>
              <p>If they don't do something about it before DTL3 opens (which they probably won't as seen from their refusal to extend 228 to Kaki Bukit), there is going to be chaos.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, buangkok crescent is in the midst of hougang town. It is considered slightly nearer to buangkok mrt than hougang mrt. Take note that for buangkok crescent, the planning is more towards hougang territory. </p>
              <p>When they launch new services, they not only need to link it to mrt, they also need to link it to amenities along hougang estates to fetch residents. Note it bypasses hougang 1 mall and ci yuan hawker centre and some schools as well. Thus linking to hougang mrt will be a more rational thinking. It also gives buangkok crescent residents a different link to hougang. 101 goes by hougang ave 8 and 329 goes by hougang ave 9. 2 different routes. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>To be fair, Buangkok is not the only 'white elephant' MRT with
                  limited connections to flats in nearby town(s). Bukit Gombak and
                  Marsiling both suffer from the same fate, and personally I think
                  Caldecott and Chinese Garden are the worst.</p>
              <p>Although there's definitely A LOT to do for stations like
                  Buangkok to catch up with good examples such as Tanah Merah and
                  Lakeside. I thought LTA's mindset had changed when they introduced
                  routes like 258 to Pioneer and 129 to Braddell, but now it's clear
                  they haven't. </p>
              <p>If they don't do something about it before DTL3 opens (which
                  they probably won't as seen from their refusal to extend 228 to
                  Kaki Bukit), there is going to be chaos.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, buangkok mrt is definitely not 'white elephant' mrt. It is already earmarked for huge residential and commercial area coming up in the early 2020s. The planning always comes area by area, territory by territory. There will be a new bus interchange coming up as well. Currently they enhance buangkok crescent and buangkok link first. 101 serves additional stops plus introduce 329. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Problem with Marsiling is that many residents in the region (except those along MRT tracks) do not have a direct service to Marsiling MRT, even though it's the nearest station to them. There have been various suggestions of 911, 912 and 913's route variants to link residents to Marsiling MRT.</p>

              <p>Hi mr iveco, you got it wrong. Service 329 is created for new btos at buangkok crescent. There are some new BTO flats being built. The new service is more for them than those living in hougang ave 9/4. Route seems redundant but it is to connect those residents who currently have 101 which is loaded with people. By the way, 101 will ply one more pair of bus stops to serve them. Take note Buangkok crescent is already under the ruling party now. So no need for votes buying. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, buangkok crescent is in the midst of hougang
              town. It is considered slightly nearer to buangkok mrt than hougang
              mrt. Take note that for buangkok crescent, the planning is more
              towards hougang territory. </p>
              <p>When they launch new services, they not only need to link it to
              mrt, they also need to link it to amenities along hougang estates
              to fetch residents. Note it bypasses hougang 1 mall and ci yuan
              hawker centre and some schools as well. Thus linking to hougang mrt
              will be a more rational thinking. It also gives buangkok crescent
              residents a different link to hougang. 101 goes by hougang ave 8
              and 329 goes by hougang ave 9. 2 different routes. Cheers.
              Thanks.</p>

              <p>SLIGHTLY nearer? Just check map, the difference is bigger than you think. When Buangkok Drive extension is complete, travelling time to Buangkok will be reduced to 10 minutes. In fact some of the flats are nearer to Sengkang MRT than Hougang!</p>

              <p>That's out of the point bro. The route is actually good IMO, as it links to many key facilities in Hougang. Hougang 1 shopping mall, Ci Yuan CC/food centre, Hougang Stadium/Swimming Complex, Hougang Polyclinic, Blk 681 market, and a few primary and secondary schools.</p>
              <p>What many people here, including me, are not happy about about is the lack of direct connection to the nearest MRT, Buangkok.</p>
