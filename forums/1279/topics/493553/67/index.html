              <p>Took 851e from Pearl's Centre at around 3.30 pm, and must say that I'm impressed with the loading, was better than I had expected.</p>
              <p>Easily over 70 pax boarded at Chinatown and Bugis with the upper deck being nearly fully seated and about 30+ pax alighted at Blk 207 bus stop along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. Only about 20 pax had remained by the time I alighted at Yishun so I would say 851e is way more popular with Ang Mo Kio residents which is quicker than 130/133/166/851 to and fro from the city. When I took a return trip back to Chinatown the laoding was a bit more modest, with about 30 pax on board throughout Yishun and Ang Mo Kio and majority alighted at Little India MRT. Bus was mostly empty along South Bridge Rd because most of the people who flagged 851e wanted to go to Tiong Bahru.</p>
              <p>Took about 40 mins to get from Chinatown to Ang Mo Kio which is comparable to the travelling time by MRT. This service has potential and LTA should consider extending 851e to Bukit Merah Int via Tiong Bahru as it can benefit those travelling to SGH a  and the DDs can complement regular 851.</p>

              <p>Again, it is not the problem of the concept itself, but the

              scheduling is not a by-product of such svcs, it could've been v

              <p>The strict scheduling is important, it actually makes these express services work. Fixed timings at each bus stop (or at the very least, major stops) has to be published.</p>

              <p>But strict scheduling fails if the timings aren't even reasonable to begin with! So it traces back to the problem of implementation once again. </p>

              <p>Which is why I take 12e only when the bus is within 10 mins
              waiting time, or else I'm better off taking DTL from Tampines
              East.. The travel time from Tampines to the city on 12e is about
              the same as DTL actually (albeit about 10 mins longer) if you don't
              factor in waiting time and BC driving slowly to keep up with
              schedule as you mentioned. There was once a few weeks ago when the
              12e BC waited up to like 5 mins at Tanah Merah MRT bus stop because
              I think he was ahead of schedule which 12e has a natural tendency
              since it has poor demand anyway, and not so much because its an
              express service.</p>
              <p>Just yesterday a typical 40 min journey from West Coast to Bukit
              Merah took me about an hour on 176 because BC was driving at
              average speed of just 30km/h throughout WC highway and would slow
              down to 20km/h about 50m before a green traffic light and
              immediately hit the brakes the moment it turns yellow. As
              frustrating it is, it shouldn't be conflated with bus being slower
              than MRT issues as SMB128B mentioned, such can be easily
              resolved.</p>
              <p>Out of curiousity, you waited 30 mins for 12e just for joyriding
              purposes or because you needed to head somewhere? If its the
              latter, my advice is please plan an alternative route next time
              because there are plenty of alternatives from Tampines East to the
              city including DTL, or there's 518.</p>

              <p>Hi mr marvel68, I wait 25 min for 12E from 5.25 to 5.50pm. Not 30 min. I was transferring from service 9 to catch 12E to go to high street centre near Clarke quay. Gosh it was slow. Yes I know there are many alternatives. By the time I wished to consider other methods, I keep checking the app and see the bus still has 15 min to go. Then keep seeing. 10 min, 8 min, etc. The initial waiting time of 22 min lengthened to 25 min because the bus timing app keeps changing. Possibly due to further slowing down of the bus service before it reaches tampines east mrt. In future, just take mrt. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Guess AMK Ave 6 has more residents than Bedok South (where 12e plies before hitting ECP), hence explaining why 851e is way more popular?</p>

              <p>I waited for the 7.00pm 851e at the busstop outside People's Park Centre on Moday. I was there from 6.59pm. However the bus did not appear. The board says 7.00pm start at Pearl's Centre and if it had followed schedule, it could not have disappeared so fast. </p>
              <p>I waited till 7.13pm, when I finally gave up and took the regular 851 instead since the next 851e timing is 7.30pm. Amazingly the 851, served be SG5045B, did the jouney from People's Park Centre to YCK MRT in under 45mins and I was there before 7.55pm. I must admit the driver was really chionging though. If I had waited for the next 851e, Im sure I would have been later than 7.55pm anyway. </p>
              <p>So the timings of the bus really matter. As much as this 851e is faster, it is only faster if it comes at the timing you are there. If not, people might be better off finding alternatives, like my case.</p>

              <p>I would really like 851e to start at Bukit Merah. Cos I work there and I woud gladly take it from BM to AMK where I stay. Infact I was excited when I heard of 851e but was disappointed that it stoped at New Bridge Rd.</p>

              <p>this morning, sv851e (SG5922) took around 35 mins to travel from amk ave 6 (blk 304) to little india station. around 15 paxes on board.</p>
              <p>i purposely wait for this 851e when SG5066 came 5 mins before.but the journey is too slow. 851e might as well travel express along marymount road/thomson road instead.</p>
