              <p>This what heard from them . However if u see the similarities between 25 &amp; 854 is very close . Both served Bedok &amp; Eunos area until yio chu kang road . By putting 25 at East coast terminal , resident there can have a direct bus to Eunos / Hougang area . U don't need 2 same buses (854/25) to run the same line for almost half of their route . If passengers in 25 want to go to Yio chu kang area they can change bus to 854 . </p>

              <p>Third one definitely unlikely due to the necessity of serving Bedok MRT, at least. The Bedok -- UEC link is probably what's needed. Though the area along Eunos Link would be duplicative of 45.</p>
              <p>Too bad CBP Terminal didn't get the extension.</p>
              <p>(In all honesty, might as well extend 26 to UEC and 25 to CBP. Would avoid duplication problems too.)</p>

              <p>This what heard from them . However if u see the similarities

              area until yio chu kang road . By putting 25 at East coast terminal
              , resident there can have a direct bus to Eunos / Hougang area . U
              don't need 2 same buses (854/25) to run the same line for almost
              half of their route . If passengers in 25 want to go to Yio chu

              <p>why everything UEC when there is low demand there? Get more services to CBP that has super high demand. </p>
              <p>854 can be cut short to Eunos already since 25 is parallel to Bedok. No need extend 25 to UEC to reduce duplication.</p>

              <p>I believe it would be MUCH better if 25 is extended to CBP instead.</p>
              <p>And I wonder, of all the Bedok services, why 25? It is a service with extremely high loading and good frequency, and I'm not sure if demand between Bedok and UEC would be too low for it (depends on the route). If they want to provide a direct connection between Bedok and UEC, would be better to extend a service with not-so-high demand, like 26, 32 or 40. </p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, yes I saw it. It is the same as when they introduce new service 117, 118 in end 2015. The plaque/sign is erected but they cover up the number. They will only show the number most likely just 1 day ahead of implementation. However, the 381 osters are all out at all the bus stops along its route. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
