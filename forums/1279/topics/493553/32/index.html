                          <p>Parkway Parade got bus service to Sengkang. And it's free. <a href="http://www.parkwayparade.com.sg/concierge/getting-here/">Route B. Sengkang MRT &lt;-&gt; Parkway Parade.</a> Every Saturday, Sunday and Public Holiday. 11am to 8pm (Sengkang). 12pm to 10pm (Parkway Parade). 1 hour interval. FYI, this is not the place to advertise business. Nonetheless, the point is that there is a bus service.</p>

                  <p>There were 3 buses for 374 parked at the bus bay. I assume that 4 parking lots are required for operations as 1 additional parking lot is required for that 374 bus that may return to the bus interchange before any 1 of the 3 buses leaves the parking bay. Thus, I arrived at the conclusion that 374 needs 4 parking lots.</p>
                              
                              <p>1 feeder service - 4 parking lots.</p>
                              
                              <p>Similarly, I was at Tampines Concourse recently. Saw 5 buses using the parking bay, although there are only 3 bus services. Coincidentally, all of them are trunk. A simple division of 5 over 3 indicates that each service has about 1.6 buses using the parking bay, which means that at any one time, there's about 2 buses per trunk service using the parking bay, and about 1 bus per trunk service that is coming in. This means that each trunk service needs 3 parking lots at the bus interchange, and this is evident at the Changi Business Park Bus Terminal where each bus service, all trunk, is allocated 3 end-on berths.</p>
                              
                              <p>1 trunk service - 3 parking lots.</p>
                              
                              <p>Anyway, that's how I arrived at the conclusion that 374 needs 4 parking lots.</p>
                              
                              <p>As for the "split buses", whatever that is, I remember there were around 2 Volvo B9TL buses at Compassvale Bus Interchange besides 3 Mercedes Citaro buses. That's how I was able to identify that there were 3 buses for 374 parked at Compassvale Bus Interchange at that point in time.</p>
                              
                              <p>Nevertheless, I must say that the observation was made around 2 months ago. Whatever recount that I write may be wrong. Sorry about that.</p>

              <p>I think this is rather unnecessary and duplicative of existing resources as there is alr svc 43 to MP. If you so wish for an express version an E variant of 43 during peak hours will be more than enough. </p>
              <p>Reason I say so is coz 164 could have been reserved for much further potential e.g. express to the west.</p>

              <p>Then question the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full</span> concept of the development of Townlink/Intra-Town services in the first place back in 1996/1997, which is to, I quote, "enhance connectivity between different neighbourhoods in larger residential towns by providing direct connections without having to transfer between feeder buses at the bus interchange". Is this so-called "aim" still important in today's era?</p>
              <p>Many of the existing Townlink/Intra-Town services are the combination of two feeders.</p>

              <p>Wanted to add this in earlier regarding 265 but I refrained from doing so given that it's not exactly relevant to the gist of the post.</p>
              <p>265's route extension to Ang Mo Kio Depot back in March 2002 had absolutely nothing to do with the withdrawal of 266. In fact, a large portion of the former route for 266 (Ang Mo Kio Aves 3, Ave 4, Ave 5) was taken over by 269 in March 2002, while 138 took over the deleted sectors of 269 along Ave 6. In November of the same year, 269 was further extended to take over more of 266's deleted sectors along Yio Chu Kang Rd and Ang Mo Kio Ave 5.</p>
              <p>263, when first introduced back in the eighties, was cited by SBS as a "ring service", which was why I said it's similar to the role 381 and many Townlinks/Intra-Towns play now.</p>

              <p>263 used to have a different fare structure from basic feeders.

              <p>Guys, just because I went to Lee Kong Chian Reference Library
              previously to read the old transitlink bus guides and share with
              you two historical bus routes doesn't mean that I will keep going
              there to refer to the old bus guides.</p>
              <p>In fact, just from one trip, I already understood the rationale
              for withdrawing or shortening bus routes.</p>
              <p>Most of the former bus routes were actually absorbed into the
              bus routes that we have today, otherwise have very little
              significance even in today's context. There's actually no need to
              know about the historical bus routes.</p>
              <p>I have seen the former bus routes that went from Hougang to
              Jurong West, Jurong West to Yishun, etcetera. They were really not
              economical, and I can understand why they were taken away or
              withdrawn, as all of them had very little demand and were actually
              duplicating the MRT.</p>
              <p>A trip from one town to another is actually much faster on the
              MRT than on the bus. The only area that requires long-distance
              connection by bus is in the North-Eastern part of Singapore,
              between Yishun, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi as currently, there
              is no MRT line that provides the direct connection between these
              areas.</p>
              <p>This is why we have bus services like 117, 118 and 129, as the
              North-East Region has limited train connections, and most of the
              connections within the North-East Region are actually provided
              better by buses.</p>
              <p>Likewise for the Thomson East Coast Line corridor. Once the
              Thomson East Coast Line and Cross Island Line are up, we can expect
              many bus routes to be withdrawn.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, with dynamic routing coming along, where bus routes
              are flexible and change according to demand, there's actually no
              need for so many bus routes, or so many buses.</p>

              <p>Just because there's no need to know doesn't mean we don't have the right to know or discuss.</p>
              <p>And there's actually no need to write such a long post every time the topic changes to something you don't have interest in.</p>
