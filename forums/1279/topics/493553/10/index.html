                                                      <p>That's an April Fool's Day joke. Posted on the first day of
                                                      April. There's even a disclaimer at the bottom of the picture to
                                                      say that it's a joke.</p>
                                                      <p>As for your request, I really don't know what kind of demand is
                                                      expected in 2112. Maybe by then nobody will be taking the buses, or
                                                      even travel on public transport. With so much technology
                                                      advancements from now to 2112, there may not even be a need for
                                                      car, bike, bus, boat, plane or train, as everything can be
                                                      transported via teleport.</p>
                                                      <p>I mean, just look at the way people travelled in 1922, which is
                                                      95 years ago. 95 years ago, the bus drivers were wearing shorts,
                                                      and back then, nobody was using the computer, or carrying mobile
                                                      phone.</p>
                                                      <p>If things were so different 95 years ago, it's going to be very
                                                      different 95 years from now, in 2112, that it's really hard to
                                                      guess what kind of demand is expected in 2112.</p>
                                                                    </div>

                                                      <p>95 years ago, my Grand Father said that by 2112, there would be "no need for car, bike, bus, boat, plane and train", and "everything can be transported via teleport."</p>
                                                      <p>LOL. We still travel by car, bike, bus, boat, plane and train, except now everything runs automated, operates 24/7, and is free for all to use.</p>
                                                      <p>By the way, what is driver? I cannot find the word "driver" in my dictionary.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>Anyway, it's nice travelling back in time to 2017, and see what wonderful vision everyone has of 2112.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, you mean if 129 goes by Bartley underpass, it has no possible chance to serve the 3 extra bus stops since it did not bypass them on its journey? This means it did not skip the 3 stops la since 129 purpose is to use underpass all along. Meaning what I say is correct la. Wao Lao eh.</p>
              <p>Meaning Bartley underpass- 129 will definitely skip the 3 stops?</p>
              <p>Meaning Bartley rd (such as 28 and 93) -will go through the 3 stops? </p>

A bus service will serve all the bus stops of a road it bypasses. With effect from 28 may, service 129 will fulfil this because it is amended to ply the extra bus stop opp gambir ridge which is the only bus stop along its current route which it did not serve. This also means I did not anyhow say as claimed earlier on. If I am wrong, feel free to correct me. Cheers. Thanks.</p></div>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, they did it in two stages last time. Some
              services go first and some later. They want to smoothen the traffic
              flow to avoid the jams which we have been seeing lately. Cheers.

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I did not shift goalpost. My claim 'if a bus service bypasses the bus stops along its route, it will serve all the bus stops' from start has always been the same. I have already repeated so many times that I feel I am so 'luo suo'.</p>
              <p>Once you reply if go by underpass means 3 stops omitted, this means I am correct lor. So service 129 goes by Bartley underpass. This automatically skips the 3 stops. Which means it totally has no choice because it did not have a chance to bypass these 3 stops as a result of LTA making it go by Bartley underpass. </p>
              <p>So this brings about to the point that my claim is correct. When a service bypasses the bus stops along its route, it will serve the bus stops. Service 129 will do so with effect from 28 may 2017 onwards after being amended to ply the stop at Bartley rd opposite gambir ridge.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes nowadays I have already changed and toned down and I don't shoot down other people proposals anymore. I just leave it as it is. All I do is to reemphasize a point that I was correct when mr busanalyser said I was wrong months ago.</p>
              <p>The amendment of Sbs 129 to serve the 1 and only extra stop it left out initially but amended from 28 may 2017 goes to show that my point was correct. However unfortunately mr SMB128B goes and brings out the 3 stops which is not part of 129 route since 129 goes by Bartley underpass. This causes a mini uproar. That was really unfortunate as this did not really affect the point that a bus service will ply all the stops of its route. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, this is partially caused by the bus stop situated along TPE in direction towards Sengkang/Punggol. Even without any accident, the jam can take 45min to 1 hr 30 min just because of heavy traffic towards Punggol being flashed on the screen. A simple and direct 10-15 min journey can stretch realistically to super long waiting times at peak hours. This negates the time saving 89E which makes use of TPE and skips the whole of pasir ris. Direct from changi/loyang to TPE stop cutting 25 min of traveling time. But it is sickening now. Paying express fares for 89E but getting services compatible to 89 normal. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi dupdup77, you take svc 89E often?</p>
              <p>I would say that the root cause is really too many cars trying to go back to Punggol during peak hours, the buses don't really cause much delay because there's the two-lane bus bays. Nowadays, LTA got change the traffic light signal timing so that cars going to Punggol can turn right and keep on going, instead of stopping again at the bridge (which is the usual signal cycle on weekday mornings or weekends), but when they don't change the signal cycle to optimize for the flow of cars exiting TPE, then you get the massive jams ...</p>

              <p>You may be right about root cause but the location of the bus stop along TPE is a contributing factor to that. The bus lanes along TPE bus stop towards Sengkang/Punggol direction are less busier than the car. Lane 1 is strictly for bus. Lane 2 is for buses/cars. Lane 3/4 are for cars. Before TPE stop is built, Lane 1 to lane 4 are for cars. You do your maths and you roughly know. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Depends on the perspective bah:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>For cars turning into Sengkang and the bus routes that were using the exit anyway, now they can utilize the new lanes and thus shorten their travel times somewhat (as compared to previously when traffic on lanes 3/4 barely moved (lane 1 is the rightmost lane as per convention)</li>
              <li>For cars turning into Punggol, also slightly better because the cars going into Sengkang are removed from the exit sooner, which allows more cars to turn right per signal cycle</li>
              <li>For the bus routes that previously skipped the exit, now they have to join the queue of cars exiting TPE, thus travel times are lengthened ...</li>
