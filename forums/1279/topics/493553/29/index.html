              <p>Looking at the videos taken of new bus service 944, I now realise the reason why LTA decide to let SMRT operate the route instead of Tower Transit. The reason is because 944 does not have any target audience, besides that pair of bus stop outside Bukit Batok Polyclinic at Bukit Batok West Avenue 3. Because the profit margin is low, in fact negligible, it's better to reduce the loss as much as possible. That's why they award it to SMRT instead of Tower Transit.</p>
              
              <p>There was probably a tender which we are not aware of, that was called by LTA to determine the operator that can offer the lowest price possible to operate the service. Unfortunately, Tower Transit did not offer the lowest price. Instead, it was SMRT that offers the lowest price. That's why the bus service was awarded to SMRT.</p>
              
              <p>The story is the same as city direct bus services, which were awarded to SBS Transit and SMRT instead of the private operators that were operating the bus services originally. As to whether the story will be replicated at other bus routes, I think it depends on the profitability. If the route is profitable, or sustainable with the current contract, it would probably be awarded to the operator that is operating the contact.</p>
              
              <p>In this case, 944 is really not profitable, in fact incurring losses that is really too great to incur - if operated by Tower Transit under the current contract. As a matter of fact, this bus service is not even required until end of this year or next year when the new HDB flats are completed. Hence, awarding it to SMRT is the better option.</p>
              
              <p>I believe there was a tender called for bus service 944 which we are not aware of, that's why we are under the illusion that LTA may have changed its approach by awarding bus routes to the lowest tender. Nonetheless, LTA could have explained the situation, but it probably finds no need for that, that's why it did not explain the situation in the press release, but just say that there will be a new bus service launched today that is called 944, serving the new residential developments at Bukit Batok.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Whereas for other bus services, I believe the Bishan one is the one that will connect to Ang Mo Kio, because it was mentioned previously that Ang Mo Kio will have new bus service. As for which areas it will serve, I will leave it to the people who are familiar with that area as I don't patronise that area. But most probably it's to improve connectivity within Bishan to connect to the industrial area at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. Otherwise, it's for the landed properties at Bishan and Ang Mo Kio, or a break-up of one of the existing bus services. Nonetheless, I will leave it to the people familiar with that area to comment about the upcoming bus service at Bishan.</p></div>

              <p>That pair of bus stop outside Millennia Institute and Princess Elizabeth is only utilised during school hours by students of those schools, and seldom by the residents living there as they have to walk through a passage to get to that bus stop, when might as well they take a shorter route to the next bus stop that is just next to their doorstep; during regular hours, it's rarely utilised.</p>
                      
                      <p>The areas along Bukit Batok West Avenue 3 already have 157, 174, 188 and 173 providing connection to Bukit Batok Bus Interchange. Furthermore, 941 is already providing a good connection to the bus interchange for residents living in the inner parts of Bukit Batok West Avenue 3 area; Bukit Batok West Avenue 8, Bukit Batok Street 11. No need for another bus service to connect residents of that area to Bukit Batok Bus Interchange.</p>
                      
                      <p>Making the route ply that path is the right choice, as it optimises the coverage of that new area when it is fully developed. The only issue is that the bus service was launched too early, as none of the developments along the route at the new area is ready for occupancy. The only development that is ready for occupancy is along Bukit Batok Road, and that development has 160 and 180 connecting it to the MRT stations at Boon Lay Way.</p>
                      
                      <p>Nonetheless, I agree that the routing could have been better, to connect to the other developments in that area. But that's probably for another new route in future when that area is more developed. I don't know about the area, but I believe the authorities have timed the implementation properly, by rolling out the bus services progressively as the developments become ready for occupancy.</p>
                      
                      <p>The future routes that ply that area may incorporate the area around Millennia Institute and Princess Elizabeth, but that is only required when the new HDB at the petrol station and opposite the foreign school is ready for occupation. Probably next year, or the year after.</p>

              <p>That pair of bus stop outside Millennia Institute and Princess
              Elizabeth is only utilised during school hours by students of those
              schools, and seldom by the residents living there as they have to
              walk through a passage to get to that bus stop, when might as well
              they take a shorter route to the next bus stop that is just next to
              their doorstep; during regular hours, it's rarely utilised.</p>
              <p>The areas along Bukit Batok West Avenue 3 already have 157, 174,
              188 and 173 providing connection to Bukit Batok Bus Interchange.
              Furthermore, 941 is already providing a good connection to the bus
              interchange for residents living in the inner parts of Bukit Batok
              West Avenue 3 area; Bukit Batok West Avenue 8, Bukit Batok Street
              11. No need for another bus service to connect residents of that
              area to Bukit Batok Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Making the route ply that path is the right choice, as it
              optimises the coverage of that new area when it is fully developed.
              The only issue is that the bus service was launched too early, as
              none of the developments along the route at the new area is ready
              for occupancy. The only development that is ready for occupancy is
              along Bukit Batok Road, and that development has 160 and 180
              connecting it to the MRT stations at Boon Lay Way.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I agree that the routing could have been better, to
              connect to the other developments in that area. But that's probably
              for another new route in future when that area is more developed. I
              don't know about the area, but I believe the authorities have timed
              the implementation properly, by rolling out the bus services
              progressively as the developments become ready for occupancy.</p>
              <p>The future routes that ply that area may incorporate the area
              around Millennia Institute and Princess Elizabeth, but that is only
              required when the new HDB at the petrol station and opposite the
              foreign school is ready for occupation. Probably next year, or the
              year after.</p>

              <p>I really don't know what's the point for this service?</p>
              <p>Don't forget that TEL itself is meant to supplement NSL... So
              why would people from places as far as Bishan go to Mayflower for
              TEL when there's already a robust bus network to NSL?</p>

              <p>It is a one way loading service. During AM, you will see a good number of pax taking 71 to Bishan for CCL/NSL from AMK Ave 1 and for CCL only from AMK Ave 1 &amp; 4. Further it will connect ave 1 to TEL in future. </p>
              <p>The stops at Bishan st 13 is a good move as people living there need to walk a long distance to the nearest bus stop. </p>
              <p>Return journey towards YCK loading will be poor during AM and it will depend on who calls first 76 or 71. 268 loading will further detoriate as it doesn't go to MRT directly. </p>
