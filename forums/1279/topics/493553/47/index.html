              <p>Fucking LTA has the ability to make noisy and irritating announcements on the new 110... yet no ability to introduce a proper stop announcer system? To at least reduce the fuck up they have caused to commuters used to taking the A22?</p>
              <p>Wtf is this? Our taxpayer money is invested in useless "take all your shit with you" announcements, instead of something that is, idk, more PRACTICAL? Again, humji on the failed 284 trial? Why shed away and not improve it?</p>

                          <p>Think about it. Would you rather get a cheap product that requires frequent maintenance, or a expensive product that requires little maintenance? Obviously the expensive product, because the overall cost is lower, if you factor in all the costs incurred over the lifespan of the bus.</p>

              <p>^^ but I wonâ€™t say the same for handphone. Handphone is the specifications that matters, not the price. Because a lot of handphone company markup the price. So not necessarily more expensive handphone means the phone is better. In fact, a lot of â€œcheapâ€� phones have quite good quality. #justsaying</p>
                  <p>Price reflects the quality in most cases, but handphone is an exception. For example, XiaoMi and Oppo have better specifications than Apple, although the price is lower.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, I think 110 is confirmed under sembawang yishun contract, not hougang-Sengkang contract which you say. This is the 25th bus service under the negotiated sembawang-yishun contract given to smrt buses and up for renewal in yr 2020. There are 25 bus services and before 110 is introduced, it only has 24 bus services. This is not like the smrt 944 incident. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, press release shows sembawang-yishun to be correct as up until the day the article was released 1 yr ago. It is unable to predict every new service after the day the release is official. So we can only deduce every new bus service to be separatedly negotiated with the various bus service provider. Agree? </p>
              <p>Since there is no official news release about which contract 110 is under, it remains subjected to various discussions. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
