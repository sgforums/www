Wow , I feel extremely flattered. I didnt know I have the power of summoning CAC UDs on 980. Yeah right !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Wow , you make sure ? Really ?  Who do you think you are ? LTA  ? If you can make sure Scanias extend by 2 years, you might as well make sure the UDs on 980 are removed from the service ?<br><br>Other then 178 and 980 , I cannot see where SMRT can fit those Nissan buses on ! I suggest you to communicate with SMRT directly in regards to Nissan Buses. End of topic.<br><br>P.S Btw It doesn't matter if 980 operates UDS or not. I dont take the service but I will carry on taunting UDs on 980 until you guys shut up about it and move on. There is nothing SMRT can do about it until they purchase new buses. Do you think I like to see those buses on the roads ? Answer is no.<br><br>That is all I am going to say.<br><br>At least if you skip one UD bus , the next one will be either mer/dennis or scania . Do you know how many Scanias are there in svc 33 fleet ? Period.<br></div>

That is just too bad for you.Obviously you have very little sense of humour.
