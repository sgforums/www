Then SMRT will cut the door opening bigger, then install 5th hand manual doors. At the driver's place, got a rope. Must pull the rope to pull open the door.

And do you think they make money selling away the DAF? How much are you willing to pay for a battered old bus? Even if scrap also will not get much money. Please don't post following what your heart desire. We know you're dissatisfied with SMRT Buses and you have proven it in your posts many times. So what else do you want?</div>

The general public doesn't even care if its a Nissan or a Merc. As long as the bus come, its OK. We pay money to get ourself from Point A to Point B. You have the option of not taking the Nissans. If don't have, then too bad. You can't win them all. So, instead of trying to change the world to suit your tastes, it is far easier to do the other way round.</div>

You want to see horse go to Kranji lah. And who say they are advanced? Hino RK176 more advanced than Volvo B57? Nissan U31F more advanced than MB O305? I don't think so.</div>

That's the spirit! Old bus, new bus, noisy bus, quiet bus, as an enthusiast, we should appreciate, not condemn. You may have a preference or a distaste to a particular bus, that is your opinion. You are free to your own opinion. But do not express in such a way that will tarnish the image of the bus, not to mention the image of our operators, and eventually the image of the Singapore Bus Enthusiast. Bear in mind that while you hate a bus model, there are others who like them. Everybody has their own opinion and they may not be the same as yours.</div>
