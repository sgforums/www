              <p>Yeah, 160 and 506 under JE route group.</p>
              <p>506 1st and last bus timings is reasonable for it to be under
                  slbp, but no idea why it isn't. And 198 under slbp shouldn't be a
                  problem as most of its starting and ending trips is at BNL int. But
                  198 practices jumpbus also, unless this system is changed to
                  BNL.</p>
              <p>I think slbp isn't that big enough to take in so many

              <p>14 is there for historical reasons. I believe 175 is there is because at that time of BC recruitment there are more based in arbp than bbdep. The introduction of 5 175 has led to 96 moving from arbp to bbdep.</p>

              <p>506 1st and last bus timings is reasonable for it to be under slbp, but no idea why it isn't. And 198 under slbp shouldn't be a problem as most of its starting and ending trips is at BNL int. But 198 practices jumpbus also, unless this system is changed to BNL.</p>

              <p>160 under bbdep is to consolidate all the JB Mk3s in 1 depot together, since 170 is also under bbdep and 160 from bbdep to Jurong East isnt that far..</p>
              <p>198 under bbdep is due to off service mileage. This reason dates way back to a million years ago. Has no effect on current day's deployment reasoning.</p>
              <p>slbp still has space.. but not logical for them to do so.. imagine 198 full slbp.. possible since 174 is also under full slbp but since its not broken, why fix it?</p>

              <p>does 198 s shift with 147? this sentence does not make sense. what u meant is does 198 crossover to 147? no. however 198 buses can be seen on 147 which indicates a cameo. this oculd have happened cos a 147 bus was not available and an available bus was taken from the depot. it could be a svc 198 bus.</p>
              <p>let me break it down for you.</p>
              <p>s shift is called split shift. s shift operates during peak hours, during am off peak, buses go back to the depot for swing till the afternoon peak.</p>
              <p>198 under bbdep would decrease off svc mileage, technically bbdep is more centralised from bukit merah and boon lay.</p>
              <p>crossover is a bus that is perm on a service that will go over to another service and a predetermined time period as stated on a timesheet as a scheduled event that happens on a regular basis.</p>

              <p><br>159 was full AMDEP control too when it was a loop service (Toa Payoh to Sengkang (loop)). But after reverted back to 2-directional service, it became HGDEP.</p>
              <p>163 was under AMDEP control before extending route to Sengkang.</p>
              <p>Because of that, 86 had to become full AMDEP.</p>
