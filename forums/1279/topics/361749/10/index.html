              <p>Yup but Singapore is a country where the free market dictates the policy that companies should take and the bus operators have to cherry up with their investors(shareholders)... I think the bus operators should make the basic for travellers and then the industry can be expanded. That also means that they should standardise the maintainence of equipment and the quality should be uniform thru-out the company.</p>

              <p>In management, where it is all about the profit dollar that keeps your business afloat, you need to prioritise what goes where. In this sense, since a subsidiary(in this case BNDEP) cannot maintain decent levels of standards and is not keeping up with maintainence standards of other subsidiaries(depots), giving them good things is a waste. I am not saying SBST should close down BNDEP, though I would be glad if that happens, but rather SBST should implement either harsh protocols on service maintainence, or do the economical viable thing to bring good stuff to where it can be maintained properly.</p>

              <p>because of you, my wish is that when the circle line opens from dhoby ghaut - marymount. is that 70 is shortened to serangoon int from yck ter and attain full hgdep control where it has a full MKIII fleet from its big number of spares (it will take MKIV DM when MKIII retire and den Strider etc.) and probably the full fleet size would be 6 buses.</p>
              <p>then, the whole amdep fleet would be released to accomodate more parking space in amdep. and then 86 follow suit?</p>
              <p>honestly speaking, every area should have some freedom to be able to receive new buses, its whether sbst feels that these new buses are needed in that particular depot to be despatched on a particular route. esp also when its depot has a large number of its fleet thats about to go into retirement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever your opinion is, it is very self-centered rather than it is gonna help SBST if things were done the way you want it to.</p>
