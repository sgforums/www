              <p>161 was introduce in 2003. 2757M was the last SD removed in late
                      2006, replaced by 9434Z when 21 ot its first B9TL buses. Not all
                      the B10TLs were replaced by LOs. LOs did replace the SDs.</p>
              <p>hgdep 161 started off as full SD service as well, all the way
                      until late 2006 when hgdep received its first batch of B9TLs. 9325E
                      was 1st, then more was added to replace the SD fleet.</p>

              <p>The first LOs went to 161 after 9842D and 9843B went to BNDEP for CityBuzz. After that it was replacement of the SDs with more LOs. Then in March / April 2007, further fleet replacement took place in HGDEP, thus we see buses like 9329U, 9364S, 9398U, 9399S.</p>
              <p>In June 2007, service 161 received 3 B9TLs. The B9TLs were removed later and replaced by LOs from service 25. In the early months of 2008, there was a "fight" between 21 and 161 for 9417Z. The former won the "fight". Months after the B9TLs were taken out, 9587R joined the fleet. The service went full HGDEP on 10 August 2009 with 9587R as the sole bus as then-AMDEP to have survived the transfer.</p>

              <p>9364S was perm on hgdep 9 when 9 first got its DDs in 2003 after the network rationalisation. In Nov 203, 9 moved from hgdep to bndep for full control, swop with 197 from bndep to hgdep. 9345Y 9364S retained in hgdep and joined 197, as 197 left behind 9378C 9432D at bndep for 9. It is a swop.</p>
              <p>The entire hgdep 197 fleet came to bndep. By the time 197 return to bndep, 9364S already left 197 long long ago.</p>
              <p>From Nov 2003 till 2008, it is not even a decade. A decade is <strong>10 years</strong>. 9364S was there for not even 4 years. 9201D joined 197 when hgdep was short of mk2s, the 3 mk3 were redeployed (732Y and etc). 9201D 9238Z 9389X went to replace.</p>
              <p>9201D 9249S and one more fella retained in hgdep, so bndep 197 was operated with the original fleet of +3SD - 3DD. hgdep sent 644T 2733G 2755T</p>
