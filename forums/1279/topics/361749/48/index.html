              <p><br>True, hgdep nearer. But you can't have the best of all worlds. hgdep has its limitations too. if Eunos retains under hgdep and serangoon joins in, not every BCs would join hgdep from amdep, for some reasons. So where do the BCs go? amdep then has to get more control of other service to make sure the BCs have a perm route to work on.</p>
              <p>The reason being hgdep has not space to contain these few services. And these few services are under Tampines &amp; Ang Mo Kio route group currently, which is East.</p>
              <p>Look at a bigger picture. Haha.</p>
