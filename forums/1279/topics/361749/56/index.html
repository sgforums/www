              <p>During that time there were SBS9155D and SBS9117P as well but they went to 97 and 98 respectively shortly after. Also for SBS9107T it was swapped with SBS9024Z of Sv 30 during 2002 when the latter was holding the NIE President Challenge Ad. As for SBS9132U it went to 98 before swapping with SBS9127K to go to 154.</p>

              <p><br>Most of the ex-service 85 buses were based in HGDEP, the VO3x from service 85 went to service 165 to replace all the NAC VO2x if I am not wrong. Tridants were mostly given to service 89.</p>
              <p>Also to add on that services like 97, 111 and 502 were cutback to loop at Marina Centre and became a single depot control. As such HGDEP had a surplus fleet of spare VO3x. Service 107 was also extended to Hougang and duties were transferred from AMDEP to HGDEP, where VO3x and MK4s are deployed.</p>
