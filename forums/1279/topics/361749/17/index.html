              <p>BNDEP got so many Volvo MK4 becoming spare buses, main reason is
              that  BNDEP took in many Euro 5 K230UBs and replace the MK4s
              on some bus services. I believe that HGDEP, BBDEP and BNDEP are
              taking in Euro 5s to prepare for the Volvo MK3s to phase out
              starting Nov 2009 (provided no further extension)</p>

              <p><br>Erm, I think you're looking too far ahead. Currently what most depots are concentrating on is on beefing up the WAB fleets for already-certified WAB services, because of complaints that WAB buses do not arrive during scheduled WAB slots. 2, 7, 12, 14, 21, 130, 196, 198, 232, 268 are just some of the services that have received KUBs replacing non-WAB buses. It's up to individual depots to decide how to deploy their new buses, some choose the triangle method (For example, EEV goes into Sv3 &amp; Sv19 replacing Euro IV buses, which then go onto Sv12) or direct deployment (Can't think of any example yet but there will be some soon). Just because certain depots are taking in massive numbers of EEV doesn't mean they have immediate plans to clear off old buses. You've got to look at depot size constrains too. You know why AM/BR only takes in EEVs a few at a go, then stop? Their depot is too packed.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying what you're saying is wrong but your picture is too big. Look at current situations first. Who knows that in the future those non-WAB buses that were replaced eventually replaces outgoing buses.</p>

              <p><br>So far have not encounter any official WAB svcs getting perm Euro 5 buses as yet, only redeployment of Euro 3 B9TL or Euro 4 KUBs. Perhaps soon ba. And also 109 which is the 1st svc in HGDEP to get Euro 5 replacing MK3 buses.</p>
