              <p>make it clear for u. there is a great dispute that SBS8033D had cloned out SBS8031J and SBS8033D did not clear out the misunderstanding, and instead, run away from the trouble.</p>

              <p><br>I can also remember taking DM OAC Merz with blue fur seats on Service 31 from my home to Tampines when I was 6 years old and also a LO2x or O305 on 28. Somehow when I was younger I can already sense those really old good days would be gone. I can also remember the days of HGDEP controlling Services in Bedok. Those days I took lots of Mark IV DM and Mark II CAC on Service 9 and lots of Mark IIIs on Service 18.</p>

              <p><br>Well,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by chance, I stumbled on SBS2888T with foldable seats in 2000 while shopping with grandparents in Geylang Serai. We were waiting for Sv 7 to come and indeed came, but saw this new bus with EDS. So, i begged them to let me have a try on it. So we boarded SBS2888T.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remembered the first time I rode a VSO on Chartered Service for NDP. It was quite a good ride. I did remembered bringing my cousins and my aunt onboard Citybuzz while they were just brand new. Joyrided C1 and C2 with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For SBS998Y, i didn't manage to board it but manage to see it in action in 2003 and 2001 doing Sv 18 and Sv 290 respectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only saw SBS999U in 2004 while coming back home from fishing. It looked simillar to SMRT Volgren bendies except the fact that it is older. Never rode it unfortunately.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The LO2x were deployed on all JIS services, Sv 242, Sv 243, Sv 154 and a few others while i was living in Jurong West. The sounds were awesome, i must say. As a young schoolboy who grew up with them, i fell in love with them. It's sad to see them gone when i came back in 2003 to deliver a letter to someone in Pioneer with my mom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For SBS1688K, i only rode it on May 1 2007 as i never stumble on it during my childhood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TIB1024H lived with me for a long time, being a perm bus on Sv 913. I first saw it on Sv 187 in 2001. The same year, it got redeployed to my feeder route, Sv 913. Been a perm eversince.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who want to ask about the old Sembawang Road End Terminal or the old Woodlands Interchange (near CIQ), just drop me a PM and i'll try my best to explain it to you all.</p>

                                Well,</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>by chance, I stumbled on SBS2888T with foldable seats in 2000
                                while shopping with grandparents in Geylang Serai. We were waiting
                                for Sv 7 to come and indeed came, but saw this new bus with EDS.
                                So, i begged them to let me have a try on it. So we boarded
                                SBS2888T.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>I remembered the first time I rode a VSO on Chartered Service
                                for NDP. It was quite a good ride. I did remembered bringing my
                                cousins and my aunt onboard Citybuzz while they were just brand
                                new. Joyrided C1 and C2 with them.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>For SBS998Y, i didn't manage to board it but manage to see it in
                                action in 2003 and 2001 doing Sv 18 and Sv 290 respectively.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>I only saw SBS999U in 2004 while coming back home from fishing.
                                It looked simillar to SMRT Volgren bendies except the fact that it
                                is older. Never rode it unfortunately.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>The LO2x were deployed on all JIS services, Sv 242, Sv 243, Sv
                                154 and a few others while i was living in Jurong West. The sounds
                                were awesome, i must say. As a young schoolboy who grew up with
                                them, i fell in love with them. It's sad to see them gone when i
                                came back in 2003 to deliver a letter to someone in Pioneer with my
                                mom.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>For SBS1688K, i only rode it on May 1 2007 as i never stumble on
                                it during my childhood.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>TIB1024H lived with me for a long time, being a perm bus on Sv
                                913. I first saw it on Sv 187 in 2001. The same year, it got
                                redeployed to my feeder route, Sv 913. Been a perm eversince.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>For those who want to ask about the old Sembawang Road End
                                Terminal or the old Woodlands Interchange (near CIQ), just drop me
                                a PM and i'll try my best to explain it to you all.</p>

                                Thanks for your effort or whatever it is -_- , We wasn't born yesterday , in fact most of us (including the seniors here) have better experience more than you. Likewise the Old Sembawang Rd End terminal and the Old Woodlands Interchange.

              <p><br>no lah.. Circle bus - mostly MB0405 with circle handgrip. Square bus - B9 with square handgrip. Triangle bus - K230 with triangle handgrip. My house there got Sv 76/268/269 with these few types of buses mah.. I dun think my son know what is B9, what is K230 but he do recognize the buses from the shape/design/EDS. Think only tintinspartan know the rego/make/feature of buses when he is 4 years old. i think i only know how to play with see saw/toys when i am 4 years old :)</p>

              <p>You seems to have diary at home, remembering all the svc, where you board, the date you board. *CLAP*<br><br>Even me, the date where i board 8031J, I cant even rem. And its the first day on the road. I believe quite a number of people cant even remember the date of boarding the bus.</p>

              <p><br>I can also remember taking DM OAC Merz with blue fur seats on Service 31 from my home to Tampines when I was 6 years old and also a LO2x or O305 on 28. Somehow when I was younger I can already sense those really old good days would be gone. I can also remember the days of HGDEP controlling Services in Bedok. Those days I took lots of Mark IV DM and Mark II CAC on Service 9 and lots of Mark IIIs on Service 18.</p>

              <p><br> Well,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by chance, I stumbled on SBS2888T with foldable seats in 2000
              while shopping with grandparents in Geylang Serai. We were waiting
              for Sv 7 to come and indeed came, but saw this new bus with EDS.
              So, i begged them to let me have a try on it. So we boarded
              SBS2888T.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remembered the first time I rode a VSO on Chartered Service
              for NDP. It was quite a good ride. I did remembered bringing my
              cousins and my aunt onboard Citybuzz while they were just brand
              new. Joyrided C1 and C2 with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For SBS998Y, i didn't manage to board it but manage to see it in
              action in 2003 and 2001 doing Sv 18 and Sv 290 respectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only saw SBS999U in 2004 while coming back home from fishing.
              It looked simillar to SMRT Volgren bendies except the fact that it
              is older. Never rode it unfortunately.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The LO2x were deployed on all JIS services, Sv 242, Sv 243, Sv
              154 and a few others while i was living in Jurong West. The sounds
              were awesome, i must say. As a young schoolboy who grew up with
              them, i fell in love with them. It's sad to see them gone when i
              came back in 2003 to deliver a letter to someone in Pioneer with my
              mom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For SBS1688K, i only rode it on May 1 2007 as i never stumble on
              it during my childhood.</p>
