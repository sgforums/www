              What's wrong with DBTF? I think this fare system is excellent and fair. Now I can just transfer buses to get right to my doorstep without incurring additional fares. Of course, we cannot have everything perfect as longer distance travel may cost more now. I've been to several countries and would say Singapore's DBTF is still the best. Ever tried in Melbourne travelling only 1 train/tram/bus stop and you got to pay a few dollars because its a zone system?

                  Having read the ST article (29 Apr 11) featuring PAP candidate Charles Chong and his team taking sv 155, I just feel its just a wayang and publicity stunt. At least for Raymond Lim previously, he was reported to make a surprise visit to the Bt Panjang bus-stop during morning peak to check it out himself of the situation and then travelled on one bus service. I can sense more sincereity from Raymond Lim instead.

              You should lodge complaint to LTA on the service lapse. If situation still remain unchanged, then its time to go and knock on your MP's door during the Meet the peoples session. If still no changes, then you decide whether they still deserve your vote the next round of elections.

              <p><br>Do u mean service 163M?</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, I would think that service 163 should add in more full day shifts based on its perm fleet. Currently service 163 has 15 buses (including 1 bus for 163M), of which only 8 buses does full day.</p>

              <p><br>What's wrong with DBTF? I think this fare system is excellent and fair. Now I can just transfer buses to get right to my doorstep without incurring additional fares. Of course, we cannot have everything perfect as longer distance travel may cost more now. I've been to several countries and would say Singapore's DBTF is still the best. Ever tried in Melbourne travelling only 1 train/tram/bus stop and you got to pay a few dollars because its a zone system?</p>
