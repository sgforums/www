Finally here's the (BS) reply from SMRT to my published letter: -.-<br><br><a href="http://www.zaobao.com/yl/yl070417_511.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zaobao.com/yl/yl070417_511.html</a><br><br>For the benefit of the non-chinese people, i shall translate it here for you all.. ^^<br><br>Currently, Service 190's (the direction from New Bridge Rd towards Choa Chu Kang) frequency for the evening peak period is 3 - 7 minutes. This kind of frequency can already satisfy the needs of the passengers [as if... -.- ]. Besides, about 70% of Service 190's bus fleets are articulated (bendy) buses, that's why the passengers's load is higher.<br><br>Service NR3 needs to bypass North Bridge Rd for a loop in order to allow more passengers to onboard SMRT NR services back home at the interchanging bus stop at Boat Quay. Besides, because NR Services operates when there's no public transport (buses/train) in operation, and it's considered as a premium service, that's why the bus fare is higher.<br><br>We thank Mr Lim (which is me!!) for your feedback.  -.-</div>
