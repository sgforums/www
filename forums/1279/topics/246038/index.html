WTF, all queueing for the same berth.<br><br>The 179 and 180 bus were both loading at the same time. The 180 queue was so long lah! All the way till the 257/243W queue there. So when the 179 bus load finish and drive off, the 180 bus still cannot move up to take the proper boarding space because it was still loading pax.<br><br>Then after that came another 179 bus, then another 179 bus then another 179 bus (all ADDs)<br>So the queue became<br>180, 182, 178, 179, 179, 179<br>all queuing for the same berth. Then this block the buses exiting from the 79 and 243 berths. Then everywhere horn.<br><br>The 180 bendy take so long to load but still cannot even load finish all its passengers. Still got leftovers passengers.<br><br>Compared to 179, after 3 179 bus departed, one minute later came next 179 bus and another 2minute later came the next one.

            <div class='col-md body'>SMRT bendies put wrong service, 180 and 184 don't need bendies, just need to add bus (but then again they only have that 800+ buses), they don't know how to prioritize where to put their bendies. 171 seems screwed up, at Orchard the buses are packed, but at Bukit Panjang you see 171 coming one after another after a long wait, first one would usually be fully seated with a few standees, the rest near empty. 190 is an extreme case, where you have a shortage. 179 faces this also, but 179 case can be tackled more easily than 190 because 179 doesn't go through busy city roads until it reaches NTU, where mini jams may occur, and demand for 179 is slightly lower than 190 at peak.<br><br>No matter how SMRT wants to push people to their trains, residents of BPJ would and should take the buses, because there is simply no point of taking a LRT and transferring to MRT when it takes 1 hour+ and you need to wait several times, when you can just wait for one bus which brings you to city in 30 mins. Bukit Panjang's transport system is screwed up by SMRT and LTA, since its main transportation mode is the bus, that white elephant LRT is just a complement trying its best to surpass buses as its main mode of transport.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With all the explainations above, I think by now you guys should be able to understand how I feel when I wrote this letter. With a screwed up transportation system in Bt Panjang, residents living in Bt Panjang will suffer even more with SMRT Buses controlling its bus services, especially Service 190 and 960. How I wonder if SBS Transit can just take over the public bus services in Singapore so that residents living in areas serving by SMRT Buses need not suffer more with poor frequency, poor bus service deployments!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking , I think SMRT should put fully bendies for super high demand service , coz i think there were some a bit low demand using bendies , cases like Sv 180 , 184 (at least they do have rigids on Sundays and PH) and from what i think , they can use rigids and maybe 1-2 bendy for these services , unless the route got narrow roads then no choice , but again , i hope SMRT 190 can be fully bendies fleet in this case, but still .... SBS did a better job for 190 during its heydays , sad...</div>

With a screwed up transportation system in Bt Panjang, residents living in Bt Panjang will suffer even more with SMRT Buses controlling its bus services, especially Service 190 and 960. How I wonder if SBS Transit can just take over the public bus services in Singapore so that residents living in areas serving by SMRT Buses need not suffer more with poor frequency, poor bus service deployments!! </div></blockquote>The LRT just seals the fate for us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Bukit Panjang has a nice and good person, Dr Teo Ho Pin, but has a poor transport operator. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
