That will be worst especially when currently SMRT Buses Ltd buying over TIBS Holdings Ltd.. Service 147 will suffer the most if it's ever controlled by SMRT Buses as now they already have a very very hard time managing its deployment for Service 190.. Same goes for Service 74 and 27.. And when ZB called me to contact a staff from SMRT Buses, I told her that Service 190 with a frequency of 5 minutes per bus during peak hours is very very slow, given the type of demand this service has, and to think that she told me that 5 mins for peak period is very GOOD le.. (as if...) Grrr..</div></blockquote>THe demise of TIbs Holdings was bad. I will never forget the poor decisions that led to it.</div>
