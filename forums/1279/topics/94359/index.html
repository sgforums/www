When they built it, I tot..wakaoz...why so small. I already know they built it as a replacement for Hougang South, so I predicted it will be Phase one only.<br><br>but there seems to be no sign of phase 2 even when it is so busy now?<br><br>And please leh...Hougang South was not closed because of NEL or low demand. That is what the bus company and governmental authorities like to say. In actual fact, all they wanted to do is to correct an "anormality" with the situation in Hougang. Long long ago, Hougang NEw Town was supposed to have only 3 neighbourhoods....1 to 3, and what is "kovan City" now was supposed to be the Town Centre. Years later, they reconfigured the planning for Hougang, doubling its size, and end up having to move the Town Centre up north to the new "epicentre" loh. And since each new town usually have 1 bus interchange at the town centre, they have to move it too loh....<br><br>Now we end up having an "oversized" neighbourhood centre at Kovan!</div>
