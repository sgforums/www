Sometimes I wished BNdepot should have kept the mercedes and gotten rid of the scanias instead . I do agree with carbikebus , the mercedes maybe be 10 years old plus but they are still doing good on the roads . Volvo buses are pretty alright but I dont like some of the Mark IV buses with irritating screeching fanbelt sounds. </div></blockquote>Well, the recent changes to svc 39 must have pissed you off big time. From past threads, you don't seem to like the Scania brand much, do you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I find that strange and your theory may be right, bcos the mkIIIs are already just behind vehicles in front and people on crowded buses risk falling when a car cuts in front of the bus.<br><br>PS: I ever saw a 088 VO3X BC who opened the window and yelled at a lorry that cut in front of him and braked hard.
