The idea was not to hold up cars behind the bus on a congested city street. Unfortunately, high acceleration equals low top speed. TIBS O405 have a ZF4HP500 4-speed automatic gearbox which, performance wise is quite similar to the W3E boxes. But the ZF4HP500 has an over drive for better efficiency over prolonged movement.<br><br>The B10M Mk II and Mk III have the same engine; Volvo THD101GC, but different gearbox. The Mk II use ZF4HP500 while the Mk III use Voith DIWA851.2. Voith gearboxes are tuned for higher top speed which means sluggish starts. They do have an overdrive but it would only kick in at about 65-70 kmh. Hence, the Mk III, which are limited to 60 kmh, will not go more than 3rd, which is a ratio of 1:1 with no gain whatsoever.</div></blockquote>All MKIII JB have an overdrive which kicks in at 65km/h as well several other "Untouched" MKIIIs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I noticed Malaysian operators don't maintain their fleets very well.</div></blockquote>Unfortunately, Singaporean Lance also belch out black smoke. This is due to the unusual characteristic of the Cummins engine which has a long turbo lag. A turbo lag is a period where the engine does not get the extra power from the turbocharger as it takes time for the turbine to generate enough pressure to get the compressor working and the fuel/air mixture burned more efficiently.  As such, the bus will move off slowly until the turbo kicks in with a surge and expels the remains of incompletely combusted gases.</div>

That sound is due to the hub-reduction axle on the rear wheels. Unlike the engine which slows down with an upchange in gears, the wheel will go faster. Hence an increasing pitch.<br><br>Howling and whirring on the O405 can be attributed, among other things, to the torque convertor in the gearbox, the above mentioned hub-reduction axles or the exhaust.</div>
