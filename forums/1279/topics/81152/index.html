            <div class='col-md body'>I am a moderator of the Singapore_Buses group, and long time member of both the sgbuses and Singapore_Buses groups.<br><br>The quality of the postings of both groups is far more superior than that of these forums, since almost anyone from the general public can post.  There is no spam on either of the groups, especially the Singapore_Buses group, since there is a screening process which determines what is a spambot, or spammer, and who is a genuine enthusiast, who has <strong>something to contribute to the group</strong>.  Here, I find nothing new gets posted, alot of whinging and b**ching about the most irrelevant things, basically a sandpit full of people who just drool over buses, or have a bone to pick with them...and one of the few moderators doesn't even have an interest in buses anymore (seemingly), but more into planes.  Which, I will be quick to add, is fair enough.  Since I like trains more than buses.  So I guess I'm lucky I can find time to oversee a train and bus group as well.  Working in the industry helps as well.  Anyways, that's my view on it, and reasons why I don't look at this group as often, and why despite having joined this forum a long time ago, haven't posted very much (aside from happily keeping a low profile, from a long way away).</div>

Who do you think you are, provoking me?! God? </div></blockquote>sbs&amp;tibs<br><br>Well, I'm not God, but a great deal more superior to you.  I am a moderator of a group that you want to join.  You are the plebian who wants to join, YET, you still want to challenge me.  That's all fine and dandy, you can stay in this sandpit and never join a yahoogroup.  You clearly do not respect me, since I am an elder to you.  So, son, you can dig deeper into the hole that you are in, and I'll keep looking down on you.  How does that sound?</div>

If you think that sucking up is going to make myself, or any of the other moderators (who do read this forum) change our minds, I wish you the best of luck.  You're going to get very far in the Singapore_Buses yahoogroup, and we will definitely welcome you with open arms.</div>
