              <p><br>Common mistake people make is to brake immediately after tyre failure.</p>
              <p>Instead what should be done is to accelerate and keep the vehicle heading forward - let it stabilise before braking gently.</p>

              <p>I experienced once back in 1994 IIRC, when VO3X 1st started on svc147. The tyre burst along HG Ave 8 when I was on board of SBS9227E. BTW, that's my 1st time on VO3X when it revenued, and also my 1st time kena tyre burst. At that time was only the LH 2nd axle tyre burst, so there wasn't any mishap caused.</p>

              <p>Tag axle is an axle not connected to the drive shaft and acts as a extra weight balance. It differs from vehicle to vehicle. On the Olympians, the 2nd axle is the tag axle, but on the Tridents, the last axle is the tag axle.</p>

              <p>Tag axle is an axle not connected to the drive shaft and acts as
              a extra weight balance. It differs from vehicle to vehicle. On the

              <p>Adding on to the above information, turning (or rather, active) tag (or lazy) axles are present on the LO and VO 3-axle buses, but discontinued from the Super Olympian onwards. This was due to simplification in design and allowing a lower floor configuration.</p>
              <p>For third axle tag designs, the above three examples do not have steering features, but the Neoplan Centroliner has this turning feature, and activates between 20 to 45 km/h.</p>
              <p>Power axles are easy to identify with twin tires being the one, or if you are looking at the rim, those with the rim 'curving' inwards would also be the case.</p>

              <p>nope. A front tire failure normally happens when the tire is damaged and the tire is under extreme loading, such as under braking or turning at speed. Even when going straight, a tire explosion can throw the vehicle into loss of control.</p>

              <p>Yeah. The tire is normally dragged across, which subjects the tire to massive lateral forces. Therefore sidewall strength and condition must be good, otherwise the tire can fail. Likewise in this case, the tire's sidewall had been damaged prior to entry to the int. When the bus made a sharp turn , the tire's sidewall is subjected to the massive lateral force. However the damaged it incurred previously meant that the sidewall couldnt withstand the lateral forces and the tire pressure within, which lead to a blowout.</p>

              <p>negotiating a turn makes a front blowout even worse. at certain speeds front blowouts can still be salvaged.</p>
              <p>still though, referring to your reply to ben, yes because of this scrubbing its actually the sidewall which is more in contact with the ground now. thus the sidewalls must be properly maintained.</p>
              <p>i'm just wondering if sbst checks tire conditions regularly or not, or do the drivers check. a few weeks ago, while waiting for a bus in ang mo kio, i spotted a svc 76 B9 with its right outermost rear tire sporting a huge bulge.</p>
              <p>a certain section of the sidewall was bulging really badly. does this signify the possibility of a blowout? this isn't the first time i've witnessed such things - once a merc on svc. 86 had a portion of its rear tire sidewall bulging so badly it could be seen sticking out of the wheel arch when looking across the side of the bus.</p>
