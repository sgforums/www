As you know Delgro is a 'big' company. Not only this rumours spreading around among SBST drivers but also in the stock market as well. Of course not to mention this also spreading like hotcakes in $MRT, who runs $MRT Train/LRT/Bus/Taxi.<br><br>You may have notice that the share price of $MRT stands at around 93 - 95.5cents/share.<br><br>$MRT just 'R' 46 positions on tuesday. This 'R' will goes on for sometime. They had already 'R' quit a number of positions to keep cost down for the pass year. This is unavoidable if you are running a transportation line. However I believe this got something to do with merge. Problem is: WHO BUY OVER WHO?????????????????????????????????????<br><br>If you compare the $$$ asset of $MRT and Delgro, of course you know who the winner lah. $MRT belongs to 'T.H' and Delgro ( I not too sure ).<br><br>Hmmmmmm.........just wait and see whats gonna happen in June 2005. </div></blockquote>Stop acting like a l*n j*ao manager lah.....You again have orang utan eyeballs ah.....What position position.....WHO BUY OVER WHO?LTA buy you and kick you out of Singapore.</div>

All transportation assets (buses included) belong directly or indirectly to the government. For <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span> competition to take place, one company (maybe SMRT) should sell a huge stake to an outside operator (like Connex). After all, even London's Metroline is property of ComfortDelGro, so why can't we practice reciprocity?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw TODAY.<br><br>And shocked to read this statement! (in red)<br>Is it going to happen!<br><br>The Public Transport Council (PTC) is assessing applications from SMRT and SBS Transit, which operates the North-East Line (NEL) in addition to its bus services.<br>.<br>Its decision will be out next month, with the changes taking effect from July.<br>.<br>According to a new formula, any fare hike would be 2.4 per cent, or no more than 2 cents on an average 80-cent fare.<br>.<br>Both SMRT and SBS Transit, a unit of ComfortDelgro, have cited rising operating costs to justify their applications for a fare increase.<br>.<br>The last time public transport fares rose was in 2002. This time, SMRT's request for higher fares comes on the back of the firm's record net profit of $126.9 million for the year ended Mar 31.<br>.<br>Addressing critics, Ms Saw stressed that her aim was not to raise fares so that SMRT makes a profit.<br>.<br>She explained: "The costs have gone up by about 10 per cent over the past three years Â— things like statutory fees, GST and property taxes, fuel and security that I have to absorb, completely not passing through to the customer."<br>.<br>She added that MRT fares here were about one-third of Asia's average and less than half of the United States', yet the MRT system has been ranked top in the world for punctuality and second for cost and manpower efficiency.<br>.<br>So, <span style="color: red;">why not merge SMRT with SBS Transit's NEL to beget more cost savings, as some analysts have suggested?<br>.<br>"We're very open to the idea, but what's the price? NEL in itself is still loss-making. At this rate, they (SBS Transit) have not expressed that they're interested to do anything," said Ms Saw</span>.<br>.<br>"I suppose they believe they can do something better with it, which we think is tough."<br>.<br>SBS Transit's response on the fare-hike issue: Pg 16 Proposal may mean no increase for some: SMRT<br><br>Christie Loh<br>christie@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>THE controversial proposed fare hike will not hit everyone equally.<br>.<br>Eight of 10 MRT commuters using the EzLink card would see either no change or, at most, a 1-cent rise in fares, revealed Ms Saw Phaik Hwa, SMRT's president and chief executive on Friday.<br>.<br>This is because in the train operator's fare hike application last month, it had asked for the bulk of the increase to fall on the "better-off", who only take the MRT occasionally, she said.<br>.<br>"For people who buy one ticket at a time Â— tourists or people who have cars but like to take a train Â— if I increase a standard ticket of 80 cents by 10 cents, that's nothing to them. So, we're looking to move fares up significantly more in those areas where people can afford," she told reporters after SMRT's prize-giving ceremony for the Ride-for-Free Promotion.<br>.<br>Yesterday, SBS Transit also came out to elaborate that if its proposal for a fare hike were approved, it could introduce measures that would include keeping fares for schoolchildren unchanged; extending hours for concessionary travel by senior citizens to include weekends, for example; and setting up a transport fund for the poor and needy.<br>.<br>The Public Transport Council (PTC) is assessing applications from SMRT and SBS Transit, which operates the North-East Line (NEL) in addition to its bus services.<br>.<br>Its decision will be out next month, with the changes taking effect from July.<br>.<br>According to a new formula, any fare hike would be 2.4 per cent, or no more than 2 cents on an average 80-cent fare.<br>.<br><span style="color: red;">Both SMRT and SBS Transit, a unit of ComfortDelgro</span>, have cited rising operating costs to justify their applications for a fare increase</div>
