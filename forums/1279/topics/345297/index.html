            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>SINGAPORE: Bus fares and train fares are set to come down, giving commuters the break many have been asking for against a worsening economic situation. <br><br><strong>But details of how much fares will be reduced will only be known at the end of February. <br></strong><br>The unusual move came just a day after the government unveiled a massive S$20.5 billion Budget, where a big focus was on helping companies cope with costs. <br><br>Public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT followed up with statements to say they will not apply for any fare adjustment this year. <br><br>SBS Transit said it also did not apply for fare increases in 2003 and 2004 because of poor economic conditions. In 2003, it was because of the SARS outbreak and in 2004, it was because the company felt economic growth had not yet taken root. <br><br>Welcoming the move, the Public Transport Council (PTC) said it is glad to know operators are also ready to work with it to reduce bus and train fares. <br><br>And cheering the move were some commuters. <br><br>One said: "We are using public transport every day, so it will benefit us." <br><br>The second said: "For me, not much - only one month, save a few dollars, which is only for one meal." <br><br>Another said: "A little savings goes a long way." <br><br>While no details are available yet, commuters were most interested in finding out just how significant the reductions will be. <br><br>PTC said it will have to sit down with the operators and work out the numbers before coming up with a plan. <br><br><strong>And instead of the traditional third quarter review, the PTC will expedite its work and announce details of the cuts by the end of next month. <br><br>In Singapore, public transport fares <span style="color: #ff0000;">are adjusted annually based on a fixed formula that takes into account factors such as wage rises and inflation. <br></span><br><span style="color: #ff00ff;">In fact, if this is being followed strictly, the maximum fare hike this year can be five per cent, according to SMRT, looking at data from January through to November.</span> But there is ground for flexibility with this formula as PTC also has to take into account the general economic and job conditions before making a final decision. <br></strong><br>Another form of public transport also stands to benefit. <br><br>The government announced in its Budget Statement it is giving a 30 per cent road tax rebate and a special tax waiver for taxis that are not hired out. <br><br>All taxi companies have agreed to pass on these cost savings to their drivers, and details of how this will be done are being worked out. <br><br>In a statement, Transport Minister Raymond Lim also welcomed the news, saying he <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">(now then)</span></span></strong> understood the concerns of Singaporeans over transport costs in these times. <br><br>- CNA/yb/yt <br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/404406/1/.html">www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/404406/1/.html</a></span></p></div>

              <p>I was rather doubtful of this, but seeing that they seem to be enforcing a downward adjustment here, I think it might really come down this time.</p>
              <p>If they had left it to the bus companies to decide, at most they will just hold it at current levels this year (and reading how SMRT seems to be wanting to raise the fares - again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> - even try pushing for a upward change). I doubt they will be willing to lower the fares themselves.</p>

              <p>There's already rumours of a snap election this year abounding. I doubt it though; PAP is well aware of the many political upheavals around the world recently that pushed many incumbent governements, if not right out of office, then on to their toes (eg. Malaysia, Zimbabwe, Taiwan, the United States, etc.), and I believe the more politically-aware population in Singapore are itching to do something like that this year if the opportunity really presents itself, and I doubt the PAP will take such a big risk even with the generous budget.</p>
              <p>Then again, I shouldn't be talking about politics in a bus forum, WTF. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              MORE surprise relief was in store for Singaporeans a day after Budget
              2009 was unveiled, when the two public transport operators announced
              that not only would they not apply for a fare adjustment this year —
              they would, in fact, pass on cost-savings to commuters in the form of
              lower fares.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              SBS Transit, for example, said
              the Government’s measures would allow the company to save “millions of
              dollars”. Transport operators got a road tax rebate, and also benefited
              from a property tax rebate and the cash grant for employers of
              Singaporeans.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The Public Transport Council
              (PTC) said it will work with the two operators and aims to announce the
              reduced fares by the end of next month.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              While details are to be worked out, theoretically speaking, the respite works out to a substantial one for commuters.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Were the current fare
              adjustment formula to be applied, based on data from last year, the
              maximum fare hike permitted this year would be 5 per cent, according to
              SMRT — the biggest since the formula was implemented in 2005.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In response to media queries,
              Transport Minister Raymond Lim said he was “pleased” to hear that the
              public transport operators will pass on savings from the Budget to
              commuters.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “I hope that in their working
              together, the operators and the PTC will explore what more can be done
              to lower transport costs for commuters,” he added.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <strong>Targeted or across the board cuts? </strong>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Asked about the form a fare
              reduction could take — whether it would be targeted at specific groups
              or across the board, for instance — and the possible quantum, PTC
              chairman Gerard Ee said it was “premature” to comment. The council
              would first have to examine the savings put forward by the operators,
              he said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But Mr Ee hinted at PTC’s
              approach: To “achieve a maximum result” to benefit most commuters.
              Significantly, SBS Transit spokeswoman Tammy Tan said the operator
              would work with the PTC “to lower costs for all public transport
              commuters — not just the needy ones”.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Commuters had previously found
              relief during the Asian financial crisis in 1999. Then, public
              transport operators gave a 5-per-cent bonus rebate on nearly all ticket
              types for one year (the exceptions being single trip and corporate
              advertiser tickets) to help reduce the cost of using public transport.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The rebate was given by way
              of an additional 50 cents for every $10 travel value of an adult
              farecard purchased or topped up. Concession tickets also received
              varying rebates.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Transport analyst Terence Fan,
              from theSingapore Management University’s Lee Kong Chian School of
              Business, felt that a fare cutacross the board, as well as further
              discounts for ez-link travel, could have a positive big-picture effect.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              <div id="articleBody" class="artText">“By making travel affordable,
              this will stimulate travel and, in turn, economic activity,” said
              Professor Fan, who also suggested a fixed-price pass — available in
              some European cities — that would spur commuters to make multiple trips
              within a short time frame.</div>
              <div class="artText"><br></div>
              <div class="artText"><strong>Can PTC call for further reduction? </strong></div>
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              While both operators have decided not to apply for fare adjustments, the PTC will, nonetheless, still convene later this year.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr Ee said it would have to
              eliminate the “transfer penalty” as part of a move towards
              distance-based throughfares – where commuters pay just for the distance
              travelled, able to choose the fastest way to get to their destination
              without the extra charge of changing between services.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              During the fare revision
              exercise last year, the penalty was partially eliminated when the
              transfer rebate was increased from 25 cents to 40 cents. In all,
              although fares went up by 4 cents, due to the higher rebates 4 in 10
              commuters actually ended up paying the same as before, or even less.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Would the PTC intervene to
              require operators to cut fares further, should economic conditions
              worsen? Mr Ee said it was “still premature” to say.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Member of Parliament Ong Kian
              Min – who chaired the committee on the fare review mechanism in 2005 –
              noted that the PTC has the flexibility to vary any annual fare
              adjustment or to reject it in “extenuating circumstances”, such as
              adverse economic conditions.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              “What PTC has done now is to
              not wait for the usual fare adjustment cycle which would take months,
              but move towards an interim measure,” said Mr Ong.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              For now, the PTC will be
              keeping a close eye on commuters’ behaviour and feedback. “We will have
              to monitor each month as it unfolds,” said Mr Ee. “Right now, it is a
              pleasant surprise that operators have decided to share the savings, and
              we take this chapter first."</span></div>

              <p><strong>Tertiary students seek lower public transport fares</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Close to 5,200 tertiary students have signed a petition for lower public transport fares.
              <br> <br> They say it is unfair they have to pay 80 per cent more in fares
              compared to students in junior colleges and institutes of technical
              education.
              <br> <br>Times are tough, and in light of the financial burden that their
              parents are shouldering during the economic downturn, a group of
              tertiary students came together last November to petition for cheaper
              fares.
              <br> <br> Not only are they taking to the streets to collect signatures, they are also doing it online.
              <br> </span><span>Polytechnic student Charlene Teo said: "We're only students and we
              don't get a lot of pocket money....so we hope the government can review
              the fares for us."<br><br>A bus concession pass for junior college students costs $27.50 a
              month and for polytechnic students $52 (89 per cent difference). <br> <br> A train concession pass for junior college students costs $25 monthly and for polytechnic students $45 (80 per cent difference).
              <br> <br> The Transport Ministry says concession fares are granted by the public transport operators. 
              <br> <br> But the government is encouraging operators to look into this matter.
              <br> <br> Earlier this week, the students had a meeting with the Public Transport Council and operators.
              <br> <br> Bernard Chen, a polytechnic student and the organiser of the petition,
              said: "We were pleasantly surprised to know that they actually wanted
              to initiate a meeting with us. So I think this is a very positive step
              forward for activism and civil society in general."
              <br> <br>At the meeting, the students proposed that tertiary students should
              pay not more than 160 per cent of what junior college students are
              paying.
              <br> <br> They also asked operators to come up with a mechanism to determine the fare subsidy for tertiary students.
              <br> <br> In the past, public transport operators have been reluctant to increase subsidies for tertiary students.
              <br> <br> SMRT had said that all concessionary fares are effectively cross-subsidised by full-fare paying commuters. 
              <br> <br>Thus, they need to exercise prudence in granting further travel
              concession beyond the present arrangement, so as to avoid any adverse
              impact on full-fare paying commuters. <br> <br> Train concession prices have remained unchanged for more than 10 years
              since 1997, while the last revision for bus concession fares was in
              2002.
              <br> <br> Responding to Channel NewsAsia's queries, both SMRT and SBS Transit said they will be lowering fares for commuters this year. 
              <br> <br>SBS Transit said the fare reduction will include the fares for
              tertiary students, while SMRT said it is still considering the matter. <br> <br> Details will be out later this month.
