            <div class='col-md body'>I had the opportunity to compare the Volvo B10BLE with the OC500LE. It chanced upon me that 2989K came as I waited for 105 to get to Hyatt hotel. Although I like both of them the ride on the OC500LE is much smoother. I'm quite surprised that the engine is quiet for a Mercedes-Benz bus which are known to be very loud. I simply love the retarder sound of this bus. It steps down in quick succession and then lets out a monstrous moan. Cool! One thing in common is that sitting at the rearmost seat is a complete no-no. Very hot lah! Interior wise, I find the OC500LE to be a bit narrow and their doors were not as wide as the B10BLE. I really feel that SBS &amp; TIBS should get a bus with wheelchair access (it doesn't have to be a CNG one). After watching the demo carried out by the Handicapped Welfare Association, I realised how easy and quickly they could roll on and off the bus. Impressive. I lost sleep today just to see the OC500LE and it was worth it. A once in a lifetime experience.</div>

As one can see, most of the buses in Singapore have steps on boarding and alighting area. The elderly and the disabled people do have difficulties getting up and down the bus. With such low floor design on the bus, it would benefit the mentioned group of people, and also create convenience for them when taking public transportation.</div>

It kicks in when decelerating, so as to slow down the bus engine without jerking too much. Comparing with a TIBS O.405 that I boarded yesterday, I feel that OC.500LE, with a 6-speed gearbox, can handle the speed of the bus efficiently, and also, smoothly. </div></blockquote>Of course! This bussy has a 4 stage retarder, unlike the 3stage for the ones we have here in Singapore!

One more thing Australian cities are much bigger than the Island of Singapore and whats more even if its back in Perth, you will face some problems catching it, because Transperth simply have too many buses from O305 single decks to Renault PR.100.2 (lots of them) to O405NH (fuel Cell, very expensive and explosive) to O.500.LE (OC.500.LE)</div>

I have uploaded different logos for SCHOOL BUS and a swimmer logo for BEACH BUS, among other things.  Better than serial cables for the TIBS LLE destos in the O.405s and O.405Gs, and the mobitecs for the TIBS L113CRLs.
