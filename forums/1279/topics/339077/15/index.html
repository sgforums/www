              <p>Well, for those of you who wants to take photographs at a bus interchange or terminal, just a heads-up. From what I have observed, it's an unwritten but enforced rule that you should not take photographs at a bus terminal or interchange; this is still largely a gray area that is not well-defined, and has been discussed here from time to time. However, if I remember correctly, it is OK to take photographs at a bus interchange or terminal after you get permission from the staff there; a few people around here have pictures of buses taken at the interchange after receiving permission from the staff.</p>
              <p>Photography of public transit system is a very sensitive issue not only in Singapore, but elsewhere around the world too - I heard that there was this incident when someone in New York was detained and denied his legal rights - for taking photographs of the subway system there (something similar happened in Singapore with regards to buses, I believe). A planned ban on photo-taking there was shot down after the citizens there gathered to protest and voice out against it. Over here, as it is not a formally and legally-defined and written rule, the whole thing is very much a gray area. It's better to be safe than sorry, but - and I strongly advise against this - if you want to test the waters, you can challenge them on this point. A well-known Malaysian blogger was, while in Singapore, confronted by SMRT staff when he took a photograph of City Hall station, and got away with it after he challenged them on this gray area; that was before SMRT formally came out and said that they prohibit photo-taking in their stations; no word on buses yet as far as I know.</p>
              <p>And - just a word of caution - security staff in Singapore are brainless, heartless, robotic creatures with absolutely no sense of humanity at all, so don't ever, ever cross their paths - and it's extremely to do so in Singapore. Remember that incident where someone missed her flight at Changi Airport all because she was explaining to her son what the security staff was doing, mentioned the word 'bomb', got overheard by oversensitive security staff, and was detained by them for no rhyme and reason until long after her flight took off, despite her protests and pleas?</p>

              <p>You are right. There's no law which states no phototaking inside interchanges or terminals. But it is the security reasons that they have to record your particulars in case of any terrorism happens. So why not just stop taking photos in interchanges or terminals to avoid all the troubles?</p>
              <p>Ok, now people will start rebutting to me that particulars should not be given to any people other than policeman. So you want SBST or SMRT personnel to call for police for your case and be detained by police do all the questionings in police station? Or just for their record purposes?</p>

              <p>You are <strong>so</strong> wrong. Law enforcement officers have the legal right to ask you for your IC, even without a search warrant. You also have the legal right to ask them for their rank, name when they ask you for your IC.</p>
              <p>SMRT/SBST Staff can tell you to leave their premises when you take photos, but <strong>cannot</strong> tell you to delete your photos. If they forcibly ask you to do it (i.e. via threats/physical means/taking your camera), feel free to call the police.</p>
              <p>ClubSnap has many debates about this, feel free to look at it and gain your insights.</p>

              <p>Actually I believe that the best way to solve this problem under a probable win-win situation is to have the 2 major companies issue us special photography pass that can differentiate us from potential terrorists. In this way they will still have our identification records while we have the right to take photos in bus interchanges / train stations.</p>
              <p>Just to bring up an example...</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.connexmelbourne.com.au/index.php?id=56">http://www.connexmelbourne.com.au/index.php?id=56</a></p>
              <p>Connex Melbourne Trains of Australia states that "<strong>We welcome the interests of rail enthusiasts, amateur photographers and the media at our stations.</strong>" However, "<strong>we require that you hold a valid permit to ensure the safety and privacy of all our customers.</strong>"</p>
              <p>Visit the link to read more on how they categorise the different types of rail enthusiasts and how they issue this "special permit" for them to take photos of stations. However they usually have limitations on where they can take photos of.</p>
              <p>But, this clearly shows that at least this train company from Australia accepts the fact that there <strong>are</strong> people out there who love trains. If only SBS Transit and SMRT will accept the fact that there <strong>are</strong> similarly, bus / rail enthusiasts and not mistake us for some terrorists. If Australia can do it, why can't Singapore?</p>

              <p>Oi, this place nto for you to "cock", ok, And I wanted to take a OC with my cam, I always had no chance, coz most of the time i always see it in interchanges. You see me taking them?????? I SERIOUSLY ASK YOU, if you see a 10+ boy with cam phone taking pics in interchanges, you just tell the office lah, I DARE YOU. You no evidence you don tell.</p>
              <p>And just smile so what??? I know, you wanted to show the forum your power in taking pics. Taking bus pics need "kungfu" one, not like someone always think he the head of the SGFORUMS. If too near, don take, Must have some space at the sides. You better reference other's pics before you take any.</p>
              <p>I was scolded by others before, I can change, if I want. You can change, just like the ads on the NEA advertisement(like SBS8219K), also, if you want. The bus fans here can give you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TIME</strong></span>. If you don't know, time is the most powerful weapon in changing.</p>
              <p>I give you time, all can give you time, as long as you can change.</p>
