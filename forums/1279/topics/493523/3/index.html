              <p>It won't. Because there are too many services in the current Tampines interchange. And the interchange has no expansion since 1988. Unless LTA decides to double the size of the old interchange. </p>

              <p>In my personal view, there seems to be some merit on the ground of displeasure against the fact that Compassvale Interchange only have one service at the time of opening; it could be a sign of under-utilisation at first instance (of course there are bound to be new services in the future, but whether it makes sense to call it an "interchange" when there is only one service is something that needs to be addressed separately).</p>
              <p>All in all, the main issue is whether there is merit in grounds for such complaints; for example, if they don't want to open Compassvale Interchange, why bother building it in the first place? (This is a very straightforward point which can be easily detected)</p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, it makes sense to call it an interchange because it is linked to the current Sengkang interchange by an overhead bridge or a traffic light. It is merely 30 metres away. It is not a few hundred metres away. So the worries are totally unfounded. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

                  <p>I agree. They should have built a covered walkway from Compassvale Bus Interchange to Sengkang Bus Interchange, or at least make 374 call at that bus stop opposite Sengkang MRT station (Blk 260A) on the way back to Compassvale Bus Interchange. Walking from Compassvale Bus Interchange to Sengkang MRT station is so inconvenient, especially when it rains. Furthermore, the area around the traffic light got people smoking; not good for health.</p>
