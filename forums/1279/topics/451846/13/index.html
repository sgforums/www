              <p>I have seen 43 heavily loaded. It completely depends on whether a 76 is ahead of it. But from Serangoon to Punggol it does have high loading (&gt;60 pax). </p>
              <p>I feel 76 route should be diverted. This is my suggestion.</p>
              <p>Yo Chu Kang (loop at Aljunied Station) via Serangoon, Upper Aljunied road, Aljunied Station. This way there is a route from AMK &amp; YCK Road to Aljunied.</p>
              <p>43 should divert via Marine Terrace to take care of 76's missed route. 43 should be converted to full DD route while 76 can be started as SD and depending on loading, a few DDs can be added. </p>

              <p>38 - Can manage with current load</p>
              <p>63 - Had asked SBS. Stated height restrictions, but I believe either 33 or 63 should have a few DDs to relieve the crowd at Tiong Bahru road during peak. Also 63 has good loading between Aljunied and Eunos.</p>
              <p>100 - They should introduce 5 DDs on this route for peak hour loading. The rush is crazy and that's one of the reasons I suggested 76 be diverted to Aljunied as at both Serangoon and Aljunied it is the only route plying through Upper Aljunied.</p>
              <p>135 - If not 100, 135 needs some DDs for sure to relieve some crowd. It also seems a heavily packed route. Take a few DDs from 132/153 and put them on 100/135</p>
              <p>238/268 - If smartly done, load can be satisfied by using extra DDs at Toa Payoh / AMK as crossover during peak hours.</p>

              <p>195 IIRC was because of the road from Queensway turning left into Commonwealth Dr is the problem. Even currently SD on 195 still have to allowed all vehicles to turn out from Commonwealth Dr before able to negotiate the sharp left turn. IMHO LTA should have fixed up that turn so as other heavy vehicles can easily turn in too.</p>

              <p>133 has high loading between Bugis &amp; Potong Pasir (extremely right) and again from Serangoon Ave 2 to AMK Ave 1 &amp; 10 junction.</p>
              <p>2 has very high loading all the way in one direction and in the opposite from CV - Bedok or Bedok - CV. Hence, it justifies for a full fleet DD or at least deploying more DDs.</p>

              <p>I have seen 43 heavily loaded. It completely depends on whether
                  a 76 is ahead of it. But from Serangoon to Punggol it does have
                  high loading (&gt;60 pax). </p>
              <p>I feel 76 route should be diverted. This is my suggestion.</p>
              <p>Yo Chu Kang (loop at Aljunied Station) via Serangoon, Upper
                  Aljunied road, Aljunied Station. This way there is a route from AMK
                  &amp; YCK Road to Aljunied.</p>
              <p>43 should divert via Marine Terrace to take care of 76's missed
                  route. 43 should be converted to full DD route while 76 can be
                  started as SD and depending on loading, a few DDs can be
                  added. </p>

              <p>I never had a chance to take these demos.</p>
              <p>Even more upset that I saw the Volvo Ailsa B55 twice on 65 before, but never had the chance to take it. A chance that was gone forever.</p>
              <p>Anyway, nice to see these buses again, brings back the good old memories.</p>
