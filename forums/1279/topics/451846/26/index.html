              <p>I totally agree with you, the DD of 54 always starts its first
              trip from NBR Ter. At approx 6.35 - 6.45, it will turn into Bishan
              Street 22, I can assure you. The bus is at least 97% empty,
              sometimes 0 pax. The worst i seen was 30 pax in it, don't know they
              put DD's there for whatever redundant reason. The 52 load was
              because of the students in the west, not very sure about it as i
              dont always go to the west. If you can get to the bus stop opposite
              thomson plaza around 6.10pm - 6.25pm(badly estimated timing), 9673A
              would come. Usually that bus would have around 90 - 100 pax, and
              the upper deck is 90% filled whereas the 1st deck is not even 50%
              full. I "played" with iris and found out that the next bus will
              take a very long time to arrive, around 6.40 - 6.45pm. The 9673A
              usually comes during 6.20pm. (Not too sure), may i ask if whether
              the bus behind 9673A is a DD? That time when i "played" with iris
              163 has not been declared WAB yet. But an adless trident was behind
              it.</p>

              <p>The 52 leaves Bishan Int at 6.00 pm, so your time estimate is almost correct. I normally see around 60-70 pax on Upper Thomson on 52, but the main loading comes at Clementi Road, Clementi MRT, Synergy HUB to Jurong. </p>

              <p>36 - Airport to Marine Parade (20 pax). Just extend 135 to loop at Changi, and extend 36 to Tampines - this would be my recommendation</p>

              <p>36 - Morning peak if you see around 10-15 pax board every bus at Orchard MRT to get down at Nassim road, hence the Tomlinson loop might cause inconvenience to them</p>

              <p>5 (Scotts Road), 16 (Orchard road). These are fast options. Alternate: 123, 139. I think if 36 is extended to Bukit Merah it should be extended via Zion road, Outram MRT, New Bridge road to Bukit Merah as other roads have 5, 16, 123 plying.</p>

              <p>135 full fleet KUBs, and there's already a 24 there. Even if MP to Bedok there, you can go plan the route yourself. It's quite near, you know. </p>
              <p>36 actually can terminate at Tampines. It's either you make the BCs work extra hard and give them extra pay. Don't terminate at tampines. Loop there like what 265 does in AMK Int. Or you ask them park by the alighting berth like Bishan Int</p>

              <p>If u ask me why 74 cannot get all DDs my guess is because they
                          are regarded as "School services" by the co itself.The fleet itself
                          is overwhelming with 40 over buses.</p>
              <p>36 is better they can extend to Bt Merah and joint control with
                          ARBP.Buses also got chance to rest and engine off there.</p>

              <p>Tomlinson rd ah how many pax board/alight there?Ive ever drive 36 numerous time while with BN on a short stint.The pattern is from airport to marine parade average about 20-30 pax then alight,At parkway there's standees to town area then just 2 stops before Tomlinson there's even 2 pax only.Pax start from Orchard till Marine parade then almost empty.Along marine parade there's a handful going airport that's all.So it's best to extend to Btm.From Btm ppl can have alternative to Orchard beside 123.Make it 36A Airport-Tomlinson-Airport and 36B for the last 3 buses plying Airport-Tomlinson only.As for 52,163 I just say no need many DDs just a few will do ie 4 DDs out of 12 buses.</p>

              <p>139 is already there from Bukit Merah to Redhill. The route can be modified a bit. 63's main concern is Rumma Tinggi - hence, no DDs. Or they should swap 33 with 63. Make 63 go to Kent Ridge and 33 terminate at RT.</p>

              <p>113 - 2-3 dds is justified. Have u seen the large crowds taking this svc? Taking 1 trip during AM peak and 1 trip during PM peak dosent prove your data is correct. If u email sbst, the loading is 87-90% during peak hours. And 112, it's only 50%... 40pax take 112 during peak hours one.. They are standing because ppl are unwilling to sit together.. Most if the crowd of 113 get off after 5-6 stops after kovan station. There is svc 115 until 6.15am because it relieves the crowd and makes it more convenient for ppl to get home, instead of walking home if they took 113. </p>

              <p>113 - 2-3 dds is justified. Have u seen the large crowds taking this svc? Taking 1 trip during AM peak and 1 trip during PM peak dosent prove your data is correct. If u email sbst, the loading is 87-90% during peak hours. And 112, it's only 50%... 40pax take 112 during peak hours one.. They are standing because ppl are unwilling to sit together.. Most if the crowd of 113 get off after 5-6 stops after kovan station. There is svc 115 until 6.15am because it relieves the crowd and makes it more convenient for ppl to get home, instead of walking home if they took 113. </p>

              <p>I know you have been rooting for DD on 113 for a long time. If I was a user of the bus and it was SD, even I would wish the same. But honestly, no, there are more worthy routes, and definitely 119 might not be one of them - but too early to comment with the route extension.</p>
              <p>I have observed 113 a few more times now. The bus pax reduce to 20-25 on Hougang Ave 1 - that is 3-4 stops, my friend. I prefer that these DDs be added to 74, 147, 87, 25 and make them full fleet DD first. After all, people on these routes have to go standing for 15-20 stops, and that is not funny.</p>
