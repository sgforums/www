              <p>Do we think SBS Transit is making optimum utilization of double
              decker buses? What is the criteria used to deploy Double decker
              buses?</p>
              <p>I feel some routes like 97, 151, 153, 166 do not deserve to be
              double deckers as they do not have more than 30 people at most
              times (166 gets full only between Little India &amp; Ang Mo
              Kio). </p>
              <p>There are routes like 16, 33, 63, 195 that have a heavy
              patronage but are only SD and DD are not experimented on them - may
              be there is a height clearance issue, but then SBS Transit should
              try to re-org the buses so that the high capacity ones get the
              DDs. </p>
              <p>My thread is basically to get a list of routes for SBS Transit
              through our experience where it should deploy DDs. </p>

              <p>If there is demand yes they will deploy. Like 243W.</p>
              <p>To be honest I'd want to see Double deckers on 243W as a full day basis. It is still crowded on weekdays and weekends I still hope they will put atleast 1 full day Double decker on a full day on 243W.</p>

              Never mind wat
              
              Tibs did a creative idea on 180 to solve the problem caused by bendy bus...
              
              Make 180 a loop sv, from Boon Lay Int, loop around BPJ roadside terminal.
              
              Need more to say Tibs wasn't fit to takeover SBS's CCK, BPJ &amp; Bt Batok svs? BI alrdy meant for ADD 12m buses, end up fit all these inefficient space usage bendy buses.
              
              But MBT's decision ended up to create more bus mess which we face today..

              <div>Buses from Serangoon Interchange don't really require DD -
              look at 100 or 105 - the bus hardly is standing even in peak hours
              for SD, then there is no need for DD. But let me correct, 100 does
              have standing between CBD and Beach road. This is just 20% of the
              route.</div>

              <p>100 can be packed to the door where 100A plies. that is morning peak. In addition between Commonweatlth MRT and Alexandra Rd but this load has dropped due to CCL.</p>
              <p>131 if any improvements would be to improve the headway during peak hour. under the quarterly review 131 has added 2 split shift buses since it started.</p>
              <p>loading on 143 is pretty dynamic. part of the reason lies whether is there any bus of a difference service in front going to the same destination.</p>
