              <p><br>What 59 needs is more DDs. At least 50% of its fleet. It is the only trunk route connecting Lor Toa Payoh 1 and passes through Kaki Bukit, Bedok Reservoir Road - industrial and huge HDB houses. Both side buses during peak hours have 80+ loading.</p>

              <p>Svc 13 I always see the VO / LO empty during early am peak. If let 45 solely AM, they should transfer the BNDEP fleet of Svc 45 all to AMDEP, and let the volgrens / wrights take over 59 like what i said. You don't need to worry about WAB too for if those fleet ad really happened, 59 still have 2 / 3 WAB.</p>

              <p>Svc 13 has 8 DDs in its fleet earlier this year, now the DDs have been reduced to 6. Actually, the loading on 13 has dropped considerably over the months.</p>
              <p>The main loading segment worth DDs is Bishan St 22 to Bishan Stn (alternate services 52, 54, 88, 410). Rest throughout the bus has 50-60 pax during peak hours if the bus is not late. </p>
              <p>The DDs will be better utilized if transferred to 45 and 59.</p>

              <p>If you take the VO3x on 45 that leaves YCK Terminal around 5.20 / 5.30 pm, you see high loading between AMK Ave 5 and Serangoon NEX, then the loading drops till Eunos Link, after which when the bus turns at PIE, the bus will have around 90-95 pax. </p>
              <p>If this bus has such a high loading at one time, I wonder how it is perfectly timed. This means the timings before and after would also have high loading. </p>
              <p>I feel 45  should have 6 DDs, 3 in each direction. It goes through industrial areas and HDB complexes and unlike 43 that has so many options in parallel, 45 actually has a unique route.</p>

              <p>With all the BSEP and service improvements, it often surprises me why 74 is often the neglected one. Leave alone full fleet DDs, in its 29 odd fleet of DDs, there is not even one Wright.</p>
              <p>And ofcourse, we need full fleet DD for 74 - apart from the 74 Express, which also for 1 or 2 trips has become DD worthy. But no one is listening about 74 - I wonder WHY!!</p>

              <p>74 has 40 odd buses because the demand is heavy and the route is long. It can actually do with a full fleet DD fleet of 38 buses. It is "not just" a school service. Agreed it connects to institutions along Dover, Clementi road, but then are lot of residential / commercial blocks also along Bukit Timah road. Also 74 connects AMK Station to Hougang Town. The downroute from AMK Station to Hougang itself can have 80+ pax at one time.</p>

              <p>36 need not go to Bukit Merah. A lot of people board 36 at Orchard MRT to get down before Nassim Road to avoid the long walk. It is the only route looping at Tomlinson. 36's route needs to be changed at Changi side. 135 should be extended to Changi airport while 36 should terminate at Tampines Int via Tanah Merah, Simei Ave, Changi General Hospital - then DDs can be used on this heavily crowded route.</p>

              <p><strong>No need of DD on 54</strong>. I don't know what that 1 DD does also :P</p>
              <p>45 - Does not need too many DDs but at least 4 DDs to start with, 2 from each side.</p>
              <p>52 - If it did not need DDs, it would not have got 4 DDs in a span of 4-5 months. 52's loading pattern is as follows. Around 50-60 pax till Clementi Road, 70-80 pax Clementi road - Clementi Station, 60-70 pax - Clementi Station / Synergy, 100+ pax - Synergy to Jurong East. The loading increases as you go to the west.</p>
              <p>163 - we have discussed this before. Loading between 70-80 pax in peak hours. The reason it has been given 3 additional DDs in the last 3 months is because it is the only route connecting the places it does. A SD cannot manage it during peak hours, and people esp on YCK Road have to leave 1-2 buses before entering the next. Even now, SDs go full on YCK road, and people have to wait for the DD behind that comes after 10-12 mins.</p>

              <p>Not really - if you see the loading at Changi, people get off by Marine Parade. The loading is only about 20-30 pax there and hardly anyone travels all the way to Suntec. The bus loads to its capacity on Marine Parade road as it is a faster way to Suntec / Orchard road.</p>

              <p>In changi airport, the pax last time has dropped tremendously and now the buses could even have 0 pax. The real load is actually marine parade when even 2 KUBs could not even handle the load. I don't understand why they park 2 - 3 36 KUBs over there with no pax on board and the bus just parking there without eds / bc on the bus. They could have just start a downroute at marina parade. Actually, if you notice, if there are 2 KUBs 1 will be 95% full from marine parade to suntec while the other one is usually empty.</p>
              <p>Don't know what the hell is SBST thinking about, parking the 36 KUBs there doing nothing, while those on service parking there is so packed. Even if they dont start service there for they fear airport might be jammed, they should at least start a downroute at marine parade.</p>

              <p>I totally agree with you, the DD of 54 always starts its first trip from NBR Ter. At approx 6.35 - 6.45, it will turn into Bishan Street 22, I can assure you. The bus is at least 97% empty, sometimes 0 pax. The worst i seen was 30 pax in it, don't know they put DD's there for whatever redundant reason. The 52 load was because of the students in the west, not very sure about it as i dont always go to the west. If you can get to the bus stop opposite thomson plaza around 6.10pm - 6.25pm(badly estimated timing), 9673A would come. Usually that bus would have around 90 - 100 pax, and the upper deck is 90% filled whereas the 1st deck is not even 50% full. I "played" with iris and found out that the next bus will take a very long time to arrive, around 6.40 - 6.45pm. The 9673A usually comes during 6.20pm. (Not too sure), may i ask if whether the bus behind 9673A is a DD? That time when i "played" with iris 163 has not been declared WAB yet. But an adless trident was behind it.</p>
