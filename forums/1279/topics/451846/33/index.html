              <p>You will have noticed SBS2601D has stopped yakking and complaining about 74.</p>
              <p>That's because SBS2601D has figured out that rather than stopping for toilet and char kway teow and the $1.50 fruit juice at Adam Rd Food Centre after completing half the journey from the west, and then hope for a 74 DD,</p>
              <p>it is actually a little easier to take 153 from Botanic Gdns, stop at Serangoon and jalan-jalan a bit, and then take 147.</p>
              <p>The main deterrant was the crowd at practically all times of the day.</p>
              <p>I don't take 74 towards BNV, but the opp way, and I can tell you its full-house all the way from early afternoon till 10+pm.</p>
              <p>Dont believe, you can try.</p>
              <p>And yes.</p>
              <p>SBS2601D reckons taking 165 from Adam Rd, despite a longer ride, would offer a far emptier DD ride. Good for kiao kar. Not quite sure why 165 is hanging on to the DDs, but fair play to SBS2601D.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>85 have very horrid frequency. 119 approximate off-peak freq is 11-13 mins. 85 takes a good 23 mins to come. Singapore OS a got country u noe. Again, would you like to blaze under the sun?</p>
              <p>119 will prosper very soon. Once the developments there are ready, I guarantee even DDs will be so packed pax can't board at Punggol, both directions. Just wait and see. </p>

              <p>Can't believe that I once believed that 113 IS packed. </p>
              <p>During evening peak, do you know how empty are the 113 buses? Three out of the five KUBs that I observed leaving HCI is TOTALLY EMPTY. I have numerous shots of super empty 113s, appearing at all sectors of the service. Terrible frequency and yet demand so lousy... no wonder DDs and freq increase don't come 113's way. </p>
              <p>But 119 is different. And I mean TOTALLY different. The number of students taking 119 during afternoon off-peak can get unbearably high. The B10Ms usually have to close its doors at Sengkang with standees all over the corridor of the bus. I have to admit, 119 load at Punggol side is currently quite bare, and 119 extension should not bring in DDs, but to other services like 168, but since it IS deployed. Then why not use it for Hougang side? </p>
              <p>After all, 119 Hougang side is quite chaotic anyway. </p>

              <p>Can't believe that I once believed that 113 IS packed. </p>
              <p>During evening peak, do you know how empty are the 113 buses?
                      Three out of the five KUBs that I observed leaving HCI is TOTALLY
                      EMPTY. I have numerous shots of super empty 113s, appearing at all
                      sectors of the service. Terrible frequency and yet demand so
                      lousy... no wonder DDs and freq increase don't come 113's
                      way. </p>
              <p>But 119 is different. And I mean TOTALLY different. The number
                      of students taking 119 during afternoon off-peak can get unbearably
                      high. The B10Ms usually have to close its doors at Sengkang with
                      standees all over the corridor of the bus. I have to admit, 119
                      load at Punggol side is currently quite bare, and 119 extension
                      should not bring in DDs, but to other services like 168, but since
                      it IS deployed. Then why not use it for Hougang side? </p>
              <p>After all, 119 Hougang side is quite chaotic anyway. </p>

              <p>119 Peak hour demand how much? chaotic? </p>
              <p>83 u sure packed like sardines?</p>
              <p>3 i agree, but 83 nope.</p>
              <p>The citaros can take the load alr.  You deploy citaro to 113 try. 2 citaros to clear the load. And who will take 113 from HCI? I'd rather take 113 at the hougang mall bus stop like other commuters to save time.</p>
