              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please lah, 43 NEEDS DDs. Lets say, for example 1DD = 2SDs. And
              svc 43 has 8 DDs. So if you calculate, 43 will need 16 MORE SDs?
              The frequency is set for equal competition with 70/70M. If the
              frequency of Svc 43 was adjusted to, lets say every 6 minutes. That
              way everyone will be taking 43 and not 70. 70 will be operating at
              a loss and SBS can't withdraw that bus due to its links to Shenton
              Way. If more SDs are deployed, svc 43 will be an SBS version of 190
              during peak hour. Even after peak its still full. The reason for
              deploying DDs from Punggol to UEC Ter is because the load from Paya
              Lebar MRT to Parkway Parade is almost the same as the load from nex
              to Buangkok Green. You try waiting at Paya Lebar MRT bus stop on a
              Sunday. When 43 comes, everyone takes it. Even if there was a 76
              behind, no one boards it</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Your argument is totally invalid.</p>
              <p>1. 43 does NOT need DDs. Here's why.</p>
              <p>2. 43's frequency is horrible. And I mean VERY horrible. Imagine of you are standing at a bus stop for 18 mins only to wait for a DD which is packed by the time everyone boards it. Would rather shorter waiting time for comfortable SD. </p>
              <p>3. Who says 43's schedule is adjusted to compete with 70? 70 will still have pax boarding anyway of 43 is not there first. Even if 43 snatched all the pax, SBST will definitely do something to 70.</p>
              <p>4. Your comparison of 43 with 190 is TOTAL absurd. 190 is SMRT and have bendies plying on it. What's more it plies CBD and it's an express svc. 190 will definitely have more pax no matter what. What's more, 43 has severely low pax capacity after Buangkok/Parkway stop. 190 is full throughout. </p>
              <p>5. It is NOT full after peak hours. It is in fact NEAR EMPTY. Believe me, I have observed 43 every day all time before. At peak hours of weekday some sectors don't even have any standees. So comfortable. only parkway and NEX weekend crowds go like crazy, but other times it's a wandering bus. </p>
              <p>point by me:</p>
              <p>6. 43's load is not full route. Only a few stops at some Places. Most will not want to move up. I have seen ppl flooding the lower deck during weekends from parkway to paya lebar. Ironically, no ppl moved up.</p>
              <p>43 is more of a short weekend service if u ask me. In that case, additional SDs for more downroute/short trips are more than enough. You must know that there are more svcs in HGDEP that need DDs more, like 74 and 89. 43 is one of them that can do with fleet additions. </p>

              <p>Well 147 has 27 DDs, and only 5 SDs. 154 does not need to be

              <p>JB cannot be handed over. You do realise that JB services need to do many things in order to gain partnership for JB services. Handing them to SMRT will only make it worse. SMRT doesn't have much spare rigids [ those MANs need to make some WAB services ] plus they are already busy handling service 950 with the OCs. 160 and 170 should just stay with SBST. Handing them over makes no difference to their loading. </p>

              <p><br> Actually depends which part of the route you see 43. If you see 43
              between NEX and Buangkok Green, there will be a very low
              probability that you will find the bus empty, even if there is a 70
              right in front. The NEX &gt;&gt; BG direct travelers are around 40
              pax at normal frequency (10min) without bus bunching. Then you
              consider the # of people who board the bus at YCK Road towards NEX.
              You can find a DD filled with around 90 pax.</p>
              <p>Between NEX and Paya Laber there are some 10 routes plying and
              hence, here I agree the loading can be less than 40 pax. Again at
              Paya Laber, you can see at least 50 pax loading in a 43. If a SD
              comes, many times people cannot completely board or have to be
              packed like sardines. The loading is good for two buses either 43,
              76 or 43 and 135.</p>
              <p>There is one extra route from Paya Laber to Marine Parade. If
              43, 76, 135 all come together, it is for sure, 1 bus will go empty
              - that's where 135 needs to be rationalized according to me.</p>

              <p>If you ask me, I would definitely give DDs to 74 before 43. I would also make 87 full fleet DD and also 147. I would convert that 1 SD from 161 to DD as well and make 161 full fleet DD. </p>
              <p>Also considering the # of spare DDs each depot has now, I don't know why they wouldn't give the worthy routes full fleet DDs now. I feel even 74E needs DDs at some time slots. There are enough DDs spare to let the ones on 43 be, and give DDs to 72, 74, 88, 89, 147, 161. </p>

              <p>147 and 161 no need full fleet. But 74, 87, 89 etc all need their fleets to be upgraded to full DD. It's a pain to see 87 spammed with non-WAB SDs in the weekends, as well as striders on 89 during evening peak. 72 doesn't have that much problem with its SDs, but will do good if its SDs are replaced.</p>

              <p>147 cannot have full DDs because of its load at weekday off-peak. EXTRMELY less amount of ppl board 147 during weekday afternoon off-peak (given no dismissal times of school which is quite a short period on the whole afternoon).  The interchange itself less than 10 ppl board oredi. In the CBD at this time less than 5 standees. This loading I can say is worse than 43 off peak. No wonder why all the SDs come in at this time... </p>
              <p>147 peak hour should have full DDs. But if it meant that not the whole fleet will be working at this time, then that's where SDs utilise.</p>

              <p>Morning: </p>
              <p>Sengkang East Way to YCK Road (70-80 pax) after which on Upper Thomson Road, pax drop to 50 pax, and on Bradell road around 30 pax.</p>
              <p>Opposite direction, loading is only from Fernvale to Sengkang MRT (loading could go upto 80-90 pax depending on whether 163M is ahead). </p>
              <p>In the evening, just reverse it. You will see 60+ pax loading 163 at Sengkang MRT itself and in the opposite direction, the load picks up on YCK Road to Fernvale / Sengkang West - East </p>
