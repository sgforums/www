              <p>i think that svc 43,90,132,165 do not need DDs.</p>
              <p>Svc 62 do not need so much DDs and such good frequency. Bus svcs
              in hougang/ lorong ah soo like 53,113, is damn crowded esp school
              dismissal times and peak hours. Got one day i waiting for svc 113,
              3 svc 62 came in the span of 15 mins, each bus 5 min, all DD, all
              so empty, no standee. Svc 113 come, full load to the door, cannot
              board. Empty svc 62 DD at the back. People complain and whine. Same
              case for 53 also. Btw, svc 113 (ex 321) had dds in the past also.
              Vo2x.</p>
              <p>reasons why 43,90,132,165 do not need DDs :</p>
              <p>svc 43's demand is not fixed. It depends on whether which bus
              comes first. Eg. if svc 76 comes first, 43's dd will be
              unutilised.</p>
              <p>svc 90. This svc only crowded when airshow or special occasion
              near the airport there la...</p>
              <p>svc 132. demand only from redhill to orchard others ulu</p>
              <p>svc 165. Off peak ulu, peak hours demand also not fixed. This
              bus svc mirrors alot of services also.... Therefore SDs can be
              deployed on this svc.</p>

              I think you should go around more often and see how the buses are during rush hours.<br>
              <br>
              90 is crowded every day during rush hours. If you had tried boarding at MacPherson for 8 or 90 towards Toa Payoh during evening rush, you wouldn't be able to board unless there is another 8 behind.<br>
              <br>
              There was a very good reason why LO2xes were placed there before, and a very good reason why the DD is back on 90. And try standing in a packed NAC Scania during evening rush and getting stuck in slow traffic from MacPherson all the way to Bee Cheng Hiang bus stop, heck, even in a aircon Merc it was uncomfortable.<br>
              <br>
              For 132 and 165, please take note of the AMK crowd towards Hougang, people board whatever bus which comes first.<br>

              <p><br>132 - Loading high only between Redhill &amp; Henderson Road (Do you really need so many DDs for a route where only 10% is high loading?) Then all routes in SG will needs DDs</p>
              <p>165 - Need DDs but not at many!! I agree - in peak hours 5 DDs from Clementi - HG in evening and other way round in morning.</p>
              <p>90 / 94 - No need la. You have 8 to relieve the crowd till Macpherson.</p>
              <p>62 - Definitely need full DD fleet. It had high loading throughout its route - at least a full seated bus unless there is bunching</p>
              <p>139 - Does not need DDs for sure. 145 NEEDs but due to Henderson road cannot</p>
              <p>186 - Needs DDs in morning peak towards Shenton. There are 2 DDs that come back to back and are filled to the brim. Go to River Walk bus stop (Havelock road). Watch the fun when suited executives try to cram into the bus.</p>
              <p>51 is fine. 143 frequency is too good with too many DDs. Need to be moved some to other routes.</p>

              <p>I agree on 90, 132, 165 but not with 43 completely coz the loading completely depends on whether there is a 70 or 76 ahead of it. In that case even 143 should not have DDs because the loading completely depends on whether there is a 30 or 51 ahead of it. Anyway, I feel there are way too many DDs on 143 that are not utilized optimally.</p>
              <p>90 - I have never seen the bus high loaded mainly coz it always follows a 8. But I could be wrong if other folks here agree.</p>
              <p>But what about 132, 153 - where is the loading? Hardly any. Now don't tell me 10% of its route has high loading so it should be DD :)</p>

              <p>Anyway back to topic</p>
              <p>i think that svc 43,90,132,165 do not need DDs.</p>
              <p>Svc 62 do not need so much DDs and such good frequency. Bus svcs
              in hougang/ lorong ah soo like 53,113, is damn crowded esp school
              dismissal times and peak hours. Got one day i waiting for svc 113,
              3 svc 62 came in the span of 15 mins, each bus 5 min, all DD, all
              so empty, no standee. Svc 113 come, full load to the door, cannot
              board. Empty svc 62 DD at the back. People complain and whine. Same
              case for 53 also. Btw, svc 113 (ex 321) had dds in the past also.
              Vo2x.</p>
              <p>reasons why 43,90,132,165 do not need DDs :</p>
              <p>svc 43's demand is not fixed. It depends on whether which bus
              comes first. Eg. if svc 76 comes first, 43's dd will be
              unutilised.</p>
              <p>svc 90. This svc only crowded when airshow or special occasion
              near the airport there la...</p>
              <p>svc 132. demand only from redhill to orchard others ulu</p>
              <p>svc 165. Off peak ulu, peak hours demand also not fixed. This
              bus svc mirrors alot of services also.... Therefore SDs can be
              deployed on this svc.</p>

              <p>62 - you are just at the wrong place at the wrong time. that's why its empty.. doh!</p>
              <p>43 - if 43's demand is not fixed, how do bus planners plan bus routes? how do schedulers determine the DD slot?</p>
              <p>90 - frog in the well, nuff said. you think everyone at airport rd drive to work?</p>
              <p>132 - then why so many people board 132 at AMK Stn?</p>
              <p>165 - as above (see 43 and 132)</p>
              <p>Your bottomline in the whole post is justifying that 113 needs better frequency, needs more buses, needs DDs because this feeder route is more packed than the trunk services you observed. And in your quest of justifying your point, you belittle the other services such that they do not need improvements.</p>

              <p><br> 132 - Loading high only between Redhill &amp; Henderson Road (Do
              you really need so many DDs for a route where only 10% is high
              loading?) Then all routes in SG will needs DDs</p>
              <p>165 - Need DDs but not at many!! I agree - in peak hours 5 DDs
              from Clementi - HG in evening and other way round in morning.</p>
              <p>90 / 94 - No need la. You have 8 to relieve the crowd till
              Macpherson.</p>
              <p>62 - Definitely need full DD fleet. It had high loading
              throughout its route - at least a full seated bus unless there
              is bunching</p>
              <p>139 - Does not need DDs for sure. 145 NEEDs but due to Henderson
              road cannot</p>
              <p>186 - Needs DDs in morning peak towards Shenton. There are 2 DDs
              that come back to back and are filled to the brim. Go to River
              Walk bus stop (Havelock road). Watch the fun when suited executives
              try to cram into the bus.</p>
              <p>51 is fine. 143 frequency is too good with too many DDs. Need to
              be moved some to other routes.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>132 - another reason for DD presence is advertisement contracts.</p>
              <p>165 - as said previously, sector between hougang and amk load is quite high.</p>
              <p>90 - you said there's 8 to relieve the crowd. what if 8 can't accomplish that?</p>
              <p>62 - its currently 35% single deck fleet. its loads have significantly dropped since CCL opened, especially those in the Tai Seng area. They have since cut about 4 buses, and converted 2-3 buses from DD to SD since the opening of CCL.</p>
              <p>186 - The 4 DDs on 186 are timed for the AM Peak crowd. dont worry about that. and its only the sole AM Peak-on-peak trip that the DDs are well utilised.</p>
              <p>143 - The DDs are best utilised along the south western corridor area. that's all.</p>

NOT DD. 90 is becoz there is not much SP in BRBP rite now, so cannot add frequency like 43. 132 and 165 TOTALLY deserves DD, even after introduction of CCL west (165 needed DD during peak hours).</p>
