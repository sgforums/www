            <div class='col-md body'>1. For single DD bus services that cannot handle DD services like 36 or 518 as eg . I really hope SBST consider operating 2 SD buses at one time to ease the load. 518's frequency is horrible and if you cant board the first bus because it's full , you have to wait for another 25 mins for the next one and that is even worse if that is the last bus. Something have to be done ....<br><br>2. For DD bus services, high load services like svc 7 , 12 or 65. During peak hours , please swop the timing of the SD and DD buses ... for example at 1800 , the SD bus is leaving Clementi for Bedok (bus 7 ) , the bus always get overcrowded and as a result , many passengers were left stranded at their respective bus stops , please swop that bus for a DD bus so that the most busiest period of time , the DD buses can fetch more passengers. This is a very common problem which SBST fails miserably.<br><br>3. Frequency of bus services is getting worse , as a regular Singapore bus services transit traveller , I find that waiting time for services are getting longer perhaps due to the jam or other reasons. I feel that SBST should send some spare buses to ease the load, for example bus 7 , the spare bus can start from orchard ... instead of clementi .<br><br>If you guys have any ideas, please post here. You never know any representive from the following bus companies are following this forum.</div>

Then I see 9261E (BN 196) on PIE westbound, presumably going to Clementi...might as well make 9261 start at Bedok and 9270 at Clementi. </div></blockquote>Do these buses use PIE? I thought they use AYE because I've seen off-service 196 buses on the Sheares Bridge heading eastwards late at night. Same for Svc 14.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the EZ link part, it was said SGD 300 million was invested. With the farecards, bus companies losed out to SGD 10 million annually. with the EZ link, it may need at least 30 years to break even, and with the high overheads and pre-trials, commuters had got something they had not bargained for.. i believed the rise in afres was partly caused by EZ link, VLS, GPS, and some "special " features of buses like the opened doors locked the bus speed to 5 km/h</div>
