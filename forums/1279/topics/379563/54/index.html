              <p>spotted 5105 + 5107 and 5109 with FULL YOG purple ad today, including FRONT part of buses... the sbstransit/scania wording in the front are also covered by the purple ad (except for the scania logo), including the front bumper as well. first time that the KUB are cover completely with ad including front part.</p>
              <p>seem like 5105-5110 and maybe 5236-5239, 5250-5252 might be used for the YOG shuttles? but no give way sticker on front windscreen though. if this is true, the mercs in AMDEP will survive a few more months... :)</p>

              <p>the redeployment was not posted maybe because even though the redeployment took place already, SBS441L keep appearing on 197 and SBS1912M has not really did 197 even though its perm, appearing as cameo to services like 78 and 79.</p>
