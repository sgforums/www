                              Tiger, Born has come to be known throughout the world as the embodiment
                              of the Classic B-boy with his ninja precise footwork, his comprehensive
                              understanding and interpretation of the breakbeat and the music that
                              became the soundtrack of NYC circa 1980's.  The precision angles and
                              body lines in which he lithely and effortlessly maneuvers his body
                              through is not only supremely mesmerizing but leaves the viewer with a
                              distinct sense of deja vu and a sublime sense of nostalgia as if the
                              spirit of a bygone hip hop era has bewitched the body of this young
                              South Korean.  <br><br>Since 2003 the artist known as Born has begun
                              to compile a vast and impressive resume of wins at international

                              a circular wave of jostling bodies that always seem to form impromptu
                              whenever and wherever the beat takes him.  He is a definite example and

              <p>Hi.. i don't really think L4O and extreme are participating cause extreme did not join in BOTY korea cause 2 of its members are judges while L4O's junior team(Last Mass) lost to Gamblerz crew in either the semi or quarter finals.</p>
              <p>But u can expect many other top crews there.</p>
              <p>Cant wait to take pictures with members of Gamblerz!!!</p>
