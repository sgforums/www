              <p class="Print">Four teachers at a reform school for juvenile delinquents in Hiroshima 
              Prefecture were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of physically abusing students.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="ThmbSet256">
              <div class="BodyTxt">
              <p>One of them is suspected of showering a 17-year-old boy with cold water and 
              forcing him to wear a paper diaper in front of his friends.</p>
              <p>Another allegedly shoved a detergent container into the mouth of a 
              16-year-old boy, saying, "Swallow this and die." A third allegedly hit a 
              17-year-old in the face, kicked him and then caused him to become incontinent by 
              refusing to allow him to use the bathroom.</p>
              <p>The Hiroshima District Public Prosecutors Office arrested the four special 
              public officers on suspicion of resorting to violence and cruelty during the 
              course of their duties.</p>
              <p>The Hiroshima Juvenile Training School is one of a number of institutions for 
              young offenders. During their time in custody, students are supposed to learn 
              how to reform themselves through lifestyle guidance and job training.</p>
              <p>These institutions, where teachers take the place of parents in caring for 
              the young people, are often described as schools for re-education.</p>
              <p>But what allegedly occurred at the training school in Hiroshima had nothing 
              to do with education. The acts perpetrated on the students violated their human 
              dignity.</p>
              <p>When one boy, feeling he could no longer endure repeated violence, said he 
              would be better off dead if force was used all the time, he was cold-bloodedly 
              told by one of the four teachers, "Then, die."</p>
              <p>It is frightening to know that such a person was a teacher.</p>
              <p>The shocking revelations prompted the Justice Ministry to investigate by 
              interviewing all the 102 boys at the school. The inquiry found that about 50 
              boys had endured physical abuse on around 100 occasions during fiscal 2008 
              alone.</p>
              <p>Most of the cases involved the four teachers. But other teachers who looked 
              the other way are also to blame.</p>
              <p>What actually happened in a closed environment where the scrutiny of 
              outsiders was not permitted? We urge prosecutors to conduct an exhaustive 
              investigation to uncover the entire truth.</p>
              <p>A system is in place that allows students at training schools to make 
              complaints about the way they are treated or other matters. This is supposed to 
              be done through a face-to-face chat with the superintendent.</p>
              <p>But not a single interview took place during the past two years.</p>
              <p>Some students said filing a complaint was usually punished by worse treatment 
              and they feared retaliation.</p>
              <p>To prevent a recurrence of this shameful state of affairs, an effective 
              system for independent monitoring must be set up.</p>
              <p>An inspection committee of private-sector monitors was established for each 
              of the nation's prisons and detention facilities when the prison law was revised 
              for the first time in 97 years. The step was taken in response to assaults by 
              guards at the Nagoya Prison in 2002 which left one inmate dead.</p>
              <p>A similar monitoring system should be established for juvenile training 
              schools. Under the system, a request for help from a student should trigger an 
              inquiry by a fact-finding committee independent of the Justice Ministry.</p>
              <p>It is hard not to suspect that the scandal at the Hiroshima school is only 
              the tip of the iceberg. At seven other training schools, like the one in 
              Hiroshima, no student interview with the superintendent was held during the past 
              two years.</p>
              <p>The Justice Ministry is now looking into how students are actually treated at 
              the other 51 training schools nationwide to find out whether there have been 
              similar assaults. The ministry should fully disclose its findings and report any 
              egregious case to public prosecutors.</p>
              <p>Most of the teachers at these facilities must be working eagerly to help 
              students mend their ways. That makes it all the more important to ensure that 
              every possible effort is made to prevent similar abuse.</p>
              <p>The government can take the first step toward restoring public confidence in 
              these facilities by demonstrating a firm commitment to fixing their problems.</p>
