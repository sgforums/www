              incident a by-product of Kyoto's lenient academic culture</span></h1>
              <p class="feature_divider"> </p>
              <div id="article_content">
              <p>On the night of Feb 25, some 95 people attended a pre-graduation “sayonara” 
              party for university seniors at a pub in Kyoto City. At some point in the 
              evening, a co-ed, aged 19 at the time, fell into a semiconscious stupor from 
              overindulgence in alcohol, was escorted into an adjacent room and sexually 
              assaulted by six members of Kyoto University of Education’s American football 
              and soccer teams.</p>
              <p>On June 1—more than three months after the incident—university president 
              Mitsuyo Terada appeared at a press conference to announce that the institution 
              would slap them with an open-ended suspension for having committed “obscene 
              acts.”</p>
              <p>“A university is not an investigating body,” Terada stated somewhat lamely. 
              “The measures we took were intended as corrective in nature.”</p>
              <p>A police source informs Nikkan Gendai (June 3) that it was not until March 27 
              that the woman, described as “unable to hold her liquor,” consulted the police 
              regarding her assault.</p>
              <p>“The six men were arrested on June 1,” the source relates. “Four admitted to 
              going all the way; two insisted they only ‘touched’ the victim but did not rape 
              her.</p>
              <p>Kyoto University of Education is a public institution with roots going back 
              to 1876, when it was founded as a pedagogical school. Its adjusted standard 
              deviation score (class curve) of 53 would place it in the mid-tier in terms of 
              academic standing. According to its English website 
              http://www.kyokyo-u.ac.jp/ehp/english/index.html, 52 foreign students are 
              enrolled.</p>
              <p>“The university is well regarded as an institution that graduates teachers,” 
              remarks Yutaka Doi, a Kyoto-based author. “This city, with a population of 1.47 
              million, is home to 37 universities, of which seven are public. Kyoto University 
              of Education rates in the top segment. But I think this incident ruins whatever 
              image they had as a ‘clean’ school.”</p>
              <p>Four years earlier, Nikkan Gendai recalls, members of the American football 
              club at the elite Kyoto University, a world-famous institution, had been 
              involved in a gang rape.</p>
              <p>With 138,509 university and junior college students—approximately one-tenth 
              of the city’s total population—Kyoto is a said have long enjoyed the status as a 
              “student-friendly” town. But for Kyoto University of Education not to expel the 
              six for committing rape is taking indulgence too far.</p>
              <p>“The problem is that the perpetrators were students in the Faculty of 
              Education,” opines the abovementioned author Doi. “In Kyoto, these students 
              still engage in chug-a-lug contests at parties. Under the pretext of preserving 
              tradition, they think they’re entitled to special privileges, and that they can 
              get away with anything.</p>
              <p>“They’re more overbearing and insolent than students in Tokyo,” Doi adds. “I 
              think it was this kind of smug attitude that led to the rape incident at Kyoto 
              University (in 2005) and this recent one.”</p>
              <p>It would seem, the reporter concludes, that the downside of Kyoto’s convivial 
              climate for students is that it fosters a sense of entitlement that all too 
              often leads to their running amok.</p>
