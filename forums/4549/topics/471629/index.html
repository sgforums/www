              Would like to share and alert all of you here, 
              whose friend/relative/sibling intend to join a Taiwan Co. located at Pasir Ris (UXX), pls consider carefully.
                              I hv joined this Co. 3 weeks and being asked to leave with unclear reason. I was being told that their Manpower Plan is changed and therefore my headcount will be transfered to another section. That's ridiculous!! How can manpower plan change in juz 3 weeks? And, how can a well established Co. hire ppl without proper planning? Really no standard.
                              I did confront my manager, does my bad performance lead to this termination? She said NO. I was like being played around and they owe me a good reason. Additionally, most of the PRC and Taiwanese there are quite rude. Any good idea that can let the Co. compensate me with salary in lieu instead of notice in lieu?

              <p>hi.....think i worked there long ago as one of the many contractors.i noticed from others rumored that they often do last minute changes.and one of them  taiwanese instructors was very nasty to my malaysian senior project manager by yelling at him in front of all the other contractors asnd his men........took him like 1 month to get over the incident .........why???because he was late.i never got any flak from them.....the taiwanese seem to be afraid of me.dunno why..............</p>
              <p>think u could get help from ministry of manpower or perhaps go apply at other better and more human workplaces.chances are that if u joined in longer...they would do the same thing again years later n say they dont need any more people after u worked for them for many years.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>junk the company if it sounds so bad.</p>

              You were a new staff there so not much you can do....read what your appointment letter agreement stated. Unless you are prepared to sue them and make them pay you the lost of income and time with your former company?

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not possible to sue the Co. as the letter of appointment stated clearly that each party may terminate the agreement by giving notice/salary in lieu. I am thinking to file a complaint to MOM. Shouldn't juz let them anyhow ask employee to leave n making us loose our income and time, as what Zul mentioned.</div>
