            <div class='col-md body'>open minded means being able to rethink if some of the old ideas u have are actually wrong. It does not mean acceptance without reason.

Like being gay for example.<br><br>An example of this would be: Someone's mother got upset when he told her he's gay.

One held by the NHS. National Health Service of the United Kingdom. The psychologist brought happiness to the family. How is he nuts? I think you're nuts because you're the one who wants to destroy families. U want families to end up unhappy. People are born gay, nobody wants to be gay. So how can any normal family not accpet gays? Only if they want to be unhappy. Be unhappy over something they have no control of. How smart is that. How sane is that. A psychologist has to be crazy to make a family end up unhappy. To begin with, no child is disobeying his parents by being gay. Its like u're saying a child born blind is also disobeying his parents by not being 'normal'. How the hell are u going to help being something u're born?<br><br>How about this: If someone is straight but don't want kids anyway? Then what?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a mother learns more about homosexuality and accepts her son, and the whole family is happy. How is that bad as opposed to a family who refuses to be open minded and end up making everyone miserable?<br><br>How is helping the family to be happy, how is keeping the family together considered crazy? considered wrong?<br><br>How is teaching a family to remain narrow minded and thus be in misery be considered 'right'?<br><br>Do tell.<br><br>i think the point i've made is very clear here. Everything else John the Baptist says or anyone else tries to say, won't change a thing. The fact is, They're hoping other families will be miserable because they cannot accept certain things and they hope others won't accept it too, even at the expense of the misery of others. That is plain selfish.<br><br>They expect gay people not to be gay, like they expect chinese people not to be chinese. They expect that gay people should live in denial, and never be as close as they can to their families because they are in denial. They expect gay people to be miserable because they themselves cannot accept that homosexuality is natural. Dare I say it perhaps, that they can't accept that homosexuality is natural because if they do, they have to accept that their homosexual feelings deep down, are natural, which means they're gays? U'll never know. Many of these most anti-gay of people are closet gays in deep denial. Not all are, but many are.</div>

Stealing is less clear cut, because kleptomaniacs exist. But to steal is to take that which belongs to others. That hurts others.<br><br>To be gay hurts no one in that absolute sense. U might hurt your family but then, I see cases of people who convert to other religions against their family's wishes, such as someone who becomes a Christian against his taoist family's wishes and end up hurting his family. I don't see the hypocritical Christians speak up against that and say it's wrong do I?<br><br>As for adultery, same as stealing, it hurts others in the absolute sense.<br><br>Unlike alcohol, u don't have to be introduced to a gay lifestyle to know u are gay. Many friends of mine have know since they were young, some as early as when they were 3, that they have no interest in the opposite sex. Whereas u don't see people who have a weakness for alcohol know since young they want alcohol because they don't know what alcohol is. There's that distinct difference about what is biological and what is not.</div>
