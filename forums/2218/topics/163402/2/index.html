One held by the NHS. National Health Service of the United Kingdom. The psychologist brought happiness to the family. How is he nuts? I think you're nuts because you're the one who wants to destroy families. U want families to end up unhappy. People are born gay, nobody wants to be gay. So how can any normal family not accpet gays? Only if they want to be unhappy. Be unhappy over something they have no control of. How smart is that. How sane is that. A psychologist has to be crazy to make a family end up unhappy. To begin with, no child is disobeying his parents by being gay. Its like u're saying a child born blind is also disobeying his parents by not being 'normal'. How the hell are u going to help being something u're born?<br><br>How about this: If someone is straight but don't want kids anyway? Then what?</div></blockquote>How do u know your parents are not unhappy? Can't u see they are also struggling hard or u come from rich family is it? Just to get back at them is it? I have been like this before much younger &amp; i was wrong. I also nearly committed suicide. Pls think again. God is calling you to Himself as He called me. The devil is at work to destroy young lives &amp; satanists collude with him. He is an evil master &amp; pls don't believe him.<br><br>Have you considered prayers &amp; treatment &amp; further counselling? Why can't u be like that then? Straight but no kids?</div>

They just are.<br><br>Prayers? YEa I do pray. I pray for people like you to stop making other's lives miserable. I pray for people like you to stop destroying families with your out-dated ideas. I pray a lot alright. I never said I was gay either. Im using my friend as an example, u ninny.

Everything else John the Baptist says or anyone else tries to say, won't change a thing. The fact is, They're hoping other families will be miserable because they cannot accept certain things and they hope others won't accept it too, even at the expense of the misery of others. That is plain selfish.<br><br>They expect gay people not to be gay, like they expect chinese people not to be chinese. They expect that gay people should live in denial, and never be as close as they can to their families because they are in denial. They expect gay people to be miserable because they themselves cannot accept that homosexuality is natural. Dare I say it perhaps, that they can't accept that homosexuality is natural because if they do, they have to accept that their homosexual feelings deep down, are natural, which means they're gays? U'll never know. Many of these most anti-gay of people are closet gays in deep denial. Not all are, but many are.</div></blockquote>Why u want a confrontation with your parents? Attention seeking?

I clashed with them over which JC i should go to, to give u an example of the things we clashed over. In the end I gave in to them, I ended up being unhappy, they ended up being unhappy because I was unhappy. See how it works? Sometimes U clash once, everyone let it be known what their opinions are like, and if they learn to be more open-minded about the choices u make, everyone ends up happier.<br><br>FYI my parents pay me attention. U just seem to have a lot of pre-conceived notions of me, which u're trying to squeeze me into. Im sorry but u're wrong on every count about me.

That is why most gay people stay in denial.<br><br>Personally I've had more than my fair share of confrontations with my parents b4, over other issues. I'm not seeking attention. Its just that my views and theirs don't match. We clash over issues and what do u want me to do? Lie to myself, to pretend I see things the way they do? I clashed with them over which JC i should go to, to give u an example of the things we clashed over. In the end I gave in to them, I ended up being unhappy, they ended up being unhappy because I was unhappy. See how it works? Sometimes U clash once, everyone let it be known what their opinions are like, and if they learn to be more open-minded about the choices u make, everyone ends up happier.<br><br>FYI my parents pay me attention. U just seem to have a lot of pre-conceived notions of me, which u're trying to squeeze me into. Im sorry but u're wrong on every count about me. That shows how much u cannot see, due to your narrow mindedness.</div></blockquote>I apologise. Sorry.</div>
