            <div class='col-md body'>You have this friend since elementary and after college the both of you lost contact with each other. But she is someone really special to you, and you are someone very special to her too.<br><br>Five years later you receive a phone call from her.<br>"Hi, I'll visit you" she says.<br><br>"Hi, Leah, when?" you ask her.<br><br>"Just wait for me" she replies.<br><br>It seems weird but you prepare for her coming anyway.<br><br>One rainy night you hear a knock on the door. And you're surprised to see that it's your friend Leah. Losing touch for five years is so long and you start talking about everything.<br><br>The both of you even go to your room upstairs. Suddenly there is<br>a power outage, but the two of you continue talking by<br>candle-light.<br><br>Then the phone rings.<br>"I'll just get the phone downstairs," you say.<br>"No, don't get it, we're in the middle of our talk," she says.<br>"It might be important," you say. "Okay if you say so, but promise<br>me you'll be back," she says.<br><br>You promise her a million times that you'll be back.<br><br>Then you run downstairs to answer the phone.<br><br>"Hello," you say.<br><br>"Hello," says the person on the line.<br><br>"Yeah?" you say, wondering who it is.<br><br>"I'm calling on behalf of Leah's family. They had an accident and her parents are in the hospital right now," he says.<br><br>"How are they?" you ask.<br><br>He continues, "They are injured but stable. But I'm sorry to say that Leah died. We found your name and phone number in Leah's purse..."<br><br>His voice trails off as you look up at the long stairs.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>WOULD YOU GO BACK AS YOU HAVE PROMISED?</strong></span></div>
