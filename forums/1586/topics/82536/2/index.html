            <div class='col-md body'><strong>E-MAIL space war </strong><br><br>Google Gmail's 1GB free storage offer has Yahoo! scrambling to do better<br><br>IT IS hot out in cyberspace as two competing Internet giants slug it out in a battle of services.<br><br>Two months after Yahoo! dropped Google as its search provider for United States-based sites and launched its own technology, the latter announced it was testing a preview version of Gmail, a free web-based e-mail service and in direct competition with Yahoo! Mail.<br><br>Yahoo!, once the leading search engine till Google appeared on the scene, had been licensing search technology from Google since 1999.<br><br>Gmail dangled a luscious carrot. It was the first in the industry to offer 1GB, or 1,000MB, worth of free storage space - 250 times more than what the leading free e-mail providers, Yahoo! and Hotmail, were providing.<br><br>In what appears to be a retaliatory strike, Yahoo! is upgrading the storage space for its free e-mail accounts from 4MB or 6MB to 100MB.<br><br>It also underwent a facelift, with new features such as a search bar that allows users to locate e-mail easily. This feature is also found in Gmail.<br><br>Users who pay US$19.99 (S$34) a year for the premium Yahoo! Mail Plus will get 2GB worth of space.<br><br>Mr Nitin Bhat, director for telecommunications research at consultancy Frost &amp; Sullivan, told The Sunday Times that the face-off was probably a battle for advertisers.<br><br>'When you have a large customer database, you can segment them and offer them to the right kind of advertisers,' he said.<br><br>The general manager for Yahoo! Singapore and South-east Asia, Mr Niren Hiro, said the upgrade was part of its 'ongoing strategy to compete effectively'.<br><br>Gmail accounts are now given out only by invitation. But it has become such a hot commodity that more than 4,500 of the free accounts are up for sale at eBay. A bidder paid US$63 for one such account last month.<br><br>Assuming your average length e-mail, without attachments, takes up 2kb of space, Gmail can store 500,000 pages of e-mail and Yahoo!, 50,000.<br><br>But this is not enough to entice local undergraduate Hairul Naim, who thinks the extra space will just result in more spam and junk mail.<br><br>According to Mr Bhat, spam and junk mail will not be a problem if companies put in place filters and software to protect users.<br><br>But there are privacy issues.<br><br>Gmail has come under fire because it intends to scan users' e-mail electronically in order to match them to text advertisements.<br><br>Responses from the World Privacy Forum and dozens of other civil liberties organisations indicate a general worry that this will lead to further compromises with privacy.<br><br>Google's response is that the scanning is used only to deliver targeted ads, and that all major e-mail services automatically scan e-mail content for the benefit of users.<br><br>Mr Hiro declined to comment on the Google privacy controversy, saying only that Yahoo! would not be doing the same thing.<br><br>Meanwhile, another e-mail provider is preparing to make its move. Hotmail, a service by Microsoft's Internet unit, MSN, offers 2MB of free storage, or 100MB if users pay US$59.95 a year.<br><br>When asked if Hotmail's popularity would be threatened by such competition, MSN South-east Asia head of business development and marketing, Mr Vincent Sim, said it was unlikely.<br><br>He did, however, say that Hotmail was always looking to improve its service, and that 'there will be an announcement coming soon'.<br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">taken from STI</span></span></div>
