            <div class='col-md body'>Joke for 13 Jun 2004:<br><br>A man went to the Doctor and the doctor told him he had only<br>24 hours to live. He goes home to tell his wife and after they<br>both had a long cry over it, he askED her if  she would have<br>sex with him because he only had 24 hours to live.<br><br>"Of course Darling." she replied. And so they have sex.<br><br>Four hours later they are lying in bed and he turns to her<br>again, and says, "you know I only have 20 hours to live, do you<br>think we could do it again?"<br><br>Again she responds very sympathetically and agrees to have<br>sex.<br><br>Another 8 hours pass, and she had fallen asleep from<br>exhaustion,  he taps her on the shoulder, and asks her again,<br>"You know dear, I only have 12 more hours left, how about<br>again for old times sake?"<br><br>By this time she is getting a little annoyed, but reluctantly<br>agrees.<br><br>After they finish she goes back to sleep and 4 hours later,<br>he taps her on the shoulder again and says, "Dear, I hate to<br>keep bothering you but you know I only have 8 hours left<br>before I die, can we do it one more time?"<br><br>Well, she turns to him with a grimaced look on her face and<br>says, "You know..  you don't have to get up in the morning.  I<br>do!!!"<br></div>

Buddy<br>didn't move.<br><br>Then the farmer hollered, "Pull, Buster, pull!" Buddy didn't respond.<br><br>Once more the farmer commanded, "Pull, Croco, pull!"

            <div class='col-md body'>A GREAT idea!!!!!!!!<br><br>THE SPOON:   (A timeless lesson on how consultants can make a difference for an organization.)<br><br>Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant and noticed that  the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket.  It seemed a little strange.  When the busboy brought our water and utensils, I noticed that he, too, had a spoon in his shirt pocket.  Then I looked around and saw that all<br>the staff had spoons in their pockets. When the waiter came back to serve our soup, I asked:<br><br>"Why the spoon?"<br>"Well, he explained, "the restaurant's owners hired a consulting firm to  revamp all of our processes.  After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil.  It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."<br><br>As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon after enjoying my soup, and, yes, he was able to replace it with his spare.  "I'll get another spoon the next time I go into the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."  I was impressed.<br>I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly..<br>Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies.  So, before he walked off, I asked our waiter:  "Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that<br>string right there?"<br><br>"Oh, certainly!"  Then he lowered his voice.  "Not everyone is so<br>observant.  That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom.  By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%."  "After you get it out," I inquired, "how do you put it back?"<br><br>"Well," he whispered, "I don't know about the others, but I use the<br>spoon."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day, Mr. Caterpillar decided to hitch a ride to town. As he was standing by the roadside, a family of bees came by in a little car and offered him a ride<br><br>Gratefully, he accepted. After putting along merrily for a few kilometers, the engine sputtered and the car rolled to a halt. Without saying a word, Papa Bee alighted and urinated into the fuel intake. When he turned the starter, the engine started up, much to Mr Caterpillar's amazement!<br><br>However, he did not say a word. The car went on for quite some distance before the engine died again. This time, it was Mother Bee who urinated into the fuel intake, and again, the car started up after that. The process was then repeated again for Baby Bee.<br><br>By the time the engine died for the fourth time, the little car was only a few kilometers from town. Not wanting to appear unsophisticated, Mr Caterpillar got out of the car without a word, and started opening the fuel cap.<br><br>In a flash, Papa Bee got out of the car. "What are you doing?" asked Papa Bee.<br><br>"I'm going to piss in the fuel intake, just like you did", said Mr Caterpillar.<br><br>"Oh, no", said Papa Bee patiently, "that won't do. This car only runs on Bee Pee (BP)."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An old man was sitting on a bench at the mall. A young punk walked up to the bench and sat down. He had spiked hair in all different colors: green, red, orange, blue and yellow. The old man just stared. Every time the punk looked, the old man was staring at him.<br><br>The punk finally said sarcastically, "What's the matter, old timer? Never done anything wild in your life?" Without batting an eye, the old man replied, "Got drunk once and had sex with a peacock. I was just wondering if you were my son."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
