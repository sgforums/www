              Redefining JB's central business district 
                  
              ICONIC LANDMARK:Komtar JBCC will have a 37,626sq m hopping mall and two high-rise office towers 
                  
              JOHOR BARU: THE Komtar Johor Baru City Centre (JBCC) project will help to redefine and rejuvenate the city's central business district when it is completed next May.
                   
              The project, undertaken by Johor Corp (JCorp) through its subsidiary, Damansara Assets Sdn Bhd, involves the refurbishment of the Tun Abd Razak Complex, which is popularly known as Komtar.
                   
              JCorp president and chief executive Datuk Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim said there would be a 37,626sq m shopping mall and two high-rise office towers -- the renovated Menara Komtar and the new Johor Land Tower at Komtar JBCC.
                   
              "There will also be a new 190-room four-star hotel," said Kamaruzzaman.
                   
              He said Komtar JBCC aimed to reclaim its status as an iconic landmark in the heart of the city as the premier shopping, lifestyle, dining and entertainment destination.
                   
              Companies that have been confirmed as tenants of Komtar JBCC include Metrojaya, which will be an anchor tenant, Royal Selangor Pewter and Tony Roma's.
                   
              "Komtar JBCC will have direct pedestrian links to the Sultan Iskandar Building, Johor Baru City Square and Persada International Convention Centre.
                   
              "In the long run, Komtar JBCC will help to revitalise downtown Johor Baru and contribute to the growth of the local economy," he said.
                   
              Kamaruzzaman said this at a briefing on the project and the signing of a licensing agreement between Damansara Assets Sdn Bhd and Rovio Entertainment Ltd, the creator of Angry Birds which will result in the opening of the Angry Birds Activity Park at the centre.
                   
              The 2,416sq m park, which is based on the popular video game, is the first such park to be opened by the Finnish company in Southeast Asia.
                   
              "Our goal is to delight fans, both adults and children, and create an exciting experience for the whole family," said Rovio Entertainment chief operations officer Harri Koponen.

              YACHT OWNERS
                  
              Johor Bahru is accessible for yachts whose height of mast is less than 25 meters from waterline. Sail 13 miles up the western arm of Jahor Straits, past Raffles Marina and under the centre span of the Tuas Bridge, (the "Second-Link" bridge), which has a minimum vertical clearance of 25 meters at HWS. Proceed upstream, staying away from the Singapore coast and keeping close to the Malaysian mainland all the way.
                  
              All yachts requiring clearance here must ensure they fly the Q flag, otherwise they may be fined.
                  
              Yachts coming from Sebana and other ports in Malaysia also have to do harbour clearance here.
                  
              Clearance can be completed at Puteri Harbour, but still not possible at Danga Bay marina itself, however, the marina will arrange for free transport to the apropriate offices and facilitate clearance.
                  
              Immigration is at the causeway and the Harbour Master (in Jabatan Laut), 1km along the waterfront from the anchorage, towards the causeway, as is the Customs office.
                  
              Customs is only required for outward clearance and issue of Port Clearance after clearing out with the Harbour Master.
                  
              Immigration outward clearance is not required if stopping at further Malaysian ports. Passports receive a new entry stamp, which is good for three months stay in Malaysia, each time you return across the causeway from Singapore.
                  
              Last checked February 2012.
                  
              ANCHORING 
                  
              Anchor close to the causeway but on the Malaysian side. There is plenty of room between the Customs wharf and the causeway and the holding is good.
                  
              There is no charge and the boats seem to be safe here with no thefts reported so far. The dinghy can be tied up at the Customs pontoon and left for days whilst you go into Singapore etc.
                  
              Visitors from yachts are advised to wear shirts when walking through the Customs base and to wait while the men are on morning parade and prayers - or at least walk discreetly at the rear of the parade. This is of concern to the Commandant at times. This is a free and secure mooring and it would be a shame if it were to be discontinued because of the annoyance caused by a few.
                  
              Yachts can also anchor in 4.0 to 7.0 meters with excellent holding in mud/clay at Lat 01.28.47N and Long.103.43.37E just off Danga Bay Marina for free. A member of the marine staff will come out in a dinghy to welcome you and give you a choice of the best places to anchor. A floating pontoon dinghy dock is directly in front of the anchorage and has 24/7 security. Free water is also available at the dinghy dock for either jerry cans, or yachts can come alongside for water by prior arrangement.
                  
              In addition there are three yellow buoys for mooring by yachts. Although is is not clear how much has changed since the marina has been built here. Close by are shops, restaurant, a reasonable supermarket, internet access and a laundry.
                  
              MARINAS
                  
              Danga Bay Marina, previously an entertainment centre, is now under new management and much improved. It is situated 5km by road from the centre of Johor Bahru and the causeway to Singapore. Buses to and from Johor Bahru stop right outside the complex every few minutes. You need to have the exact bus fare of RM1.10. Taxis also pass by regularly (marina information updated September 2013).
                  
              A new marina, Puteri Harbour, opened on 15th January 2009, and is situated 30 minutes away from Johor Bahru. Clearance formalities can all be completed at Puteri Harbour.
                  
              CRIME
                  
              Penang and JB are reported to be the worst areas for crime in Malaysia. Take necessary precautions when going ashore and if cycling, be sure to cover baskets/crates to avoid bags being snatched.

              Tel: +607-221 5688 Fax: +607-221 5688 ,VHF Channel 74

              Danga Bay Marina is located just after a floating fish farm on your left, with several large fisherman houses on stilts on the right. From the entrance you can also see the distinctive roof line of the complex and four 14 storey apartment blocks which are part of the Danga Bay development. The marina entrance has now changed significantly as the entrance channel is being dredged. 
                  
              Probably the best approach is to the west of the dredgers. DON'T go between them and the reclaimed land as before, as they are tied to steel drums attached to the shore. Keep 100 metres to the west in 2 metres of water. Because of dredging operations it may be necessary for your boat to be moved. Call on 74 on approach for advice on where to berth. If no answer, anchor off and dinghy in.
                  
              There is usually plenty of empty berths. Toilets above the office with 1 shower in the ladies toilet. Berthing is 100Rm a week plus power. 50Rm a week extra if you leave the vessel unoccupied. Water is currently free (requires filtering and/or treatment to be potable) as is Wi-Fi.
                  
              Staff very helpful but VHF not always monitored, so best contacted by phone. Very handy for supplies.
                  
              Marina will arrange free transport to facilitate clearance. They also arrange fuel &amp; gas runs twice a week. Laundry drop off close by. Currenly (Feb 2013) there is a daily shuttle bus sevice to to Danga City Mall at 10am.

              Y Adventures Batu Maloi - 19 Oct 2013 (FULL)
              
              Located in Tampin Forest Reserve, sandwiched between Negeri Sembilan and Malacca, Batu Maloi Cave provides an extraordinary experience which is relatively unknown and less commercialized. Batu Maloi Cave is a nature site, formed not through erosion or by tectonic plate movements. It is actually a stack of huge, granite boulders with a clear stream flowing through; the â€œcaveâ€� is made up of openings and passages in between the boulders.
              
              To navigate through the 1 km narrow cave passage, participants will need to climb, squeeze, crawl and even wriggle their bodies through. During the exploration, participants will get to experience natural Jacuzzis and be immersed in â€œindoor poolsâ€� found within the cave.
