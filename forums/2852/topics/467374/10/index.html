              <p>Hi all, </p>
              <p>Am new to the thread. Read about the inconvenience expressed about living in JB and working in SG. Have been doing a bit of research on this. Wanted to share my thoughts for discussion.</p>
              <p>Actually with the shuttle tebrau (KTM trains) now running between JB Sentral and Woodlands train checkpoint, I think it is now a lot easier for commuting. It runs regularly in the morning and evening peak periods. Cost SGD 5 coming from SG and RM 5 from JB Sentral.  The train ride takes 5 mins to cross the causeway and tickets can be booked online to secure a seat.  And immigration clearance is done only once.</p>
              <p>Considering that a rental of a 3 bedroom HDB in Marsiling near the woodlands train checkpoint  will set you back by about SGD 2.2K while an equivalent 3 bedroom in JB is only about SGD 900 to 1 K.  I think it makes living near JB Sentral a much more attractive proposition. Able to save about SGD 1K per month with about 10-20 mins longer in commute each way.</p>
              <p>Any thoughts?</p>

              They should make that train to run to and fro between JB CIQ Checkpoint and Singapore Woodlands Checkpoint every hour like a shuttle train. That would really help to lessen the congestion at the causeway.

              MALAYSIA AUTOMATED CLEARANCE SYSTEM (MACS)
              
              Malaysiaâ€™s fast track clearance pass, MACS, can now be processed in Singapore
              
              Â· MACS branch counter opens in Singapore offering additional service for greater convenience to motorists
              
              Â· Dedicated pedestrian lanes at checkpoints for expediency
              
              Â· To apply, Singapore passport must be valid for two years before expiry
              
              A new streamlined experience will avail greater convenience and save time for Singaporean motorists and pedestrians seeking to apply the MACS (Malaysia Automated Clearance System) pass that allow smoother auto-gate processing at the Malaysian checkpoints.
              
              Third Link Pte Ltd, a vendor appointed by the Malaysian immigration authorities, has set up an additional branch counter in Singapore to ease the process of application for the MACS pass.
              
              Previously, applicants would have to go to the MACS service counters at the Causeway or Second link checkpoints to apply. This has proven to be a minor inconvenience as the designated parking areas in the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex (CIQ) complexes are limited. Moreover, first time applicants coming by car may not be familiar with the location.
              
              The new MACS branch counter in Singapore will process all ordinary Singapore passport applications for a fee of SGD$35, renewable annually. The fee (SGD$15.00) is a charge levied by the Malaysia Government for a successful application. If the application is rejected, the fee will be refunded to the applicant. However, the Service Fee (SGD$20.00 inclusive of GST) levied by Third Link for services rendered is non-refundable.
              
              Applicants must submit their passport by 2 p.m. from Mondays to Fridays. Once submitted, it will be ready for collection the next day by 7 p.m. An application made after 2 p.m. will be considered a next day application, hence the passport will be return after 2 working days.
              
              The applicantâ€™s Singapore passport must be valid for two years before expiry. The pass, with embedded RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) chip, is scanned upon entry and departure.
              
              Dedicated MACS lanes for motorists continue to be available to Singaporeans at Bangunan Sultan Iskandar in Johor Bahru and Kompleks Sultan Abu Bakar in Tanjung Kupang respectively. The MACS system allows Singaporeans to enjoy fast track entry though these Malaysian checkpoints without having their passport stamped.
              
              A fast-track auto-gate lane has also been dedicated at both checkpoints for pedestrian expediency.
              
              The MACS pass does not act as an immigration pass or visa. Non-Singapore passport holders are eligible to apply for the MACS pass but they are required to obtain a visa (if applicable).
              
              Non Singaporean or Singapore Permanent Resident must possess a valid pass (holder of long term visit pass or work permit) issued by either the Malaysian Government or the Singapore Government. The pass must be valid at least 9 months before expiry.
              
              NOTE : The following countries are not eligible to apply for the MACS pass: Columbia, Afghanistan, Israel,all African countries

              In the past, when MACS PASS was processed by Malaysia Immigration at CIQ at Johor Bahru, in the arrival section of the CIQ building, just next to the escalator (which is going up to the arrival immigration counter from the bus bay arriving from Singapore), you only pay RM30 for one year. But now you pay in Singapore dollars and you have to leave your passport for one day and collect it the next day. In the past you could have the MACS Pass done within minutes and made the payment.

              <p>If you want to eat KFC with a nice view of Singapore across the Johor Straits, I recommend you go to KFC outlet at Stulang Laut. Not far from Johor Bahru Immigration Checkpoint. Go there to eat and relax in the evening, its much nicer. I've been there myself many times too.</p>

              <p>I have been driving to JB for years.</p>
              <p>JB is not as safe as Singapore. It is a fact. But if you are careful and wise, you can prevent yourself from being a victim of crime. However i must qualify, sometimes if u really suay, in Singapore also can get robbed what. </p>
              <p>I usually go JB when there is daylight. I return to Singapore before midnight. I only go to crowded places like JB city square, Jusco/Tesco Tebrau City or KSL. When you pump petrol, go to those near the Tuas customs or JB customs.</p>
              <p>Try to go in a group, don't drive like mad man. Don't draw attention to yourself by wearing alot of jewellery or flaunt your smartphone everywhere you walk. Don't go to dark alleys. To prevent yourself from getting lost and going to undesirable places, please borrow or buy an updated GPS. Make sure your tires are pumped to right PSI. Fill the radiator and engine oil. Reduce your chances of breakdown etc. </p>
              <p>PLEASE OBSERVE RIGHT LANE RULES! If you not sure of the roads or not confident to drive fast, drive in middle lane. Remember, Malaysia is not your home, observe ppl's rules. Small roads about 80km/h above. Inner city highways right lane, ppl usually drive 100km/h above. Highway right lane is 130km/h and above. Sometimes people do drive 200km/h, if you see them highbeam from far, please siam. Don't guai lan because if they can't stop in time, you also die. Always check your rear view mirror every few minutes.</p>
              <p>Basically, go there. Spend your money and eat happily. Don't draw attention, don't piss people off.</p>

              AIRASIA ADDS NEW ROUTE FROM JOHOR BAHRU TO GUANGZHOU
              on: April 17, 2016In: Business
              
              JOHOR BAHRU â€“ AirAsia is poised to make Johor Bahru the gateway for Chinese travellers to visit Southern Peninsular Malaysia with the introduction of AirAsiaâ€™s new direct flight to Guangzhou, which is scheduled to commence operations on May 29.
              
              The daily flights connecting Johor Bahru and Guangzhou will be the airlineâ€™s 17th route into China from Malaysia, and the second route into China launched this year after Shantou.
              
              Celebratory all-in-fares from as low as RM88* one way are available for booking online at airasia.com from yesterday until April 28, for the travel period of May 29 to Oct 29.
              
              â€œAlternatively, the promotional fares are also available on AirAsiaâ€™s mobile app on iPhone and Android devices, as well as the mobile site mobile.airasia.com.
              
              Spencer Lee, AirAsia Berhad Head of Commercial said, â€œOur southern hub of Johor Bahru is one of the key development points for us this year, and we are pleased to be connecting the rapidly developing Johor Bahru to Guangzhou, China through this unique route that will be operated exclusively by AirAsia.
              
              â€œThis will further increase our market share in Johor Bahru, and we look forward to working closely with all key industry players here to grow Johor Bahru together.â€�
              
              Md Derick Basir, CEO of Senai Airport Terminal Services Sdn Bhd said, â€œSenai Airport is delighted to introduce the new route to China by AirAsia. With the ongoing development in Iskandar Malaysia, there has been a lot of demand for air travel between Johor and certain parts of China. As such, we believe that the new Johor Bahru â€“ Guangzhou route introduced by AirAsia will be a success.
              
              â€œWe have been exploring on the possibility of starting a Johor Bahru â€“ China route with a few parties and AirAsia was the first airline to act on the opportunity. This demonstrates AirAsiaâ€™s seriousness and commitment to further develop Senai Airport as their secondary hub, after KLIA2. Now, the people of Johor can travel to China more conveniently compared to before. Previously, they had to travel to KLIA2 to take a flight to China. With the new daily flights between Johor and Guangzhou by AirAsia, Johoreans need not to do so anymore.â€�
              
              YB Datuk Tee Siew Kiong Johor State EXCO of Tourism, Trade and Consumer? said, â€œ?The state government welcomes AirAsiaâ€™s decision to launch this new route connecting Guangzhou to Johor Bahru.
              
              â€œWe believe that this is definitely the right time as we have seen an increase in tourists, business travellers and investors from China especially from Guangzhou into Johor Bahru lately. This initiative brings both cities closer, and will help to boost the cooperation between Johor Bahru and Guangzhou especially in tourism, trade and investment. Furthermore, the e-visa entry which was implemented by the government last March has made it much more convenient for Chinese visitors to enter Malaysia,â€� added YB Datuk.
              
              AirAsia Group currently operates 139 weekly flights into of Johor Bahruâ€™s Senai International Airport, inclusive of both domestic and international flights.
              
              Formerly known as Canton, Guangzhou is a sprawling port city located at northwest of Hong Kong on the Pearl River. This capital city of Guangdong Province is a prosperous metropolis that is the third biggest after Beijing and Shanghai.
              
              Tourists to Guangzhou must not miss the breathtaking night city view walking along the Pearl River bank, go to the top of the Canton Tower to enjoy a birds-eye view of the city, visit the historical Temple of the Six Banyan Trees and many more.

              Yes, you're right Istari. Now there are so many Police's road blocks, especially in the night. You can see many police cars patrolling in the housing estates, on the main roads, kampung roads and highways. Good job JB police!

              <p>I'm not sure. I did ask the main agent in Singapore about it whether we could have that MACS done in JB besides in Singapore. He said, "NO" accept in SIngapore.  </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Yes, it is inconvenient for Singaporeans staying in JB to have it done in Singapore because it would take almost 2 days to have it approved e.g. Monday morning at 8 am before 2 pm you submit your application and you can only collect it on Tuesday at 7 pm. You need to stay in Singapore for 1 night. If submit your application on Monday or weekdays (Monday to Thursday) after 2 pm then you can only collect it on Wednesday at 7 pm or the day after tomorrow (3 days). If you submit on Friday then you can only collect it on Monday or Tuesday evening.</span></p>
              <p>Well, I did ask the JB immigration officer why they outsource the MACS service to an agent in Singapore. He said that there were many complains from Singaporeans when their MACS office at the arrival hall of CIQ JB Immigration. He said many Singaporeans complained it was inconvenient for them, especially by those Singaporeans who are living in JB but driving in instead of taking public transports. And the complains were also by those Singaporeans (without own vehicles or taking public transport) who were only visiting JB occasionally for leisure.</p>
              <p>Well, you know and I know Singaporeans like to complain...sigh! Hehe. This caused the MACS to be outsourced and caused the inconvenient for those Singaporeans like you and I, that are living in JB.</p>
