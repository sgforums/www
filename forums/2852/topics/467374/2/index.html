              Oh I'm sorry to hear about your father. Yes, I understand. Same like my case, the property at Taman Sri Putri, was bought in 1992 and it was only a weekend house too. It is an international lot for foreigners to purchase. I never thought I day I would actually go into semi-retirement and into full retirement in the near future in JB. When I think about it, it was actually a good and lucky move to buy it looking at the current quota for foreigners to purchase private property now. Back then, there wasn't any quota. Then in 1994, my brother and his wife stayed there after they sold their HDB flat in 1994 I think. I only shifted there permanently in 2005 during the time when Singapore economy was still recovering from the 2004 recession. I decided to shift there because I see it was the best solution for me in regards to dollars and cents. And I see it too as a good place for my future retirement and furthermore its not far from Singapore. We can still receives Singapore TV and Radio broadcast...so it is still like living in Singapore in a way but in a conducive environment, slower pace, more spacious and the cost of living is much cheaper than Singapore. Yes I agree with you, having a property in JB is good because its freehold.

              Initially, I depended alot on own transportation. I was driving a Malaysian registered car and I would park the car for free at any area in JB. However, later on I decided to purchase season parking in Plaza Seni in JB near the JB checkpoint because for security and my own safety. After parking my car, I would then commute in and out of JB and Singapore by public buses. I find it faster for buses to reach JB because the bus lanes to JB is quite clear of other vehicles in comparison to car lane. I used to commute in and out of JB and Singapore by KTM train too in the past when the railway station at Tanjong Pagar was still open and run by KTM. Its even easier and cheaper to travel by that means in the past...it only cost me only RM123 for a to and fro season pass a month. I would travel by KTM train all the way to Tanjung Pagar Railway Station and go to my workplace from there. So before KTM train closed its operation at Tanjung Pagar Railway Station, I managed to ride the KTM train for the last time and it was a historical train journey for me. Well, now I don't depend on my car to commute to JB eversince it brokedown three years ago. Intially, I felt like patah kaki or broken legs for not having my own car. I started and learned to take public buses from Skudai to JB and then to Singapore and vise versa going home to Skudai. I need to walkout to the mainroad at Skudai which will take me about 15 to 20 minutes walk and at the mainroad there are many buses for me to take to JB. In the past, when I was still working full time in Singapore, it would take me about 2.5 hours to reach my workplace. Now, eversince I go into semi-retirement and do part time work in Singapore, I don't travel much to Singapore and I don't have to rush. I take my time. I'm much more relax and happier now. About applying Malaysian citizen probably not but PR I don't mind. Its better to hold a Singapore passport because you can travel to most countries without a visa.

              <p>SHE was alone in her home and had left the door unlocked.</p>
              <p>   An intruder entered and allegedly threatened the 26-year-old teacher with a knife.</p>
              <p>   The man threatened to rape and stab her if she screamed, The New Straits Times reported.</p>
              <p>   The incident happened on Tuesday night at her home in Taman Skudai Baru in Johor Baru, the report said.</p>
              <p>   The intruder then proceeded to molest the victim before forcing her to undress.</p>
              <p>   Fearing for her life, she stripped.</p>
              <p>   The suspect took a smartphone, a laptop and RM150(S$60) before fleeing.</p>
              <p>   The victim, who did not suffer injuries, lodged a police report.</p>
              <p>   Johor Baru Utara police chief Assistant Commissioner of Police Ruslan Hassan said the police have launched an operation to nab the suspect.</p>
              <p>   He told The Star: "Initial investigation revealed that the suspect was believed to have acted alone during the robbery and molest incident."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>   ACP Ruslan said that most of the suspects were detained after they were tested positive for drugs. They had also been carrying prohibited items such as knives.</p>
              <p>   He urged the public to be vigilant and to contact the nearest police station if they saw suspicious strangers in their area.</p>
              <p>   Meanwhile, a taxi driver was jailed a total of 22 years and given 10 strokes of the cane after pleading guilty to robbing four women in January, The Star reported.</p>
              <p>   Rosli Yusoff, 43, however, will serve only six years as the jail sentences will run concurrently.</p>
              <p>   Rosli and an accomplice, Azizi Jaafar, 36, had been charged with robbing Wan Sharina Ahmad Tewfik Khalidi, 36, of RM2,000 in the accused's taxi in Selangor.</p>

              Precisely, work in Singapore to earn Sing dollars and later change some of that portion of your income to Malaysian Ringgit for your cheaper cost of living in JB / Malaysia. Follow and learn from those Malaysians working in Singapore. Most of them have money in their bank and good life in JB / Malaysia while working in Singapore. I think for your case, during the period when your family bought that condominium, the quota was RM300,000 and above for foreigner buyers/ownership. Yes, for foreigners to purchase properties in JB / Malaysia, the quota now is RM500,000 and above onward. I think it will go up again once the Iskandar Project achieve its 50% completion. Danga Bay will be mostly for condominiums. Why not you contemplates on landed property instead?

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@Zulkiflie- im actually not a huge fan of landed property. even if i were to buy one, I will look at Horizon hills or East Ledang. But the prices are getting very expensive. All above 1 million ringgit. I prefer Condominiums since i am the type of person who enjoy condo facilities. I also heard Malaysian government will likely be increasing from 500k to 750k soon for foreigners.  Read from iproperty. I really like Danga Bay, i saw how it is going to look like in the future. Looks impressive. There will be a mall and the condo can access to the mall at level 6. Its called the vision city of the south. Well i hope danga bay will not be abandoned halfway. </p></div>

              Ah I see. Ok, as for my case, I prefer landed property because for so many years living in a HDB flat, its like being in a pigeon hole and it makes a difference when I started living in JB. Besides, I love gardening now its like past time for me and I find it very relaxing. I'm quite surprise with the home prices in Horizon Hill and East Ledang has gone up so fast. Yes, its expensive now about the minimum quota, well, lets hope it don't increase so soon. If that happens, then I reckon many average Singaporeans will not be able to afford to buy private property in JB / Malaysia. It will be for those who are rich again to purchase private properties in JB / Malaysia like in Singapore.
                  
              I'm sure they will make a point that the Danga Bay project will be completed. The Singapore government and Malaysian Government are involved in it.
                  
              "CapitaLand Malaysia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CapitLand Limited of Singapore, controls 51 percent of the consortium which will develop the land.

              I have a Singaporean friend married to a Malaysian, now having 2 kids, they live at Bukit Indah now. When they first got married about ten years ago, they bought a place at Pulai Indah under his wife's name. Then 2 years ago, they bought a place at Bukit Indah for RM300,000 maybe less because his wife is a Malaysian and probably some special discount I think. They rented out their house at Pulai Indah. Maybe, they bought the Bukit Indah home under both their names now. My friend rented out his family HDB flat at Tiong Bahru in Singapore and his mother lived at Bukit Indah with them now.

              I think Malaysia is like any other country - there is a little higher crime rate.
              
              I been driving and exploring whole of malaysia - down most of the road and area. It is very safe as long as you are street wise.
              
              Do not dress too flashy, drive expensive car, wear expensive watch, carry too much cash in wallet ....etc
              
              Do not go to quiet places, lane, alley or restuarant or go to quiet shopping center. In shopping center - avoid quiet corners and quiet toilet.
              
              In car lock your door. Do not service your car or wash car there - usually car theft - are your key been duplicated. Do not pump at quiet petrol stations.
              
              When driving or walking - be aware if you been followed - if so go to crowded places for protection, like police station, shopping center, where there is lot of people, if need ask for help from security or staff.
              
              I once have been followed before by a red small car, i purposely turn a few turn to confirm that .  For this type of case, alway keep to the big road with lots of car, keep turning around in the city big road with lots of cars - soon he be left behind in a traffic light. Ensure the tail is totally lost before you proceed to your destination.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you storywolf. Have you tried driving from east coast of malaysia and cross over to west coast of malaysia down to Singapore. I had many times in the 80s, its very relaxing and its like cruising in your car while you enjoy the view. Along the way you can stop at many places without rushing for time. There are many hotels in small towns you can stay for a night. I did that each time I wanted to breakfree from Singapore life.</div>

              Thats great man. And I think I don't have to tell you how it felt like after completing that long journey. You know, I've done that journey and completed it before in 12 hours, of course no stop over in the hotel just for refreshment like drink coffee and some food at some small coffeeshops. I felt like all my stress gone when I reached Singapore. Only when you love driving alot...then I think you will feel great accomplishing that long car drive. 
                      
              Only in Malaysia you can really test the performance your car but you must be alert plus you must try be a good, skillful driver and have confidence in yourself. I love driving in kampung roads rather than the expressways because when you drive on expressways you tend to be sleepy plus there are not much nice sceneries you can see and enjoy. But when you drive in the old kampung roads to K.L. wow! it makes a lot of difference because you have to been alert always because there many bends and turns on the roads which makes you don't fall asleep. That is where you really buildup your driving skills. Of course you must know when and where to overtake the vehicles infront of you and you must also know the road ethics and co-operate safety driving with other drivers while driving in Malaysia, especially the truck and coach drivers.
