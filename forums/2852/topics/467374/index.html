              Oh I see. Well, I think 1 week being JB will not help you to know about the way of life in JB. You should try to observe and adapt with the environment there because the way of life in Singapore is so much difference. Don't always compare Singapore with JB because it would not help you adapt with your new life there. You must occupy your time to have something to do or you will get restless and bore. Get use with the life there because the phase of life there is much slower than Singapore. Blend with the society there and get to know your neighbours and neighbourhood.

              Blend with the crowd. Don't show you carry alot of money for your own safety. Those shopping centres in JB town the prices mainly cater for tourists. If you go further up north, the prices will be much cheaper mainly for domestic buyers.
              
              Angsana shopping centre, many Singaporeans so the prices are quite expensive. Try Kipmart in tampoi, Giant in tampoi, Skudai Parade in Skudai and JUSCO shopping mall at Taman University...better sales bargain.

              </p><p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;"><strong>SINGAPORE— </strong>Seeking to prevent a serious rift in relations with Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, apologized "unreservedly" Thursday for remarks that brought a storm of protest from Malaysians.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The public apology was a rare act for Mr. Lee, a tough and often outspoken former prime minister from 1959 to 1990 who remains a powerful figure in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">"The senior minister had no intention to cause offense and apologizes unreservedly for the offense he has caused to the government and people of Malaysia by his statement on Johor," a statement from Mr. Lee's press secretary said.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Mr. Lee said in a recent affidavit for a libel case that the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malaysian state of Johor, which is linked to Singapore by a causeway, was "notorious for shootings, muggings and carjackings."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Analysts said that the strength of the protests in Malaysia threatened to damage relations unless an apology was forthcoming.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Most of Singapore's water and much of its food comes from Malaysia. Although the two countries have close ties and cooperate in some areas, there is increasing economic rivalry between them.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Analysts said that Mr. Lee's derogatory reference to Johor touched a sensitive nerve in Malaysia.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">"Some Singaporeans feel themselves to be generally superior to Malaysians, and even if they don't, most Malaysians think they do and that is enough," said Bruce Gale, Singapore regional manager of Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Pte.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad of Malaysia said Thursday that many Malaysians felt that Mr. Lee should "make amends" for what he said about Johor. At a demonstration in Johor, members of the youth wing of the party Mr. Mahathir heads, the United Malays National Organization, brandished placards calling <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr. Lee "senile," "stupid" and a "pig" — terms that are almost unheard of in the normally smooth diplomacy between leaders of countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations. Mr. Mahathir said that Mr. Lee's comments revealed the difficulties in relations between the two countries.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Singapore was expelled from the Malaysian federation in 1965, partly because Malay leaders suspected that Mr. Lee wanted to win power in Malaysia and end the special privileges given to Malays.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">Mr. Lee's libel case was one of 13 brought by members of Singapore's governing party against an opposition politician, Tang Liang Hong, who fled to Johor after general elections in January in which he failed to win a seat in Parliament.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The comment in Mr. Lee's affidavit about Johor was made as part of an argument disputing claims by Mr. Tang that he feared for his life in Singapore.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Of all places, he went to Johor," Mr Lee said. "That place is notorious for shootings, muggings and carjackings. It does not make sense for a person who claims to be fearful for his life to go to a place like Johor."</span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.467em; font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', times, serif;">The statement by Mr. Lee's press secretary said the affidavit was not intended to be made public.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@ Zulkiflie Wow, u actually stay in JB? Although i don't know where Skudai is, i'm pretty sure is further from town, City Square? I think it'll be safer for me and my friends to just hang out at City Square for now. Abit too cautious and scared to roam one JB. Maybe if i can rent a Sg car i would go further up. But, 1 thing i have to admit when i stayed 1 week with my cousins, i felt so much more relaxed and less stressed out. I think Malaysia is a great place to rest and relax. We Singaporeans take safety for granted knowing that everything is safe here and expect everything to be like Singapore. I've been to Indonesia, but not Phillippines and to say that Malaysia is unsafe is really an understatement. </p></div>

              Skudai is not far from JB. If take the public buses, it will take about 30 mins to reach there or 45 mins the most during peak hours. Ok, maybe you should try Pelagi Mall which is within JB town itself. And near that areas are others shopping centres.Or maybe The Zone shopping centre which is near to the ferry point centres that goes to Batam or Bintan in Indonesia.
              
              You can try taking public buses most of them are air condition or taxis. Just for your information don't take blue taxis the fares expensive. Take red taxis and make sure go by the meters don't bargain with them because the law in Malaysia now for taxi fares are by meters ok. 
              
              JB is a safe place and should know more once you stay in JB permanently.
              
              I've lived in Indonesia for 3.5 years and I've been to the Philippines many times and even stayed there for nearly a month each I visited there.

              Where is your family house location in JB and what is it that you couldn't take it staying with your cousin in JB? Is it because of your cousin family staying in your family house or it is because you still couldn't adjust and adapt with environment in JB?

              I see. So you couldn't take it because of commuting in and out of JB and Singapore for work. Well, I understand. Its not easy at first but within a month you will get use to it. Take it the first month is like BMT. About the jam at the causeway and checkpoints, you must know when is the peak hours and to avoid jams most people from JB go for work in Singapore very early in the morning. When going back to JB after work too, you must know when is the peak hours at Woodlands checkpoint. You must plan your journey to work wisely and also you must know the strategy of which buses to take and the best routes to take once in Singapore to avoid being late for work. All that tips you will know and learn from the Malaysians working in Singapore. If your work place is near the woodlands checkpoint it would be very convenient. However, you should ask yourself one question,"If the Malaysians could do it why can't I as a Singaporean?" That question will make you see differently. Ok, Orchid View is a new condominium place and its very nice. I'm staying in a landed property at Taman Sri Putri in Skudai. Why aren't your parents living or retire in that place at JB? Your cousins will be able to save much of their income while living in JB. They are Singaporeans too?
