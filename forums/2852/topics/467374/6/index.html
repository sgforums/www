              Hi Bukitindah007. There are many Singaporeans living in JB now. Well, you can also learn from your neighbours and get to know your neighbourhood area too. I'm just helping ISTARI to update the topic within sg forums. Glad you find it useful. By the way, it will take awhile for Singaporeans to adjust their lives in JB. Don't worry you and your family will get used to the life in JB...in fact you will feel like home still. Anyway, Singapore is just next door from JB. 
              
              Maybe you should visit this topic of RETIREMENT within sg forums too...take a look at it.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Report by NG JUN SEN and MATTHAEUS CHOO</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What was supposed to be a short trip to Johor Baru for a Singapore couple turned into four hours of hell.</strong></p>
              <p>The couple were allegedly robbed after an attempt to flee led to a horrifying car chase. Then followed four nerve-racking hours driving around the city from one ATM to another to draw money to pay the men.</p>
              <p>   The two men, armed with a knife, took off with RM6,000 (S$2,400) and their mobile phones - an iPhone 4S and a Smasung Galaxy Note 2. This is how the events last Saturday unfolded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 46pt;">1</span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 46pt;"> </span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 20pt;">You owe me money</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>It started at a petrol station opposite Plaza Pelangi, a shopping mall in Johor Baru frequented by Singaporean.</strong></p>
              <p>Mr and Mrs Lim (they refused to give their full names or be identified in photograph as they feared for their safety) had just come from a hair salon near the mall. They were refuelling their car, a white Volkswagen Scirocco, for the trip home at about 11.15pm.</p>
              <p>   They were suddenly approached by two men in their 30s, one of whom had a knife. The men said Mr Lim owed them RM65,000 and recognised him through his vehicle's licence plate number.</p>
              <p>   Said Mr Lim, 35, who runs a car dealership: "I have never borrowed money from anyone in Malaysia."</p>
              <p>   The couple have travelled to Johor Baru more than 40 times in the past two years and have never encountered anyone making such a claim.</p>
              <p>   As his wife called the police, Mr Lim tried to stall for time by arguing with the two men. The Johor police headquarters was less than 100m away.</p>
              <p>   "I kept telling (the men) it's a case of mistaken identity, but they became aggressive, pushing me and clenching their fists in my face," he said.</p>
              <p>   "At that time, there were a lot of people at the petrol station who saw what happened, but none of them helped us."</p>
              <p>   Mrs Lim, 32, claimed she spoke to a Johor police officer over the phone and was assured that help would come soon.</p>
              <p>   Johor Baru deputy police chief Ismail Yatim confirmed that they got a call for help from Mrs Lim.</p>
              <p>   A patrol vehicle was promptly sent to investigate, but the couple were gone by the time they arrived. Police also tried to call them but the number was not in use , said Mr Ismail.</p>
              <p>   Meanwhile, fearing for their safety, Mr Lim sped off towards the immigration checkpoint.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 46pt;">2 </span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 20pt;">Threatened with knife</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>That was when he realised the men were chasing him in a white lorry, which he believed was modified. It soon overtook the couple and weaved dangerously in front of their car.</strong></p>
              <p>Said Mr Lim: "We were speeding towards the checkpoint, trying to escape. But I couldn't outrun him at all. Many people were honking their horns at us."</p>
              <p>   The lorry suddenly braked in front of them, forcing them to stop near a Shell petrol station just half a kilometre away from the checkpoint.</p>
              <p>   The man who carried the knife alighted and walked over to Mre Lim's side of the car, threatening to smash the window.</p>
              <p>   Said Mr Lim: "I was afraid of what he would do to my wife if he got in, so I wound down my side of the window. I didn't expect him to come over and snatch the car keys from the ignition."</p>
              <p>   The man allegedly forced Mrs Lim to go to the back seat. He then entered the car, sitting beside Mr Lim.</p>
              <p>   "He didn't pull out his knife and he kept telling us that it wasn't a robbery and he just wanted us to return him the money that we owed," said Mr Lim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 46pt;">3</span> <span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 20pt;">Don't insult me</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>The man ordered Mr Lim to drive to a car wash, where someone would bring them documents proving Mr Lim's debt.</strong></p>
              <p>But those documents never arrived. Mr Lim claimed the seemed to get more desperate, hurling Hokkien vulgarities at them.</p>
              <p>   They were then told to drive a short distance to a 7-Eleven store, followed closely by the white lorry.</p>
              <p>   There, the man gave them an ultimatum: Leave the car, or pay the man "compensation" to make it worth his time.</p>
              <p>   Mr Lim said: "I lied that I only carried RM400 with me, but my wife blurted out that she had RM3,000."</p>
              <p>   Said Mrs Lim, who works in a bank: "I was terrified of the man, I didn't dare to try anything different."</p>
              <p>   But the man wasn't satified and allegedly told the couple "didn't insult me". He then ordered them to drive to an ATM to withdraw more cash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 46pt;">4 </span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 20pt;">No cash</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>It was 2.30am when they arrived at a Standard Chartered ATM, which was situated opposite the Johor police headquarters.</strong></p>
              <p>Said Mr Lim: "I saw no police around, but I made sure the ATM's closed-circuit television cameras captured the man's face."</p>
              <p>   But the ATM could not dispense any cash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 46pt;">5</span> <span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 20pt;">Call your bank</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>They went to another ATM operated by CIMB Bank near Plaza Pelangi at about 3am. Even then, he still could not withdraw any cash as his UOB ATM card was not approved for overseas withdrawal.</strong></p>
              <p>"He made me call the bank over speakerphone to activate the card," said Mr Lim. "The bank staff told me to wait until 3.30am for the card to be activated."</p>
              <p>   Mr Lim claimed the man also began to call several people for advice on how to proceed, and Mr Lim heard male and female voices on the other end.</p>
              <p>   He could not understand what was said as the man spoke in Malay, but he thought the man suspected he was being tricked.</p>
              <p>   Then, instead of waiting until 3.30am, the man told the driver in the white lorry to return home and forced the couple to drive to another ATM near City Square Mall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 46pt;">6</span> <span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 20pt;">Ordeal ends at 4am</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>At a Hong Leong Bank ATM, Mr Lim managed to withdraw RM3,000 when his earlier request to authorise overseas withdrawals took effect.</strong></p>
              <p>"At that point, I just want to leave. I wanted to give him the money and go, but he told me to drop him off elsewhere first," he said.</p>
              <p>   They drove to a hawker centre, where the ordeal finally ended at about 4am, after the man took the cash and their mobile phones and escaped.</p>
              <p>   Before he left, however, the man gave him two numbers to call and told them to collect their mobile phones at Woodlands Centre later that morning.</p>
              <p>   Said Mr Lim: "I didn't even think of giving chase. I drove off to the checkpoint straightway. I didn't even call any of the numbers or go to Woodlands Centre either."</p>
              <p>   The couple made a report at the police station at the Customs and immigration checkpoint in Johor Baru and were told to make a detailed report at their police headquarters. Mr Lim flatly refused.</p>
              <p>   "There is no way they will make me go near where we first met the men that night," he said.</p>
              <p>   They went straight home.</p>
              <p>   The couple had to return to the same police headquarters on Tuesday to speak to police investigators. Said Mrs Lim about her return trip: "I was trembling the whole time. What if it happen again?"</p>
              <p>   Said Mr Lim: "It was a scary experience for me and my wife. No way am I going back to Johor Baru again."</p>

              <p>Events planner Serene Tay, 38, was robbed by a motorcyclist while she was waiting in her car for her cousin at Taman Sentosa. The rider gestured to her and knocked on her window. When she ignored him, he used a metal rod to smash the front passenger side window. She got out of the car to try to escape, but was then attacked, leaving her with abrasions and chest pains. The robber fled with her mobile phone and wallet, which contained about RM1,500 (S$600).</p>

              Yes, lately after the Malaysian GE recently this year, there were an increase of crime rates in JB and other parts of Malaysia. Many of the gangsters were arrested and many too were shot dead because they carried firearms. They open fire at the police while being surrounded and raided by the police.
                  
              The Malaysian police and respective government agencies have launched crackdown operations on the daily now to arrest suspected gangsters and illegal immigrants.
                  
              My advise to Singaporeans, don't be arrogant by trying to show you are a Singaporean and you carry so much money in public. Blend with the public there. If you want to change large amount of Singapore dollars to Malaysian ringgits, changed it in Singapore.  
                  
              If you are driving there, if you can, try to know the nearest police stations there just in case if you feel you are being followed you can at least drive your car to that nearest police station.

              About Pandan City in Johor Bahru development...well..this was planned in 2009...
              
              Friday, July 10, 2009
              
              
              Mahabuilders to revive Pandan City Business Centre project
              
              JOHOR BARU: Property developer Mahabuilders Sdn Bhd plans to revive the abandoned Pandan City Business Centre here into a thriving commercial and educational centre.
              
              Managing director Mustapha Hassan said it was currently talking with several educational-related institutions to set up branch campuses, colleges or learning centres.
              
              He said Universiti Malaysia Perlis would be opening its southern region matriculation centre in January with the initial intake of 120 students.
              
              â€œWe also want to attract private medical service providers and banks here,â€™â€™ Mustaphatold a press briefing on Thursday.
              
              He said the project by Kretam Holdings Bhd was left abandoned for almost seven years before Mahabuilders took over in 2007 after paying RM20mil to the bank.
              
              The business centre is located along the Tebrau Highway and easily accessible from the city centre and via Jalan Tampoi and Pasir Gudang Highway.
              
              Mustapha said there were 338 shop-offices in four blocks of four-storey commercial buildings with lifts and 1,000 basement parking lots available for tenants.
              
              He said the company was open to any business proposal including turning Pandan City into a one-stop textile and garments wholesale centre like the one in Jalan Kenanga, Kuala Lumpur.
              
              â€œAccessibility to the centre will also improve when the flyover from the Tebrau Highway and the exit point from the North-South Expressway (NSE) are completed in a year or two,â€� said Mustapha.

              You can go there by bus from Larkin Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru. Bus journey will take around nearly 2hrs or 2 hrs plus. The bus fares is around RM12 plus. Once you reach the Mersing Bus Terminal...you can hire a cab from there or make arrangement with the Fishing Bay Resort management for transportation. The place is about 15km from Mersing town. As for my case, I will ask the bus driver where to alight nearest to Mersing Fishing Bay Resort main road and walked in from there so that I don't have to double back from Mersing Town.

              Those going JB, if you are taking the public buses there...here are some of the photographs of the buses. Keep note the displayed destination plate on the buses and the number if you are taking the public buses there. Use small notes and coins to insert your bus fare in the fare box located just next to the bus driver's left hand side. Some buses still have bus conductors to collect your bus fare from you and issued you the bus ticket. All the public buses are run by private operators.

              New Bus for London Visits Malaysia
                          
              Posted on: 19 November 2013
                          
              Officially known as New Bus for London (NBfL or NB4L), the NBfL was designed and assembled by Wrightbus. The NBfL is also known as the New Routemaster or Borismaster. 
                          
              Assigned as LT1 by Arriva, the prototype unit was the first unit to be introduced on the streets of London. In addition, LT1 had also visited some other cities such as New York City to promote the "Great" campaign.
                          
              LT1 had since arrived Malaysia since 10 November 2013 and has been planned to tour around Malaysia before leaving on 11 December 2013.
                          
              Details of the schedule will be gradually released by the British High Commission Kuala Lumpur on its Facebook page.
