              There is a bus service from Singapore - Sentosa Resort World to JB, Kotaraya and from JB, Kotaraya to Singapore - Sentosa Resort World. I used to commute in and out of JB and Singapore by taking this bus while I was working at Tanjong Pagar Complex, when the KTM train station at Tanjong Pagar  ceased their operation and returned to the Singapore Government. You can even take this bus from Scotts Road opposite Far East Plaza.  
                          
              Then there is shuttle service from Singapore Changi International Airport to JB, Kotaraya. And from JB, Kotaraya to Singapore Changi International Airport. Yes, I prefer to take this shuttle service to return to JB.
                          
              They also have bus service from Golden Mile Complex in Singapore to JB Premium Outlets.
                          
              Its very convenient to travel this way and no need to change bus.

              HJ SHARIN LOW MUSLIM SEAFOOD RESTAURANT
              
              Authentic 'halal' Chinese cuisine
              
              THRIVING BUSINESS: Sharin Low Abdullah has 17 restaurants located all over Malaysia, and one in Jakarta as well
              
              JOHOR BARU: CARE for a halal serving of authentic Chinese cuisine? Then head for Sharin Low's Grand Restaurant located at Jalan Padi 1 of Bandar Baru Uda, here.
              The restaurant's director, Sharin Low Abdullah, said the restaurant which started operations here more than four months ago has come up with a Chinese New Year menu promotion which includes yee sang, a prosperity dish enjoyed by the Chinese community when celebrating the lunar new year.
              
              Also on the festive menu are the Prosperity Chicken dish, shark's fins fried with egg, abalone broccoli stir-fried with fatt choy, steamed siakap Nyonya, lo han chai, salted egg kwai tau meow and roast duck.
              
              Sharin, who is 66, is also the Selangor Chinese Muslim Association chairman. He converted to Islam when he was in his 20s.
              
              "I was working in a factory in Tampoi, here, and I had many Muslim friends at the workplace. After I left the factory, I went to Kuala Lumpur to work at an assembly plant for electrical products," he said.
              
              "Five years ago, after retirement, I ventured into the food business by opening my first restaurant in Shah Alam. Hj Sharin Low Grand is my 15th halal restaurant that serves authentic Chinese cuisine.
              
              "The restaurant in Johor Baru has two chefs; one is a local Malay and the other, an ethnic Chinese from Myanmar."
              
              Sharin said the menus differ slightly among the various outlets, which operate under the names Hj Sharin Low Restaurant and Haji Sharin Low Family Restaurant.
              
              The locations of his restaurants include Klang, Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur, Kuantan, Cyberjaya and Putrajaya. His 18th restaurant opened last month in Kota Baru.
              
              This outlet in Bandar Baru Uda, which is managed by Sharin's niece Linah Lim, is open daily from noon to midnight.
              
              Sharin also ventured to Jakarta, Indonesia, when he opened his 16th outlet there.
              
              For enquiries, call 016-731 5653.

              Actress Cai Pei Xuan setting up restaurant in JB
              by Austin Camoens
              
              JOHOR BARU - Actress Cai Pei Xuan, who has made a name for herself in Singapore, is venturing into business by setting up a restaurant here.
              
              The 29-year-old from Muar, who starred in a Chinese drama titled Holding Hands, opened a Baba-Nonya-themed non-halal restaurant in Taman Sutera Utama.
              
              â€œI decided to venture into the food industry because it is a lucrative market,â€� she said.
              
              Cai went into business early this year when she started a music school in Johor Jaya recently.
              
              â€œI feel that the next appropriate step was to open a restaurant,â€� she told The Star at the launch of her restaurant, known as Bibik Kitchen, yesterday.
              
              Several of Caiâ€™s friends and Singaporean artistes were present at the launch, including Yao Wen Yong, Paige Chua, Yvonne Lim, and Belinda Lee.
              
              Cai started her career as an actress in 2004 taking on minor roles with local production houses in Kuala Lumpur.
              
              â€œI got my big break three years ago when I signed a contract to star in 180 episodes of Holding Hands in Singapore,â€� she said, adding that the show was slated to be the longest running television drama.
              
              Cai said she hoped to open two more restaurants in Kuala Lumpur and Penang once her restaurant business has picked up.
              
              â€œIt took me nearly a month and more than RM200,000 to set up the business here,â€� she said.
              
              Asked why she decided to set up the restaurant here, Cai said it would have cost more than twice as much to open up a business in Singapore.
              
              The restaurant serves non-halal cuisine, including prawn mee, pork rib mee, wantan mee, mince meat mee, nasi lemak, fried bean sprouts, fried bittergourd with salted egg, sambal ladies fingers, and sambal eggplant.

              BIBIK KITCHEN
              
              Bibik Kitchen, JB
              
              I like to introduce this new eatery in JB which was opened by an up and coming MediaCorp artiste, Cai Pei Xuan. She actually acted in some local sitcoms and lately, she seems like making it big in Singapore. By the way, read this article which was published in The Star.

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I am a singaporean girl. I went to johor bahru today alone as i have an important thing to do. As i am a girl and I'm alone, i felt quite scared. I took second link via tuas to jusco (Leon) and there are many taxi there. As i am afraid of my safety, I choose a chinese decent looking guy to be my taxi driver and he kindly drove me up to Batu Pahat. It was a long journey there as it takes 1-2hrs to reach. The taxi driver named Ah Xiang is a nice guy as he brought me safely there and even took the effort to wait for me while i visited a temple. He even send me back to second link custom so that i can go back sg safely. I went there from 9am+ to 2pm when i reach sg.</p>
              <p>All thanks to him that i don feel scared as my safety is more important than anything. </p>
              <p>Ah xiang, His number is +60146193696. He's a really nice johor taxi driver. If you all feel worried about getting rob or rape, you can call him to drive you there. He is a friendly person and nice to talk with guy. I'm travelling alone so don worry too~ â™¡</p>

              I have with me here brochures that I have collected from Johor Sentral Tourists Information Centre at Johor Bahru to share with the tourists visiting Johor State.
              
              JOHOR MALAYSIA
              
              AGRO-TOURISM &amp; HOMESTAY
              
              What is Agro-Tourism?
              
              Agro-tourism is the organising of tourism activities around agricultural and village based attractions.
              
              Johor has some of the world's agro-tourism wonders that are certain to fasinate you. Theses include one of the world's Arowana aquaculture farms, the only place in the world that produces a special hybrid of pineapple called Josapine and a cross-breed cow called the 'Selembu'.
              
              Other agro-tourism hightlights are lowland tea plantation, bee apiary, herbs and spices farm and of course, tropical fruit orchards. Sampling of local fruits, such as the durians dubbed the 'King of fruits' and pineapples and honey are not to be missed.
              
              Our village-based agro-tourism programme involves visiting a village that exposes you to the intriguing rural lifestyles.
              
              Do not just visit the farms or plantations: acquire some skills in harvesting, rubber tapping and fruits picking. Do not just buy handicrafts and souvenirs: learn how they are made.
              
              Do not just visit villages: talk with the kampung folks, have coffee or meal with them, play their games or indulge in their pastimes. Above all you should stay with them under our unique homestay programme.
              
              Homestay Programme
              
              This programme allows you to stay with the family of participating villagers of designated kampungs (or villages). Participants have to meet certain requirements before the Ministry Of Tourism certify them as homestay operators. The programme is community-based with the village hedman, area officers of the agriculture department and rural folks join hands to develop and promote it. The local police is also involved.
              
              You are treated as guests to the family and are asked to join the villagers in special ceremonies or happenings in the village. Cultural performances like Zapin, Ghazal, Kuda Kepang, Silat and others are also arranged. You eat local food, learn local customs and traditions, don local dresses, play local music and sing local songs. Each guest will be presented with a gift from the host family.
              
              Homestay programme is best suited for groups. It is offered as a package with village-based agro-tourism programme. Its educational value makes it a very popular programme for all levels of students both local and foreign.
