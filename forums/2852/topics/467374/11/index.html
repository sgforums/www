              This is a friendly advise and reminder.
                  
              Those Singaporeans driving their cars to JB, make sure your car's engine are in tiptop condition. Check your car engine or have it service before you drive to JB.
                  
              If your car broke down at JB Checkpoint, it will be towed away to the nearest place outside JB Immigration Checkpoint, for instance to Petronas or Shell gas station just outside JB Immigration complex. So it won't caused any traffic jams at the causeway or within JB Immigration complex. I think that towing service is free. However, after that, when you have your car tow to the workshop in JB, it will cost you within the range of RM160 to RM170.
                  
              And lastly, if your car cannot be repaired at the car workshop in JB, and you want to tow it back to your mechanic's car workshop in Singapore, it will cost you about RM700 to RM800 (inclusive of JB Immigration levy). Plus you must accompany or must be present at both checkpoints in JB and in Singapore at Woodlands Checkpoints. The immigration of Malaysia in JB and in Singapore need you to verify your car and your car status. You may have to follow the tow truck driver in his truck in the lorry lane entering Singapore and if you unlucky it may take hours or the whole day to enter Singapore.
                  
              This is very important too to know. If your car's computer box is spoiled, the computer box in Malaysia may not be necessary be able to start your car engine. Most of the Japanese cars in Singapore are Japanese made spectrum version whereas in Malaysia, their cars computer box are either Malaysia or Thailand made spectrum version. You may ended up towing your car all the way back to Singapore.
                  
              Keep this in mind. You do not want your car's problem in JB to spoil your plan for leisure time in JB. It can be a nightmare for you. 
                  
              Drive safe while in Malaysia.

This means that all foreign-registered cars entering Johor need a Vehicle Entry Permit to enter Malaysia, but owners of Singapore-registered cars don’t need to worry about the fee until July 15 because there will be no charges of RM20 (S$6.60) up until that date because they’re still conducting a test run.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 14px; color: #373737; line-height: 1.5; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; padding-right: 0em; padding-left: 0em; word-break: normal; font-family: proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The registration of vehicles for VEP will be until the end of the year, according to Hasni Mohammad, Chairman of Public Works, Rural and Regional Development Com­mittee. He also said that 60 percent of the one million vehicles which entered Malaysia via the two entry points over the past two months were Singaporean vehicles. He also added that “each vehicle lane at the checkpoints was equipped with cameras and sensors to read number plates and RFID tags”.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 14px; color: #373737; line-height: 1.5; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; padding-right: 0em; padding-left: 0em; word-break: normal; font-family: proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">There are more than 120,000 Singapore vehicles have already registered for the VEP since August 2014.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 14px; color: #373737; line-height: 1.5; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; padding-right: 0em; padding-left: 0em; word-break: normal; font-family: proxima-nova, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, Singapore has increased their vehicle entry permit charges for foreign-registered cars, it is now S$35 per day from S$20. They also increased the Goods Vehicle Permit fee for foreign-registered goods vehicles from S$10 to S$40 per calendar month. Vehicle Entry Permit exempts cars entering Singapore between 5pm and 2am from Monday to Friday.  They also give  10 free days per year and there are no charges during the weekends for a foreign car.</p>

The owner/representative of the car needs to provide personal information and car registration details. They will now be advised on the collection of a RFID tag to be displayed on the vehicle’s windshield at JPJ’s designated premises after registering successfully. Please also note that there will be an administration fee of RM10 (S$3.30) imposed during tag collection, and the VEP is renewable every five years.</p>

              <p>Best time in the morning is from 4 am to 5.30 am in the morning, no traffic jam at the Causeway. And if you work retail hours then the best time is 9.30 am onwards. This timing is for week days work week. Saturday and Sunday usually no traffic jam.</p>
              <p>So in other words, if your starts work in between 7 am to 9 am, its still better for you to make a move from your home early to avoid being trap in the traffic jam.</p>
              <p>Most of us who are staying in JB and work in Singapore, are super early when reach our office or work place. Most will take a short sleep again at the office or anywhere that is convenient before we start work.</p>
              <p>You have to be discipline in waking up early and also to be patience when crossing the Causeway to Singapore.</p>

              You're welcome X Man. Well, you can always park you car in season parking in JB, more safer that way for Singapore registered car. Then take a bus in or walk in to Singapore if there's a traffic jam at the Causeway. Walking to Singapore Checkpoint from JB will take about 30 to 45 minutes. Take it like an exercise for yourself. Most Malaysians do that in order not to be late for work. Learn from them and learn too the various strategies to enter Singapore..there are many ways to plan your crossing over to Singapore. Tell yourself this,"If the Malaysians can do it why can't I."

Decided to head North and found myself in Senai at Palm Villa. Yes, its a very nice neighbourhood and very big houses there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Went to Sutera Mall in JB with my wife yesterday to get some bite. We dined in a place call IT ROO CHICKEN CHOP. They claimed to have the best chicken chop in JB. Well, its delicious but I'm not sure whether it's the best chicken chop in JB. You have to try it for yourself and see whether it's true or not. This F&amp;B outlet is near and just outside Sutera Mall. In fact there are many F&amp;B outlets just outside Sutera Mall. Those of you, Singaporeans, you can drive there and it's something like those area near KSL or Pelangi area in JB. Majority are Chinese customers. And if you don't have a car to go to this place, no worries, there are buses from Jurong Bus Interchange in Singapore and 2nd Link CIQ in Johor, that will bring you directly right in front of the main entrance of Sutera Mall. You can shop and eat within Sutera Mall itself or walk about outside to shop at those retail shops and dine in many F&amp;B Outlets available there. It's a nice place to spend quality time with loved ones.</div>

It's my first time me and wife stopped by and see what they have there. And to our surprise they have plenty of things for us to buy with reasonable price. The place is big and they have food stalls like in the food court especially for seafood in the Chinese Food section, something like the old Newton Hawker Centre in Singapore. And in that Chinese Food Court section there is a stage for live shows especially in the night. There is Malay Food section too that sell variety of Malay food. I recommend that you try the Char Kway rojak in that Malay Food section. It's crunchy and delicious. There are retail shops and wet market too.</div>

              For Singaporean car drivers and Motorcycle riders, if you want to know where is the Headquarter of Johor Traffic Police, it's at Jalan Skudai, Batu 10. It's just opposite the Skudai Parade Shopping Mall. You can pay your fines there and most of the traffic accidents / vehicles (Major or Fatal), involving local or foreign vehicles are reported there and the vehicles are towed there for further investigation, if it's a major or fatal accident. It's just located next to the Jalan Skudai main road in the direction towards Senai, it's a 10 storey building I think and it's just next to a big mosque (Masjid Jamek).
