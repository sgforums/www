              <p>JOHOR BARU - Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum 
              Sultan Iskandar has forgiven the individuals involved in the brawl with 
              bodyguards of the royal entourage but he wants foreigners to respect the
               local laws and culture and not behave like hooligans.</p>
              <p>"We welcome
               foreigners to the state but they must respect our laws and culture," he
               told a press conference yesterday at Istana Pasir Pelangi.</p>
              <div id="idParentDiv">
              <div id="idDivAd" style="width: 300px; height: 250px; padding: 4px; float: right; overflow: hidden; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;"></div>
              <div id="idDiv1" style="clear: none;">
              <p>"They cannot behave like hooligans and use vulgarities. Even locals must respect the laws wherever they go."</p>
              <p>In
               detailing what happened between the bodyguards and four foreigners 
              British, German and French expatriates on Saturday, the Sultan said he 
              wanted to set the record straight as there were many versions of the 
              incident.</p>
              <p>"For me, the matter has been settled and I welcome them 
              back," he said, adding that his three-day diving expedition at Pulau 
              Rawa was marred by the fracas.</p>
              <p>Sultan Ibrahim, who regretted what 
              had happened on the last day of his trip, said he was in his yacht and 
              only found out about the brawl early the next day.</p>
              <p>It was reported
               in The Star that four foreigners were involved in a brawl with 
              bodyguards after they had trespassed into a power boat belonging to the 
              Sultan. "They even tried to strangle one of my crew," the Sultan said.</p>
              <p>He
               said the foreigners were actually staying at the neighbouring Alang's 
              Rawa Resort and were a nuisance to other guests at the resort when they 
              went around banging on room doors in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
              <p>"I
               believe they may have been fighting among themselves earlier as there 
              was broken glass in their room and one of them even injured his leg when
               he jumped into the sea from my boat and scraped himself against 
              corals," he added.</p>
              <p>"My doctor treated the injured foreigner but I am quite upset how the issue was blown up by the foreign media."</p>
              <p>Two
               foreigners involved in the brawl were treated at a hospital in 
              Singapore and lodged reports with the police and their respective 
              embassies in the republic.</p>
              <p>Singapore's The Straits Times quoted a 
              28-year-old Briton as saying they were assaulted by the bodyguards after
               they were invited by the royal family for drinks.</p>
              <p>Both the 
              British High Commission and German Embassy are following the matter with
               Malaysian authorities. Nine police reports have been lodged so far.</p>

              <p>Singapore is the only country where they are made to feel they are superior and Singaporeans have to consult them on anything. <br><br>They
               get along in our system better than us locals. Eg Roads, MRT, our laws .
               That is why they feel at liberty to lecture us at will. Why is that so?
               We have ourselves to blame. In  short we have allowed ourselves to be 
              colonised a second time.</p>

              <p>The Johor Sultan said that these Spore expat Angmo 
              behaved like hooligans was correct. In China they humiliated and 
              insulted young innocent chinese teen girls by forcing sex on them. PRC 
              police are useless and they are good in catching local hooligans or 
              protesters. I admire the local chinese people for protecting their 
              citizens against Angmo.</p>

               only have zealous bouncers at nightclubs - expats may friend-friend the

              <p>Very hard to  know who was right and who was wrong. Yes expats do have a tendency to behave badly especially younger set who  usually go wild when  partying or enjoying themselves, thus going overboard. Sultan's body guard could also be very reactive perhaps, and view their childish merry makings  as " kurang ajar". And kurang ajar indeed they probably were, since they should know better that  when they are in  a foreign land they should also respect the rules and or behavioral code of conduct of the land, be it Johore or Singapore.</p>
              <p>Indeed all countries have their own rules which must be respected. Whether you are a emperor or a maharani you can't for example just  land you private jet or helicopter on the grounds of the polo club or island country club golf course as you suka suka...right?</p>
