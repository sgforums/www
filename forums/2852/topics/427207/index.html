              Remember Dead Man Can't TALK!
              
              The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission's probe into graft allegations involving billions of ringgit took a deadly turn after a senior Customs officer fell to his death from the third floor of the MACC building in Jalan Cochrane here.
              
              Meanwhile, hundreds of freight forwarders were left fuming when the Customs branches in Port Klang were apparently left unattended yesterday.
              
              The agents were initially upset with the slow processing of documents, and things heated up when the agents learnt that Selangor Customs assistant director Ahmad Sarbani Mohamed, who was in charge of the Port Klang Import and Export Division, had fallen to his death.
              
              Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz said the graft investigations must continue despite the incident.
              
              Several groups called for the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry into the death, the second incident of a death plunge at an MACC building.
              
              A senior Selangor Customs officer under investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) fell to his death from the third floor of the MACC building in Jalan Cochrane.
              
              Ahmad Sarbani Mohamed, 56, a Customs assistant director based in Port Klang, had been released on bail two days ago after being picked up in the commission's investigation into a syndicate laundering billions of ringgit via tax evasion activities.
              
              His body was found sprawled in an open air badminton court located on the first floor of the five-storey building at about 10.20am yesterday.
              
              Ahmad Sarbani had gone to the MACC office here on his own accord. Initial findings revealed he had arrived at the building alone on a motorcycle at 8.26am.
