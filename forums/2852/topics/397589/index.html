              <p>Remember the 'Malaysian Malaysia' concept that LKY proposed when PAP contested in the Malaysia general election in the 1960's  while Singapore was still part of Malaysia?</p>
              <p>This was the main trigger that resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia.. The Malaysian Malaysia concept posed a serious threat to the dominance and the fundamental existence of the Alliance Party led by Tunku. Remember, the Alliance worked based on the power sharing formula among the 3 major races..</p>
              <p>Fastforwarding to today.. Almost 50 years later. Najib introduced his 1Malaysia concept to woo the votes of the minorities after BN suffered heavy loss in the 2008 GE.. </p>
              <p><strong>"The 1Malaysia concept is more popular than Milo, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), the badge and logo of 1Malaysia has no competition because some like chicken and some may not like to eat chicken, but everyone likes 1Malaysia," said Najib.</strong></p>
              <p>Lee's idea was taken up by Najib 50 years after Malaysia's independence. Was Lee's Malaysian Malaysia concept too 'advanced' for the Malaysian back in those time to accept it. It took malaysians 50 years to see the merit of Lee's Malaysian Malaysia??</p>
              <p>What does this says about LKY? He got a great foresight and makes very good prediction? He can see things that people of his time don't?</p>

              <p>Basically, dun take  our Uncle LKY too high, he is just  like a gambler in a casino, he gambles on politics, with a shrewed and cunning way. And fortunately, he wins most of the time, just like a fortune tellers who alway guess the right future of your life, he will become popular to a stage that even if he predict wrongly, peoples still trust him...so take LKY as a normal layman, he is not someone exordinary ya.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, with regard to malaysia, they hv come out with so many kind of slogan, from malaysia boleh to tak boleh, from bed in hotel room to courtroom. And today, someone said most of their politician are drinkers, mabok peoples who like to cane women for the same offence, drinking. It is the way of the malaysian politics, if it works, who care, that is their culture, coming up with new slogan and strategy is part and parcel of the ruling party BN, and certainly not LKY, who himself also used Hilter, Kim Jong II, and Saddam way of governing singapore.    </p>

              <p><br>if people are not happy, they can just vote the oppositions, but too bad, most opposition in singapore are no better than PAP, that is the fact, if there is one, sure to win it by 100%</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Moderator... why is the thread being posted here leh? I think speaker's corner is more appropriate. True that the topic suggests that we are discussing about malaysia but my point is to question the foresight of LKY. Malaysian Malaysia and 1malaysia is just an example for me to illusrate my point and for others to give their views and take on the issue.. So i think it's more appropriate to shift it back to speaker's corner and not keep this in the sgforumsmalaysia corner...   </p></div>

                  makes very good prediction? He can see things that people of his

              <p>I remember reading in Said Zahari's memoirs that Lee Kuan Yew made a deal with Tunku to suppress the rights of Singaporeans inside Malaysia but Lee Kuan Yew betrayed his promise to him and came up with the malaysian malaysia concept to bid for power in malaysia.</p>
              <p>Go and read Said Zahari's memoirs for more details, he writes a lot on the dirty policies of Lee Kuan Yew, all his lies, betrayals, connive with british, manipulate Singaporeans etc.</p>
