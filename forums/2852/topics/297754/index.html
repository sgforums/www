I thought minorities are not important ?<br><br>If peaceful protests is not the way... then by Voting ? Revolution ?<br><br>Are surveys done in Form 3 Moral classes ?<br><br>Does protests really always ends with violence like portrayed in RTM 1, 2 and TV 3 ?<br><br>Personally i would think the HINDRAF rally has jeapordised the system for reform.</div>
