              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Malaysian prime minister Najib started an Apartheid-like policy on 14/9/2013. The policy will help the bumiputra(Malays) only based on race. Apartheid is a system of discrimination based on race, which wsa condemned and ended in South Africa in 1990. </p>
                  <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Should the world condemn this race-based policy which discriminates and divides the multiracial nation? Do we still remember how the world community joint forces in condemning Apartheid in South Africa?</p>

              <p>But any discrimination policy based on race by any government (Apartheid system) is already being condemned and banned in South Africa in 1990. Just like chemical weapon is banned by civilized world.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't the civilized world pay attention to this issue, as it is  with the chemical weapon in Syria?</p>
              <p>In short, civilized world and any right-thinking people would not accept race-based policies (Apartheid) in any form!</p>
              <p>PM Najib and his party (um--no)  won the election on 5/5/2013 with 49% of votes only. They are arrogant and uncivilized to start a massive discriminatory race-based policy to help the bumi (Malays) whch have already control most of the country Government-linked Companies like Petronas, SimeDerby, Telekom, Tenaga, Banks, etc.  </p>
              <p>In fact the government should start any Apartheid system again in modern time. Do your agree?</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">“There are some that believe China and the US are two global powers and could govern the world together. Only a fool would believe this kind of talk,” Li said during an event on September 12 organised by the Atlantic Council of the United States at the Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">Several Chinese media outlets misinterpreted this quote, and reported Li had said, “Only a fool would believe that China is now number two in the world.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">In another Atlantic council event in Washington DC last night, Li addressed this misinterpretation, and explained that striving for hegemony and ranked status among nations was not China’s priority,<a style="color: #006391;" href="http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2013-09-18/061428244186.shtml">Chinanews.com</a> reported.</p>

China will never seek to become number one, number two, or number three.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">Li also said that China was still a developing country, with one hundred million living people below the poverty line, and needed to reach a consensus with other nations on power relations and “mutually beneficial co-operation.” </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">“China should strengthen co-operation with other developing countries as a foundation for diplomatic work and engage in positive relations with its neighbours,” Li said. “Of course, it is also particularly important for China to develop relationships with global powers such as the US.”</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">Li is no stranger to the Sino-US relations, and first came to prominence as China’s ambassador to the United Nations between 1993 and 1995. He later served as China's ambassador in Washington.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif; font-size: 14.285714149475098px; line-height: 18px;">His most famous outspoken remarks include calling Nato's bombing of China’s Belgrade embassy “no casual mistake" in 1999.</p>

              <p>"Bumiputera Economic Empowerment Plan (Apartehid-like plan)– Najib’s double-barrelled repudiation of the New Economic Model and 1Malaysia policy
                      The 50th Malaysia Day had been the most troubling Malaysian anniversary since it was declared a public holiday four years ago, for only two days earlier, the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak had virtually renounced his reformist credentials as Prime Minister for all Malaysians as well as the torch-bearer for national transformation, whether governmental, political or economic.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Deputy Prime Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said Najib’s announcement of the RM31 billion Bumiputra Economic Enforcement Plan two days before Malaysia Day was “a very lucky day” and “the most-awaited event”, and it is understandable why Muhyiddin was so elated, for it marked the triumph of his “Malay first, Malaysian second” stand and the ignominous trouncing of Najib’s 1Malaysia policy in less than four years.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>It was in March 2010 that I challenged Muhyiddin and all the Cabinet Ministers at the time whether they fully supported Najib’s 1Malaysia Policy, reminding them that the goal of 1Malaysia as spelt out by the 1Malaysia Government Transformation Programme Roadmap was “to make Malaysia ….a greater nation: a nation where, it is hoped, every Malaysian perceives himself or herself as Malaysian first, and by race, religion, geographical region or socio-economic background second and where the principles of 1Malaysia are woven into the economic, political and social fabric of society”."</p>

                      <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The world condemned and ended Apartheid ( a system of discrimination based on race) in South Africa in 1990.
                      On 2013/9/14 Malaysia PM Najib re-started a RM31 billion BEEP which is race-based discriminatory policy to help only Bumiputra in this multiracial nation. 
                      Can the civilized world accept this type of Apartheid-like policy in Malaysia in modern world???</strong></span><p></p>

              bumiputra policy was already started by then former PM Dr M many decades back...
              
              so it is nothing new to be alarmed of.
              
              the other races should just leave the country...why work so hard to pay taxes only to benefit other people who don't wish to work hard and just wait for government to dish handout?

              Isn't this a disgrace to humanity if Apartheid-like policy is allowed to be implemented, in any country, without condemnation in modern time?
              
              Remember the whole world came together to condemned Apartheid in South Africa that ended in 1990??? I think that race-based discriminatory policy  is not compatible with modern world.
              
              (Why Apartheid-like policy is allowed to be implemented in Malaysia again( on 2013, September 14) when it was condemned by all nations then? )

              <p>“To many Malaysians, even ethnic Malays, Mr Najib has sacrificed political principles to save his job. His campaigning slogan of ‘1 Malaysia’, emphasising racial harmony, now rings hollow.”</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>In keeping with the new Bumiputera plan, the “stuttering” Malaysian economy would now have to raise enough money for the programme.
                                          The Chinese and Indian communities here would likely continue leaving the country, “disgusted” by the “overt racism of it all”.
                                          “And the country’s stated goal of becoming a prosperous economy by 2020 will recede further,” The Economist wrote.</p>

                                          A leader that sacrificed his political principle IS NOT CREDIBLE anymore!!!! What do you think?</p>
