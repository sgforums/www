Opens only at night.  3.50 ringgit.  There is at least one similar Thai fried rice stall at Nusa Bestari, but have not tried it.<br><br>Penang laksa, Johor laksa, mee rebus etc at a Malay stall at Gelang Patah night market every Tuesday.  Very good business.  Seem to be sold out within an hour.  About 2.00 ringgit per packet.<br><br>White-color fried (or is it steamed?) rice vermicelli (bee hoon) at various Malay stalls at Gelang Patah night market every Tuesday.  Nicer than most Chinese styles.  1.00 or 1.30 ringgit per packet.<br></div>
