              <div id="post_message_426970"><a href="http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?t=328786">http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?t=328786</a><br> <br> Everytime I come to this forum, all I see is singaporeans complaining
              about this and that...most of them are really stupid complaints, which
              clearly showed these people are so short-sighted.<br> <br> I am a Malaysian, by the way and I don't live and don't work in
              Singapore. I am here because I have investment in Singapore, so I need
              to keep myself up to date with Singapore market.<br> <br> Number 1 complaint - Foreigners working in Sg, esp Malaysian.<br> Complaint so much for what? I admit, a lot of Malaysian come to Sg and
              work because of higher pay. But on the other hand, Singapore
              desperately need malaysians too. Malaysians are the only foreigners
              that share the same culture and language as Singaporeans. Without
              Malaysians, singapore won't be able to function in almost every aspect.
              So stop complaining.<br> <br> Before singaporeans complaint about malaysians, ask yourself, do you
              rather have Malaysians who speak the same language as you to get most
              of your jobs done or do you want someone who don't speak the same
              language as you.<br> <br> If you really think that Malaysians should not come to Sg, then go and
              vote for a government that ban Malaysians working in Sg, I want to see
              what happen to Sg.<br> <br> Number 2 complaint - Stop complaining of Sg government opening doors to other foreigners...<br> <br> As a malaysian, I envy Singapore so much because of its open door
              talents policy, Malaysia is no where close to that...the UMNO-malay
              close Malaysia door to talents...instead UMNO only want those illegal
              muslim filipino...a very sad case for malaysia<br> <br> so please stop complaining, if malaysian can do what sg is doing,
              malaysia can be very prosperous. PAP policy is right in this sense.<br> <br> Number 3 complaint - don't complaint of your MRT lah..<br> I traveled to so many countries, Sg MRT is one of the best in world, so
              stop bitching about it. Come to New York City, you will then learn to
              appreciate Sg MRT.<br> <br> Number 4 complaint - stop complaining of your health care lah...<br> Sg health care is among the best in Asia, i know it, because i m in the
              medical field. It might be expensive, however, it is still better than
              a lot of Asian countries...come to the US and see, you can't even
              afford to see a doctor for a cold. So stop bitching about it.<br> <br> Even though seeing doctor in Malaysia is cheaper, but Sg has better quality in general. so stop complaining...<br> <br> Number 5 complaint - stop complaining you don't have enough money<br> You don't have enough money, most of time is because you are wasting
              money and don't know how to save. Singapore wages is considered very
              high compare to most countries in Asia, not to mention that Sg tax is
              low compare to Western countries...<br> <br> So..please stop bitching...<br> <br> <br> Number 6 complaint - stop complaining prices in sg is expensive.<br> sometime, it is more expensive in malaysia, i know it, because sometime i go to sg and buy things, because it is cheaper....<br> <br> <br> What you should complaint:<br> 1. complaint about media corp, singapore tv today is getting more and more bored, unentertaining, actors are horrible...<br> 2. complaint about why singapore laws are so tough and unforgiving...<br> 3. complaint about why singaporeans are so kia su...</div>

              <p>*  Without malaysians, Singapore won't be able to function in almost every aspect.</p>
              <p>Reply : If that is the case, many would expect malaysia to do better. This is what malaysian want to believe.</p>
              <p>* Before Singaporeans complaint about malaysians, ask yourself, do you rather have malaysians who speak the same language as you to get most of your jobs done or do you want someone who don't speak the same language as you.</p>
              <p>Reply : Able to communicate in English is key. Besides language, there are few other qualifications as well.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Reply : In politics, there is no such thing as banning a nationality. Anyway, malaysian production operators in Sg had faded away since few years back. Same goes to Jr Executive.</p>
              <p>Few years back, there was a malaysian in US wrote to Sg Straits Time that he followed the News on the water supply issue. He suggested that Sg stop buying water from malaysia.</p>
              <p>Now, malaysia and Singapore <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can see what happen</span>.</p>

              <p>Reply : malaysian' mentality. If there is no Singapore ..... malaysia provide to Singapore .....</p>
              <p>Look at the Multimedia Super Corridor and Port of Tanjung Pelepas. These 2 project was set out to pull Sg' business away. Iskandar region started out to keep Singaporean away. Middle East "brothers" pulling out of Malaysia. Now come to Singapore for help.</p>
              <p>Plenty of things malaysian can do. Boleh !</p>
