            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">TAURUS MAN </span></strong><br><br>A quiet simple man who can do something unexpected to shock u. Taurus man mostly medium height, strong with good health, good strong body. When he talks, he likes to turn his head to one side on one direction. His body will be quite straight, facial structure tends to be square-shaped more than other shapes. His eyes sparkle with liveliness. Even when he is in love, he is still a free wild bird. He is a sand in your palm, the more u want to hold it, it will slip out. If u stand &amp; hold it still, it will stay that way. Don't set rules &amp; draw a line for him, he will not stay. When u are with him, he will think only of u. But an hour later, he could change his mind. He is very patient with other people, but very impatient with himself. His world always turns &amp; it will not stop just because he loves u. If he's upset, he will show it right away. If something has gone wrong, he will blame his own carelessness instead of blaming other people. He's sincere to his friends even to some friends he dislikes. He likes to do odd things &amp; surprise other people. He could be fully dressed in a nice suit &amp; jumps into the pool. He could slap your back so hard just to make u turn around to see he has flowers in his hands. He never wants to get too close with anyone for he thinks living in reality is living by yourself. He does not care what people think when he behaves weird. He could be walking bare feet &amp; laughing at people who laugh at him &amp; think they are so narrow-minded. He does not like to follow conformity, but always want to search for new ventures, new mystery. He will be interested in a life of a millionaire as much as a life of an old man selling newspaper on a sidewalk vendor. He likes to search &amp; analyze people &amp; things. He will analyze his friends or his girlfriend, &amp; once the mystery is gone, he will search for new puzzle to solve. He cannot easily understand things, so he will gradually learn about u till he fills up all his questions. He knows so many people, but he has few friends. He looks for quality friends than quantity friends. He will be close with some friends shortly &amp; move on. He always feels lonely even when he's surrounded by many people. He could create his own little world, &amp; sometimes no one would understand him. He looks only for future &amp; he thinks he lives for the future. He may wonder how many people think like he does, but he does not want to be like the others. A man with a conflicting personality. He is cool, understanding, able to work well, &amp; very artistic. Taurus man could be an artist. He could shock u as much as he is able to calm u down when u'r upset. He is a free spirit who likes to venture, but when he wants to be alone, do not touch him but to let him be. He won't disappear from the crowds too long, he will be back. He will give u straightforward opinion or comments, but will never advice what he thinks u should do. He doesn't like people to tell him what he should do too. He thinks each individual dreams &amp; thoughts should be very private. He will use his brain not his body strength, so he will let other guys compete. He has a certain satisfactory in life &amp; hates to force himself in competition. He may seems careless, but actually he is a thinker &amp; a stubborn one. He sees anything in details &amp; not easily trust people till he thinks he knows them well. U can just smile &amp; he will think why &amp; what are u smiling about, &amp; if u are pretending. Once he trusts u &amp; accepts u as a friend, no one can say otherwise to change that for he will not listen to gossip. He will be honest &amp; sincere to his friends. He hates lies, so he will not tell u lies. If he finds it is necessary to lie, he will find other ways not to tell u or avoid telling u anything. If he really has to lie, u will never be able to tell that he is lying. He can really keep secrets, so u will hardly know that he is a lonely soul. If u want this kind of guy, u have to be an interesting person. He has to be curious about u. Hell for him is "No Freedom", so if he marries u then u should know it is the biggest decision in his life. Always be interesting, then u could have him beside u.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>TAURUS WOMAN </strong></span><br><br>A slim moderately tall woman. Taurus woman is funny &amp; a jolly. Square facial bone structure, high cheek bone. Her round big eyes sparkle with wit &amp; curiosity. U will not see many round faces Taurus women, &amp; mainly she will have a strong jaw line. She is a constantly change person. If she's upsets, she will not show it &amp; will keep it to herself for a long time, &amp; will remember them well. If she gets really mad at u, u will suddenly become a totally &amp; completely stranger to her. She is a patient person, but always needs new excitement. She hates long talk meeting, long &amp; endless conversation. She can be in love with u today, &amp; one day she could act as if she has never loved u before. She has patience with what she wants to do &amp; will never give up until she gets there. She will be very persistent in what she is doing till she has reasons for stopping her project, then she will quit. Money for Taurus woman is not the most important factor in life. She thinks of money as an instrument for assuring a good living. She has more satisfactions in achieving her goals more than satisfactions in fine clothes &amp; luxuries. If u like a woman who always thinks of love &amp; romance, then u are dating the wrong girl. U cannot tell her to stay at home, she likes to work &amp; prefer not to work at home. She loves animals &amp; likes to be surrounded by animals. Love is in her head, but Freedom is in her soul. She has her own idea about love &amp; is afraid to show her true feelings for fear of rejection. She is not the type to talk<br>about love, but she sure has a strange way to show it. She's not good in showing when she is in love, but if she loves u she will be honest to u more than any other women. She will be honest to her loved one, but at the same time seems distant. U will have a good relationship with her, if u allow her freedom. Do not force her to be with u in a poker game which she hates, but let her goes out swing with her friends if she wants to. She will be different from other girls, &amp; she thinks differently is one of her unique quality. She is a public figure but belongs to no one. She will not stay with u, if she thinks u are not sincere. She likes u to have personality, but better not to compete with her. Loves her, but not too much for she's afraid it will limit her freedom. She always stands out of the crowd for something she dares to do. U could see her dress like a poor farmer dinning in the fancy restaurant, or dress like a nun in an a cocktail dress party. If u are a politician who are looking for a wife, she will make a good one because she is cleverly smart &amp; she could get along socially with any type of crowd. She's not a jealous type because she has to know u thoroughly before accepting u in her life. She has more curiosity in life than wondering if right now u are flirting with someone else. If u keep a distance from her, or go away for a few days, she will miss u more. Even when she is dating u, she's also able to be fond of someone else, if u do not have something she is looking for. She will never disappoint u or hide behind your back to make u lose face, but she is the type who's just going to tell u to your face that " We're better off breaking up". She always remembers her first love. Taurus woman holds the best record for divorce for she does not care about how people think of her, but everything should be done for "Happiness". She has lots of friends &amp; sure of herself, so u will hardly see that she delays any of her thoughts before her action. If she thinks of something, she will go ahead &amp; does it. She has many men wanting her for her constant changes is the challenge. She can be cute &amp; funny, but suddenly cool &amp; tough. She has her own style of dressing up, so u could see her dress like an old mate today, &amp; tomorrow she may dress like she comes from Mars. She will have that interesting hair, dress &amp; a look unique from anyone else. She likes to learn about your dreams &amp; your thoughts. She has fun teasing u &amp; making jokes. If she did something wrong, she won't hide it from u, but do not ask when she is not in the mood to talk about it. She hates to owe people money &amp; take promises seriously. If u promise to pay her back, u'd better paid up. If u want to make it with Taurus woman, then do not be jealous or possessive, do not be narrow-minded, do not criticize about nonsense or small &amp; insignificant matters. Try to like her friends &amp; let her has privacy, then she can be very sweet to u.<br><br></div>
