            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">CANCER MAN </span></strong><br><br>The most sensitive man &amp; the weakest emotional type in all Zodiac. Most Artists are Cancer. Cancer is controlled by the "Moon" &amp; the moon changes its shape daily, so Cancer man's emotional moods changes all the time too. U will be confused with him &amp; yet it is his constant changes that "Charm" u. He ever goes to get what he wants directly, but he will wait for a chance &amp; opportunity to do so. Once he gets what he wants, he will not lose it, except that he's tired of it by himself. The most sensitive man who cannot stand rejection. He cares what other people feel or think of him. He hates losing face &amp; tends to over-protect himself, so sometimes people might think he is a cold person. Gifted, creative, imaginative, is Cancer. Mystery &amp; complexity plays a major role in a life of a Cancer man. He could be very funny, very quiet, suddenly very sad. Living with him could be very unexpected, for u will not know what is his next mood. If u like excitement &amp; surprise, u have found the right guy &amp; never get a chance to be bored. He thinks of his home as "nest" &amp; it is the safest place for him. If he feels hurt or depressed, he will stay at home alone quietly. Once he feels better, he will come out of his retreat &amp; lives normally again. Being a loser is not for him. It is so easy to fall in love with this guy because he is gentle &amp; very polite. His wit &amp; creative mind could win your affection. He will come out from his nest to protect u even if he is not opening himself up to other people much. Not many people will win his heart. His security is only when he has money in his pocket. Once he feels secure, then he might think of having a happy family. Even if he likes to make &amp; keep money, he is not stingy. Spending money is part of his good image, so he will be happy to spend money to take u out to a very expensive restaurant or buy a jewellery for u. Certainly when he has money ok. He is possessive to everything that he thinks belong to him. Don't try to talk to another cute guy in front of him, he will get suspicious because he is not very secure or confident in himself for this kind of competition. Once u know each other too much, he will start to look for new excitement, but not to worry for he will always think of u. If he thinks u are the true love for him, &amp; u try to disappear once. U will be sure he will come &amp; look for u. He is a shy guy, but if he likes u, u can get up in the morning &amp; see that he is in front of your house everyday till u go out with him, a very persistent guy. He likes secure, cheerful &amp; lively woman, confident but yet at the same time always act proper &amp; appropriate. He likes secure woman, but is able to adjust to his rapid changes. A very difficult type to find woman indeed. In the beginning, u &amp; him will be so sugary sweet together &amp; he will only think of u. This so "super romance" will not last forever, so don't slip this chance. If u are the one who want his interest, then act &amp; make yourself interesting. Be a supportive person &amp; gives him compliment sometimes, but not too much till he thinks that u are insincere. Unlike many other Zodiac, if he is mad then u better get out of that room. He will calm himself down. Giving him a slight touch on his shoulders or concerned facial _expression are enough. He loves his mother, so try to be his mother's favorite, but do not act like his mother!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">CANCER WOMAN </span></strong><br><br>When she is in love, she will act both ways. Firstly, shy &amp; polite, trembling to be near u. Second, attach to u like glue &amp; trying to be with u all the time. She will try to go home with u after work, or have every lunch with u. It is ok if u like her too, but if it's not the case, u will feel very uncomfortable. She hates to be talked about or gossiped by someone else. If she gets to know about it, she will be very hurt. In nature she is a shy type, except she has been influenced by some other Zodiac. She is not a brave or daring type, so if u like her, then u better be the one who start first. She will not accept her true feeling, so if u like here, u have better tell her first. She is like a musical note - always changing in tunes, so 1 minute she can be funny &amp; cheerful, &amp; the other minute she can be sad &amp; depressed. Other people may think of her as "Over-acting", or "Over-reacting". When she is depressed, she will go out &amp; look for things to make it up. She loves money, &amp; thinks of having "Money" as "happy", not as "God". She will not look down at u if u aren't rich, but she will help u make money, save money. She is not an extravagant person &amp; sometimes will tell u not to buy her expensive &amp; useless gift. She is the type who enjoys long &amp; quiet walks. Cancer woman also influenced by the "moon", so under the moonlight she will be a fascinating woman. She has a constant fear for many things. She fears not being smart enough, not pretty enough. Even if she is not fat, she will not be satisfied. Assuring her of her looks would help, because she can change mood 4 times a day. She is not stingy, but u shouldn't be surprised if u see her collect old or broken junks. She sees that everything are useful to her. She will find a way to re-use them some day. She is not a jealous type, but possessive. The best part of her is that she will sacrifice everything for her loved one without any limit. Don't leave her in times of troubles, she will never forget it. She is not a weak type, even though she looks like one, ie. if u argue with her, she might cry her heart out. Once u left, she will wipe her tears &amp; start to clean up her apartment normally. She is a very careful mother &amp; will look after her kids in every aspect of life. If she is a mother of your children, u are at ease, but if she is your mother-in-law, u will suffer. Not to worry, this type of mother-in-law will not let her own daughter be an "Old mate". She could be moody &amp; argue with u for many minor things like many women, but she always wait &amp; want to take care of u. If u argue with her &amp; disappear for a few days, she will be waiting for u, but not for long ok. This kind of testing is risky, try not to do it. The Cancer woman need 2 things to be happy --- "Work" &amp; "Love". She can live in a dusty house, but she cannot live in that same house with no Love.<br><br></div>
