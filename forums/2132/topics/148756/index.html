            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>ARIES MAN </strong></span><br><br>He always let other people walk in front of him, but he will get there first.<br>He is a very careful guy &amp; small obstacles won't make him fall easily even if he thinks life is a very serious matter. He is as romantic as any other Zodiac. He could look gentle, but inside he is as strong as steel. Once he determines to do something, he is serious about doing it well. He will keep any pressure or insult deep down inside without showing emotions. U will never see his emotion of burden or disappointment &amp; always wonder what he thinks or feels. He will keep his feelings well. U will never see a guy in this Zodiac involves in other people business. He's always concerned with his own business. Sometimes he can be talkative, but he will never give anyone advice if he has not been asked. If u ask for advice, he will certainly give u one. He respects elderly &amp; senior, so u will see that he is the type who visit his parents steadily or often. He's slightly shy but also stubborn. He will find many ways to make u happy when u are with him, till u realize he is the important person for u. Once he is in the "Power Position", he will use his power gently. He is a good leader &amp; "Gentleness" is one of his effective method for exploiting his power. It is although he is borne to be a leader. He never hides his ambition, &amp; he is a workaholic. He will not take any position that he has no control. He will work very hard to reach his goal &amp; satisfaction. Compliment from his boss or superior are never enough for him, he wants his deserved reward. His deep insecurity makes him reach &amp; collect valuable things, &amp; for this u may think he's stingy. Actually he could easily spend money to buy things, travelling or pay for things that makes him happy &amp; also are necessities to him. He cares what other people think of him &amp; wants to get good comments or compliments. Outside he looks like stone &amp; steel, but inside he is a fragile person. He will hide &amp; cover up weak emotion &amp; sadness in order to maintain &amp; keep up his "Image". One method of cover-up u could easily notice is out of a sudden he becomes quiet, cold, or act very strong or very secure. Often, he feels insecure, even when he's serious about his life &amp; his own surroundings. This is the man who never hurries to get married, so hardly sit back &amp; regret about his marriage later. If he gets married, he needs to be very certain. It will take a long time for such decision, so if u tell him that u are "breaking up", u better forget him for good because he will never come back. He always keeps his promise. If he said he will meet u in your place in 2 hours' time, then he will be there, unless some serious accidents or unavoidable things occur. He hates people who is late for date or any appointment. He likes to think woman should be a follower &amp; taking care of family &amp; work is a man duty. He doesn't like to compete with his girlfriend or his wife at work because competition already exist with himself &amp; other people. He will be very proud if he can afford &amp; care for his family. Do not try to over-power or insult him, he can't stand it. He likes to be in control of everything, every situation. He likes "Classy Woman", if she also comes from a good family then it is a Plus. It will make him feel proud &amp; very ego about her status. Flashy type of woman, forget it. He likes a perfect or a nearly perfect housewife. He tends to be possessive. He will not tell u if he is mad at u, but will act very moody to show u instead. He likes to hear sweet words &amp; compliment so u can get his interest that way. If he approaches u to ask u out, do not act too stubborn or fool around too much. He will get tired &amp; just disappears. He has to feel confident. When he's around u, so knowing this fact u should know what to do, right! If u want him, u have to make him feel like he is the most important person for u. He likes a kind-hearted woman, polite &amp; can get along with his family. When he feels sad, do not leave him alone, but be very supportive. Kind words &amp; your smile will win him over, so this strong man will be like a chicken in your palm.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>ARIES WOMAN </strong></span><br><br>She thinks the world is watching her through the eye glasses of rose petal frame. She thinks people think &amp; talk about her only about good things &amp; often disappointed to know the fact that they are not true &amp; not even real, so she will feel hurt. She thinks her path has to be a beautiful one. She thinks only positive things so she prepares &amp; always make arrangements for herself to be in the right path, quite systematic indeed. If there's no guy in her life, she will be busy with herself. This seemingly ordinary woman will push herself to meet her goal. Her face mostly will be slim &amp; long, high cheek bone, eye brow slightly curve up, slight tall more than short, thin lips &amp; she will have quite a confusing or mixture of characters. Sometimes, she will be very careful about the guys she will mingle with. She thinks as if she has a main CPU in her head &amp; she could memorize everything from her childhood. When she faces problems, she will handle them &amp; solve them very well, &amp; at the same time showing other people that she has that capability. She can put her mind in solving problems in crisis better than many other Zodiac. Once she's determined to do things, nothing will stop her. Woman in this Zodiac could be totally different from one woman to another woman. U could see her in the party dancing flash-dance or dirty-dancing as well, u could also see her as an old-fashioned lady or a geek. She could be someone flashy &amp; wanted by many men, or she could be a cold &amp; non-social person. She will have her own way to win u over. Once she chooses u, she will need to be proud of u. "Love" is not as important to her as "Marriage". Her real goal in life is "Safety" &amp; her position in other people's sight need to be "Secure". She plans her life, &amp; social life easily &amp; very carefully. She is also very artistic &amp; realistic, so if u are a nobody or nothing, no chance because she loves ambition &amp; a good life. She need lots of love, but do not want &amp; do not believe in an occasional or unconventional love. She is proud in nature, so if u see a woman in this Zodiac comes from a poor family, she will act like a woman from a noble family by birth anyway (certainly there are always exception). She always look cool even when she's not. She likes to make people see her as "secure &amp; confident" even though she is has mixed emotion &amp; is a mixed character type. If she is mad, u can tell right away &amp; she can stay moody for quite a long time. U never have all her time, for she likes to work hard &amp; also spent some spare times working for charity. U will see woman in this zodiac a "Volunteer" for camp, &amp; if she is in a high society, she will most likely be a President or a V.P. of a "Club". She is romantic &amp; artistic, but being poor &amp; unstable is certainly not in her dreams. Her beautiful imaginations need to be realistic, for failure is not in her plan. A Goat always climbs high, so either she starts from a low point or a high point, she will make sure at the end she will have the best spot. She will not show her ambition, but she will show that she's satisfied with herself now. Once u look back she already moved up again, quietly but sure. If she is your loved one, be supportive &amp; understand her. She is stubborn, but she will listen. She will act like a gentle fragile person, but in fact she can stick u down like a super glue without u knowing it.<br><br></div>
