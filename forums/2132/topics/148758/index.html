            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>CAPRICORN WOMAN </strong></span><br><br>A tall slim, cool &amp; quiet woman. Once she is mad, she can be very fierce. She can work better than some men &amp; she is a very high confident woman. In her opinion, woman is not just a flower or decoration at home or at an office &amp; is certainly not a weak sex who needs protection. She likes to control &amp; hide her weak emotions. She will never try to change anyone, but she will learn to accept them as they are. If she does not like someone, she will not comment or criticize but she will completely ignore that person. She hates plastic &amp; artificial flower because it make her feel that u are not being sincere. She loves real flower &amp; its scent. She loves a guy who wear cologne after shave. If u are a type of a guy who wear your jeans one month before washing, or wear an old sneaker, then u can forget about her. She loves music &amp; nature even though there is exception. She loves to go picnic in nature, so if u don't have so much time to spare for her, u can take her fishing too. She is not as jealous as Aquarius or Leo woman, but do not cross the line OK. Better not to see her gets mad, especially in front of public when she feels like losing face. She loves to makeup &amp; dress perfectly &amp; very neat, so never rush her for this matter. She has her own goal in life &amp; does not care if u have a doctorate degree or not, if she thinks u are not bright then she will not care about u at all. She likes smart people by character not by certificate shown. If u can't show her this quality, go &amp; take a bus &amp; travel to the next stop. She does not like a dreamer who talk about his dream but never put his hands in action to make it happens. Don't bother to tell her "everyone is doing it, u should do it too", or "I think u should do it, it's good for u", because she will do what she wants to do only. She is a neat &amp; tidy person, so if your apartment is a pig sty, do not take her there. If u go out on a date with her, try to be presentable such as dress nice &amp; clean, clean nails or else it will be your last date. She is a cool type &amp; will not nag, so easy on your ears. She is a slow but sure type. She will always respect &amp; honor u &amp; will never try to make u lose your face. If she loves u, she will help u in anything u do. She likes to help people &amp; expect nothing in return. If she asks u for a favor &amp; does not get one, she will feel very disappoint. She has a high hope &amp; a high faith &amp; believe in her own confidence than believing in "Luck". If she is your wife, u will have nice &amp; clean home &amp; a gourmet cooking. If your parents visit your house, they will be pleased. She is a 3 in 1 means, a perfect mother, a perfect housewife, a perfect wife or u could say "happily ever after".</div>
