            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">VIRGO MAN </span></strong><br><br>Time is precious for Virgo man &amp; if u make him wait, he will consider that as an insult. He hates to hear criticism &amp; hates to be criticized. If he is criticizing other people, then he must be influenced by other Zodiac. He is &amp; he likes to be a perfectionist. He always thinks he's doing the right &amp; appropriate thing, &amp; often he thinks he makes no mistake. He is a bright guy &amp; could accept comments if he thinks it can improve himself. He is the type who's well adjusted to make changes. He will spend money carefully &amp; spent it worthwhile. He will only be extravagant for his personal pleasure. He is quite romantic, a type of guy who can drive 100 miles just to tell u how much he misses u. If he does not care about u, he will not even spend a dime to call u locally. Long distant special low-rate call is also out of the question. He hates rough &amp; crude people. His woman has to be clean &amp; well-dressed. He<br>inspects anything in details due to being a perfectionist, so u could be lying in your bikini with a perfect figure &amp; he can suddenly comment u about your big feet. If u gain 2 pounds, he may comment that u are getting too fat. Before going out with this kind of guy, look at yourself head to toe in the mirror &amp; ask yourself if u are really &amp; entirely ready. Unless he dates a model, then he will have less comments. He is neat &amp; tidy, so his life is always in a schedule, a fixed time for lunch, the same time to go home. He is knowledgable about food &amp; conscious about nutrition, so u won't see this guy eating junk food, or strange &amp; exotic food for sure. U will see him in social events or party if only necessary. He is gifted with acting, so if he says he cannot go out with u because he is sick, then u will believe him. He is hard to please when it comes to what to eat, how to work, what kind of a woman to date. He's always neat &amp; tidy all the times, even if he is in the army, he will be the cleanest soldier in the camp. He likes to speak properly with no slang. He hates laziness &amp; lazy people. He always acts like a boring mature adult, but upon knowing him, u will know that he has his own charm. He always sees things clearly, so he is not the type to be blinded by love. He is a kind &amp; cool guy, but if he's constantly irritated with rudeness, ignorant, or stupidity then he will show u that he is annoyed. U may see a guy in this Zodiac dressed up in an old shirt &amp; old jeans, but if u look carefully, u will see that his hair is neat &amp; unconsciously he will touch his hair a lot. His desk is always neat &amp; if he sees small scraps of papers on the floor, he will pick it up or throw it in the basket. People may think he is selfish, because when he says "No", he really means it. Any favor asked, he will help but always in his own limit. The more he<br>see faults in others, the less he wants people to see his. If u want him to change his faults, try to tell him gently or else he could take it as an insult. He wants love that comes with quality, so he only has a few loves in his life. Woman's trick will not work with him. If he breaks up with a woman, he will also try to avoid all her friends &amp; her environments too. He is very picky &amp; with every break-up, he will be twice careful next time. He can sweep woman with his charm, but he likes to keep his relationship like a friend. He likes a sincere self-confident woman, neat &amp; clean, perfect &amp; tidy. A real two "P", picky &amp; perfectionist Zodiac.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>VIRGO WOMAN </strong></span><br><br>She will be similar to Leo woman in appearance. A slim woman who walks with confidence &amp; proud. She has an egg-shaped facial structure, high &amp; round forehead. She likes to look straight as if she is searching. She is not a pretentious type &amp; will always say what she thinks. U will see Virgo woman walking fast. She will try her best to be perfect, to look perfect &amp; to feel perfect even though there is no such perfection. She is very delicate of what &amp; how she dress. She is bright but easily despaired with obstacles. She likes smart guy who will be compatible with her, so if u are a rich dumb guy, u can forget about her right now. She is not a very possessive or jealous person for she expects respect from her loved one. She does not like a part-time lover, or a temporary mate. If she finds her dream man, she will grap the opportunity. If she does not like u, she will always keep a certain distance. Act proper &amp; appropriate is her discipline. She dislikes &amp; can't stand bad languages, cursing words or phrase. She likes a gentleman who opens the doors for her. She wants to feel protected &amp; when a man is taking care of her, she will feel like a complete woman. She memorizes everything about other people &amp; about herself very well. She can really keep secrets, u can trust her on this. She likes refreshing &amp; mild scent. She is very delicate in maintaining her beauty, so u could see her seriously picking soap which matches &amp; suits her skin most. Do not comment her on these very picky habits, it is her happiness in working full times as a self beautifier. She is not an innocent angel for sometimes she can be as tough as steel. Even though she's easily despaired, she is not the type who cries over it. She belongs to a shy type, so making speech in front of the room can make her nervous even when she walks &amp; talks confidently. She only searches for true love, not just any love. Her love is an ideal one. She likes to think no one is neater &amp; as attractive as her, which can irritate u sometimes for there is no such thing. She likes sweet talk, but she can slip &amp; say something unpredictable &amp; unbearable to u too. When she stops getting mad, she will totally forget what she has just said &amp; be an angel again. If u have a date with her, u'd better be there on time. Flowers &amp; sweet words can calm her down. If u want to apologize, make it brief &amp; straightforward. Do not drag your apologetic words into a long making-it-up events, it could lead u to another world war. She likes her man to dress nice &amp; clean. She is good in details, especially with money. Do not make her thinks that she is a clown or looks funny. Initially, upon knowing her, please try not to glance at other pretty woman so much. Early period of dating her, try not to hold her so much in public, it would not be a proper thing to do. She loves books, stage-play &amp; music &amp; likes to criticize about them too. Criticism is her icon, including major &amp; minor things in life starting from your hair, your dress &amp; the way u talk. If u are in love with her, be as almost perfect as u can.</div>
