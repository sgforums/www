            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evNHMcrW7R0<br><br>This footage is very very scary and is 100% real as shown on CNN only last month with an exclusive interview with Demonologist Lorraine Warren, who is currently leading the investigation.The babys crib is to the left of the door but isnt shown due to anonymity. The parents had it edited out by zooming in on where the occurances are seen. The legs and part of the crib can still be seen. This is the clip of the incredible footage of a ghost caught on tape by the parents of a 7 month old baby who is still currently being awakened at random by a ghost and annoyed. I recommend turning up the volume for this one and dont worry, even though the footage itself is shocking, there isnt anything that will make you jump up. If you turn up the volume you will hear the scary annoyances that poor baby had to go through. I heard a pig and crying. Not only the baby crying...the crying of a woman. Incredibly spooky. There wasnt anybody near that room for hours and the door opened and closed by itself. Demonologist 'Lorraine Warren',famous for her haunting investigations and many books, insists the footage is real and stated "no foul play what so ever by the childs parents with this" on CNN during the interview and stated that the entity caught on tape was "no trickery due to mishaps or mere shadows". She also mentioned that the entity cannot be passed off as a shadow due to the "contrast and severe cold it emits" as she too and her investigators have been "thumped by it" on 4 different occasions since taking the investigation. The mother told investigators that the baby stopped crying momentarily because he thought it was herself that had come in to check if he was alright. The growl followed and then the sound of the mothers voice crying even though she wasnt crying or near that room. The investagation is still going on and the child is being watched closely, both by the parents,Demonologist Lorraine Warren and unfortunately, by the entity aswell. According to Lorraine Warren, this entity has the ability to copy the voices of people, hence causing much confusion in the house between the parents. The father has been heard using VILE language from inside the childs room and sometimes from under the crib itself, even though he is always at work when it happens. The mother is often heard crying in different rooms around the house by her husband when she isnt crying atall and she, on many occasions, even heard her own voice... crying from both the attic and her babys bedroom. Some of this crying is heard in the footage you will see along with the other disturbances. Much more occurances have been recorded by Lorraine Warren and her team of investagtors but hasnt been shown to the public yet due to the parents wishes of anonymity. Im glad i dont live there!
