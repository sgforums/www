Bush.[24] Police only realised that the motorcade was a hoax when Licciardello, dressed as Osama bin Laden, stepped out of an official-looking car replete with bonnet-mounted Canadian flag and complained in-character about not being invited.[25]<br><br>Licciardello, Morrow and the nine crew members were immediately detained by NSW Police, taken to Surry Hills Police Station, questioned and charged with entering a restricted area without special justification under the APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007.[26]. All were released on bail to appear in court on 4 October 2007.[27] If found guilty they each face a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment, or up to 2 years if they were in possession of a "prohibited item".[28] NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione stated that the Chaser stars risked being targeted by snipers during the prank.[29]<br><br>The Chaser team gained approval from lawyers, employed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, to carry out the stunt under the impression that the team would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and not allowed entry into the APEC security zone.[30] However, the team managed to pass through two police security checkpoints, in view of snipers, using a fake convoy of hired limousines, despite the fine print on the "APEC 2007 Official Vehicle" vehicle stickers reading "This vehicle belongs to a member of The Chaser's War on Everything. This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him".[31]<br><br>Despite condemnations by various public officials, most notably the NSW Minister for Police, the Sydney correspondent to the BBC reported that the Chaser team had become 'folk heroes' following the stunt.[32] Furthermore, 87% of some 28,451 respondents to a web poll conducted by the Sydney Morning Herald found the stunt funny.[33] Indeed, Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, appeared amused when asked to comment.[31]<br><br>Later on 7 September 2007, three members of the Chaser and their film crew were questioned and released over a follow-up stunt involving running near the protected APEC zone dressed in cardboard cars topped with Canadian flags.[34]<br><br>The Chaser announced that the episode to be aired on 12 September 2007 would officially be renamed The Chaser's War On APEC[35], however, this was not done. The episode ended up giving The Chaser's War on Everything their highest ever ratings for an episode with 2.245 million viewers tuning in across Australia</blockquote>So cool! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Police Minister not impressed over Chaser stunt<br><br>New South Wales Police Minister David Campbell says he is extremely concerned that the ABC TV program The Chaser's War on Everything has taken APEC security so lightly.<br><br>Police have confirmed that 11 people are being questioned after being arrested at about 11.30 am AEST.<br><br>Three cars have also been seized, with officers investigating alleged breaches of the APEC security zone.<br><br>Eight cast and crew members and three hire car drivers are being questioned by police about the stunt.<br><br>The stunt involved driving a fake motorcade into the northern part of the CBD including Macquarie Street, with one of the crew dressed as Osama bin Laden.<br><br>Mr Campbell says the situation is not funny and is being treated seriously by the APEC Investigation Squad.<br><br>"This is an extremely serious issue," he said.<br><br>"The Government has made the point time and time again, that we've got the most serious, the biggest security operation in Australia's history.<br><br>"We've got 21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time and it needs to be taken seriously."<br><br>Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer says the arrests show the APEC security system is working.<br><br>"Whatever you think of the humour of the Chaser, the honest truth is they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way," he said.<br><br>"They presumably were, as is the nature of their show, aiming to humiliate a lot of well known people."<br><br>The program was further told that any perceived threat to security would be dealt with as a threat and their profile would not necessarily protect them.<br><br>Police say they are not embarrassed that the fake motorcade managed to get close to Mr Bush's Sydney hotel before it was stopped.<br><br>Assistant Police Commissioner Dave Owens says security measures have since been reviewed but he insists the incident proves that police tactics are working.<br><br>"I'm not embarrassed at all," he said.<br><br>"What I am is very angry that such a stunt like this would be pulled.<br><br>"We have 21 world leaders here, and whilst I enjoy like everyone else a good laugh, this isn't funny."</blockquote></div>
