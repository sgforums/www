I do see alot of people not helping. Sad to say. Most of them are youngsters. Or young adults. Those that helps around are actually the older generation. (age... 30+ and above)<br><br>You sure singaporeans will really do nothing in this situation. Seriously. In singapore, if any girl is being flashed naked in public. And that place is farking crowded. There will be people who will get that 3 girls down on the floor. Someone with a top or jacket. Someone calling the police. THEN THE REST IS ON THEIR FARKING MOBILE PHONE TAKING THE FARKING PICTURES OR VIDEO.<br><br>I don't think that ALL singaporeans are MYOB kind of attitude. But i do agree with your last sentence. Too many SGers are MYOB...<br><br>I'm quite pissed. About MYOB singaporeans and they being VERY proud about it.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
