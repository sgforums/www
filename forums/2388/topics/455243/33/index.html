              Stephen Hawking
              
              Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (Listeni/ËˆstiË�vÉ™n ËˆhÉ”Ë�kÉªÅ‹/ stee-vÉ™n haw-king; born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. Among his significant scientific works have been a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularities theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vocal supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
              
              He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.
              
              Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his A Brief History of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking has a motor neuron disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition that has progressed over the years. He is almost entirely paralysed and communicates through a speech generating device. He married twice and has three children. In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalization of assisted suicide for the terminally ill.

As a child, he struggled mentally and emotionally as well as physically, but eventually came to terms with his disability and, at the age of seventeen, started his own non-profit organisation, Life Without Limbs. Vujicic presents motivational speeches worldwide on life with a disability, on hope, and on finding meaning in life. He also speaks about his belief that God can use any willing heart to do his work and that God is big enough to overcome any disability.

              Is the story of Hua Mulan true or just a folklore? Well, in my opinion...the possibility of this heroine existence would not have been narrated in the ancient Chinese poetry without any plausible genuine story behind it. This ancient Chinese Heroine figure existence is yet to be discovered by many Chinese Historians in China.
              
              The Legend of Mulan
              
              No other woman in Chinese history has inspired more admiration than Mulan, who is considered an embodiment of loyalty and filial piety. The ancient story of Mulan enlisting in the military on her aging fatherâ€™s behalf is one of Chinaâ€™s most treasured legends and included in every Chinese school textbook. The story has also become quite well known outside China through a Disney animation film that has popularized this celebrated Chinese heroine.
              
              Mulan was an actual person. Her last name was Hua. She was born in a small rural village in northern China, and purportedly lived from 581 to 618 AD during the Sui Dynasty, though other records place her between 386 and 534 AD, during the Northern Wei Dynasty. While the dates may be disputed, her story is unequivocal.
              
              Mulanâ€™s father was a soldier and raised Mulan like a boy. She not only learned weaving and embroidery from her mother, but also practiced martial arts, equitation, archery, and fencing with her father. In her spare time she liked to read her fatherâ€™s manuals on military strategy.

              JOAN OF ARC
              
              Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc, IPA: [Ê’an daÊ�k]; ca. 1412 â€“ 30 May 1431), nicknamed "The Maid of OrlÃ©ans" (French: La Pucelle d'OrlÃ©ans), is a folk heroine of France and a Roman Catholic saint. She was born to a peasant family in north-east France. Claiming divine guidance, she led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War, which paved the way for the coronation of Charles VII of France. She was captured by the Burgundians, transferred to the English in exchange for money, put on trial by the pro-English Bishop of Beauvais Pierre Cauchon for charges of "insubordination and heterodoxy", and was burned at the stake for heresy when she was 19 years old.
