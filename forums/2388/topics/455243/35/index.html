              This Peter King was an outstanding British military man.
                  
              Peter King (British Army officer)
                  
              Peter Frank King (b. Caxton, Cambridgeshire, 30 October 1916, d. Lake Wahapo, near Whataroa, New Zealand, 12 December 1962) was a British Commando in World War II, who was commissioned in the field and awarded the Military Cross. He also served in Korea with the New Zealand Army, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1951. King died in a car accident in 1962.
                  
              King joined the Dental Corps in March 1939 and served as a non-technician, excelling as a weapons instructor. He spent two years in this role, rapidly becoming a drill sergeant at the Dental Corps' depot, but then applied to transfer to a fighting unit. This was refused. King was so frustrated that he and another soldier, Pte Leslie Cuthbertson, then 20 and from Newcastle-upon-Tyne took matters in their own hands; they planned and executed an unofficial and unauthorised raid on occupied France.
                  
              King emigrated to New Zealand in 1946 and worked as a factory manager in Christchurch and as a bushman at Otautau, Southland.[3] He joined the New Zealand Army in November 1950 for war service in Korea (Kayforce).
                  
              In November, 1951, Kingâ€”now a Captain with the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artilleryâ€”and a signaller, Gunner Derek Rixon, manned a forward artillery observation post (OP) for New Zealand artillery supporting a company of The King's Own Scottish Borderers on Hill 355. The first large scale Chinese attack was broken up by the guns but, when their OP's communications were cut, the two men joined in the close-quarters defence of the hill, each becoming wounded. After two hours, the position was abandoned and Rixon carried King to safety. For his "tenacity, commitment and courage", King was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Rixon received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his "fine example of courage, commitment and comradeship while fighting alongside his officer". King was described as "the genius of gunner observers" by a Scottish infantryman.
                  
              From July to September 1952, King commanded 161st Battery before his return to New Zealand.
                  
              Out of the Army, King returned to the South Island, working at Te Anau as a trail guide. Late in 1954, he was selected to join the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan in Kashmir and he was commissioned as a Major in the regular Army. Between 1956 and 1959,[5] King served on the Kashmir cease-fire line based at Srinagar.
                  
              King married Dorothy Woodham Graham on 18 April 1959 at Blenheim; she was a postmistress and daughter of the well-known alpine guide Alec Graham. The couple subsequently had a son and a daughter. He retired from the Army in 1960 and worked for the New Zealand Forest Service at Otautau before being appointed as the first Chief Park Ranger of Westland National Park in 1960.
              
              Peter King drowned on 12 December 1962. He was travelling to a meeting in Hokitika when his car, out of control, went into Lake Wahapo, South Westland. He is buried at Whataroa, South Westland.

              TRUE STORY OF BRAVO TWO ZERO
                  
              Bravo Two Zero was the call sign of an eight-man British Army SAS patrol, deployed into Iraq during the First Gulf War in January 1991. According to one patrol member's account, the patrol were given the task of "gathering intelligence;... finding a good LUP (lying up position) and setting up an OP [observation post]" on the Iraqi Main Supply Route (MSR) between Baghdad and North-Western Iraq, while according to another, the task was to find and destroy Iraqi Scud missile launchers along a 250 km (160 mi) stretch of the MSR.
                  
              The patrol was the subject of several books. Accounts in the first two books, by patrol commander Andy McNab's Bravo Two Zero (1993) followed by Chris Ryan's The One That Got Away (1995), as well as those by the SAS's RSM at the time of the patrol, Peter Ratcliffe (Eye of the Storm, 2000), did not always correspond, leading to accusations from the media of lying.[citation needed] The investigative book The Real Bravo Two Zero (2002) by Michael Asher, followed the patrol route and interviewed witnesses. The subsequent book, Soldier Five by patrol member Mike Coburn (Kiwi Mike), was released in 2004. For McNab's conduct during the patrol, he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, whilst Ryan, and two other patrol members (Steven Lane and Robert Consiglio) were awarded the Military Medal.

              TRUE STORY OF SERPICO
              
              Serpico on Serpico
              
              HARLEMVILLE, N.Y. â€” He looked like some sort of fur trapper, this bearded man walking through the snowy woods here in upstate New York. But then, Frank Serpico has always been known for his disguises.
              
              Anyone who has seen the celebrated 1973 film â€œSerpicoâ€� knows that he often dressed up â€” bum, butcher, rabbi â€” to catch criminals. His off-duty look was never vintage cop either, with the bushy beard and the beads.
              
              This is the man whose long and loud complaining about widespread corruption in the New York Police Department made him a pariah on the force. The patrolman shot in the face during a 1971 drug bust while screaming for backup from his fellow officers, who then failed to immediately call for an ambulance. The undaunted whistle-blower whose testimony was the centerpiece of the Knapp Commission hearings, which sparked the biggest shakeup in the history of the department.
              
              Four decades later, Frank Serpico is still bearded, handsome and a flamboyant dresser. At 73, he seems spry enough to chase down and collar a perp; on that wintry walk through the woods, he interrogated a man carrying a sled, and followed a trail of blood drops in the snow until it disappeared. Not long before, he had sniffed out a dumper of garbage on his property and reported him to the police.
              
              Mr. Serpico still carries the detective shield he was awarded as he left the department on a disability pension and, often, his licensed revolver, with which he takes target practice on his 50-acre property not far from this Columbia County hamlet. He also still carries bullet fragments lodged just below his brain from the drug shooting; he is deaf in his left ear, and has nerve damage in his left leg.

              Hmm...believe it or not..it is base on true story.
              
              Based On A True Story: The Serpent &amp; The Rainbow
              
              Before Night of the Living Dead, zombies werenâ€™t a terribly common horror movie trope. Itâ€™s weird to think about this since theyâ€™re so common these days. To an obnoxious degree, even! Got a few bucks and want to make a horror movie on the weekends? Zombie flick. Do it. Thereâ€™s a legion of fans out there so stupid and ga-ga for zombies that you could make a movie about people shooting zombies in for an hour and a half and the fanboy legion of doom would hardly notice that nothing else happens. Before George Romero came along and revolutionized horror, though, zombies were an obscure bit of island folklore and nothing more. Unlike the zombie apocalypse, the old notion of the voodoo zombie has not been done to death and some of my favorite spookfests walk in the footsteps of White Zombie, the classic Lugosi horror that is as heavy on Belaâ€™s intense presence and overacting as it is on atmosphere.
              
              The idea of the voodoo zombie, a body stuck somewhere between life and death, able to think and speak but unable to do much more than you are told by the person who made you. Itâ€™s a pretty fucked up concept in horror and is ripe for a comeback. Somebody make this happen. Itâ€™s about on par with the idea of being buried alive which, coincidentally, is a part of making an actual zombie. With A Nightmare On Elm Street, Wes Craven managed to revive the dying slasher movie and breathed new life into horror, which was already beginning to sputter out after a flood of cut-rate slasher flicks drowned any momentum the genre may have gained in the wake of Halloween. Unfortunately, he dropped the ball with just about everything he directed in the aftermath of that hit. The Hills Have Eyes sequel is dud of epic proportions and Deadly Friend is incomprehensible. To break out of this trail spin, he took on a book by Wade Davis, an ethnobotanist who spent time in Haiti while researching voodoo zombies. The result was The Serpent and the Rainbow.

              The Serpent and the Rainbow 
              
              The Serpent and the Rainbow is a 1988 horror film directed by Wes Craven and starring Bill Pullman. The script by Richard Maxwell and Adam Rodman is loosely based on the non-fiction book of the same name by ethnobotanist Wade Davis, wherein Davis recounted his experiences in Haiti investigating the story of Clairvius Narcisse, who was allegedly poisoned, buried alive, and revived with a herbal brew which produced what was called a zombie.

              RABIES
                  
              Rabies (/ËˆreÉªbiË�z/; from Latin: rabies - madness) is a viral disease that causes acute encephalitis in warm-blooded animals. The disease is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted to humans from another species (such as dogs), commonly by a bite from an infected animal. For a human, rabies is almost invariably fatal if postexposure prophylaxis is not administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death.
                  
              The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The incubation period of the disease is usually a few months in humans, depending on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system. Once the rabies virus reaches the central nervous system and symptoms begin to show, the infection is virtually untreatable and usually fatal within days.
                  
              Early-stage symptoms of rabies are malaise, headache and fever, progressing to acute pain, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, depression, and hydrophobia. 
                  
              Finally, the patient may experience periods of mania and lethargy, eventually leading to coma. The primary cause of death is usually respiratory insufficiency. Rabies causes about 55,000 human deaths annually worldwide. 95% of human deaths due to rabies occur in Asia and Africa. Roughly 97% of human rabies cases result from dog bites. In the United States, animal control and vaccination programs have effectively eliminated domestic dogs as reservoirs of rabies. In several countries, including Australia, Japan, and Singapore, rabies carried by terrestrial animals has been eliminated entirely. While classical rabies has been eradicated in the United Kingdom, bats infected with a related virus have been found in the country on rare occasions.

              Sometimes when I was upset or having a misunderstanding with my wife in my younger days....I would simply drove my car to the beach, listen to some songs to calm and console my inner soul. I would close my eyes and listen to the lyrics...to free and heal me of any hurts.

              As you can see, these international tourists, majority are Aussies by the way, they don't dress up for night entertainments in Bali. I remember Bounty...it was only a hotel and restaurant..and now its a discotheque/bar. Paddy's Club..well they were not so popular in the past. I used to bring my international tourist friends at Sari Club in Legian Street or Gado-Gado at Seminyak which was a beach front discotheque like the present Ku De Ta in Bali. I remember a place called Peanuts Club where they would call the girls to come up onto the stage. Then the dj and audiences would tease, persuade and cheer them to lift-up the front of their t-shirt to bare their naked breasts. And most of them would do it....free show...lols....well you can also see naked breasts while eating at the restaurants by the pool..loll.  Well, these places are not in business anymore. 
                  
              One thing about Bali, you don't feel you are in Indonesia...its more like you are in the western world. The night life in Bali is until 5am or 6am.

              I watched this movie last night....reminded me of the movie Armageddon produced in the same year of 1998. 
                      
              The President of U.S.A. who acted within this Deep Impact movie was a Black Guy, the same guy who acted as The President of U.S.A. in the movie of 2013. Well, deep impact and 2013 could be like a sequel movie...first about Gigantic Comet the size of New York City going to hit earth and then earth was saved but there was this polar shift that took place in 2013 and the world was in dilemma to seek for the best solutions for the survival of Mankind. 
                      
              Between Armageddon and Deep Impact movie...I preferred Deep Impact. More reality in the moments of life and death...sacrifices and family ties. 
                      
              About the moral story of these movies....Mankind will only be One Nation when Earth and its population is threaten from deep space.
                      
              Hope you enjoy watching this movie.

              What is an Extinction Level Event?
              
              An extinction event (also extinction-level event, ELE) is a period in time when a large number of species die out. The normal background rate of extinctions is about two to five families of marine invertebrates and vertebrates every million years. Since life began on Earth, this background extinction rate has been punctuated by seven major extinction events.
