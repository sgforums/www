              TRUE STORY OF THE GREAT ESCAPE
              
              The Great Escape, as it came to be known, was a mass escape attempt from the prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III located near the Polish town of Zagan. 
              
              The purpose-built camp was opened in April 1942 and the Germans considered it to be practically escape-proof. Prisoners were fairly well treated and the Geneva Convention of 1929 regarding treatment of Prisoners of War was followed.
              
              Housing and recreational facilities were considered to be better than those at many other German prisoner of war camps. The picture (right) shows the inside of one of the barracks at Stalag Luft III.
               
              The camp housed mainly British and American airmen whose planes had crashed on Axis territory. The Germans generally captured prisoners with the words 'For you the war is over.' However, it was the sworn duty of all captured military personnel to continue to fight the enemy by surviving, communicating information and escaping. Many of the prisoners at Sagan were re-captured escapees. The Germans believed that security at the new camp was so tight that it would be impossible for anyone to escape.
              
              Escape Committee
              
              It was realised early on that for any escape attempt to succeed it had to be well planned and organised. The Prisoners at Sagan therefore established an escape committee. Chief escape officer was Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, a former escapee who had been recaptured several times. He was known as 'Big X'.
               
              The committee decided to build three tunnels and the plan was to effect the escape of at least 200 prisoners. The tunnels were given the code names 'Tom', 'Dick' and 'Harry'. There were two main problems to be considered - How to get rid of the dirt that was dug away and how to prevent the tunnels from collapsing.
               
              In order to prevent the tunnels from collapsing they had to be shored up with wood. The prisoners used bed boards for this task and as the tunnels grew longer and more wood was needed many prisoners found themselves sleeping uncomfortably on beds with little support. Some even converted their beds to hammocks. The picture (right) shows how the bed boards were used.
               
              Getting rid of the dirt from the tunnels was problematic because the earth removed was a different colour to the earth around the camp. One method used was to construct long bags which could be filled with earth then hidden in the trouser legs. A cord around the neck would open the bags thus releasing the earth on a patch of ground that was being dug or cultivated by another prisoner. Those dispersing the dirt in this way were know as 'Penguins'. More than 100 tons of earth was disposed of in this way. Another method involved filling empty Red Cross boxes, placing the boxes in the middle of a group of men who would then gradually bury the earth.
              
              Other important members of the Escape Committee were the forgers who made maps and forged papers and the tailors who made civilian clothes out of blankets and other materials that were scrounged and altered uniforms. The picture (left) shows a jacket that was used by an escapee.
              
              The Escape
               
              The discovery of 'Tom' was a major blow to the escape committee and all tunneling had to be suspended for a time to avoid further detection. Eventually 'Harry' was completed and the night of the Great Escape was planned for 24th March 1944, a moonless night. Lots were drawn for the 200 places and maps, papers and disguises were completed.
               
              On the night itself all allotted escapees took up positions in hut 104. It was planned that the escapees would leave the camp in stages. Everyone was very nervous and tense, a situation that was made worse by the discovery that the tunnel was around 10 feet short of the woods. This meant that the tunnel exit was on the path of a perimeter guard. By the time that a decision was made on how to signal when the coast was clear, it was around 10pm. Further delays were caused by some men panicking in the tunnel.
               
              By 4am it was clear that it would be impossible for all 200 men to escape and the decision was made to close the tunnel at 5am. At around 4.45am a shot was heard at the tunnel exit. The tunnel had been discovered.
               
              76 men had escaped through the tunnel. Of the remainder, those that were found waiting their turn in hut 104 were sent to the cooler - the camp name for the solitary confinement cells.
              
              The Outcome
               
              Of the 76 men who escaped, 3 made it home to the UK. 23 were recaptured and sent back to Sagan. Hitler personally ordered the execution of the other 50 men.
               
              The commandant of Stalag Luft III, Lindeiner, was court-martialed by the Gestapo for not preventing the escape.
               
              Morale among the prisoners was low when the executions became common knowledge and few were keen to attempt further escape attempts.
               
              Although only 3 men managed to reach safety and 50 men were murdered, the escape caused havoc among the Germans. Thousands of police, Hitler Youth members and soldiers were diverted from wartime duties to search for the escapees.
               
              Urns containing the ashes of the 50 who were executed were brought to the camp. British airmen constructed the memorial (below) to commemorate their deaths.

              *********************************************
              
              A Fascinating True Story that Inspired â€œEscape to Victoryâ€�
                  
              We all remember the classic film, where the dream team of Pele and Bobby Moore, team up with Rambo, Michael Caine and Ipswich Townâ€™s John Wark to outwit the Gestapo and escape their prisoner of war camp through the power of beautiful game. Few people know however, that the plot of this football classic is in fact based, on a true story. This is the story of F.C Start and â€˜The Death Matchâ€™.
                  
              Football, in the 1930â€™s had become extremely popular in Eastern Europe, and one of the more successful teams in Ukraine were Dynamo Kiev. After the German invasion in 1941 however, the national league was cut short, and the players, who joined the army, were captured and sent to prisoner of war camps. In the Spring of 1942, the former Dynamo goalkeeper, Mykola Trusevych was released, and with the support of his boss at Bakery Number 3, set out to find his old team members. Trusevych found eight former Dynamo players, and, accompanied by three from rivals Lokomotiv Kiev began playing local military teams under the name F.C Start.
                  
              Following several convincing victories over Hungarian, Romanian and German teams, including a Luftwaffe team known as Flakelf, F.C Start were noticed by the leaders of their German occupiers. It was seen that the team had become a beacon of hope for the population of the city and it was decided that a rematch would be played between Start and Flakelf and this would be used as a propaganda tool for the Germans, therefore a much stronger team would be put out by the Luftwaffe.
                  
              The match was held in the Zenit Stadium in Kiev and was refereed by an SS officer. The exact size of the crowd was unknown but it is said that the heavy police presence did not deter the people of Kiev coming out to support their team against the occupiers. Before the match the referee entered the Start dressing room and instructed the players to perform the Nazi salute before the match. The Start players, unlike the England team upon their visit to Berlin in 1937, refused, and instead gave their own slogan, which roughly translates as an appraisal of physical strength.

              TRUE STORY OF THE GREAT RAID
              
              Leader of WWII's 'Great Raid' looks back at real-life POW rescue
              
              Bob Prince has never taken off the simple gold signet ring that his late wife, Barbara, gave him after they were married at Seattle's Church of the Epiphany on Jan. 31, 1942. 
              
              It can be seen in a 50-year-old photo taken around their third anniversary, when Prince was an Army Ranger serving an ocean away from Barbara, in the Philippine Islands.
               
              Then he was Capt. Robert W. Prince, 25, of the Army's elite Sixth Ranger Battalion. Prince, known for his coolness, just had been hand-picked by a man he deeply admired, Lt. Col. Henry Mucci, to lead 120 Rangers, Army Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas to rescue 512 prisoners of war from a nightmarish Japanese prison camp near the town of Cabanatuan.
               
              The "Great Raid," the subject of a new movie, was cloaked in secrecy and draped with urgency. The POWs included many who endured three years of starvation, disease and torture after the battle for Corregidor and the Bataan Death March. In August 1944, with defeat imminent, the Japanese War Ministry issued a "kill all policy" to cover up war crimes by executing the witnesses. Before the Cabanatuan raid was carried out, prisoners in a camp near Palawan had been drenched with aviation fuel and burned alive.

              TRUE STORY OF THE FLOWERS OF WAR
              
              MINNIE VAUTRIN
              
              Minnie Vautrin was born in Secor, Illinois. She was hard working and spent much of her childhood and teen years earning money to attend college. At 17, she attended Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. She then graduated from the University of Illinois. She began a career in teaching, starting with high school in LeRoy, Illinois.
               
              In 1912, Vautrin made her way to China as a missionary and teacher. During her first few years there she helped found a girls school in Luchowfu. After her first furlough, she returned and helped build and found Jinling Girls College in Nanjing, where she eventually took over as Master of Studies.
               
              When the Japanese army invaded Nanjing in December 1937, she and the other foreigners in the city, including John Rabe, worked to protect the civilians in the Nanking Safety Zone. Jinling Girls College became a haven of refuge, at times harboring up to 10,000 women in a college designed to support between 200 and 300. With only her wits and the use of an American flag, Vautrin was largely able to repel incursions into her college.
               
              Minnie recounted the horrors of the war in her diary in 1937:
               
              
              "There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today. Thirty girls were taken from language school last night, and today I have heard scores of heartbreaking stories of girls who were taken from their homes last nightâ€”one of the girls was but 12 years old. Food, bedding and money have been taken from people. â€¦ I suspect every house in the city has been opened, again and yet again, and robbed. Tonight a truck passed in which there were eight or ten girls, and as it passed they called out "æ•‘å‘½ï¼�æ•‘å‘½ï¼� Jiuming! Jiuming!"â€”save our lives. The occasional shots that we hear out on the hills, or on the street, make us realize the sad fate of some manâ€”very probably not a soldier."
               
              On 19 December :
               
              
              "In my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror."
               
              In 1938, she wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at inling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.
               
              In 1940, weary and stressed, Vautrin took a furlough again from her work. A few months later, haunted by the images she saw and feeling responsible for not being able to save more lives, Vautrin committed suicide by turning on the stove gas in her small apartment in Indianapolis.
               
              After the war, Vautrin was posthumously awarded the Emblem of the Blue Jade by the Chinese government for her sacrifices during the Nanjing Massacre. Her work saving the lives of Chinese civilians during the massacre is recounted in the biographical book, American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking, written by historian Hu Hualing.
               
              In the documentary film Nanking, Vautrin was portrayed by actress Mariel Hemingway, who recited excerpts from Vautrin's diary.

              TRUE STORY ABOUT MEMPHIS BELLE
              
              Restoration: The Memphis Belle
              For this famous B-17, surviving 25 missions in World War II was the easy part.
              
              Two years ago, Roger Deere traveled to an eastern Ohio coal town, where he visited a four-room Sears pre-fabricated house whose ceiling bowed down from the weight of all the stuff in the attic. The homeowner had died; a relative poking through the accumulation had run across something he thought might be of interest to Deere. Along with everything else, the attic contained the radio equipment for a B-17 bomber.
              
              Deere did not ask how radio equipment got into the attic. He did not want an explanation; he wanted the equipment.
              
              In time, it will be placed in the Memphis Belle, a Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress now being restored at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, where Deere is the chief of the restoration division.
              
              During World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces required heavy-bomber crews to complete 25 missions before they could go home. In 1943, having flown over France, Belgium, and Germany, the Memphis Belle crew became one of the first to reach that goal. After returning to the States in June 1943, the bomber and many of its crew served as the centerpiece of a 31-city War Bonds tour. Academy Award-winning director William Wyler documented the Belleâ€™s service in a 41-minute color film Europe.
