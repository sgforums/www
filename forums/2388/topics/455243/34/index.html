              To Jimmy Ng. If you want to find a girl of your dream...look for one who knows how to cook, take you as you are and love you...with or without lots of money. You too must know how to cook at least, take her as she is and love her.

              THE BATTLE OF ISANDLWANA 
              
              War: Zulu War
              Date: 22nd January 1879
              
              Place: 10 miles east of the Tugela River in Zululand, South Africa.
              
              Combatants: Zulu army against a force of British troops, Natal units and African levies.
              
              Generals: Lieutenant Colonel Pulleine of the 24th Foot and Lieutenant Colonel Durnford commanded the British force at the battle. The Zulu Army was commanded by Chiefs Ntshingwayo kaMahole and Mavumengwana kaMdlela Ntuli.
              
              Size of the armies: The British force comprised some 1,200 men. It is likely that they were attacked by around 12,000 Zulus.
              
              Uniforms, arms and equipment: The Zulu warriors were formed in regiments by age, their standard equipment the shield and the stabbing spear. The formation for the attack, described as the â€œhorns of the beastâ€�, was said to have been devised by Shaka, the Zulu King who established Zulu hegemony in Southern Africa. The main body of the army delivered a frontal assault, called the â€œloinsâ€�, while the â€œhornsâ€� spread out behind each of the enemyâ€™s flanks and delivered the secondary and often fatal attack in the enemyâ€™s rear. Cetshwayo, the Zulu King, fearing British aggression took pains to purchase firearms wherever they could be bought. By the outbreak of war the Zulus had tens of thousands of muskets and rifles, but of a poor standard, and the Zulus were ill-trained in their use.
              
              The regular British infantry were equipped with the breach loading single shot Martini-Henry rifle and bayonet. The British infantry wore red tunics, white solar topee helmets and dark blue trousers with red piping down the side. The irregular mounted units wore blue tunics and slouch hats.
              
              Winner: The British force was wiped out by the Zulu Army.

              About this movie..I was only 12 or 13 years old when I watched it on tv. The funny thing was after watching this movie..I had a crush with that Japanese main actress hehe..kept thinking about her for weeks before I managed to overcome my own emotion hehe. Well, last night, I watch this movie again. I was wondering whether I will have that same crush again on her. Well, not same feeling but I admire the Japanese women's courtesy, respect and love towards their men. I enjoy watching the movie again especially listening to the humourous dialogues and gestures.

              OBA - THE LAST SAMURAI TRUE STORY
              
              SAKAE Ã“BA 
              
              Sakae ÅŒba (å¤§å ´ æ „ ÅŒba Sakae?) (21 March 1914 â€“ 8 June 1992) was an officer of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. He served in both China and in the Pacific campaign. After Japanese forces were defeated in the Battle of Saipan, he led a group of soldiers and civilians deep into the jungle to evade capture by Allied forces. Under ÅŒba's leadership, the group survived for over a year after the battle and finally surrendered in December 1945, three months after the war had ended. Following his return to Japan, he became a successful businessman and served on the city council of Gamagori, Aichi.

              TRUE STORY OF TWO MEN WENT TO WAR
              
              Two Men Went to War is a 2002 British film based on a true World War II story, from Raymond Foxall's book Amateur Commandos which describes the adventures of two army dental corps soldiers who sneak off on their own personal invasion of France. The film was directed by John Henderson.
              
              Sergeant Peter King (Kenneth Cranham) and Private Leslie Cuthbertson (Leo Bill) of the Royal Army Dental Corps passionately desire to see active service, but are held back. Armed with two revolvers and a handful of grenades, they plan an unauthorised mission to occupied France. They write to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, explaining their intention to fight the Germans. After they finally succeed in getting to France, they stumble across a German radar station. They blow up what they take to be the main operations room, and then the entire compound unexpectedly erupts with gunfire and explosions. They narrowly evade the Germans and escape in a boat which is later blown up by a mine; the men are picked up by the British and interrogated as possible spies. Once their identities have been established, they are returned to barracks to be court-martialed as deserters. An aide of Winston Churchill had seen their letter, and knew of a commando raid on the radar facility which was facilitated by a diversion due to mysterious explosions in what they discover was actually the cookhouse. The aide intervenes in the court martial, establishes their presence at the enemy radar station and conveys an invitation to tea with the Prime Minister should they ever be in Whitehall. The court nevertheless demotes Sergeant King to the rank of corporal and remands Private Cuthbertson to military prison for 28 days, lenient sentences for desertion in wartime. A note on screen tells the viewer that the men never meet again.
