              DELTA FORCE
              
              1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), popularly known as Delta Force, is a U.S. Army component of Joint Special Operations Command. It was formerly listed as the Combat Applications Group by the Department of Defense but has since been officially re-designated the Army Compartmented Elements (ACE). While 1st SFOD-D is administratively supported by USASOC, it falls under the operational control of the Joint Special Operations Command. Delta Force and its Navy counterpart, the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, are the United States military's primary counter-terrorism units. It is often referred to in the U.S. media as a Special Mission Unit.
              
              Delta Force's primary tasks are counter-terrorism, direct action, and national intervention operations, although it is an extremely versatile group capable of conducting many types of clandestine missions, including, but not limited to, hostage rescues and raids.
              
              The Central Intelligence Agency's highly secretive Special Activities Division (SAD) and more specifically its elite Special Operations Group (SOG) often works with â€“ and recruits â€“ operators from Delta Force.

              The 1st Infantry Division of the United States Army is the oldest division in the United States Army. It has seen continuous service since its organization in 1917. It was officially nicknamed the The Big Red One after its shoulder patch and is also nicknamed The Fighting First.[2] However, the division has also received troop monikers of The Big Dead One and The Bloody First as puns on the respective officially-sanctioned nicknames. It is currently based at Fort Riley, Kansas.

              During my teenager years, I was witnessing Communism taking over Indo-China countries one by one like dominoes effects. So during my NS period, we took our NS in the SAF seriously. Will this kind of atrocities happen again in the future? We don't know for sure.
              
              S-21 and Choeng Ek Killing Fields: Facing death
              
              Tuol Svay Pray High School sits on a dusty road on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. In 1976, the Khmer Rouge renamed the high school S-21 and turned it into a torture, interrogation and execution center. Of the 14,000 people known to have entered, only seven survived. Not only did the Khmer Rouge carefully transcribe the prisoners' interrogations; they also carefully photographed the vast majority of the inmates and created an astonishing photographic archive. Each of the almost 6,000 S-21 portraits that have been recovered tells a story shock, resignation, confusion, defiance and horror. Although the most gruesome images to come out of Cambodia were those of the mass graves, the most haunting were the portraits taken by the Khmer Rouge at S-21.
              
              Today, S-21 Prison is known as the Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocide. Inside the gates, it looks like any high school; five buildings face a grass courtyard with pull-up bars, green lawns and lawn-bowling pitches. The ground-floor classrooms in one building have been left to appear as they were in 1977. The spartan interrogation rooms are furnished with only a school desk-and-chair set that faces a steel bed frame with shackles at each end. On the far wall are the grisly photographs of bloated, decomposing bodies chained to bed frames with pools of wet blood underneath. These were the sights that greeted the two Vietnamese photojournalists who first discovered S-21 in January of 1979.

              ADOLF HITLER
              
              Born in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to power in German politics as leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, also known as the Nazi Party. Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.

              The Truth Commissions and the Silmido Incident
              
              The New York Times has a story about Korea's truth commissions which is well worth reading (hat tip to the Metropolitician). I've covered different aspects of these commissions before, such as the (separate) investigations by the Defence Ministry and the National Intelligence Service into their respective pasts, the announcement that the Judiciary would do the same, the campaign to revoke medals earned due to taking part in the 12.12 coup and the Kwangu uprising, the outcome of that campaign and findings on the Nokhwa program which conscripted activists in the early 1980s, as well as some of the early findings on the Silmido incident. These commissions came up in the press this week as it was reported that the NIS commission had yet to announce findings on Kim Dae-jung's kidnapping in Tokyo in 1973, and that Kim was none too happy about this.
              
              One of the events that I've been meaning to write about was the investigation into and retrial and acquital of those involved in the People's Revolutionary Party case from 1975 - one of these days I'll get to it. The other I realized I hadn't really finished was the Silmido case, and I was motivated to post on it due to some pictures that I found, which are below.

              'Filthy 13' leader, model for 'Dirty Dozen,' dies in Chatham
              
              Jake McNiece was gone before we even knew he was here.
              
              His name might not resonate with you. It didnâ€™t with me until I heard that he had died. After that, it didnâ€™t take long to learn Jakeâ€™s story. Itâ€™s worth learning. In a nutshell, he was the real-life model for Lee Marvinâ€™s character in the 1967 movie â€œThe Dirty Dozen.â€�
              
              Jake, 93, died in Chatham on Monday. A couple of months ago, he and his wife, Martha, moved to Chatham from Ponca City, Okla., to live with son Hugh, a math professor at Lincoln Land Community College, and his wife, Mary Ellen.
              
              â€œWe got them to come the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,â€� says Hugh. â€œWe enjoyed almost two months together.â€�
              
              The actual group of WWII soldiers the movie is based on was called The Filthy Thirteen. They were rounders â€” not murderers and psychopaths, as Hollywood portrayed them, but brawlers and no respecters of authority.
              
              â€œWell, we often went AWOL,â€� Jake said in an interview with Public Radio International. â€œWe never took care of our barracks or any other thing, or sanitation, and we were always restricted to camp.
              
              â€œBut we went AWOL every weekend that we wanted to and we stayed as long as we wanted till we returned back, because we knew they needed us badly for combat. And it would just be a few days in the brig. We stole Jeeps. We stole trains. We blew up barracks. We blew down trees. We stole the colonelâ€™s whiskey and things like that.â€�
              
              Thatâ€™s why they were chosen for the job of parachuting behind German lines just before D-Day. It was regarded as a suicide mission. These guys were the original expendables, and Jake, a demolitions expert, set the tone for them. He was part-American Indian and had his men shave their hair into Mohawks and put on war paint before that pre-D-Day mission. A famous picture of it was printed in â€œStars &amp; Stripes.â€�
              
              Hugh says his dad did not have much interest in â€œThe Dirty Dozen.â€� He never met Lee Marvin. Jake said the movie was OK, but not all that factual. It was a time in his life when he didnâ€™t really talk about the war to anyone but friends and family.
              
              â€œIn the 1960s,â€� Hugh says, â€œDad was really not ready yet to be promotional about things. Part of it was respect for the families, his buddies. In his mind, it wasnâ€™t time to make a big public deal out of things.

              SINGAPORE HEROES
              
              Lieutenant Adnan bin Saidi
              
              Lieutenant Adnan was born in Kajang, Selangor. During World War II, he led the 1st Infantry Brigade in protecting the area at Pasir Panjang Ridge (now known as Kent Ridge) in the Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) area on 12 - 14 February 1942.
              
              On 13 February 1942, the Japanese troops attacked Pasir Panjang Ridge. They disguised themselves as Indian soldiers in the British army. They wanted to trick the Malay soldiers so that they could take control of the Pasir Panjang area. However, Lieutenant Adnan saw through their disguises and knew that they were Japanese soldiers. He gave orders to open fire at the disguised Japanese troops.
              
              The Japanese troops, despite many being killed and injured, did not surrender and continued to attack the ridge. More Japanese soldiers soon arrived and joined in the attack. Although Lieutenant Adnan's Malay Regiment was heavily outnumbered, yet Lieutenant Adnan refused to surrendered and urged his soldiers to continue fighting until the end.
              
              Lieutenant Adnan and his soldiers held off the Japanese for two days in spite of running out of food and ammunition. Many of the soldiers from the Malay Regiment were killed during the fierce battle. Lieutenant Adnan himself was shot. Despite his serious injuries, he refused to give up and continued fighting against the Japanese.
              
              Eventually, the battle at Pasir Panjang was lost and Lieutenant Adnan was captured by the Japanese. The Japanese soldiers tied him to a tree and bayoneted him to death. Lieutenant Adnan was only 27 years old when he died. He left behind his wife and two young sons.
              
              Due to his courageous actions at the Battle of Pasir Panjang, Lieutenant Adnan was considered as a War Hero by Malaysians and Singaporeans.

              KARGIL WAR
                      
              The Kargil War (Hindi: à¤•à¤¾à¤°à¤—à¤¿à¤² à¤¯à¥�à¤¦à¥�à¤§ kÄ�rgil yuddh, Urdu: Ú©Ø§Ø±Ú¯Ù„ Ø¬Ù†Ú¯ â€Ž kÄ�rgil jang), also known as the Kargil conflict,[note (I)] was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LOC). The conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay (Victory in Hindi) which was the name of the Indian operation to clear the Kargil sector.
                      
              The cause of the war was the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and Kashmiri militants into positions on the Indian side of the LOC, which serves as the de facto border between the two states. During the initial stages of the war, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid. The Indian Army, later on supported by the Indian Air Force, recaptured a majority of the positions on the Indian side of the LOC infiltrated by the Pakistani troops and militants. With international diplomatic opposition, the Pakistani forces withdrew from the remaining Indian positions along the LOC.
                      
              The war is one of the most recent examples of high altitude warfare in mountainous terrain, which posed significant logistical problems for the combating sides. To date, it is also the only instance of direct, conventional warfare between nuclear states (i.e., those possessing nuclear weapons). India had conducted its first successful test in 1974; Pakistan, which had been developing its nuclear capability in secret since around the same time, conducted its first known tests in 1998, just two weeks after a second series of tests by India.
