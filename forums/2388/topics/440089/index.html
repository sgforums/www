              <p>a movie made based on a true story.  She was raped by two robbers holding knife on a public bus, nobody went to help her except for one man. She later chased the man down the bus who was very puzzled and angry why she did that. The next day he read on news the girl drove the whole bus down a cliff.  Do you think the girl had done the right thing ? punishing the robbers and the rest heartless people who dare not fight off the robbers ? This is so typical of Chinese reaction. Meek as a lamb when real trouble come and protect only themselves.</p>

              Well, it could be due to a combination these two things:
              
              1. Imagine you're a girl on a bus. two men rape you in PUBLIC, in full sight of the passengers, who DONT get up, DONT help, instead they WATCH the whole damn thing like it's some sort of fucking freakshow and you're the center of it.
              2. Those two men raped you. period. they deserve to die. even in chinese courts the death penalty is meted out to rapist, worst for gangrapist, how much more so now?
              
              
              So... we sum it up to this: a 'innocent' girl raped in public on a bus full of self-centered, heartless PRCs who WATCHED you get raped as if they were enjoying a free porno plus two heartless perverts who watched too much  Grand Theft Auto and decided to re-enact it for real.
              
              A bus full of heartless freaks no different from the rapists plus your rapists. what better way than to kill all of them at once AND make them die horribly? obviously that's what the girl did.

              Haha, they wont. 
              
              But sadly, society not only in China but around the world does not tolerate vigilantism, so u can expect she's likely gonna be facing an uphill battle in court especially if kids were in the bus.

              <p>I can't really say this girl did the right thing... but she protected future victims from being raped and robbed... as for the nonchalant, apathetic passengers, they don't deserve to die... but why so selfish to that extent....?! They died for their selfishness...</p>

              <p>i only compared this to 911 incident when the second plane was
              stopped halfway by a few ang mos fighting with the terrorist. They
              knew they would die but at least they died saving others. for
              chinese, worldwide, they only fight hard if the vctim is their
              family or spouse, they will not risk themselves for a stranger, not

              <p>thats assuming you can get the whole busload of people to act together.</p>
              <p>btw i googled and one guy did helped the victim.  he was stabbed on the leg.  he was the only survivor.</p>
              <p>911 incident is different from this case.  its terrorism.  in terrorism americans unite. </p>
              <p>check it out on youtube.  the americans behave the same way.</p>
              <p>so its universal in human behaviour, not just the chinese.</p>
              <p>and if i remember correctly a singaporean chinese died trying to save some indian foreign workers in a local construction accident.</p>

              <p>there is always a SINGLE hero, be it Singaporean Chinese , China Chinese or ABC, but no unity.</p>
              <p>If the busload of men or the bus-driver had gotten fed up at the brutal ways of the two robbers and took actions into their own hand, the girl would not have driven the bus down the cliff. She only spared the one who stood up for her and suffered the cut in the leg.</p>
              <p>The two robbers were not even using guns which would be more fatal. For knives, if they were swamp by 6 , 7, 8 men , could they win ?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.54em; font-size: 13px;">Two mixed martial artists from Oregon were in Los Angeles for a grappling tournament, but they ended up using their skills to do much more than win a match. <a style="color: #046bca;" href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=8420209">They subdued an armed robber</a> who was holding up the clerk at their hotel.

              <p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1.54em; font-size: 13px;">Brent Alvarez runs Twisted Web MMA in Eugene, Ore., and Billy Denney is his student. They were walking through the hotel lobby when they saw the robber, who had gone behind the hotel's counter, pulled out a gun, and demanded money. The clerk handed over the cash, but yelled for help. Alvarez and Denney jumped on the robber, and while Denney controlled his wrists, Alvarez sunk in a rear naked choke. They held him in place until police arrived.</p>
