              <p>Cruel or Creative?</p>
              <p>Singapore youths' spoof of tissue aunty's $1 song upset netizens</p>
              <p>WHY MAKE FUN OF HER HARD LIFE</p>
              <p>SHE is 48, wheelchair-bound, and sings a cheerful jingle to make a living.</p>
              <p>Madam Neo Geok Tho's signature '$1tissue song' usually inspires sympathy and admiration.</p>
              <p>But not among some Singapore youths.</p>
              <p>At least five groups of them have made video clips making fun of her and the song, and put them on the Internet.</p>
              <p>The videos all feature youths making their own parodies of Madam Neo's song, a familiar tune to many Singaporeans who have seen her at various MRT stations in recent years.</p>
              <p>In one video, three youths with bright T-shirts over their faces dance around and play the guitar while singing the familiar words: 'One dollar, one dollar... Uncle, aunty help me buy tissue paper.'</p>
              <p>In the spoof, a teen acting as Madam Neo says to a potential 'customer' in a tragic tone: 'Oh! $1... Give me!' before letting out a scream.</p>
              <p>In another clip, a group of boys in school uniform are similarly seen dancing around and laughing while singing the song.</p>
              <p>The clips have attracted furious responses from other netizens.</p>
              <p>'You guys are heartless, please be ashamed of yourselves,' went one comment by netizen GQDS on YouTube, the video-sharing website where the clips have been posted.</p>
              <p>Another, by the name of tanyimei, wrote: 'Fancy you people making a joke out of people who are merely being there to make a living.'</p>
              <p><strong>CRUEL MOCKERY</strong></p>
              <p>Friends of Madam Neo, like housewife Tan Kok Eng, 44, thought the videos were cruel.</p>
              <p>'They are mocking her,' she said. 'What if she were their own family member?'</p>
              <p>But Madam Neo brushed off these imitators.</p>
              <p>She told Lianhe Wanbao: 'I believe the teens made the videos in a moment of fun.</p>
              <p>'I'm happy they can have some fun out of this. If there's a chance, I hope to be able to hear their versions.'</p>
              <p>She declined further interviews about the matter.</p>
              <p>Madam Neo even came up with modified lyrics of the song for Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>The positive response is typical of MadamNeo, who was hit by polio when she was just an infant.</p>
              <p>She has been selling tissue paper at stations like Tampines, Bishan, Woodlands, Tiong Bahru, Jurong and Raffles Place for more than five years.</p>
              <p>She lives with her husband, MrLim Swee Yong, 52, in a rented one-room flat in Tampines.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim is also wheelchair-bound. He was born with a spinal abnormality and has never been able to walk.</p>
              <p>The couple receive $290 a month from government agencies each month, but it's not enough to cover their living expenses. So both go out to work to support themselves.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim earns $400 a month selling newspapers in the morning and evening in their neighbourhood, while MadamNeo earns about $10 a day from selling tissue paper.</p>
              <p>But despite their difficulties, the couple, who have been married for 20years and have no children, remain happy.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim told The New Paper in Mandarin: 'I didn't dare think I'd get married. It was a miraculous thing. I'm lucky to marry such a beautiful wife.'</p>
              <p>He showed us pictures of their wedding day showing them, on their wheelchairs and in their finery, performing the tea ceremony, followed by a photo session at the Singapore Zoo.</p>
              <p>A typical day in Madam Neo's life starts with her friend Madam Tan, who helps them to buy groceries every morning.</p>
              <p>She then pushes Madam Neo on her wheelchair to a nearby coffeeshop to have breakfast. Madam Neo cooks for herself and her husband.</p>
              <p>Another friend, a retiree, wheels Madam Neo to Tampines MRT station in the afternoon so that she can get to work.</p>
              <p><strong>LONG DAYS</strong></p>
              <p>She sings till about 8pm every day, and gets home at 9pm if she is at a nearby station, 10pm if she is further away from home.</p>
              <p>Said Madam Tan: 'She takes note of which MRT station she goes to each day, so people won't think, 'You again, I just saw you yesterday.'</p>
              <p>Madam Neo told Lianhe Wanbao that it was actually her older sister who gave her the idea for the $1 tissue song.</p>
              <p>She said: 'When I started selling tissue paper, I found it difficult.</p>
              <p>'My older sister used to sell bedding at a department store, and she told me that after she came up with a song, business was good. So she encouraged me to come up with a song too.'</p>
              <p>And that's how the $1 tissue song came about.</p>
              <p>She said: 'It's easier to attract attention with singing. Also, I won't be so bored by myself.'</p>
              <p>Her job isn't easy though.</p>
              <p>Said Madam Tan: 'Sometimes, she sings until her throat is hoarse. But to earn a living, what to do?</p>
              <p>'Also, if it rains, she cannot go out to work because she cannot carry an umbrella and go around. It's dangerous for her.'</p>
              <p>Madam Neo also told Lianhe Wanbao that sometimes, some teens would squat beside her and imitate her singing the $1 tissue song.</p>
              <p>Some use their handphones to record her.</p>
              <p>The maker of one of the spoof videos on YouTube, called punkd1, wrote this on his blog in response to criticism of the video: 'The crew would like to stress its stand that this video was made for entertainment purposes and it harbours no form of ill intent...</p>
              <p>'With due respect, this idea was greatly inspired by the innovative singing efforts of the elderly lady who displays an incredible amount of enthusiasm.</p>
              <p>'In summary, the gist of this motion was all about the song and never about mocking anyone.</p>
              <p>'Having said all that, we do hope that with this publicity... Aunty one-dollar will see new progress in her tissue paper sales.'</p>
              <p>As for the other spoof videos, Madam Neo prefers to let the matter rest.</p>
              <p>She said: 'I don't pursue it because I don't want to make a scene in public. As long as they don't go too far, I let them be.'</p>
              <p>Her hopes for Chinese New Year are simple: Better sales. It looks like nothing can dampen her spirit.</p>
              <p>'(Her) song was a gift from God,' said her husband, Mr Lim. 'That's why my wife is so cheerful.'</p>
