            <div class='col-md body'>(This is a reply to Care Bear from the California thread....)<br><br>Hey, the partner yoga looks good man!  You mentioned communication, understanding and intimacy.  Lets talk about the last one.  hehe.  No, seriously, does it mean we have to go with our own partners or we just go there and pluck any unsuspecting victim from the crowd?<br><br>Wah.....that may mean that before you start class, you have to strategise where to stand (or who you stand beside), right?  So you go on stage and stand beside the instructor har?  hahah...<br><br>Eh, but seriously....I think thats for the expert level.  I mean I don't think I wanna risk balancing anyone in the air just with my feet like that (referring ot your middle picture).<br><br>You also mentioned verbal and non-verbal communications.  You mean you actually have to talk with each other?<br><br></div>

He wants me to join another gym with him.  Sigh...sounds tempting again.<br><br>Wah, that means to have the chance to work out with the partner of choice, before the true yoga class starts, I have to start strategising already on who to stand next to.  haha.  Suddenly, a big sweaty sloppy burping hairy guy come and stand beside you how?<br><br>One question....do you sweat when you do yoga?  I mean being so close to each other, sweating away....can be quite uncomfortable right?  Wet, sticky, BO, etc.<br><br>One day maybe I'll get to balance you on my feet like that, but firstly I hope you have life insurance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Romancing Singapore was some kind of SDU programme?<br><br></div>
