Very tiring to run (esp when you've done with bulking and wanna get cut)!!<br><br>All the best!</div></blockquote>i taking ON's 100% Whey too....good, VERY easy to mix. i use a small cup, put in a scoop of it, also can mix until thorough....tried Designer Whey, 1 scoop in a huge mug dat can hold about 300ml...very hard to mix thoroughly.<br><br>The purple one is more ex, dats pro-Complex, gives u much lesser servings compared to the 100% whey...but got more stuff inside. i support 100% Whey none the less.<br><br>Nitro-tech is too ex lah, AFAIK, Hydroxycut is wat makes Muscletech famous overnight, after that they branch into Nitrotech and Celltech, now Pumptech. All are very expensive....i boycott Muscletech' stuff. i only bought celltech once and i think i am not letting them laugh their a$$ off to the bank.<br><br>to me<br>celltech = 90% dextrose, 9% creatine and 1% ALA and wat fark<br><br>with the price of 1 celltech, i can get 1.5 kg of creatine powder and enough glucolin to last me through for god knows how long</div>
