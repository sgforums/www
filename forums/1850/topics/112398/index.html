            <div class='col-md body'>Coming from California, its probably a scam.  Don't trust it.  Definitely some trick lah...maybe they ask you to pay for 1.5 years and give you membership for 2 years, etc.  I don't believe they'll just let unlimited number of public go in for 6 months free of charge.<br><br>I've heard so many complaints about the place - too crowded and can't get machines, staff are very pushy and always try to sell you something, etc etc.  Check with the person with the nickname "Care Bear".  She had a slight experience with California recently.  PM her or something.<br><br>By the way, personal training at gyms like California is S$70 per hour (in addition to your membership and other fees)....and you have to sign up for many sessions at the same time.  Aiyah, if you wanna spend that kind of money, then Chunyong and I can teach you for S$50 per hour.  Then you can have two trainers somemore.  haha.  We not qualified so we charge a bit less than ourside.  Chunyong:  we'll split $35/$15 (I take the bigger share).<br><br>Hey, I started doing weights about 20 years ago.  Never had any personal trainers or anything (there weren't even proper big gyms at that time - and there were probably less than 10 personal trainers in this country during that time too).  During those times, we just trained with friends, watched others and learn, read about it in mags, etc.  Nowadays, you have the internet which is much easier.  And in the end our bodies all turned out OK what - far from perfect lah, but still a bit better than average.<br><br>Try surfing the net for research...its quite a good source of information!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, another thing I noticed is that you'll usually use is not necessarily the best/biggest/most expensive one.  Instead, its usually the most convenient for you (usually in terms of proximity).<br><br>I'm a member of quite a few gyms....and the one I use most frequently is the one downstairs from my place, which also happens to be the smallest, lousiest and cheapest (its free in fact).<br><br>After work or study, when you come back, you just don't wanna go out again lah.<br><br>If you live in Hougang (teochew nang har?) and join a gym in town, I suspect that one day in the future, you will be asking yourself why you keep going so far and spend so much just to exercise.....when you can do it nearer and cheaper at Hougang gym.  Then the whole situation gets a bit sian liow....<br><br>(As for me, I'm also member of Planet Fitness Suntec.  I go there only once a week, or 56 times a year.  If you divide the annual membership fee by 56, you will see how expensive each visit is!  But mine's a idifferent story because I like the girls there lah....so no choice.....got incentive mah.).<br><br></div>

I chose to join california cos it has so many more types of machines.<br><br>One advice: if you're really joining, make sure u bargain hard. Don't pay like 80-90 a mth. You can get 40+ monthly only if you pay a lump sum for like 24-30 months.</div></blockquote>queueing time more than work out times then pointless liao...i dun like to queue...i rather go use other machine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The correct gym etiquette is to share machines, so that everyone can stick to their tempo/schedule as much as possible.  So if you're using a machine and someone asks "can I share?", you're supposed to say yet and alternate sets with him.<br><br>Very seldom has anyone requested to share with me....in Singapore, we usually just wait for our turn.  I also...if I see someone using a machine, I'll just go and use something else first.<br><br>Angmohs are friendly on the outside only lah, many of them have good etiquette....but don't let that fool you into thinking that they're friendly people who treat you as equals.  Many look down on us.  I had many many many bad experiences before.<br><br>Its common to line up at California for machines?  So during line up got chance to talk with girls or not?  Eh, but very uncomfortable if someone stands there and stares at you leh.  At Planet Fitness, its quite empty and getting emptier, like going to close down like that.  haha.  The only time when I lined up was when some bastard inconsiderate yaya stood there and talked with his friend (which he shouldn't be doing in the first place).  I cut in and they showed me dirty face, but they walked away anyway.<br><br>Anyway, I seldom use the weights and machines....sometimes only.  But seroiusly, even at peak hours at Planet Fitness Suntec, at most 50% of the machines are used.  I would prefer a bit more crowded...more lively.<br><br>I have a friend who joined California for 4 years at a shot....I think he bargained like hell and came up to $400 per year only.<br><br></div>
