Anyway you have just a few more months what.  Honestly, its not good to start carrying heavy weights too young.

            <div class='col-md body'>Uncle Moo Moo,<br><br>You're 15+ years old and you're already 1.75 m tall??  Good grief, what do you guys eat nowadays??  Long beans?<br><br>Anyway, I don't know what gyms are charging, but most will not allow anyone under 16 to be a member.<br><br>Er....if you want to put on weight, skip the cardio (running) for the moment.  Put on a bit of weight first, then start your cardio.  At your age, you just need 2 weeks to get your stamina up from 0-100% lah, don't worry.<br><br>55 kg is a bit light for 175 cm.  At this stage, I don't think its important to watch your diet like a professional does yet....you probably could eat anything without getting into trouble.  The important thing is just to eat much more than what you're eating now.  But stick to white meats, egg whites and tofu....and some fibre (fruits, vegetables) and carbo (rice, white bread).<br><br>Remember that one's weight is actually a function of energy (food energy, calories) input versus output.<br><br>Generally,<br>When input &gt; output, weight gain can be expected.<br>When input &lt; output, weight loss can be expected.<br>When input = output, weight is consistent.<br><br>To put on weight, you need to input more energy (ie. more food).  And not increase your output too much.<br><br></div>

They only offer the basic. Changkat Gym's equipment is much older. You may like to visit my site below, I have a complete 2 series guide for beginner. If you want to see animation of how exercises are performed, just email me. Anyway my advice is if you are serious about training, joined a gym near your home, or school, it is more convenient for you to go regularly.</div>
