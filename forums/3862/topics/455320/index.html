              <p>It may be unthinkable now to tackle secondary school math without a scientific calculator, but students used to do so more than 30 years ago.</p>
              <p>  Mr Jerome Lim, a student at St Joseph's Institution (SJI), relied on the mathematical tables in his Logarithm or Log Book to preform complex math calculations.</p>
              <p>  "It helped me to appreciate the math functions, which you really can't when you use scientific calculators," says Mr Lim, 47, a naval architect.</p>
              <p>  Besides logarithm tables, the book contained tables for angle functions like sines and cosines, and square roots and hyberbolic functions. Some students even gained an unfair advantage by scribbling formulae, which should have been memorised on the book, which was brought into exam halls.</p>
              <p>  After exams ended, his class would head to cafes in the vicinity like the Red House to celebrate with $4 four-course set lunches. Do-Re-Mi, run bt Yamaha at the then-newly completed Plaza Singapura, were among the few air-conditioned places with food at reasonable prices. A&amp;W gave him his first taste of fast food, and the promotional $1.20 Tuesday Coney Dogs (hotdogs) were a favourite.</p>
              <p>  He and his friends used the straws from A&amp;W as pea shooters - the peas fit nicely into the diameter of the straws - to play pranks on unsuspecting pedestrians.</p>
              <p>  Many other hangout places were within walking distance of the old SJI compound (now the Singapore Art Museum). As lower secondary students, Mr Lim and a few of his friends would arrive before the afternoon school session and spend time at the MPH's flagship bookstore at Stamford Road, the National Museum and the old National Library.</p>
              <p>  He remembers visiting Bras Basah's many bookshops, besides vendors selling bootleg music cassette tapes. The boys also appreciated the fact that girls' schools like Saint Anthony's Convent and Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus were in the vicinity.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Juraimi Rahmat, who went to primary school in early 1970s, still remembers the traditional children's games he used to play. These ranged from "hantam-bolah" where a ball is used to hit an opposing player, to "gasing" or top spinning, to "yeh,yeh" involving a skipping rope made from linked rubber bands.</p>
              <p>  "We would be perspiring a lot after recess," says the 47-year-old businessman, who studied at Permaisura Primary School in Commonwealth area. "Back then we played many physical games."</p>
              <p>  The resulting stains on white canvas shoes would be covered up with chalk, and every weekend a special white shoe paint would be applied to the shoes after washing them.</p>
              <p>  Food and drinks during recess included five-cent bandung and 10-cent mee rebus. Students deemed malnourished were signed up for free triangular-shaped packets of milk. He also recalls White Rabbit brand candy and peanut cake among the snacks sold at the canteen.</p>
              <p>  After breaks, he and fellow students would brush their teeth by the "longkang" (drain) under a oral hygiene programme; a dentist was stationed at the school. whom many kids dreaded being summoned to.</p>
              <p>  His school and the neighbouring New Town Primary School shared a field, where he trained twice a week with his school soccer team. Both school compounds now form the Ministry of Education Heritage Centre.</p>
              <p>  He remembers travelling to district inter-school soccer tournaments, which were held at Dover Road. But then, their protective equipment was only ankle guards and no shin guards. The kids did not wear soccer boots, but normal shoes instead. Mr Juraimi says he believes there were concerns that the sharp spikes on the soccer boots would result in injuries.</p>
              <p>  Students used to tease each other with stories of ghosts lurking at the hill just behind the school. Once, he and his friends played hide and seek and one of them vanished. When he eventually returned, "he told us that he decided to walk home to take his meal", says Mr Juraimi with a laugh.</p>
