              <p>REPORT: <strong>JENNIFER DHANARAJ</strong></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Is maths sexy? This celebrated French mathematician thinks so.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Mr Cedric Villani has even likened the discovery of new matbs problelll$ to having multiple love affairs - from the initial thrill to the joy of understanding, before familiarity and boredom sets in.</p>
              <p>   Then it's time "for another mathematical romance".</p>
              <p>   Mr Villani, 39, has gained international acclaim for making mathematical thinking "cool".</p>
              <p>   In 2010, he won the Fields Medal, which is often called the Nobel Prize for mathematics.</p>
              <p>   Awarded every four years, it recognises the outstanding work of mathematicians under the age of 40.</p>
              <p>   "My inspiration comes from the world around us and it is full of problems waiting to be solved," he tells The New Paper on Sunday.</p>
              <p>   Winning the Fields Medal has made him a spokesman for mathematics, and has seen him travel to over 30 countries to give talks.</p>
              <p>   Mr Villani is a showman in the world of mathematical thinking, and his talks see him enthusiastically descnbing his approach to maths concepts and equations.</p>
              <p>   Tall, gangly and dressed in a three-piece suit with his signature floppy bow tie (in honour of his 19th-century science hero Ludwig Boltzmann), he has the aura<br>of a typical eccentric.</p>
              <p>   His unconventional appearance and approach have even earned him the label of the Lady Gaga of mathematics. His resume even includes a stint in modelling.</p>
              <p>   He says: "I agreed to appear in a French fashion magazine, although it was my first and last time!"</p>
              <p>   Mr Villanl. is in town for the Global Young Scientists Summit@one-north, which begins today and. ends on Friday·</p>
              <p>   The inaugural summit, organised by the National Research Foundation, seeks to highlight Singapore's vibrant research landscape. Its theme is "Advancing Science, Creating Technologies for a Better World", and it aims to inspire young scientists to address global challenges and future needs of mankind.</p>
              <p>   Young scientists will be encouraged to engage the many international leaders of science and technology that will be present at the event.</p>
              <p>   Mr Villani is a strong advocate of making scientific thinking more attractive to all.</p>
              <p>   He says: "Maths makes you feel like an adventurer in that you explore people's minds during encounters worldwide."</p>
              <p>   He insists that it is a universal language, saying: "It appears everywhere. Every movie with special effects and every animated cartoon uses many mathematical concepts and simulations.</p>
              <p>   "It is also used to predict the weather, ease traffic, draw architectural plans and detect cancers."</p>
              <p>   He adds: "Maths is the language by which the laws of physics are written, so it explains our world</p>
              <p>   "Just as one is interested in history to understand where the world we live in came from, you can be interested in mathematics to understand how the world works."</p>
              <p>   Mathematics has been crucial in some of the most important events in history, he maintains.</p>
              <p>   Mr Villani argues that without it, we might be living in a frighteningly different world today.</p>
              <p>   "Without the work of the English mathematician Alan Turing, who deciphered German military codes during the Second World War... The war could have been won by Germany!"</p>
              <p>   As a maths advocate, Mr Villani has inspired many who thought they had left the subject behind at school.</p>
              <p>   "I wrote a popular book called Optimal Transport: Old and New, which sold more than 40,000 copies, and received hundreds of comments by non-mathematicians," says the father of two.</p>
              <p>   And true enough, he has been approached by fans of his work, many Of whom are not familiar with the subject.</p>
              <p>   He has met singers, heads of state, writers and even rugby players in the course of his travels.</p>
              <p>   His fans include acclaimed film directors Takeshi Kitano and David Lynch, whom he maintains is the coolest person he has met.</p>
              <p>   "I enjoyed every minute in his company. He was very fascinated by mathematics and the birth of the Universe."</p>
              <p>   There are, however, some misconceptions about what Mr Villani does.</p>
              <p>   For instance, he does not see the world in terms of equations magically appearing before him -like in the film A Beautiful Mind.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: red; font-size: 16pt;">   Mr Villani is quick to dispel these misconceptions and points out that being a mathematician is not simply about complex calculations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span>   "Like many mathematicians, I do not calculate at all! It's not just about figures. My work is to understand problems."</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>   While others may be inspired by Mr Villani to explore maths later in life, it has always been a passion for him.</p>
              <p>   "I always found maths a fun way to train your mind. I always loved it, but didn't imagine it would be my job until I was 25."</p>
              <p>   There is still the question of the discipline being sexy.</p>
              <p>   Mr Villani says he agrees with legendary French mathematician Andre Weil, who said that the rush from finding mathematics solutions was similar to that of an orgasm, but lasts longer.</p>
              <p>   So could maths be used in attracting the opposite sex?</p>
              <p>   "I'm afraid not. Mathematicians are human beings. We think in terms of emotions, not logic."</p>
              <p>   Mr Villani also says he's never tried a mathematical pick-up line, but shares one which one of his students came up with: "If you were a function, I would be your derivative, so I would always be tangent to your curves."</p>
              <p>   He admits: "I'm not sure it would be efficient. One should test"</p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">intro
                      to bikini calculus is so .. <span> </span>but it does force
                      maths-hater to learn calculus , but not quite a route to like maths.. haha ...
                      but even so once you out in the working world, calculus will be emptied into recycle
                      chute ... muahahahaha ...</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">I
                      think learning to like maths is far more important than force-learning of
                      mathematical equations, formulas and diverse methods, but unfortunately that is
                      what the govt believes to make a more productive intelligent person and what
                      the schools are doing right now in a more drastic extent compared to the past. <span> </span>That's why parents hire tutors for their kids,
                      because they paise cannot solve their kid questions... <span> </span>muahahahaha ...</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"> </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Maths
                      is a beauty itself, is an art, is a kind of wushu that requires time ... maths
                      equations, formulas, methods, critical evaluation etc.. are all dead as they
                      are, but maths are alive.<span>  </span>Until you
                      begin to see maths is alive, you have not started out to know maths, which is
                      one of component of scientific research.<span>  </span>does this confuse ... muahahahaha .. okay okay forget about maths ...
                      let's talk sex baby without maths...</p>
