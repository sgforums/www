For American consumer-product giant Procter &amp; Gamble, the humble ingredient used in baking bread has given its SK-II skincare division a pretty puff in fortunes.<br><br>Last year, women worldwide spent US$500 million (S$850 million) on SK-II products, which are packaged in distinctive, deep-red boxes.<br><br>This is a double-digit growth worldwide, making SK-II one of the world's top five selling premium cosmetics brands, say its officials.<br><br>SK-II, which is based in Japan, debuted its first yeast product in 1980.

            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, sales have ballooned from $2 million in 1999, when it opened a counter in Isetan, to $25 million last year.<br><br>Intensive promotion, with TV and print advertisements featuring celebrities like Hong Kong star Sammi Cheng and China-born model Qi Qi, have helped SK-II. The initials stand for 'Secret Key' while 'II' stands for the brand's belief in combining nature with technology.<br><br>Last year, the brand with a 30-item range edged out big names to clinch the trophy for 'prestige' skincare product from the Association of Perfumes and Cosmetics Distributors in Singapore.<br><br>Based on stores' reported sales, SK-II also outsold rivals in all nine department stores it had counters in last year, making it the No. 1 skincare brand in the prestige cosmetics market.<br><br>Officials from the brand say that of its 60,000-strong clientele in Singapore, eight in 10 are aged 20 to 39. Most are women earning between $2,000 and $6,000 a month.<br><br>SK-II's secret, says its maker, is Pitera, a patented yeast which the brand claims can bring back the skin's natural balance.<br><br>In Singapore, a 150ml bottle of essence containing 90 per cent Pitera costs $149 - just about a dollar a drop. It is not cheap, but P&amp;G claims that one bottle is sold in the world every 28 seconds.<br><br>FOR YOUR SAKE, HERE'S THE SECRET<br><br>PITERA, the money-spinning yeast, was discovered by American cosmetics firm Max Factor three decades ago.<br><br>Back in the 1970s, a dye commonly used in cosmetics and sold by many brands left many women in Japan with blotchy faces.<br><br>Much was made of this in the media. In the aftermath of the hooha, cosmetics brands operating in Japan, including Max Factor from the US, scrambled to find alternative natural ingredients.<br><br>Mr Takashi Yoshii, 53, was one of a five-member team involved in the hunt. Now SK-II's technical marketing manager, he and his team decided to check out an old Japanese saying that sake brewers had beautiful hands.<br><br>They staked out tightly-knit and often secretive family-owned breweries to see if there was a secret ingredient that resulted in the brewers having such glowing skin on their hands.<br><br>Sake is made from ingredients like water, rice and yeast.<br><br>Five years later, the team came up with a yeast strain, isolated from the alcohol, that could be used on the face.<br><br>In 1980, Max Factor launched an essence in Japan under the Secret Key II trademark. It was sold for the same price as today - a hefty 15,000 yen a bottle.<br><br>But the line did not make a splash until P&amp;G acquired Max Factor in 1991 as part of a global move into the cosmetics business.<br><br>P&amp;G, which has a US$138 billion market capitalisation, has about 300 brands in over 140 countries, ranging from Camay soap to Pampers diapers and Whisper sanitary towels.<br><br>'I don't think Max Factor gave SK-II a lot of marketing support but it still had a group of loyal users,' says Ms Yoko Hori, 40, who used to handle the branding of toiletry products in P&amp;G in Japan.<br><br>'We thought there had to be something special about it. It turned out to be the jewel in the company,' says Ms Hori, who is now SK-II's global skincare design marketing director. P&amp;G started advertising SK-II heavily in the mid-1990s and sales rose dramatically.<br><br>A decade earlier, Max Factor had started marketing SK-II in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Starting in 1997, P&amp;G took it to Malaysia, Singapore, China and South Korea. The brand entered Britain in 2000 and was launched in the United States early this year.<br><br>NO FAKES, ONLY 'MIRACLE WATER'<br><br>IN THE process, SK-II is dispelling the image that the products are targeted at older Asian women.<br><br>Pitera, it says, is suitable for women of all ages as well as men and Westerners. In fact, so successful has the product become that fakes have been discovered in recent years.<br><br>At its Kobe laboratory, which Life! visited recently, scientists scrutinise counterfeit masks, essences and lotions which have been made anywhere from China to Taiwan.<br><br>In Singapore early last year, P&amp;G successfully sued a man who peddled imitations online and door-to-door. P&amp;G tracked him down and the culprit was fined 'thousands of dollars' and the goods in his house were confiscated.<br><br>SK-II says prices remain high because it hires skilled workers to grow Pitera.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More than 45 scientists in Japan are devoted to the Pitera formula alone. They spend their days trying to understand the yeast that grows only by natural fermentation and which cannot be made in machines. Even the four-day fermentation in big vats cannot be rushed.<br><br>P&amp;G says it does not plan to build plants outside Japan as of now, as making Pitera requires strict standards. Limiting production to Japan also helps guard its secret formula, it adds.<br><br>SK-II says world dermatological bodies have validated its claim of Pitera's seven benefits on the skin, including hydration, tone lightening and oil control.<br><br>The brand also takes credit for changing the way beauty consultants work in shopping malls. Its counters worldwide offer computer-aided skin counselling, an edge SK-II claims to have over the 'naked eye' diagnosis offered by most brands.<br><br>A skin imaging system, developed for over US$2 million, breaks down and grades skin in terms of texture, spots, wrinkles and pores. (see story below). A central database offers regular users a comparison with their past reports in minutes. Despite its high price - most products cost over $100 - SK-II has won a following. Even its competitors say they have been caught by surprise by the brand's success. They attribute this to the way P&amp;G pounds its 'miracle water' message on TV day and night, in a method not unlike the way P&amp;G sells Pampers.<br><br>SK-II will not say how much it spends on advertising, only noting that it is 'competitive' and spends more than others in television ads.<br><br>Average monthly TV spending for skincare brands in Singapore was about $200,000 in the period from June last year to this May, says AC Nielsen.<br><br>Meanwhile, fans are helping to spread the brand.<br><br>Singaporean bank employee Jeannie Koh, 28, for one, spends over $1,000 every three months on 14 items. 'It's expensive but worth it. Many people have used it and said it is good. I've tried many products but this is different.'<br><br>She started with a sample at the brand's launch five years ago, and has been using it since. 'I have tried other brands, but I found this different,' she says. 'My skin has managed to regain its glow and moisture.'<br><br>Out, damned spot!<br><br>I HAVE the age spots of a 19-year-old and pores of a 21-year-old. The texture of my skin reflects my age - 31. And I have the wrinkles of a 36-year-old.<br><br>That was what a computer told me at an SK-II counter in a Tokyo department store.<br><br>The age of my skin was decided by comparing it to that of 300 Japanese women whose skin had been analysed and results stored in the database.<br><br>Minutes earlier, I had hoisted my face onto a chin rest to have pictures of my left cheek taken.<br><br>On a screen on my left, a close-up of my plump cheek emerged. It showed a big pimple I had tried to hide that morning with concealer. Then there were the lines running from under my eye to my temple. I could see every freckle I had.<br><br>The Japanese beauty consultant said I had fared really well in the test on pores and spots. She suggested I do something about the lines.<br><br>I consider myself vain but I don't usually buy anything for my face that cannot be found at Watson's. And seldom have I bought anything beyond basic cleanser, toner and moisturiser.<br><br>I was given two red paper bags filled with SK-II products and instructions to put layers of stuff, all infused with Pitera, on my face. Seven layers every night, six every morning. The combined value of items? Over $1,000.<br><br>That night, with the instructions propped up against a mug, I performed the ritual.<br><br>Wash. Tone. Splash the famous essence. Pat, pat to make sure everything sinks in. Then on to the stuff for repair, whitening and anti-wrinkling. It took 20 minutes. And I got part of the sequence wrong.<br><br>I went back to the store the next day for another test. My pimple was still there. The scores for my pores and spots were practically the same from that of the day before.<br><br>But I had gone back eight years in texture and shed four years of wrinkles. Overall, the computer said I had the skin of a 24-year-old.<br><br>Two weeks have since passed and my skin does look fairer and firmer. But when my free samples run out, will I spend over $1,000 every three months to keep up the SK-II routine?<br><br>I'm still not convinced that if I switch to cheaper products my skin would be worse off.<br><br>Still, I am tempted. I am resting my decision on a long-tenanting zit scar between my eyebrows. If it vanishes in the next two weeks, SK-II will have my thousand bucks. -- Krist Boo<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.

I don't experience the stinging sensation leh.<br><br>No, you don't need to use cotton to dab.<br><br>We only use cotten for toner.  The reason why we use cotton for toner because toner is for removing the last bit of dirt on the face, which cannot be removed by the cleanser.  But of course, the most impt function is to close up the pores.  When applying the toner, the dirt will stick on the cotton and thus leave the face totally clean (cleaner than just after using the cleanser) &amp; close up the pores.<br><br>If you find it easy to use cotton pad for SK2 Treatment Essence, then go ahead to use it.  It's no harm doing so.  Just that, it's not necessary.</div>

After accumulating certain number of points, you can exchange them with free gifts.  Points are earn with every purchase at SK2 counter.<br><br>But but but... I find it's not worth it.  You accumulate so many points, let's say a few hundred (which is equivalent to a few hundred bucks of products that you purchase), you can only exchange for some SK2 product in sample size only.  And the points can only be kept for 1 year.</div>

Intensive care enables you to experience the superior skin treatment effects of SK-II PiteraÂ®, that normalizes the skin cell renewal cycle thus solves skin prblems from the root.<br><br>How to use:<br>Gently place mask over entire face.  <span style="color: brown;">Remove after 5 - 15 mins and then wipe with a cotton pad soaked with Essence or wash off.</span>  (Can be used by cooling or warming the mask.)  Dispose after use.  The mask works more effectively if Essence is applied before and after mask application.<br></div>
