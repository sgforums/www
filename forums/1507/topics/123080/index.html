Wet tissues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It's quite good... the tissues are really wet (and not drydrywet like some other brands). I can't tell how well exactly it cleanses, but should be quite well bah, since it doesn't worsen my skin condition.

            <div class='col-md body'>I like cleansing oils because they clean really well.<br><br>I'm using the Shu Uemura cleansing oil for oily skin now.  Bought the small bottle for $50+.  (May be different size from Honeybunz's description?) Cleans thoroughly.  Has a mild peppermint smell.  Hurts the eyes if it gets in contact with eyes.<br><br>Before this I used Ipsa cleansing oil.  There's only 1 oil for all types of skin.  Cleans well too.  No scent.  Gentle on the eyes.  Small bottle costs $40+,  for more quantity than Shu (I think 10ml more) .<br><br>Comparatively, I think performance wise these two brands are on par.  Perhaps Shu feels less oily after you wash off with water.... but they're almost the same.  Ipsa is more economical.<br><br>I didn't know about the bubbles around the eyes from using oil cleanser, but these two products don't give me this problem.  After using a cleansing oil, I use a normal cleanser.<br><br>Oil cleansers may be pricey but they go a long way, at least 2-3 months worth of product in a small bottle.  So I think they're still worth it.</div>

Quite good, i swear by their products.</div></blockquote>I don't exactly like the nuskin cleanser.  But I really love their masks (mud and firming).  They are really the best masks in market.  (In the past I have also used SKII, Estee Lauder, Clarins, Loreal, Nivea, H2O etc).<br><br>I am actually using the Herbalife cleanser.  never heard before?  Many ppl only know them for slimming and health stuff.  My friend went to USA, so I "dong pang" her to buy for me in their LA office.  Quite good.  Somemore quite cheap also.  .... Need to use a bit only (pump out about 10 cent coin size), can clean all traces of makeup.<br><br>But then, they don't sell in Singapore, too bad.  Also, they might stop this range completely.  So I think no chance for me to replenish.  So now going around exploring other brands.<br><br>Likely going into Fancl one.  Tried SKII cleanser before (the sample size).  Every SKII users swear by it.  But I find it so so.</div>
