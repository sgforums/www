              <p>It is still something of a surprise to see a man in a nail salon. But Zhou Xingyu, 31, has been a nail artist for nearly a decade and is now a partner in a nail salon in Tuanjiehu area.</p>
              <p>He also works as a nail-art tutor at fashion schools and sometimes appears in fashion magazines such as Xinwei demonstrating the latest nail trends. Sitting at a table covered with nail kits and in front of a shelf full of colorful polishes, he massages a client's fingers, before creaming, smoothing and designing the nails. His dream is to have his own nailist training salons.<br><strong><br>Q: When did you first learn nail makeup?</strong><br><br>A: In 1999, NSI, an American-based nail care products company, initiated a training project at the salon where I was working as a teacher in Fujian province.<br><br>I attended the classes led by a teacher assigned by the company, who showed us how to mix acrylic powders and liquids and apply it to the surface of nails to make false nails. It was something like making a false tooth. At that time, there was not such an extensive range of nail products and accessories as now. It seemed amazing and interesting.<br><br><strong>Q: Why did you join it?</strong><br><br>A: It has something to do with my character. I am curious and interested in new things, especially those about fashion.<br><br><strong>Q: As a man, has it ever felt strange to be a nailist?</strong><br><br>A: Not at all. I believe it's not defined by gender, it's a question of technique. As a trainer at a salon, I was sensitive to fashion and believe it is as natural to be a nail artist, as it is to be a hairdresser or a makeup artist.<br><br>When I began my career, I learnt that there were already many legendary male nail artists in the West. They were in their 40s or 50s, working as a nail art tutors and setting the trends for the colors and designs.<br><br>Now many nail salons in China have male nailists. And there are some salons in Beijing with only male nail artists. It has been said that men are more suitable for the job, as women usually wear nail makeup to attract men. Also a male nailist brings something new to a nail store.<br><br><strong>Q: Being a nailist is a job that requires patience. Are you very patient?</strong><br><br>A: I'm a typical Cancerian, a mix of extroverted and introverted. Sometimes I get impatient when I find there is a mess, I can't wait to clear it, or when others do a job slowly I can't wait to take over and finish it.<br><br>But when I am sitting at the nail table with my clients, I become very patient. Most my clients say I am very patient and considerate, that is why I am well received.<br><br><strong>Q: Have you ever been rejected or treated disrespectfully because you are male?</strong><br><br>A: I once met a celebrity client when I was working at Toni&amp;Guy. She wanted some translucent white false French nails. When the leader introduced me to her, she assumed I was not qualified to do her nails. She cast a contemptuous glance at me, and asked: "Who are you?"<br><br>I just said with a smile that I would make the nails for her and introduced my ways of making the French nails. She became a repeat customer of mine. But most clients I meet are very kind after communicating with them for a while.<br><br>I never feel I am lower than others. I believe every job is equal. It is to provide a service for others. It is just a difference in clients and approaches. I joined the industry because I love it. At the beginning I was inspired by my interest and curiosity and now I get satisfaction from it.<br><br><strong>Q: What's you interpretation of your job, routine or creative?</strong><br><br>A: It really needs creativity, but it is based on routines and standards. I have to learn how to spread smoothly on surface before I create images on it. After acquiring a sound basis, I need some imagination and sense of fashion and color. If one says she likes red, I should know how to realize it and add some colors like shimmering gold or dark color to make it better.<br><br>It usually takes three or four hours to make false nails. I usually work several hours a day, sometimes until late night to 1 am, if there is client, especially in summer. I make average 5,000 yuan a month.<br><br><strong>Q: Would you have a habit of looking at someone from his or her hands?</strong><br><br>A: Yes. When I watch entertainment TV shows, my focus is always on their hands and I would stand close to the screen and have a clear look at their nails. In summer, I like to see what girls' fingers and toes are wearing. I also pay attention to men's fingers.<br><br>Now more men are starting to pay attention to nail care. It is not yet common in China, while in other countries, like Japan, nail care has become a regular makeup for man.<br><br>I regularly polish my nails and do some nail cares. Neat nails would convey that I am careful and dainty so it makes it easier for my clients to trust me and agree to give me their hands.<br><br><strong>Q: Do you have men clients?<br></strong><br>A: Yes, in this community store ,I have some. There are more in those high-level nail salons or clubs. Most are white-collar workers, especially those with high position in a company. For them, nail care a must and reveals their good tastes as a fine man.<br><br>Nail care makes a man neat and polite and also makes them in a good mood. In fact men's nails generally grow faster than women's and tend to be stronger. However, their increased surface area makes them prone to trauma from bumps and bangs.<br><br><strong>Q: Is there anything special with men's nail care?</strong><br><br>A: They seldom do hand care, and just get a manicure. Sometimes they wear polishes.<br><br>There are many brands out that have released polish specifically for men that come in a variety of colors, while the favorite is non-gloss clear polish that is great for those who like the natural look.</p>

              <p>I am so going to blacklist Nail Palace.  I bought their package just because they have outlets all over the place and I super busy woman, not all the time I can stick to the same outlet. </p>
              <p>everytime try to upsell me something.  the last time I visited, I did a one time gelish just to try out.  and then the girl tried to upsell me, not 10 sessions, but 20!!! </p>
              <p>they claimed that gelish can last for a month.  so why the hell I want to buy 20?  use until when?  probably the company close down before I finish half of it. </p>
              <p>naymind.</p>
              <p>the girl walked away and then come back and asked me to buy 10.  since she thick skin, I also thick skin and told her that I am poor, no money, cuz all money kept aside for my trip next month.  so sorry, not going to buy.</p>
              <p>she walked away, and then came back again and asked me to buy 3 sessions. </p>
              <p>wah piang! </p>
              <p>how to relax and enjoy my mani/pedi like that?  every visit some staff will fly towards me machiam like houseflies.  bug me again and again.  once I finish my package, I WILL NEVER STEP INTO ANY OF THEIR OUTLET EVER AGAIN!</p>

              <p>blacklisted nail palace years ago</p>
              <p>worst nail salon i ever been</p>
              <p>and i wasn't the one who signed up package<br>it was someone else who signed up but wanna faster use finish them so she treat me and other fren</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the power of numbers. the 3 of us went to do the last 3 sessions together and they still wanna sell somemore. </p>
              <p>still say better to sign up now bcos they will introduce GST soon and we have to pay more. </p>
              <p>and keep introducing anti-fungal tablets, quick dry top coats<br>my nails were done by a young girl<br>she is bery quiet. just do her own thing<br>but the supervisors and seniors just crowd around us, armed with a notepad and a calculator and start blabbering away</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when we all said no, they simple just left us there to wait for our nails to dry<br>when we walk out, no one acknowledge us or say byebye</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i still see their outlets crowded. <br>still got many aunties patronising them.</p>

              <p>btw, there is no need to go for soak off for gelish bcos u can peel it off when it starts to lift.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the place i went for my gelish did not relli do a good job<br>the lady did not paint evenly. so some parts look light, some parts look dark<br>she did try to sell package 6 x gelish at $28/session, which is bery cheap<br>but the T&amp;C is.... valid for 6 mths.... which means need to do once per mth<br>since she din relli do it well, i no bother to sign up</p>

              <p><br>WAH!  I thought my encounter bad enough when they hardsell 20 sessions of gelish. </p>
              <p>$5k package is crazy.  They may wind up even before you complete the package. </p>
