              Global halal cosmetics market 
              booms
              
              
              <br>KUALA LUMPUR, May 5, 2010 (AFP) - 
              Entrepreneurs producing "halal" cosmetics say the global market is booming as 
              more Muslims opt for beauty products that conform to Islamic rules. <br><br>

              Zulkifli made her first halal soap four years ago, after searching in vain for 
              the right products to bathe her baby. Now her business has an annual turnover of 
              1.6 million dollars.
              </p><p> </p>
              <p>"Halal is an issue for Muslims. At the end of the day, everyone will die and 
              God will ask you what have you done," said the Malaysian 
              singer-turned-entrepreneur.</p>
              <p>Famiza, who unusually for a Malaysian woman wears the black niqab that only 
              reveals her eyes, now exports dozens of top-to-toe beauty products to Indonesia, 
              Cambodia, Thailand and Brunei.</p>
              <p>The concept of halal, which means "permissible" in Arabic, is mainly applied 
              to food. Pork and its by-products, animals not slaughtered according to Koranic 
              procedures and alcohol are all "haram" or forbidden.</p>
              <p>But manufacturers are cashing in on the concept that virtually all goods and 
              services can be certified halal, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, clothing, 
              financial services and even tour packages.</p>
              <p>Like their conventional counterparts, halal cosmetics -- including lipstick, 
              deodorant and alcohol-free perfume -- can contain animal ingredients but they 
              must be prepared according to Islamic codes on slaughter and preparation.</p>
              <p>"Even the small amount of collagen in our night cream is derived from halal 
              sheep raised at a Muslim-run farm in Australia," said Famiza, adding that she 
              plans to expand her business from Southeast Asia to Europe next year.</p>
              <p>Nearly a quarter of the world's population are Muslims and the global halal 
              business, estimated by a Malaysian research company to be worth 635 billion 
              dollars a year, has expanded from Islamic countries to Western nations with 
              growing Muslim populations.</p>
              <p>In France, which is home to about five million Muslims, sales of halal food 
              are forecast to hit 5.5 billion euros (7.2 billion dollars) in 2010 according to 
              an industry spokesman.</p>
              <p>The halal cosmetics business -- estimated to be worth 560 million dollars 
              globally -- is seen by analysts as next in line for growth after the lucrative 
              halal food and Islamic finance sectors.</p>
              <p>Mah Hussain-Gambles, founder of the first halal cosmetics company in Europe, 
              Saaf <a class="tag" href="http://sg.fashionmag.com/tags-Pure">Pure</a> Skincare, said the industry has 
              also benefitted from a "green wave" and that 75 percent of her customers are 
              non-Muslims.</p>
              <p>"The principles are the same -- they want something that doesn't harm the 
              body, the purity and that is exactly the same as the halal movement," she 
              said.</p>
              <p>"I create an eco-ethical brand which is organic, vegetarian and halal -- they 
              are all important elements to me," she said, adding that demand "is getting out 
              of control".</p>
              <p>"The enquiries are from everywhere. Last week there were enquiries from 
              Bangladesh, Canada, Australia, Belgium and Malaysia -- it's just too much 
              work."</p>
              <p>Abdalhamid David Evans, a British expert on the halal business, said more 
              manufacturers will jump on the bandwagon as Muslims choose halal products to 
              reinforce their identity while others become more eco-conscious.</p>
              <p>"People are becoming increasingly concerned about those things and they 
              become a marketing issue," said Evans, of Imarat Consultants.</p>
              <p>"Without a doubt, (the halal cosmetics industry) is going to be big," he told 
              AFP on the sidelines of the first international halal cosmetics and toiletries 
              conference, which was held in Malaysia last month.by Beh Lih Yi</p>
