            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Esalen</strong><br><br>Esalen is a marriage between Swedish massage, with its precise manner of working with muscles and circulatory system, and the deeply personal sensing work brought by the individual therapist and has become a physical/emotional/spiritual human emergence to be sung to through touch. The recipient is gently urged to become an active participant through heightened awareness and surrendering to a deep sensing place. Long, lengthening strokes with gentle rocking and stretching, passive joint movement, sculpting of deep musculature, delicate cranial balancing, all point to a subtle neural reeducation of the body. Personal attention takes precedence over technique; thus each massage session is unique in itself. Esalen massage then becomes a meditation of receiving touch from another as part of a larger picture of richness which puts you firmly in touch with your more personal self. Warm scented oils or lotions are used to deepen the sensual experience through smell and texture.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.aromaticmassage.com/stones.jpg"><br><br><strong>Hot Stone Massage</strong><br><br>Hot Stones have been used for healing by Native Americans, Aborginies, and many ancient European &amp; Middle Eastern cultures for centuries. This massage uses flat bastalt river stones, beach pebbles, &amp; volcanic stones heated in water to a temperature of 125 degrees. The stones are applied to the body, along with a warm aromatic oil, and are sometimes left on areas such as the sacrum on a protective towel for extra heat infusion. Most of the massage is a combination of Swedish and Esalen, using the stones as a tool for a therapeutic, deep muscle HEAT penetration.<br></div>
