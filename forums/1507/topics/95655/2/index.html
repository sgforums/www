(one customer per room or two at most) v quiet &amp; soothing, they will not persuade customer to buy their products. process is clean face, scrub face, steam face,  extract blackheads, face massage, cold mask, body massage. last at least around 1 and half hr. Everything is good but only thing is it does not have much effect as some of my friends went to other facial salons their face got fairer and more radiant.<br><br>My friend who did hers at Adonis her package was $600+ and got to buy alot of products. she spent 3000+ just buying the products later her face got worst and she went to a clinic instead. the clinic prescribe antibiotics &amp; cream for her. Withing 2 months, she recovered and she don't go facial after that.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi Star Star Blue,<br>previously i had signed up for entire facial package at Chinatown, after completing the entire course of 10 sessions which includes cleansing, scrub, steam, and squeeze out all the funny stuff, i went consistently weekly, my skin did improve slightly (very prone to blackheads, pimples coz oily), but it didn't last... A few weeks after i stopped, my skin condition got back to before i started facial.<br><br>Did you know that in fact all these extraction and squeezing is not solving the root of the problem... Although even when we squeeze it out ourselves, we feel very shiok that the funny stuff came out, but our pores will be enlarged and the funny stuff will not stop production... So if you want to look for facial try to look for those that dun do extraction especially and who uses products to retard the production of blackheads or whiteheads in the long term.... i learnt these all from my current beautician, and i really tink is true, after i heed her advice...<br><br>hope it helps to you...<br></div>
