Instead, they serve as a forecast - think of it as a weather forecast - where we can make sense of the universal energies we are working with, in order to make the best use of our time and efforts. It is designed to help you maximize the good stuff coming your way, and to help you meet your<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">challenges with confidence and grace.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">ARIES<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I let my inner child out to play, to bring joy, luck, creativity and abundance my way.”</strong></p>
              <p class="rtecenter" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><img class="imgResponsive" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; width: 460px; height: 460px; max-width: 460px; max-height: 460px;" title="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 ARIES" src="http://www.herworldplus.com/sites/default/files/western_zodiac_horoscope_for_2016_aries.jpg" alt="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 ARIES" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Dear Aries, take a moment to congratulate yourself - after all the tests, twists and turns of 2015, 2016 sees you wiser, more mature, more able to take on the world with all that you’ve learnt; 2015 may have delivered some truly stunning moments that really tested your self-belief, but in the process, you’ve gained much valuable insight into people while letting go of unhelpful beliefs that have been holding you back. The way you perceive the world is so much sharper and more insightful than before - you are able to take it in with a new level of discernment now. You’re no longer simply taking things at their face value, you’re now able to call in your judgement, decisiveness and intellect to meet the events of your life head on, with your newfound level of wisdom. More importantly, you’ve reached a new level of honesty with yourself.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">You’re not taking anyone’s nonsense this year! This will be a year where you will be called upon to use your wisdom, and to check in with your intuition. Each time you’re faced with new situations and people, it’s important to be able to sort through them to see if they are really who they are presenting themselves to be. You will be called upon to use your instincts in making judgment calls; having the ability to discern fact from fiction will be a key skill for you this year.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Speaking your truth firmly yet kindly will be another. Be sure to temper your words with some honey though. You can get your point across without cutting anyone needlessly. Be forceful, but be tactful.Lastly, allow yourself to tune into the joy that your year will be bringing you, because a lot of it will be coming your way! Don’t let the fear of losing control or the thought of how you appear to others get in the way of really experiencing the happy moments in your life. When it’s time to cut loose and just relax, let your mind take a backseat, and be fully present to the ones you love.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Wonder, play and imagination are the keywords for you this year. Have you ever pulled those all-nighters, only to produce work that isn’t exactly up to your liking or standards? This year, the approach isn’t about putting in the hours, but will come from cutting loose and allowing your creativity to flow from within. A relaxed mind is a creative mind. When you find yourself stuck or needing inspiration this year, shut down your laptop and go for a walk. Go to an amusement park. Visit the museum. Anything that allows you to clear the space to hear your intuition speaking to you. And you’d be wise to listen, because your intuition is able to pull together disparate elements from everywhere, and give these ideas to you in the form of hunches, ‘strong feelings’, even though your dreams at night. Listen to them - there are important nuggets of truth they want to tell you. And when the creativity comes, it’ll flow. Allow your playful side to lead your way in your work this year, and it will lead you straight to your pot of gold.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">LOVE <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">It’s a time of taking stock - if you’re in a relationship, you’ll be looking at how far you’ve come, how you’ve grown together, the ways that you’re adding to each other’s lives. It’s really a kind of contemplative year where you aren’t necessarily rushing to the altar, but also not about to just call it quits and blaze your own solo trail too. Truth is, you’ve grown a lot. Your needs are different now. Discovering how to express these needs and to find ways to meet them is already a project in itself - you’re taking the time to get to know this new version of you, and your partner will need time adjusting to it too! Your partner will also be a mirror for your growth; this year, choose to see every conflict, every disagreement as a chance for reflection and renegotiation.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Not in a relationship? Whether you’re looking or not, this is a great year to take time off to spend quality time with yourself. Take the time to really assess your own growth. How are you different now? Do you like what you see? If you’re looking for love, are those ideas of the ‘ideal one’ still accurate? It may be a time to revise what it is you’re looking for, so you don’t go chasing down 2012’s idea of what you want, vs what the 2016 smarter, sassier you wants. To attract someone who’s the perfect fit for you, you have to also be aware of your own worth. I’m not just talking about the numbers in your bank account, but also your self-esteem - your real appraisal of yourself, the sense of self you bring out with you into the world every single day. This all matters, because that is what the world sees, and responds to. Feeling comfortable in this version of you will go along way in broadcasting your confidence out into the world.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">TAURUS<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I am ready to let my fire burn bright, I am ready to glow.”</strong></p>
              <p class="rtecenter" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><img class="imgResponsive" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; width: 460px; height: 460px; max-width: 460px; max-height: 460px;" title="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 TAURUS" src="http://www.herworldplus.com/sites/default/files/western_zodiac_horoscope_for_2016_taurus.jpg" alt="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 TAURUS" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">It’s a transitional year for you; from a bumpier time of change to that of gentleness, play and imagination. Oh, but it will still be a busy year for you, trust me. But you’ll be learning to handle more of the stresses that come your way with lightheartedness and a sense of playful joy. Any opportunity you have to get in touch with your emotions, jump at it. 2015 may have really seen you questioning the structures of your life, all that you’ve built for yourself based on your ideas of comfort and stability. There’s comforting, then there’s constricting - where has it become too comfortable? Where do you see yourself stagnating in some way? 2015 would have brought opportunities that really tested the foundations that you’ve built your life on thus far. Some pieces may have fallen away, perhaps with some reluctance on your part, and with some shock and difficult emotions to boot. But you may have already realized it was all for the better.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">You may be feeling even a little lighter somehow - albeit a little raw and wary. But take heart, in 2016, you’re finding your way forward a little more tentatively, but with hope and willingness to explore, to wonder, and to be open again. What is it that you’ll find? Who are you, really? Which part of yourself have you lost touch with, that you’d like to reclaim again? Your emotions will hold the key to these questions.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">You don’t even have to dive too deep to find valuable insights - it’s just about noticing the moments when you’re really, truly happy, and making room for more of that in your life. There’s times when you notice you’re just tired and sick of certain things, and you can arrange your time to make sure there’s less of that. Don’t be in too much of a rush to feel like you need things to look or feel a certain way immediately - let there be a vacuum for a little bit to see what comes in. Feel your way forward. Let your imagination lead the way when it comes to anything you need to face in 2016. Having a lighter, more playful mindset will help you see solutions to problems and blocks, and you will discover that you are way more resourceful than you ever believed yourself to be!</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">You are going in the right direction, dear Taurus. There’s literally no brighter card than the Sun - and I am so excited for you! You will see a spotlight on your work, and it’s well-deserved. Fame and acclaim may be heading for you, which is a more traditional way of looking at it. But I see it as a lot brighter and shinier in all ways. Yes, there will be attention, glory, accolades, and all the good stuff. May it be so! But another way to look at it is, that you’re finally infusing your true self, your essence and what makes you YOU into your work now. You have a deeper level of self-knowledge, self-awareness and self-esteem than ever before. And it’s paying off, big time. This is a great year for finally letting that pet project you’ve been nursing and working on a while to show. This is also a great time for launches, promoting yourself, polishing your professional image, and showing your best self to the world. Make hay while the sun shines, baby. There’s no better time.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you’re in a relationship now, you’re focused on building a strong foundation for it in 2016. You don’t want to waste any more time, you’re serious about making it a partnership to go the distance. You want it to be a place you can seek solace from in tides of change or trying times. How are you going to make it a strong one? Trust, communication and being upfront about your needs - I see those as being some of the things you’ll be discussing. Communication especially - it’s about voicing out exactly what you need from the other, figuring out acceptable compromises, and building trust step by step. However, be sure to come from a place of fairness and empowerment - and not make it about power and control. To be able to cultivate a strong relationship, there has to be trust and a kind of vulnerability, where giving and taking are balanced and in no need of score-keeping.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you’re not in a relationship right now, there is a chance that someone substantially older than you may take your fancy. What is it about him that attracts you? His stability, his confidence, his assuredness? Perhaps you feel that being with a strong, stable man will add more stability to your life. If you’re not actively looking or in a place to want a relationship right now, or in any other kind of ‘It’s Complicated’ relationship, I have an inkling that your focus will be on building yourself up to be strong and confident in yourself, your ability to structure your life to get things done, to handle your business - than to seek out anyone else right now. You may have a desire to channel more of the Emperor’s drive, structure, willpower in your life, if that is so, then follow your gut. It will not lead you astray.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">GEMINI <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I can make magic happen, my heart will lead the way”</strong></p>
              <p class="rtecenter" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><img class="imgResponsive" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; width: 460px; height: 460px; max-width: 460px; max-height: 460px;" title="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 GEMINI" src="http://www.herworldplus.com/sites/default/files/western_zodiac_horoscope_for_2016_gemini.jpg" alt="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 GEMINI" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">You have the means to reach your goals, lovely Gemini. You’re feeling affirmed, supported, confident in your ideas and plans that you are now raring to turn into reality. I feel this sense of excitement bubbling up in you - accompanied by a sense of assuredness, like, YES, I can bring my dreams into practical reality. Yes, I have what it takes to reach my goals. 2015 might have been a year where you really let yourself explore, trying out new experiences and maybe even new personas on for size. You were figuring out where you’re heading and whether you’re comfortable with what you’ve done with your life so far. Things may have changed really quickly for you, as you morphed into the more empowered and self-aware version of you, the one who’s greeting 2016 right now.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">And all your seeking has really paid off! You are more secure in your skin now, you’re way more attuned to your true worth and what you can uniquely bring to the world. And with that, comes a sense of grounding. What resources can you marshal, both from within and without? You will be calling on a lot of your personal resources that you’ve built up over the past year. It could be new skills, new relationships, new inspirations to build the world of your dreams. The time for adventuring is temporarily over - you’re now in your building phase, to build a secure foundation for yourself you can lean on for the years to come.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Nowhere will this newfound sense of confidence be able to come through more than in your realm of Work &amp; Wealth, dear Gemini. You have so much raw material to work with now! You are able to turn your dreams into reality - when it comes to work, the question is, which of these dreams do you see the most long term potential? Where do you see yourself focusing all your energy and attention? You can bring anything into reality as long as you know what you want, why you want it, and if all of you really wants it - including your heart, not just your mind. This is an amazing energy for you to work with. Use it wisely and to your advantage, by focusing all your energies on the areas you’ve identified. You may have to put on the blinders a little bit. Start saying ‘no’ more so that you can say ‘yes’ to your own projects.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">There are positive signs that your relationship will be steadily growing stronger this year, if you are in a committed relationship right now. I’ve a feeling that it might be because of all the work that you’ve put towards showing the more Feminine side of strength. It’s a kind of soft strength that isn’t about brawn, muscle or brute force. These manifest as tolerance, gentleness, allowing the space to be, as well as having patience. Though quieter and less dramatic, these are very valuable tools for you to navigate the waters of love. You’re finding that certain things really aren’t worth the fight or getting upset about anymore - you’ve risen above it. The love you have for your partner allows you to value peaceful communication over petty fights. And it’s all paying off in a mutually respectful relationship. Conversely, it might also be about your partner demonstrating that side of strength too - he/she might have taken the lead in being tolerant and patient, showing you in the process how it’s totally possible to be strong yet gentle at the same time.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you’re not in a committed relationship right now, whether you’re looking to be in one or not, there is a calmness about you. You’re truly realizing that it doesn’t take another person for you to feel a certain way about yourself. You’re discovering that your heart can bloom, just for yourself - you can be in love, without needing a lover. You’re realizing that the texture of love is so different when it’s directed at yourself, at your own heart. You’re discovering how you can be alone but not lonely. And that is so wonderful! If you’re dating, or actively seeking out a relationship, it will be perfect to project that sense of confidence and strength as you go on your dates. When you are able to interact with the other without any sense of expectation, just enjoying their company without being too attached to the outcome, you will be surprised at where it will lead you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">CANCER <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I am unstoppable when I trust myself.”</strong></p>
              <p class="rtecenter" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><img class="imgResponsive" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; width: 460px; height: 460px; max-width: 460px; max-height: 460px;" title="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 CANCER" src="http://www.herworldplus.com/sites/default/files/western_zodiac_horoscope_for_2016_cancer.jpg" alt="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 CANCER" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Hello, sharp mind. What do you most use your mind for? Is it to make smart choices in your life, or to cast judgement - upon yourself or others? 2016 will see events coming up in your life that will require you to make the best use of your discerning mind. In any challenge, you will be calling upon your powers of judgement, your ability to see through BS, and your insights to pierce through smoke and mirrors to take actions in your best interest. 2015 was really a year where you had to do a lot of feeling - you probably won’t admit this to<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">anyone, but you know you feel so much; sometimes you may have feared being pulled down by the undertow. You may have felt a little frightened by the intensity of it, the directions it pulled you in, the uncertainty of shifting sands and trying to make your way across ground that was far from solid. It may have felt like traipsing around in mud one second, and skating across ice the next, unable to stop yourself. </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Do you want to know a secret, dear Cancer? All those emotions were really just a test for you to see if you could ride them well, to understand what triggers the ups and downs, and the true meaning behind them - so that you could really understand yourself on a deeper, more intimate level than before. If you paid attention, and did the necessary work to observe your emotions - they really help you experience all facets of yourself, not just the shiny pretty front that you show to the world. You will come to realize that having this wealth of experience in riding your emotions will serve you well when you are making decisions in 2016 - you now know when you’re making a purely emotional decision, vs an intellectual one, and how to balance the two. The keyword here is finding a balance. When using your intellect to make a decision, take time to figure out the most compassionate, gentle way to implement it. When letting your heart guide your actions, figure out a way that will still take care of your material and long term professional interests.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Have you been honing a particular skill set? Have you already taken every class, read a ton of books, been working on it for a long while now? Preparing? I’m here to tell you that you ARE ready, dear Cancer. It’s your year to really turn your ideas into gold. This year has the energy of action - doing, manifesting, bringing into practical reality. You are at a phase where you are ready to show your work, you are ready to make it happen. Not only that, you ARE ready to succeed and profit from it. All it takes is your commitment and faith in your mastery of your particular craft, and to stick with it long enough to reap the rewards. Remember how we talked about mastering your emotions and allowing them to inform your decisions, instead of letting them lead you? This comes into play in your work as well - don’t let those feelings sway you off your path. You are super prepared. You do know your stuff. You DO know your market, your audience. It’s all within you. Don’t let those doubts be bigger than your dreams, dear Cancer. The only caveat: work steadily at it. Come up with a plan that you can stick to. Persevere, dear Cancer. I’m seeing that the pot of gold is waiting for you, there for your taking.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you are in a partnership right now, I see this year as a shift towards including others in your activities and plans than staying in your exclusive twosome. Sometimes, growing as a couple requires reflection and feedback from others. You get to observe how you both interact in a group; you may see a side of each other that surprises the both of you and allows you to experience another facet of them. It may also point to a desire to collaborate and to join forces in a business or a project - what skills does your lover possess that complement yours too? Could you guys possibly put them together to make something profitable out of it? Whatever you ultimately decide to do, the theme of learning underlies all of it - to make your relationship grow stronger, adopting an attitude of humility will allow you to learn from each other’s strengths, while supporting and shoring up areas of weaknesses. There is much wisdom in the other that will be able to benefit you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you aren’t in a committed relationship at the moment, I see that you’re putting your focus into your heart’s projects and turning your dreams into reality. You’re learning and growing, and you aren’t too concerned about being single right now. But you do know that you’re extraordinarily attractive when you’re in your element right? Your potential amour may be secretly admiring you as you put out your work with confidence and grace. So the one may land in your lap while you aren’t even looking! Isn’t that usually the case?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">LEO<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I have the courage to look within.

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Dear Leo, 2016 will be a year where you’re starting a new cycle. You’ve probably already been spending the last few months of 2015 shaking off the dust of a completed cycle, during which time may have felt kind of low key and slower-paced for you. It’s important to always remember that life isn’t a straight line trajectory - there are cycles, waxing and waning, ebbing and flowing. I know you take pride in knowing how things will go and feeling in control, and feeling like you’ve got it all handled (in fact, who doesn’t?) but I have a feeling that 2015 might have shaken some of that certainty up. There may have been quite a few surprises for you, where you were compelled to question many things in your life. It’s like suddenly discovering that, hey, life is not as cut and dried as I thought it was; I DON’T have it all figured out, I don’t know everything yet… But instead of letting that thought scare you, this year, you’ll be allowing a sense of excitement to come in. The start of this new phase will be all about further self-discovery, and going after long-held dreams that you may have shelved indefinitely. 2016 will bring you many opportunities where you will get a chance to approach life with curiosity, creativity and confidence. You’re cutting loose a little. And all for good reason! Because there are wonderful surprises waiting for you, and they will all be better than anything you could ever imagine!</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">This will be a year where you will surprise yourself, with your level of creativity, passion and boldness that you are able to harness. You may be hesitant to label yourself or to put yourself in a box just yet - you’re having too much fun exploring! You’ll be allowing yourself to shine in ways that you never thought you could. You’ll be discovering new areas of self-expression: perhaps you never fancied yourself much of a dancer, but you go take up dance classes anyway, and find yourself enjoying it so much! Ever wanted to paint, sculpt, write, bellydance, sing…? It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as you open yourself up to trying it out and going in with the intention of simply having fun and being able to direct your fiery life force at something creative. Your untapped creative potential is just waiting to burst out this year; you will feel your life force surging through you, and you will feel so good. Allow yourself to revel in that.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Isn’t it so satisfying to know that something you’ve built with your own time, effort, sweat and tears can stand the test of time, and be the bedrock you can build your whole life upon? This is the year you’ll begin building towards that sense of satisfaction in your work. It’s time to get structured, organized and systematic. All that creativity needs to be channelled constructively so that it can be most effective, and get the best results. On a higher level, this could be assuming a position of authority, where you’ll be learning how to lead others, and be an example to them. You will be filling those shoes and taking up those reins - and honestly, you were born to do it. If there was any fear or doubt, banish those<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">thoughts right away! With your big heart and ability to take charge courageously, there is no better candidate for a leadership position. It’s an area of your life that you want to count on to bring yourself that sense of security. I would say take it slow, but at a steady clip. It’s important to not let emotions lead you astray - if you’re able to come up with a plan that you’re confident about, stick with it and see it through. You’ll be amazed at the results.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Dear Leo in a relationship, you know that you love being showered with attention and affection. Nothing makes you feel more treasured than being adored. However, if you’re facing any kind of problem in your relationship, it is time to really dig deep and ask yourself some important questions, such as: does your need for attention and affection sometimes override your partner’s ability to give it at the moment? Perhaps he or she is really stressed, tired, or even ill, and thus not able to give as much as they would like to, temporarily. How do you respond to that? Is your give and take equal? I’m sorry Leo, to cut so close to the bone this quickly, but these questions seem to be pertinent to your love life at the moment. There may be situations that arise in your partnership that may have you questioning yourself and your dynamic in this way, especially if there have been recurring arguments, or a pattern of spats that seem to go nowhere… It’s time to really dig deep and look at your motivations.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">On the other hand, if you’re staying in a relationship because of other reasons - and let’s face it, people get into relationships for all kinds of reasons - it might be time to do a review if that’s actually serving you and your greater good. Here are some questions you can ask yourself: Is this relationship holding you back in some way? Are you actually using your relationship as an escape or to hide from something (yourself and your gifts, maybe?). Are your standards so high you find yourself constantly disappointed by your partner? I don’t want to speculate, because there could be so many underlying reasons, but I would encourage you to probe gently… once you have the answers to these questions, you will know the next step to take.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you’re not in a committed relationship at the moment, you may be finding yourself drawn to someone you could reasonably deem as being Bad For You. Meaning, that mysterious, dark, tall and handsome guy, who’s also a womanizer. The artsy, romantic wanderer who has a hard time staying committed. If that’s the case, if you’re looking at them for something serious, you will really have to ask yourself what you’re getting into before you dip your toe in. There are times when you will need to ask yourself if it’s really worth it! Also, someone may be appealing to your ego - they may shower you with compliments and buy you expensive gifts, but be sure to check what their motivations really are.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">VIRGO <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I trust myself unconditionally. My creativity will shine for all to see.”</strong></p>
              <p class="rtecenter" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><img class="imgResponsive" style="box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: middle; width: 460px; height: 460px; max-width: 460px; max-height: 460px;" title="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 VIRGO" src="http://www.herworldplus.com/sites/default/files/western_zodiac_horoscope_for_2016_virgo.jpg" alt="Your zodiac horoscope for life, love and career in 2016 VIRGO" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Dear Virgo, I see you shining with creativity and enthusiasm. I see that you’ve reached a new level of confidence in yourself and your ability to be original, that you’re now owning what is unique and powerful within you. You are ready to show the world what you’ve got. More importantly, you’re now taking bold, concrete steps to reach your goals in 2016! Honestly, the energy I feel for you this year is just pure excitement, with a sense of determination and optimism. 2015 was a year that really pushed you to question what’s important - what you hold dear to your heart, your true life purpose, where you’re directing your efforts, what really lights you up, and what you’re willing to work towards and fight for in the long term. All the challenges of the year only served to bring you closer to what matters to you. This year, the more risks you take, the more you’re willing to put yourself out there, to step up into the spotlight, the more the world will be able to reward you for your efforts and your talents.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">This is not the year to stay low-key, or be in the background. This is the year to front your efforts with your signature grace and quiet confidence. Every time your nerves get to you, think to yourself, who are you serving? Who are the people that NEED what you’ve been cooking up? Who are the people that will be able to benefit so much from what you’ve been working so hard on? Every time you get self-conscious, just remember you’re not putting yourself out there just for any old fame, or recognition - it’s about really giving the world something useful, that has the potential to help people be happy or lead better lives. Yes, I have no doubt that your goals are that ambitious, dear Virgo, because you of all signs are able to make it happen.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Do you think of creativity, and of productivity as a factory line, just chugging along, that you can flip on and off like a switch? Or do you think of it in terms of cycles, as an organic process that waxes and wanes, ebbs and flows? How you see the flows of your work and wealth this year will greatly determine how you feel about what’s happening in these areas of your life. The truth is, we can’t always be 100% productive all the time, even though we may prefer for that to be so. Our productivity isn’t governed by neat, 5 day blocks of 8 hours each. It just doesn’t work that way for everyone, even if practical reality dictates it. So when you hit a block or get frustrated with your level of productivity, step back for a moment and really allow yourself to feel what you really need at the moment - should you be stepping away from your desk, and taking a break instead? Will pushing yourself for a few more hours really produce the kind of work that you’re happy with? </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Also, because of how closely tied your sense of self-worth is to your work, this will always be an area of your life that will stir up emotions for you. 2016 will offer you many opportunities to question: How much is my work really worth? Am I confident about what I’m offering to the world? Am I undervaluing myself? These are questions that only you can answer, dear Virgo, and they may not be answers that you can necessarily get out of a book. They may not even have clear-cut answers, and will require you to do some trial-and-error testing, some deep probing within yourself, some experimental steps to get feedback from others. It will also require research and putting your work out there in the world to get it grounded in reality, so that you can get real-world evidence of what it’s worth.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you are in a relationship right now, this is the year to take a novel approach to love matters. In your secret heart of hearts, you know that you want passion, excitement and adventure in a relationship, alongside all the good stuff like stability and loyalty. How do you bring more of that into your love life? You have to do your part, to really make time for it - to plan surprises, to go on date nights, to not default to the usual hangout and try something new instead. Channel some of your creativity into your romantic partnership, and you’ll really see it grow and nurture you in a way that you’ve forgotten you could feel. If you’re willing to put in the work - with enthusiasm and joy - the warm fuzzies will return to you in no time. Though it must be said that it does take two hands to clap - be sure to let your partner in on what you’re hoping to create more of in your relationship, and see that they are onboard to do their part in making it a fun and exciting partnership again too!</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you aren’t coupled right now, whether you’re looking or not, ‘serious’ won’t be a word that you’ll be associating with a romantic relationship. Why should you settle for boring? This is the year you’ll want to dress up and shine, just for yourself, because you want to look good and feel good. You’ll want to bring your vibrant self to the fore because you’re enjoying how you feel when you are uniquely yourself, compromising yourself for no one. And this will be exactly the quality that will be drawing you more suitors than you can imagine! When you shine, dear Virgo, you light up the sky. Your boldness, assertiveness and confidence will be turning heads and drawing admiring glances. This is the year when someone who puts in effort for a fun and creative date will impress you more than the good old movie and dinner. Be your best, vibrant self, and love will be flowing your way.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">LIBRA <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“Steadily and surely, I am building my security.”</strong></p>

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">OVERALL ENERGY OF YOUR YEAR<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">You’re in the midst of a cycle that is currently all about building. You’re looking to surround yourself with tangible results of your efforts. You want to feel like the Queen of your empire, you’re willing to put in the work to get there, and we are all cheering you on! What are you working towards, dear Libra? What is it that has gotten you all fired up, looking so determined? A business is definitely on your mind: are you starting your own lifestyle blog? Designing your own line of accessories? Or are you building up your online presence? Or<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">maybe even a multimillion dollar empire! This year brings an energy of seriousness and drive - you’ve set your sights on a particular goal, and you're not going to let anything or anyone stop you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">The year’s energy supports you in committing to your efforts and helping you to drive your plans forward. In 2015, you may already have laid the groundwork for this project or plan that you’re now so eager to bring into fruition, and if you're still waiting for any sign to move forward boldly - this is it! This year supports steady efforts, tried and tested methods, and sheer willpower and patience to see things through. It’s not a year for trying out shortcuts, or testing out the latest fads. If in doubt, consider investing in expert opinion, seeking out the advice of people who have gone before you on your path, doing research, and basically making sure that your bases are covered. Above all, your persistence is required.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">In balancing out the fiery energy of the year that will be driving all your efforts, an element of patience and restraint is needed. With all that go-go-go and sheer horsepower energy, there is a danger of missing the mark or making overly hasty decisions. Take breaks to check in periodically that you are still aligned with your big picture. You will need to call in your higher self often, so that you’re mindful of what you’re doing and it’s not something you decided to impulsively take on just because it looked good in the moment. You can sometimes get so caught up in the excitement of things, that you get momentarily swept away! And that is not a bad thing - but this year, it is important to be able to focus your energies on the things that are truly worthwhile.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Which areas of your work do you place your focus on to an excess? For example, there are certain things you pay attention to more because you enjoy them, while neglecting some other equally vital, yet not so fun bits. Only you will know where you will need to find more balance. Achieving a sense of harmony is key - where all parts are working together in tandem. You may also be called upon to play the mediating role in your work - where your diplomatic abilities will come in very handy when it comes to navigating conflicts, seeing that different parties get their needs met. I also see teaching and learning for you to be the big themes of the year - we learn best when we teach, so go out there and spread what you know, and you will end up learning even more in the process! Or you may discover that there are certain ideas that are intriguing to you, or that you have certain gaps in your knowledge, and you would love to explore them further through higher learning.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you’re in a relationship right now, you and your amour will be reaching a new level of commitment, love and stability. I have a feeling that 2015 really involved the both of you getting to know each other on a deeper level. That was a year where you grew closer, discovered a lot about each other, which perhaps involved working out the kinks of your relationship, while understanding where certain compromises may have to be made. Many often neglect that effort is needed to make a love relationship work, but this time around, you’ve put in the effort to make it something to go the distance. This year, this solid base will be a springboard for a collaboration between the two of you - you may also be excited about what the both of you can bring into practical reality - you’ve found the one that your ideas just flow with, who you can bounce ideas off, and who inspires you to get things moving and that you want to make things happen with. Whether it’s going to be a baby or a creative project, know that this sense of excitement can be trusted. This is an area of your life where you will be feeling really excited about, and where it will be wise to channel all of that restless energy into a project outside of yourselves. For example, a home improvement project, a shared savings goal or even an investment portfolio. Putting your heads together to dream up of a shared objective, and working towards it as a team will cement your bond and bring it to the next level.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you are single, this year will be about making sure that feeling safe and secure within your own skin is a priority for you. Your own sense of security is important because we first need to offer ourselves the love that we look for, so that we are not looking for someone to complete us, but instead, complement us. How does the prospect of this sound to you? I know, it may seem like a real task if you’ve never really considered this before. But it really starts with the little things. It’s about having faith in your own talents, your own voice, and your own abilities. All of which you have in bucketloads. You have no reason to really doubt yourself, or your true worth. It’s also about knowing that can be comfortable and happy in your own skin, without being coupled up. When your self-belief is deeply rooted within you, your glow will draw in admirers from everywhere.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">SCORPIO <br style="box-sizing: border-box;">“I am so strong I can be gentle.”</strong></p>

Every time you tried to ignore it or to stuff your emotions down, they just came up, rearing their heads, forcing you to confront them. Take a moment to breathe deeply, my love. Take a moment to congratulate yourself, and to look back over the terrain you’ve traversed. Though it’s all par for the course for you - being a Scorpio, you should already be very familiar with exploring your inner world - you should still feel proud of yourself for all that you’ve managed to work through. 2016 will be the physical manifestation of the changes that you having been going through internally. These changes will start to show - from the way you lead your day to day life, the thoughts you allow to take up space in your mind, to the way you interact with others, and the attitude you approach life with in general. I see a kind of softening in you, a knowledge that it isn’t necessary to always be the strong one, that having your vulnerabilities show doesn’t make you weak - in fact, it allows others to draw closer to you, because under all your impressive abilities, you are so very human, so very sensitive, and so deserving of the love that others can’t wait to give you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">This complete change will manifest in unique ways depending on your individual life path. It could be practical things, like leaving a job or moving to another country. But more likely, it could be about far reaching psychological changes. It’s like a switch flipped in you. You may suddenly decide that you don’t want to do things a certain way any more, you may discover that there truly isn’t a ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ for certain things - that not all things are black and white, and don’t need to be judged as so. Sometimes what feels right may look wrong on the surface, and you’re now able to tolerate that tension, and to accept that certain things just can’t be parsed or worked through with your intellectual mind. Basically, an utter and total transformation that has been years in the making. You’re also finding new ways of expression of the darkness within you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Although culturally, ‘darkness’ has taken on some kind of ominous, negative quality to it - most of the fear and mystery around it is totally unfounded. Darkness simply means qualities that are underground, that operate within our subconscious, that don’t necessarily get to be expressed in our day to day life. You will be finding more ways to work with the darker feelings within you, and to let it out in safe, creative ways, through art or other forms of self-expression.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">WORK<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">You’re already an expert at assessing, making judgement calls, collecting facts and information, and preparing an excellent summary of what’s going on. Your sharp mind is prized and rewarded at work, and rightly so! I see you reaching a new level of mastery in your work this year. 2015 was really a period that broadened your mind, with a lot of new information flooding in and challenging you and your psyche in ways that you’ve never experienced before. There was a lot to take in. You learnt a lot, and had to learn to become more flexible, to evolve the ways you think, and to consider alternate viewpoints. All of that had a purpose, dear Scorpio. They were challenges to help you develop your mental faculties further, and to help you eventually fulfill the potential of all that you are here to offer the world. And that potential is great!</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">This year, it’s about putting together all that you’ve learnt in a way that can further benefit others. You’re skilled at putting disparate elements together. You are blessed with superb<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">organizational skills and managing many different moving parts. You are excellent at synthesizing information. Many of your rewards will come from helping others to see issues at<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">work the way you do - while offering up all your brilliant solutions. You will be a way-shower. Refining your ways of articulating your truth to those you work with will be the ultimate key to your success this year. Temper your tone with some honey, dear Scorpio. Learn to see when to hold back and when to speak up. You will see that even when you don’t explicitly state things in the plainest terms ever, your point still gets across. You will be respected, not feared, and things will still get done - brilliantly.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">ROMANCE<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you are in a relationship, it’s time to let your intellectual side take a backseat. Yes, that means giving your mind - that gets to be so brilliantly used in your work - a little rest. Allow your heart, your soul and your spirit to take over. I see a deep femininity in you that wants to be expressed, dear Scorpio. “Wait, I’m a woman - I’m already feminine by default,” you say, “what do you mean?” To be clear, both men and women have the feminine AND the masculine in them. Each is associated with different qualities, and the feminine is defined by intuition, patience, allowing, creativity, whereas the masculine is about action, bringing ideas into practical reality, and drive. Both have their place in the world, both are equally important. In matters of love, what this means is to remove the usual mind-oriented, problem solving approach that you would usually apply to work and other areas of your life, and allowing your heart to come forward instead. Whenever things get foggy or unclear, probe gently to find the heart of the matter. I have a feeling that many issues that will arise this year will be matters that aren’t necessarily neat, rational problems that can be solved by putting a band-aid on it - or even necessarily needs to be solved. Rather, they may simply need to be heard, need some breathing room, space for expression, as well as your support and attention.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">If you’re not in a committed relationship at the moment, or looking for someone - there is a reason for it. You are deeply exploring what it even means to be a woman. What is there to<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">being a woman? The answer is as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. You want to be really strong and confident in yourself being the woman in a relationship. You want to know what you are fully capable of bringing to a partnership - and what you want out of it. You are exploring it deeply, and enjoying the process a fair bit. There’s no rush or hurry to be in a relationship, because this process of getting to know yourself is already a pretty consuming process! I see you happy to stand alone for a bit and feeling at peace about it. We attract the things that we need for us in our lives, my love, and when you are standing so deeply and beautifully in your peace, so comfortable in your skin, if it is right for you, the perfect one you for you will walk right into your life.</p>

I can feel you reaching out far beyond the borders of what you once thought possible. You’re no longer content with the confines you thought you’d be happy living within. This year, the world will offer up a plethora of choices and opportunities for you - it’s a beginning of a new cycle of sorts, where you’re now more ready to follow your heart and to discover where your creativity and passion can lead you. There are by no means any clear answers, or even a clear end-goal. But what has become increasingly clear to you is this: that there will no longer be any kind of satisfying life where you’re only living a half-truth, or a boiled down version of what’s in your heart. This is what will really serve you well in 2016: to go after what’s in your heart. You will know what it is when it fills you up with passion, that clearly isn’t just mere intellectual stimulation, but is something that truly excites you to your core. Because once the initial heady excitement fades, it’s still something that sticks with you.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: 'Montserrat Regular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 14px;">Taking a beginner’s mindset to everything that you do in this year will be rewarding - without expectations, but with all your enthusiasm and curiosity. Because the rewards will be great - I actually see an exciting new vista for you where once you allow the floodgates to open, you will find yourself buoyed by all the amazing opportunities that you’d never imagined. Don’t let yourself be weighed down by thinking too far ahead about the what-ifs or wanting to achieve mastery immediately. Be in the moment and enjoy how it feels like to do whatever it is that you’ve set your heart on doing - whether it’s starting a new business, learning a new skill, picking up a new hobby, joining a social group, teachin</p>

Expect passions, desires to learn, grow, create and innovate to be at its all-time peak. Investments will flourish and economies will pick up. This applies to both a global and a personal perspective. It’s the perfect year for all singletons to link up with their plus ones and those hitched to expand their families. So move forward with optimism and a cheery disposition. Indulging in a little risk taking will present no harm this year!</p>

However, rash decisions and a lack of discipline are not part of the equation. It’s ok to daydream and take risks but in moderation when combined with level headedness. Moving forward too quickly may result in financial loss however moving forward slowly but surely will ensure success. Anticipate tongues to wag with jealousy at your successes. But with your style and elegance you put them to shame quietly.</p>

You are looking to find the one thing that will excite you and keep your attention going. It’s going to be a year of finding the balance between taking risks and lying low when you need to. Participating in conflicts and power struggles aren’t really going to work in your favour so stick with what you are familiar with and you will find your joy. Self-improvement seems to be the theme for the year where you work on building on existing knowledge. Expect to discover a new ambitious and more confident you by year end as energies become more focused.</p>

Each one will be a test of your qualities. Roaring your way out isn’t really going to cut it this year. Use your intellect, practice calm, emotional maturity and lots of patience to weave your way out of tight alleys. Short cuts will be very enticing but hold yourself back from taking them as your ‘situation’ will definitely make a reappearance as taking short cuts would mean you have not learnt your lesson the first time round. It’s a fairly ambitious year where you will feel the need to achieve lots but avoid getting frustrated when things don’t always go your way.</p>

Luck together with hard work moves you upwards and onwards fairly quickly. As swift as things are flowing for you, it is always advisable to step back for a moment and quieten things down to listen to that inner voice which will prove to be your strong guidance this year. Good things are never achieved on your own hence remember to encourage and praise the team that you work with. Slowing things down will be an appropriate thing to do during the third quarter. It’s also a fantastic year for picking up new knowledge or skill set. Rise to the challenge and test yourself and don’t be afraid to try that off the beaten path.</p>

Stick with the familiar and you will be in a very safe position for 2016. Keep an eye on your finances as well. Avoid getting into any investment opportunities which sound too good to be true. Going with the herd might be just what you need this year. When it comes to career and ambitions, opportunities are abundant and all equally good. It might be good for you to get a general consensus from close ones when going for the best option just to be sure you aren’t taking unnecessary risks. Your general mood will turn more cheery and more at ease as the year progresses so just take care as not to rub people up the wrong way at the start of the year.</p>

Snakes will find themselves switching their focus on appreciating what is already before them rather than constantly craving for something better. The patience of the snake will certainly be tested. This will be evident when what you have been working on takes forever to deliver results and you begin to lose hope. Relationships will see an improvement as you decide to mature up and forgive past grievances. Keeping the peace within yourself and with everyone will be your motto this coming year.</p>

Creativity is blooming and ideas just seem to be popping out of your ears. Be cautious as to whom you are sharing this information with. Shared with the wrong company and it could stir up jealousy and negativity which would not work in your favour of achieving success. Also you do not want someone else to make something out of your ideas before you do! You may ‘lose’ some money in the form of an investment but this will be returned very soon in terms of profits or gains. There is a nice flow and structure to the year which allows you to achieve what you have been wanting for some time in this Monkey Year!</p>

It’s good news galore when it comes to the area of your finances, career, business and health. Ideas never cease to flow and changes come quickly. The Sheep will be spoilt for choices when it comes to opportunities. What an exciting time it will be! When things move a little too quickly and good things flow non-stop there will be a tendency to be careless and big headed. So just be on your toes at all times and use your strong sense of intuition to guide you when it comes to judging characters around you.</p>

This could be a make or break year. Things could go really well or the opposite. This will be entirely dependent on the choices that you make as you go along. You might find yourself in emotionally unstable times so be sure to make decisions when you find things are at their calmest. The ingredients are all there to make a financial success for yourself this Year of the Monkey but it’s important that you don’t end up making a loss when it comes to who you are dealing with. Intuition will be your friend this year so use it as much as you can to light your path.</p>

Venturing beyond your comfort zone or choosing to take up challenges which you would not normally do isn’t recommended for this year. Apart from power struggles in the work or business area things are going to plod on in a slow and steady manner. It isn’t the year to put a business idea into motion as it looks like more thought and effort is needed to fine tune your ideas. Roosters may find themselves feeling restless and energies may not be very calm so there may be a tendency to get involved in arguments. Keep a watch on your finances and try your best to achieve a balance between your incomings and outgoings.</p>

Adventure and new discoveries await and you take charge of things to make this happen for yourself. You tread where you have never been before but you do so with calculated risks and prior knowledge and understanding. All are very wise moves on your part. For the single Dog, expect wedding bells and for the settled Dog you may expect a little one to add to the clan. There is more time being spent with the family as Dogs usually do. But the adventurous side takes over sometimes and you find yourself a little busier on the social front as well. It’s important that you keep an eye on finances as there will be a need for it on the family front. </p>

You learn the art of giving and receiving. But this will be more so for your benefit. If things aren’t really going to benefit you in anyway then you won’t be going ahead it. All the elements are in your favour and growth and development are expected in all areas of life like finance, health and energy. Make the most of this year and not let any opportunity go to waste. Take the chance if you feel like it. Trust that all will work out.
