Most of the product cost &gt;$100.<br>Example : Toner is $76<br>Refining Treatment is $179<br>Treatment Essence (the Miracle Water as advertised) : $94 for 75ml and $149 for 150 ml.<br><br>2 ) Generally all counters give good service.  Usually seven days after you buy from them, they will give you a call to see how you find the product.<br><br>3 ) My complexion has been better.  I see result from the Refining Treatment cuz I constantly have blackheads and white heads on the side of my face due to my hair.  Within less than 1 month, my face is not so rough anymore.  Now quite smooth.  But I heard that the Miracle Water is the one that makes the most magic.  I have just started using this Water thing two weeks ago.  Haven't seen any result yet.  But from all the brochures, it says that this Water is supposed to enhance the effect of all other products.<br><br>4 ) I have not heard of any facial service.  I don't think so.</div>
