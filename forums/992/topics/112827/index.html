My ex-Sister In Law always stretch out her hands for $$$$ and she don't work. Every month give her 500 and she still want more and more .. and take from my parents (they are near 70 yr old liao) as well to spend on her junk food. What a b!tch!<br>And she is in her early 40s. We ask her to work, she pretend and shirk. Find work and got everything done for her and she pretend she has to take care of her kid. But,s she actually throws her kid to my mom. She does not feed of bath her. She just sits home watch TV and complains Tv is lousy. Then she asked for a maid so as to help her with housework which she does not do. Yet she cannot speak a word of english or malay. She can only speak Chinese (she's taiwanese) and expect the maid to learn chinese.<br><br>She created so much conflict and quarrel in the family. Then she say want to divorce since 1st week she got married until finally she walk out on her own, abandon her kid (less than 2 yr old). Then she claim she did not ask for divorce and claims we threw her out. Then she fight custody for the kid so as to make us pay alimony. She spent all my brother's savings  on her diamonds and gifts for herself, every trip back to Taiwan (2 to 3 times each yr  and each time is about 2-3 months. She actually didn't want to come back). The kid followed her, goes there weighing at 12-13 kg. Come back is left about 9-10 kg. She said she skip breakfast and dinner for the kid (she is crazy!). She filed so many false claims with her lawyer to get whatever money she can from my family, and she wanted the house to be sold(she did not pay a single cent for it) to get half her so called share. My dad is never a rich person, he sells fruits at factory canteen and to supplement income, he goes to pick cardboard boxes and drink cans. He's been paying for all these things until he's fed up. My brother has still not learn his lesson and is teaching his daighter to be like him so foolish and to be like his wife, take and take only.<br><br>But there are people like my sister in law (foreign bride whom every man all so wow-wow about) who comes around and abuse my family and take so much out of them. My parent's are now broken in spirit and in money. I am disappointed with everything but there is not much I can do.<br><br></div>
