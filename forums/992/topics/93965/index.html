If it works out, then everything is okay.  If it doesn't work out, then you will have to bear the hurt, the pain etc.<br><br>Life and love is unpredictable.<br><br>Whatever it is, follow your heart.  Even if the relationship doesn't work out, at least you have given it all and tried your best.  That is the best thing you could have done for yourself.  To give yourself the opportunity even if the odds were against you.<br><br>If you didn't follow your heart but chose instead to follow blindly whatever your parents / friends say, then you would never know what could have been had you done what you wanted in the first place.  There is no guarantee that following your heart will always be the right thing to do but hey, life would be meaningless if everybody followed a life plan determined by his/her parents only.<br><br></div>
