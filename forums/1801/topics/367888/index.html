One of the EDM industries favourite and most prolific producers and DJ's, Mr Marco V is back with what looks to be his most incredible artist album yet - Propaganda.</span><br><br><span class="content-article-body" style="font-family: verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-style: normal; line-height: 16px !important; color: #000000;"><img class="floatCenteredBorder" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: auto; padding: 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="http://img.trance.nu/?width=422&amp;url=http://www.trance.nu/v4/_themes/tnuv4/assets/covers/Marco_V_Propaganda_COVER_lowres.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="422" height="426"><br><strong>Trance.nu: Hi Marco, where in the world do we find you? In the studio perhaps, putting some final touches on the album?</strong> <br>I am in a plane on my way to Brasil - Sao Paolo. The Album is finished I am working now on Propaganda part 2 that's going to be out after the summer. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: I can imagine you must be incredibly excited to be presenting your new album to the world after all the hard work that’s gone into it?</strong> <br>Yes I am. I wanted to create an album that works on a dance floor but also something that's great to listen to when you are not in a club. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Propaganda part 2? Now that is very interesting news! Could this be part of the twist we’ve been anticipating? Two albums in one year? So if Propaganda is the new Marco V artist album, could I guess that Propaganda Part 2 will be mix album of some of your finest beat selections?</strong> <br>I have so much new music at the moment that didn't fit into one album, I also wanted to make extended tracks and not shorts edits from the original versions. So I thought it was a great idea to spread it over 2 albums, now I can have all the tracks on Propaganda that I like and also the full versions. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: You also have world renowned illustrator Vee Ladwa working on a Propaganda comic book as part of the album? This is such an exciting idea and an EDM first I’m sure. An image to the Propaganda sound? How did the comic idea come about?</strong> <br>We thought about something that combines the 2 albums into one, first I had the idea cut the artwork into 2 parts and when you put together the albums it would have been one artwork. This will work for a vinyl cover but not for a CD cover. Now there is a small comic story inside the CD that is cut into 2 parts and gives the Propaganda feel an extra boost. <br><br><img class="floatCenteredBorder" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: auto; padding: 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="http://www.trance.nu/v4/_themes/tnuv4/assets/artists/Marco_V_by_VeeEL.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="391"><br>A sample of Vee Ladwa's work with Marco V. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: You seem to be quite the professional propagandist with this new and very exciting campaign! The dictionary defines propaganda as “information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause”. Would you like to elaborate on the Marco V cause?</strong> <br>I want to infect as many people as possible with my "music". That's what I mean with Propaganda the Marco V sound. There are still a lot of people who don't know what I play and/or produce. But don't take it all too seriously it’s just for fun! <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: The first release of the new album is already creating a storm of propaganda! ‘Unprepared’ sets a high standard for the rest of the album to follow. Is there a story behind the tracks Iggy Pop-like lyrics?</strong> <br>No not really, most of the times we just make what's pops up in my mind. There is only one rule in my studio, go with the flow and see what comes out on the end of the day. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Being the head honcho behind the very established and successful In Charge records must take the pressure off you as far as releases are concerned and obviously allow you greater artistic creativity?</strong> <br>I always have worked close with my A&amp;R manager but having my own label gives me a bit more freedom to release different stuff from myself and from others. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Is this part of the reason behind the four year intermission from your last artist release?</strong> <br>Yes, there is a lot of going on and time flies. It's very hard to do the amount of traveling I do and produce a new album. I just moved to a new house and got myself a new dream studio in the basement. Now I have much more time to spend in the studio. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Congratulations on the new house! Being an aspiring bedroom producer myself I can’t help but ask you for more detail about this dream studio?</strong> <br>I have custom made studio monitors and a control room that is completely flat. The only thing you hear is what really comes out of the speakers, no extra sub, resonance etc. <br><br><img class="floatCenteredBorder" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: auto; padding: 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="http://img.trance.nu/?width=422&amp;url=http://www.trance.nu/v4/_themes/tnuv4/assets/artists/Marco_V.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="422" height="633"><br><br><strong>Trance.nu: What are Marco V’s top tips when it comes to the global travelling DJ?</strong> <br>I always try to stay in my own time zone so i don't have to much of a jet lag when I come home and always try to eat healthy as well. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Have you discovered any places around the globe where the EDM scene is particularly good?</strong> <br>It's more about clubs than countries, there are some clubs where the vibe is extremely good. One of my favorite places is the Zouk club in Singapore. I was in club Sirena in Sao Paolo for the first time and that was also great! <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: I am busy downloading my “monthly recharge!” from iTunes in the form of the April TopTenMix! Can’t wait to get my ears around it! Has the TopTenMix radio show and podcast been a successful project?</strong> <br>Yeah, it started as a project on my website but after a few months more and more requests came if it was possible to download the mix. For me it was the right moment to get it to a radio station and get myself a podcast. At the moment is on 10 different internet and fm stations worldwide and expanding every month. <br><br><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://www.marcov.nl/"><img class="floatCenteredBorder" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: auto; padding: 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;" src="http://img.trance.nu/?width=422&amp;url=http://www.trance.nu/v4/_themes/tnuv4/assets/artists/toptenbanner.gif" border="0" alt="" width="422" height="99"></a><br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Does part of you feel saddened about the prevalent state of electronic piracy in the world today especially when you will soon be presenting your very own electronic child to the world in the form of your new album?</strong> <br>Yes but there is nothing I can do about it. The good thing is that the legal downloads are going up every month, so maybe things will change in the near future. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: What is your take on where the EDM scene is at the moment and where you see it going in future?</strong> <br>I wish I knew, it would help me a lot! <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: You have had two very successfully collaborations with fellow Dutchman Sander Van Doorn in the form of ‘Organic’ and the more recent ‘What Say’. What do you feel has been the key to the success of this collaboration? </strong><br>We both have the same thoughts about music. We like the same techno tracks, same bands, we like trance but not the typical hands up in the air trance. So when you go in the studio you are on the same level music wise and you can produce whatever you like. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Are there any other artists out there you think you could repeat that collaborative magic with?</strong> <br>At the moment not but you never know. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Any vocalists who would compliment the Marco V sound?</strong> <br>I am speaking to somebody at the moment but I can't tell you who it is, first we want to see if the song is going to work for us. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Speaking of the Dutch! Next years FIFA world cup is being held in my country and I’m sure the mighty Dutch are going to be favourites to win again. I think we need to organize a Dutch supporter’s tour to South Africa! Gather the troops and come spread some quality music to our shores! Have you ever been to our shores in the past?</strong> <br>Yes years ago I did a few shows in Johannesburg. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: I read about an incredible open air concert you held in a forest? What other incredible events would you love to put together? Besides my brilliant Dutch Supporters Tour 2010!</strong>I would like to organize an In Charge party on a warm and sunny beach. We don't have that over here so I need to take it to a nice place abroad. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Well I can highly recommend South Africa’s warm climates and fantastic shorelines, Cape Town in particular! Track 11 on Propaganda, ‘WRC Theme’, does that stand for World Rally Championship theme?</strong> <br>Yes indeed, I remixed the original leader of the WRC TV show. They really liked it and asked me to make a "real" song from it. <br><br><strong>Trance.nu: Thank you for your time Marco! I wish you all the best for your new album and all that accompanying “propaganda” that will go with it!</strong> <br>My pleasure, thank you.</span> <br><br><span class="list-title" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 1.4em; font-weight: bold; color: #2c384d; text-transform: none;">Written by:</span><br><a class="link-nodisplay" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href="http://www.trance.nu/v4/mypage/67086">Craig Patterson</a></div>
