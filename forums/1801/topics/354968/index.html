              <p><strong>Trional feat. Cristina Soto - Piercing Quiet</strong></p>
              <p>The World is in constant motion, <br>and so are all of us.</p>
              <p>You love the glow of sunrise, <br>my stars come out at night.</p>
              <p>The night.<br>The night.<br>The night.<br>The night.</p>
              <p>Your quiet pierces trought me, <br>this freedom renewed.</p>
              <p>It takes me to a place where, <br>the silence strucks right through</p>
              <p>the night.</p>
              <p>the silence strucks right through <br>the night.</p>
              <p>The silence strucks right through <br>the night.</p>
              <p>The silence strucks right through <br>the night.</p>
              <p>As you cut your ties with burden, <br>the grown gets further away.</p>
              <p>Now that we are weightless, <br>I just have to say;</p>
              <p>The night</p>
              <p>the silence strucks right through <br>the night.</p>
              <p>The silence strucks right through <br>the night.</p>
