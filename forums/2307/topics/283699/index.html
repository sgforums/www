She is the first Singaporean to head a world sports body.<br><br>Phua also outlined her plans, such as getting bowling into the Olympics.<br><br>The recent Singapore Open saw, for the first time, bowling lanes set up in a shopping centre.<br><br>Bringing the sport to the people is just one of the many ways to increase the sportÂ’s visibility, according to Phua.<br><br>But now as president of the world body, she is thinking bigger Â— like a world bowling series.<br><br>It will consist of six to eight tournaments, involving the three major zones Â— namely the US, Europe and Asia.<br><br>And the prize money is a whopping US$150,000 per tournament.<br><br>The series will also help unite the three regions.<br><br>Singapore is expected to host the finale, but Phua has other plans, such as setting up the world secretariat here, manned by professionals who will drive the world bowling series.<br><br>The Singapore Sports Council and EDB (Economic Development Board) are also supportive of the move.<br><br>"As a world body, the requirements are going to be much more demanding especially if we have a thriving bowling scene from January to December. We definitely need credible (and) efficient staff to make sure that everything is well run," said FIQ President Phua. She is also the president of Singapore Bowling Federation.<br><br>The Olympics is the ultimate glory, and the world bowling series is expected to help with that goal.<br><br>Other plans on her agenda include getting bowling reinstated into the Commonwealth Games and expanding the sport into the African and Oceania regions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its definately good news to all aspiring bowlers, I think there could be a high possibility that Bowling is going to be part of the 1st Youth Olympic Games if Singapore going to be selected by the IOC to host the event.<br><br>What you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup. if i not wrong, because the lane conditions can be altered to suit a particular style of bowling and hence go against the definition of "sport".<br><br>Long time never bowl liao. Still recall the time I went to watch the cathay classic, where the top 3 of the highest total 30 games score goes step-ladder.<br><br>Remy won. But personally felt that Kimo Latoman (Spelling?) from Finland had more sportsman ship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It kind of challenging but its not impossible, ppl in the FIQ must be open and think out of the box to let the ppl in the IOC to be convinced that there could be fair play.<br><br>Just my wild thoughts........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>e.g. Lane condition can be set/oil differently in every/pair lanes, so that no advantages to any style of bowlers at the qulifying stages.<br><br>Bowlers will have to be knowledgeble to adapt and make quick changes.<br><br>On Sportsmanship, I've also witnessed some poor showmanship in a few major tournaments, it depends on a few factors<br><br>- What is at stake! $$$? Face?<br>- Whether the competing opponants knows each other<br>- Bowler's experience<br>- Mood of the Crowds<br>- Proceeding with the games, Good Start, Bad Start.<br>- etc<br><br>What we hope to see is a close fight everytime, but it may not be possible at times <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
