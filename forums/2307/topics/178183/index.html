M'sia, Thailand, Korea, Phillipines, etc...<br><br>See  the resent Asian Youth Championship, where are we heading?<br><br>If you are in your youth, and being part of a bowler fanatic in SG, does it bothers you? I meant, is there something worng with our system? Why aren't our bowlers performed at the bigger stage, are we over depending on a handful.<br><br>What will be the future of SG?<br><br>Considering the fact the numbers of Bowling centre  we have, should we produce more elites.

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, the main impedence to Singapore becoming a bigger player in the region as a 'bowling power' is the administration.<br><br>Although the Singapore Tenpin Bowling Association (is it still called that now?) was making improvements, they have hit a wall of late. I thought that the appoiontment of Jessie Phua was a good move, and she started off making all the right moves. Too bad everything tailed off and she moved on after a few years in office. During her time, the SEA games results were not the best, but I thought the direction the association were headed in was right. In short, I think Singapore bowling needs another passionate - and most importantly - strong head.<br><br>I say this because our youth development scheme has become a joke. We were once the best in the region. During my time, countless bowlers came through the ranks and many more with potential were waiting in the wings (i will not mention names, out of courtesy).<br><br>The problem is two-fold:<br><br>1)  Like it or not, Singapore bowling is still very dependent on courting popularity instead of ability. I mean this in the context of talent scouting. We all know of the annual trials for the National Youth team. Unfortunately, for those that don't already know, I'll say this - the trials are a farce. Many good bowlers who deserve to be in don't get  picked; whilst those with 'connections' are automatic selections.<br><br>For instance: Some schools have coaches who also happen to be National Youth/National coaches. And its no coincidence that these schools make up a large proportion of the Trials' intake every year.<br><br>2)  I said this before: the administration is bad. The state of leadership of Singapore bowling is the main fault. If the leadership were stronger, the problem highlighted in part (1) would cease to exist. And we'll have proper coaches, be they foreign or local. We'll have good bowlers who are willing to represent the country.<br><br>Example: I know plenty of excellent bowlers who were, and still are, qualified to represent the country. And I'm speaking of bowlers who can/will/probably match or beat our last few crops of national bowlers on a more than regular basis. They turn down call-ups to the team simply because they are disillusioned by the management/leadership of the association.<br><br>I know my post has been long and wordy, but they echo what I feel deeply. I still love the sport with a great passion. And I hope this post does not dissuade anyone from trying to make the National team - one never knows when things might change.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I agree that they are much more bowlers out there good enough for the national team.. just that they dont have the chance..<br><br>even say normal players like me, its so hard to find a club or team to join where people train together and work towards a direction. All along, i train alone, trying hard to find people to play together but still up to no valid..<br><br>I want to join a club or whatever.. but just cant find any.. i love bowling, but it just seems so hard to find a route for me to take. I cant find a good bowling vcd, cant watch any international bowling competitons.. I even had a hard time finding help in singapore cos there's no forums.. in the end, i had to msg stangers in friendster for help.. lucky.. at least they seems to be friendly..<br><br>Another thing.. there are talents and people who are very into bowling during school days.. after they graduate, there's no more route for them.. they love bowling but without the school and teammates, they are lost.. they are alone.. and just like me.. standing there in the middle.. not knowing how to continue the route.. and then slowly.. they give up bowling..<br><br>but they are more fortunate.. i love bowling since pri school.. i never had the chance to be in bowling team as there's no such cca in schools before.. and its only now that i can afford my own balls.. thats why I want to continue my interest.. but it seems like I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere..<br><br>talents are lost in the process.. and thus cant provide enough competitions for places in Singapore team..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Chris10<br><br>I share your sentiment, infact many are like you, its not easy to join a team of regulars to bowl and learn together.<br><br>I've been doing that for a few seasons, forming teams in league, members comes, members goes, due to many reasons, works, family, different frequencies, expectation level among members, what have you.<br><br>So many league teams are usually good freinds, not just bowling kakis, or bowling kakis becomes good freinds.<br><br>Team size usually 6-12, fluctuate over times.<br><br>If you like to join a team for league, I think Team F.O.S. and my team may still may have vacancy if you are available on Tuesday evening, ofcoz F.O.S. is a stronger team than mine,  check it out at http://www.csc.gov.sg/planetbowl/<br>you will find out more from there.<br><br>Nice talking to you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey chris, i really shared your sentiment.<br>The first time i picked up a bowling ball was when i was 14. The first game that i bowled, i got 51 pts, and a single miserable spare only. But the magic was there and bowling captivated me since then.<br>Bowling as a ECA/CCA was not offered at all in my schools, and it was after NS, that i got in SIM, that i enjoyed the trainings and kakis, competition, leagues etc.  Bowling is never the same w/o kakis and friends who share the same passion, who share and grow in mental strength in the game. Feel free to look for us and Spook, and we can share our games in CSC, subject to our differeing schedule.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to bring 2 ball bags around on public transport. I think most of us did when we first began. At one point of time, I brought 3-4 balls around and alternated between public transport and going with friends who drive. Now I drive and I have gone back to bringing two balls. I actually need only one, but i don't have a single ball bag, so two balls help to balance the bag.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>You can also get a locker at a regular place you play at. I used to have locker at Victor's in Marina South. regular locker costs $75 annually back then. Enough space for 3 balls + shoes and accessories. Good deal.<br><br>Lockers are the best solution by far.<br><br>Hey spook,<br><br>20 kgs (44 lbs)  of gear?? Are you carrying 3 fourteen pound balls or something?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

But slowly they are improving, just not as fast as other countries. But to be true, bowling is pretty political even in the region, look at the recent sea games, it is almost pre determined who would lose. Not in terms of bribery or fake performance, but in terms of lane conditions. To many who do not know, in competitions, the lane technician that oils the lane cannot ensure you win, but he can ensure that you lose!!! the recent report shows that in the masters of the sea games, the oil on the left side of the lane is twice that of the right side. amazing isn't it? and remy ong with  high ball speed naturally did not perform and lost. But i do believe bowling will slowly grow. that is why i doing my personal best to educate novice bowlers so that they wont be fooled by not so pro coaches and pro shops, and hopefully standards will rise slowly.<br><br></div>
