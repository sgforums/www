              <p> </p>
              <p>I think your backswing is too high. For spinner, don't really have to be this high? What really matter is control and consistency first. Once you can control the ball really well and be consistent, than you can try for speed and the rest. haha!</p>

              <p>Oh... Well one thing about bowling is making the right decisions of how many boards to move, how much more revs to add or take away, how much more speed you need and stuff like that.</p>
              <p>And ya I know.. Bout my swing being high... But don't shock yourself.. That is my lowerest already, the only other way to lower it is by muscling it but that would make it even worse.</p>

              <p>For national team spinners, they pratice spinning the ball for 2 months before stepping on the lanes. What they do is they just first pratice the spinning part and release at home. After a few weeks, there should be a good release than now you need to work on footwork. Go see some videos on how the timing of the spinners is. Pratice on your last sliding part and release and follow through. After that pratice the whole thing. But girst make sure your spin is like a helicopter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>12 lbs? No wonder back swing so high lol! bt than, spinners also cnt use heavy ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try out that method. With patient and peserverance, you should be able to do good.</p>

              <p>Ok first, you might have misunderstood a couple of things:</p>
              <p>1) There are spinners who use 13 - 16 in other countries (I used to be one of them)</p>
              <p>- and not only they won't get injured but they are actually not going to get injured because there was once a comment I read somewhere from someone that some Taiwan Spinners use 13 as well and they still don't swing higher than me.</p>
              <p>Than my timing.. LOL.. Not boasting or anything.. But I literally have the same timing as Jennifer Tan or Tseng Su-Fen ah. Just a little later than them by a fraction.</p>
              <p>After that I WILL try that method you said. I just hope it works since I don't have anyone to tell me if I'm right or wrong and the only person who can, well.. I don't see him offen.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the tip though. Hope it works :)</p>

              <p>LOL.. the timing part is not really .. um.. i dunno what to say haha..</p>
              <p>okay.. yes tehre are 13-16 pound users.. but hey, as a spinner, you have to literally spin it every single time. If you did not have a strike, it would be 2 throw per frame. 24 throw for 12 frame or 25 if you spare the last one. Think about it, what are the possibility of injuring your wrist? I have known people who injure themself and all it takes is that one injury to ruin their career. Not injuring does not mean you won't. We can only minimize the risk.</p>
              <p>Jennifer and Tseng's timing is more smooth, and have a good balance at the end. Later by a fraction is whats causing problem. Develop a good balance, solid release and your game will definetely go up.</p>
              <p>I saw you almost falling over that day. So, maybe work on your balance too? One step at a time though.. Dun rush everything. I dunno, maybe your were trying something? Hahas</p>
              <p>Bowling is a fun game. Enjoy it, pratice hard and the reward will be great!</p>
              <p>Hope it helps! Looking forward to seeing you in the nxt competition!</p>
              <p>Good luck with your game!</p>

              <p>Yup I will... But you are not getting the fact of knowing the proper technique you wont get injured do you????</p>
              <p>- When I said wont I meant it, I know someone who has been bowling for the last 2 - 3 years with a 13lb ball and he is still fine. (no offense just telling you but since you're a stroker, than yes I understand theres still a chance for me to get injured but I'll tell you one more thing.. If I were to get injured it wouldn't be just my wrist. :)</p>
              <p>And I'm still working the the balance part, hope that get that right by the next tournament. And my balance was partly due to my shoes that day, kept sliding short. Anything you would reccommend to get the sliding consistent?</p>
              <p>And yeah I was trying out a faster approach, thats why my steps and balance was slightly more off that usual.</p>

              <p>Anything is prone to injury ma. Just like even i know the proper technique of bowling i still have sore thumb, you know? all those things. hahas.. more than 100 muscles need to work together for your release so yeah.. hahas</p>
              <p>what kind of shoes do you have? do you have those that have the detachable slide? mine has and it got three. One that can slide alot, a medium and one that can hardly slide.</p>
              <p>If not go get a power slide. It will come in handy. Maybe try and work on your balance and release first. Once that is good, than add in the speed and power</p>

              <p>Sore thumb? Do you mean at the joint to the palm there? That could be the case of your drilling because if i'm right than I also had the same problem as you and my was due to the drilling of the houseballs.</p>
              <p>After I got my Celebrity 300 and had a proper drilling my problem is gone already. And I'm only guesing since the only other people I know with a sore thumb is because of their bone or they cannot bowl as offen and seeing that you have school training I rule the problem to drilling.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can go ask some pro shop uncle and see lor if your ball drilled at CSC than you go ask Uncle Simon.</p>
              <p>My shoes are basic bowling shoe, I'm planning to change before ITE to better ones(hopefully the changable ones also). How much is the power slide thing ah?? Is it that cloth cover? or you mean the approach?</p>
              <p>- if you meant the approach step than I can't use it, because it slows me down too much and I will have a hookers timing instead of a spinner.</p>

              <p>Ok let me get it straight ah.</p>
              <p>1) The power slide is the cloth thing around $25 - Might not buy, see how maybe I use powder instead.</p>
              <p>2) You will check your drilling on the ball</p>
              <p>3) Training.</p>
              <p>Ok. Now I got that cleared out, where do you train usually? And if you want to check your drilling best is not go back to your freqeunt shop bcause if they are the one that drill your ball than good chance they will think there was no mistake.</p>
              <p>- no offense or anything</p>
              <p>But best is to go to another shop that you trust and than see what that uncle/aunty say before going back to your usual. Than you and your usual driller can work something out.</p>
              <p>Because I've seen people encounter problems like drilling a fitting ball another place but went to another shop and drill a ball but it didn't fit. Than they bring back to their usual and found that the different guy drilled the ball wrongly.</p>
