              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently I've been taking part in the Secondary School League</p>
              <p>I relieased that on most lanes, I cannot consistently send the ball to where I want.</p>
              <p>When I get the 'feel' I would at most retain it for a game or so only.</p>
              <p>Any tips or help?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My normal average is 170, 180 but during the competition is can drop to 132 a game</p>

              <p>I also bowling in that tournament and tomorrow is the last day right? For me I also can't send the ball where I want but unlike you I simply suck so not much help to provide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But maybe it's how you match your ball to the lane? Cause I noticed that the lanes are quite dry since my captain plays normally on all lanes and he is using a ball that is for dry-lanes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(The ball was recommended by his coach) But anyway if you have already tried  this than I'm not sure how I can help you than.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope this helps :)</p>

              <p>hm.. maybe?</p>
              <p>i noticed the lanes are quite dry too.</p>
              <p>maybe you need more pratice on your precision? And on dry lanes speed is also one key factor so i think thats what i am lacking now</p>
              <p>anyway the competition is overr for now</p>

              <p>Yeah.. Now waiting for next year's NAG during the March Holidays Haha.</p>
              <p>But for Spinner is there anything like drills or training that can help to improve on that?? My speed is easy enough since I can average a 25 to 26 if I wanted but thing is the ball does not always go where I want.</p>
              <p>Not sure if I am doing something wrong or anything but if you could maybe try and point what I might be able to change to improve on accuracy I won't mind putting up a link for youtube with me bowling. :)</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Hmm. I am currently waiting for my novice challenge and Penang International Open.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For spinners I think you really need to make sure your ball is goign straight and what is your spin rev rate? Pherhaps praticsing at home spinning the ball might help alot?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Its simply stress that is playing its part... when you are stress your confidence dropped and then your judgement and everything will be affected.</p>
              <p>Dont feel so stress during the tournament. When you are just normal practicing, you are not stress thus can get 170-180. When you stress everything becomes sucky..</p>

              <p>Stay relaxed. Everytime I go bowl at tournaments I know I won't go to the Masters so for me and my team is like just having fun and some times we bowl normally sometimes dont.. LOL!.</p>
              <p>But thanks for the advice and good luck for your Novice Challenge, I won't be attending but a chance I wil be there to see my captain to bowl. So hope I will see the right person haha :)</p>

              <p>you shouldn't be thinking liddat!</p>
              <p>you know, sometimes is the desire to win that drives you onwards, so it can reallt help you but of course, you musn't lsoe focus.</p>
              <p>By thinking you won't be in masters, you wont have that drive to excel. I rememebered I really wanted to be in the masters during my last novice and i easily gto a 198 average. But of course my nxt 4 game at doubles was trash &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>haha.. everyone can do it! jiayou! btw what sch are u from? and sec what wor? Maybe can see you nxt time! haha!</p>

              <p>and did you ever considered trying to learn stroking instead? I know its your technique and im fine with it but what i feel is that to be a good spinner, you gotta be really really accurate and need tons and tons of training. I seen alot of spinners and there are rarely a good spinner.</p>

              <p>very simple.. focus ur aiming on your intended arrows or pins (whichever you use for aiming) and follow through your release towards the direction of the focused target.. your ball should go to where you want it too.</p>
              <p>as for competition, just treat it as though you're playing a leisure game with your friends.. it might help get the pressure off you.</p>

              <p>i think you've never considered the possibility of injury? haha.</p>
              <p>i tore the tendon in my thumb during a game a few years back, and doctor said the tendon will not recover to 100% and recommended not to strain the thumb anymore.</p>
              <p>you think after so many years of bowling, i'd want to quit just like that? heh.</p>

              <p>NOpe definitely not.. Sorry bout the thumb I have a friend's future brother in law who used to be a bowler and have knee and arm injuries stop bowling since.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although he still miss getting his own strikes haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But since you only have a thumb injury why not use a lighter ball or try the impossible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bowling with your other hand? Thats a possibilty. :)</p>

              <p>Compassvale.. We're not really a offical CCA but hey.. I think its better this way.. Considering our school only has budget for 5 xD we get more training and more personal coaching lol xD</p>

              <p>haha.. The first day I think the Sport School Bowlers for my squad is doing average</p>

              <p>For my squad, they kept on stepping on the foul lines over and over again.. And I went over to see them bowl and their starting position of the ball is really wierd.. hahas</p>
