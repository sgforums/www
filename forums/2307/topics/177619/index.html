I am not saying all pro shops in singapore are bad and not professional, i know a few good ones. but the rest are simply atrocious. Some even appoint newbies that dunno much as assistant ball drillers. I am just trying to say, Pro shop is a profession, so we should always ask for better standards when they are not met.

Well, i am not a ball expert, and i nv say i am, the ones that should be expert should be those pro shop operators, however alot of these pro shops are not. but i have enough knowledge of balls for my own good. And the worst part is alot of them are very profit driven, if you dun know, one of the top 2 pro shop in singapore actually cut finger inserts into half, so that they can use it as 2 finger inserts.<br><br>wat you are saying here is very unfair to most bowlers. Because most prob they will start off like me....with little knowledge, hoping to improve their bowling by buying performance ball,  and right here wat you are saying is....even if you get cheated by these "professionals", you should only blame yourself for being stupid??

I've been to many pro shop &amp; I dun see any such problem.<br><br>I seen bowlers/customer walks into a pro shop refuse to listen to advise insisting their way, gave incorrect information abt their game. What happen next, they return &amp; insist a refund claiming the ball was drilled wrongly....Next a check on the bowler's skill level......the poor guy can't even release the ball correctly. But who's fault??? Driller right??? Again, if a bowler cannot score well, he blame who??? driller, ball, lane, oiling pattern &amp; everbody but themselves.......<br><br>Let me ask, since U want high standard ball driller/Coaches, R u willing to pay higher standard profession fee??? We, Singaporean only know evrything is expensive......now tell me where I can find a pro shop here is cheap &amp; of high standard?</div>

So when u make a mistake bcos of this, u get angry with a lot of the pro shops??? </span><br><br>And the worst part is alot of them are very profit driven, <span style="color: red;">Regardless of trades or business, they r juz making a living to meets end needs.

So, I guess they r probably not......</span><br><br>wat you are saying here is very unfair to most bowlers. Because most prob they will start off like me....with little knowledge, hoping to improve their bowling by buying performance ball,  and right here wat you are saying is....even if you get cheated by these "professionals", you should only blame yourself for being stupid?? <span style="color: red;">Like everybody, I make my first purchases with the entry level ball, pin-in &amp; looks like stock clearing ball &amp; wat have u......it is only this ball tat give me the first opportunity to improve my game. When I dun get my ball to hook, I juz work harder to make it hook tats all. I dun scream at others when it dun work for me. Its the bowler not the ball. </span><br>Please, you grow up!!!</div></blockquote> <span style="color: red;">Me??? I've grown to be a certified 200+ average bowler over hundred of games with SBF for the last 5 years...good luck!!!</span></div>

I've been to many pro shop &amp; I dun see any such problem.<br><br>I seen bowlers/customer walks into a pro shop refuse to listen to advise insisting their way, gave incorrect information abt their game. What happen next, they return &amp; insist a refund claiming the ball was drilled wrongly....Next a check on the bowler's skill level......the poor guy can't even release the ball correctly. But who's fault??? Driller right??? Again, if a bowler cannot score well, he blame who??? driller, ball, lane, oiling pattern &amp; everbody but themselves.......<br><br>Let me ask, since U want high standard ball driller/Coaches, R u willing to pay higher standard profession fee??? We, Singaporean only know evrything is expensive......now tell me where I can find a pro shop here is cheap &amp; of high standard? </div></blockquote>no, i am not a unreasonable person, in the scenario that you mentioned, it is not the ball driller's fault, i am not sayng there are no bad customers. And as in any other business, bad customers are inevitable. But i really dunno wat is your pt, i am right here talking about  alot of pro shops not up to standard in terms of knowledge, not wat kinda nasty customers pro shop operators face. That is part of business!!!! unless you telling me that because the pro shops got bad customers so the ball driller dont need to be updated in skills??<br><br>I dun give a damn wat kinda bad customers pro shop face...you open restaurant you will get nasty customers, you sell handphone you will get bad customers, in fact in any business you have bad customers, so wat is the point you are trying to prove???<br><br>Who i am trying to help here are good customers that is looking to improve their bowling, yet getting some bullshit from these unskilled drillers. Nobody cares wat happen when pro shops meet nasty customers, wat i care is when i require the professional skills such as advance ball drilling, is the driller capable of giving me that? and yes, i do know a pro shop that is really knowledgeable yet affordable. but i am not going to tell you where. I cant speak for everyone, but for me, yes, i am definitely willing to pay for a higher price to get more professional service. My reasoning is this, is it cheaper to pay slightly more for a ball that works, or to buy a few ball that dun work?? you should know better</div>

A pin in ball is usually used for spinners, or for very specialised drilling for hook bowling, it is definitely not recommended for a beginner learn how to hook, cos it never will!!! It is extremely difficult to map a "pin-in" ball to hook for a beginner, espcially when his rpm is low. so please, as a good bowler yourself, you should know a ball driller should nv sell a "pin-in" ball to a beginner that is learning to hook. and my intention at that time was not to get a ball that hooks only on dry lane, so wat makes you think it is justified for him to sell me that ball when he clearly know i am a beginner learning how to hook???<br><br><strong>so i should blame myself for this?? Yes, I think u r partly to be blame for being too impulsive. I believed in making some research b4 any purchase.
