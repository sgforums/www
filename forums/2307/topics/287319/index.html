Assuming u walk straight squarely, ur release could be at the 15th bd. And if you're aiming at second arrow (10th bd), a more accurate way to describle ur line could be "release 15, aim at 2nd arrow".<br><br>For hooking action wise, could be a snap or arc. Can't tell from what u said.</span><br><br>2) as my bowling style is stated above, when the lane is dry, i will hit cross pocket of 1-2 pin or even miss the head pin completely.. :&lt;<br>when this happens, i move starting point 1 board right, moving my line 1~2 board to the right.. yes i know this is the wrong way right? cos im not supposed to move my line, instead im supposed to move 1 board left, keep my line at 5~10 board correct?<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> There are several methods to this. I assumed when u say "moving my line 1~2 board to the right..", you're moving the whole line, as in your starting position, ur release pt and aim pt.<br><br>There's the 2-4-6, the 3-6-9, etc methods that bowling academics will tell u. But aiya, the key is to hit the pocket u want consistently and with the largest margin of error.<br><br>Personally, I find it easier to move left, while maintaining my aim point.</span><br><br>But i personally find it much easier to  throw straight down the lane instead of moving left, pushing the ball outwards to form an arc action? any pointers on this?<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Can consider changing your aim pt to 3rd arrow, that way can reduce the fear of ball going in lokang... haha But if u can play a "larger hook" well, u've got a larger margin of error, which is good. =) </span><br><br>3) with the question 2, it brings me to my 3rd question.<br>shld i change my bowling style to the arc instead? cos it seems like bowling lanes in SG are cutting cost in oiling.. my ball tend to overhook 8 out of 10 times, which results in me moving right and right and until it is living on the edge along the gutter...<br>i have seen some online videos of US bowlers, and seems like they always do the arc...<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Can't really comment. Have to really see how u play. I had the same problem last time of moving right and right when my ball overhooks. To me most of the time it doesn't solve the issue. Cos usually, the oiling on the extreme right/left are even lesser too! Learn to play deeper into the lane. You'll be more versatile too. </span><br><br>....<br><br>Bernard</div></blockquote>my comments in <span style="color: blue;">blue</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks airgrinder for the clarification..<br><br>regarding the release at 15 board, aim at 10 board..<br>think im more of a release at 10, am at 10.. ie. i threw straight down the lane..<br><br>so it really doesnt matter much where u place ur foot, it's rather where u throw and aim where people talked about boards etc?<br><br>yup, 1 have heard of the 3-6-9 and used it to do my spares..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>now comtemplating whether to move inside the lane or stick to my release at 10, aim at 10 way of bowling..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

Usually, it's 5 bds, meaning if u'r going to release the ball at 10, your starting position should be at abt 15. But this differs betw people.<br><br>bigger size guy may need to stand at 17, etc.<br><br>And, the above is assuming your shoulders are square to the lane.<br><br>I stand at 30, my shoulders ideally are squared not to the lane, but to my aim point. So my release point could be at 20, aiming at 15, my left foot will be at 25</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi folks,<br><br>Long time no regular bowling liao since our league ended, at least few months lor....sigh.<br><br>Juz to share my experience to the noobies.......no completely right, but not completely wrong too....juz preferrence  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I use my tip of my shoe to take my position, these cut all the confusions i read from the book.<br><br>Use the 2 roles of dots as starting position, some have 5, some have seven, so, its always safe to start using the center dot(20 board). slowly adjust it to align with the target(Arrow/Board) I wanna hit.<br><br>As for board adjustment, remember, "Unless "All" Else Remains" minor adjustment can be quite confusing.<br><br>You can develop your own "Where to Stand(20 board), Where to Aim/Hit(10 board/2nd arrow)" lists,  it takes some time to understand our own method.<br><br>Important things is Control , I must be able to go where i wanna the ball to go, which is not that easy for newbies. The only answers is Practise, Take Notes and make adjustments, till getting it rights.<br><br>But if really wants to learn to bowl better fast, best is to take up bowling lessons from proper coaches, they will guide you through and correct the wrong habbits.<br><br>Trial and errors take a long time......years <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
