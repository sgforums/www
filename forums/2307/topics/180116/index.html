            <div class='col-md body'>Buying proper bowling shoes is probably an important aspect of bowling, for most it is a pretty worthwhile investment, as it can spare you from the uncomfort of renting house shoes(god knows who worn that shoe before you!!!) So for those who is looking to buy bowling shoe, here are some intros to wat choices you have. Bowling shoes can cost from $40 to as much as $300+, depending on the performance(yes, shoes are not just shoes, they have diff performance level just like balls!!)<br><br>firstly, to address the most basic questions first, when you buy bowling shoes, they should feel comfortable, not too loose, not too tight, and most importantly, buy the correct type, ie left hander or right hander, for most bowling shoes, one side's sole will be smooth, which is meant for your sliding foot, and the other side's sole is rough which is meant for you to push off for your final step. Usually for left hander, it will be right sliding foot for last step, and vice versa for right hander will be left foot slide. but of cos i did see people with right hand right foot, or left hand left foot, which is basically wrong, while i suggest you correct it, but for some, so long as it works for you, then dun change it la.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most basic shoes cost around $40+, usually white in colour, this is also the shoe that you will get when you buy as a package from pro shops. nothing fanciful, usually quite plain with a average quality slide and push off sole. Usually not very durable, mine spoil after 5mths, meant for beginner bowlers that dun bowl too often or on really low budget.<br><br>The next in line is the dexter sports series, cost from $60 to $90, much better looking, usually quite sporty, one thing to note is that they hav the same "slide-rite" soles on both sides of the shoe, this is basically to lower their production cost la, but for those that is learning to push off, this shoe may post as a hazard as both sides are meant to slide, so your push off foot may slip as it has not much grip. But otherwise it is pretty stylish and reasonably priced. quite durable too.[/img][/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nowadays got this ABS pro-am shoe, cost around $100, pretty good quality, non-changeable soles, but the soles are of pretty good quality, look wise pretty nice too.<br><br>mid-end performance- "Leyon excellent", $120, my third pair of bowling shoes. the reason why i rate it as perforamnce is becos it has 4 interchangeable sliding soles, which you can change according to how slippery or rough the approach is at the bowling centre. The shoe is full leather(but the leather quite hard, takes time to season), so very durable, the cheapest performance shoe in singapore. made in korea.<br><br>ABS Tour high performance shoe- cost $200+ changeable soles and heels with attachable cleats, so can adjust very accurately to the amount of slide you want. made of kangeroo leather, comes with shoe bags and covers also. very complete package of performance, remy ong use this shoe. but high cost, for bowlers that requires high performance in slide and push off.<br><br>Dexter SST5,6,7. cost $200+, used by most national bowlers, national youth, and world bowlers. Very comfortable, comes with interchangeable soles and heels. SST5 comes with 2 slides and 2 soles, while SST6 and 7 comes with 4 soles and 4 heels. comes with shoe bags and cover too. very durable. performance shoe for all pros or pros-to-be</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A pair of good shoes does help to improve one's bowling, especially with those changeble soles at different centres, if really into bowling, must not overlook this and put all the investment on the balls, do budget for it.<br><br>If can afford Nike, Addidas, a good pair of bowling shoes is considerable affordable, not to say if compare with Golfing shoes.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
