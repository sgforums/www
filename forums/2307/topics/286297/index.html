            <div class='col-md body'>an arched hook comes from a dull or ball with huge friction with the lane. particle balls have mostly arcing action.<br><br>conversely, shined balls usually have a snap action.<br><br>i wont say i prefer which over which, depends alot on the lane conditions. for oily lanes, i would prefer a snap action but on unpredictable medium/dry oil lane conditions i prefer the more predictable arcing action.</div>
