It is a relatively new term that came into the bowling world for mayb 2 3 years back.<br><br>anyway the erratic behavior is usually due to different oil condition on the lanes. Balls behave differently on different oil condition, some balls are for light oil, some are for heavy oil. If you use a strong heavy oil ball on a light oil condition, and with some decent release, the ball will hook like nobody's business.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>... it has a slightly different technique that involves breaking the wrist when releasing the ball ...</blockquote>This is termed "<span style="font-style: italic;">Loading and Unloading</span>".<br><br>Loosely, loading means that prior to entering the leverage position at the bottom of the swing, the bowler cups their wrist to position their hand under the ball.<br><br>The unloading action is executed during and throughout the entire release. From a fully (or partially, depending on how much hook is required) cupped position, the wrist flattens to a straight position and proceeds smoothly to a broken position. This entire action is very quick in real-time.<br><br><blockquote>... which uses gravity to increase the RPM instead of the traditional lifting of fingers ...</blockquote>I'm not sure about gravity effects, but unloading at any time during a release is generally a method to increase the amount of leverage one can get onto the ball.<br>----------------------<br><br>This method defies the widely-held notion that "broken wrists = weak release; cupped wrist = big hook" that many regular bowlers have. While that may be true, the action of unloading mid-release imparts <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> action to the ball; similar to the way an animal trainer cracks a whip (after whippping, the arm always returns like a recoiling motion).<br><br>If you can't picture this, don't worry - its normal. The loading and unloading method is very difficult to understand and harder to learn, let alone master. That is why its generally acknowledged as an advanced technique.<br><br>For those who wish, try to get your hands on some video clips of the PBA bowler Chris Barnes. He's widely known as the most famous / accomplished practitioner of this technique in the professional leagues. He uses this method on ALL his first shots, and breaks his wrist all the way for spare or fuller shots.<br><br>In Singapore, Shaun Ng is the best in the business, in my opinion. If he's still bowling, you can watch him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

When i started learning, even after demo by my coach, i stil did not quite get it. it is like totally different from conventional hook bowling. Anyway, this so called unloading is wat some people would name as "hitting" the ball.<br><br>In conventional hook bowling, we rely on cupped wrist, then as we release, our fingers will lift the ball, creating revolutions. In power bowling, after about 9 months of learning looking and asking, this is wat i have comprehend. From a cupped position, when approaching the lowest point, you will "hit" the ball, or break your wrist, this will impart a sudden impulse to the ball, causing it to fall from the hand real fast due to gravity. at the same time your hand will follow through, causing the ball to come off the fingers, and this action will impart tremendous amount of revolutions on the ball. this is slightly different from lifting the fingering, instead, here is letting the ball slip off from the fingers. Anyway to do this you need to have forward pitch for your thumb, which will cause the thumb to exit before the fingers do. I say again, this is not easy to visualise. And only a few coach in Singapore know how to teach this technique.</div>

Anyway the "pin in" ball i got is "The Rock Pearl" from columbia, suppose to be a high performance ball. Anyway the pin is positioned 1 inch directly below my ring finger, which is very very close to my PAP. I do know that the biggest influence on drilling is dist of pin fr PAP, in this case this pin is very close to my PAP, so mayb that explains why it hooks less. Dunno if it is really wrong drilling anot thou..<br><br></div>
