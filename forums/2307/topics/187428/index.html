            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, ever wonder why cranking seems to be very popular now?? After some research and consultation, i realise that cranking is good because of the high revolution, not exactly because to make very big hooks. Basically wat we desire is for the ball to hit the pins at very high revolution, it will have much more energy, and also when contact with the pins, the rev will cause the pins to spin instead of just being hit backwards, thus increasing strike probability.<br><br>I know there are people who use high revs just simply beacuse they desire a big hook, while it is always very spectacular(i like it too)...but i do see quite a few with real big hooks but their ball is totally out of control....so i think we need to know the true reason for using such high rev. In fact, alot of crankers at national level had to drill their ball in such a way that the ball hook less!!! amazing??? not really, reason?? their high rev will make normal leverage drilling balls over hook and hard to control, so they desire a reasonable controlled hook yet with plenty of revs for great hitting power, yet with no worries that their ball will hook so much that one lane is not enough...haha...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to share my views about "cranking".<br><br>"To crank" is simply one way - amongst many - to describe the action certain bowlers impart action to the ball. Though more often than not, this form of delivery leads to a shot that seems like it revs a lot, the relationship between cranking and ball revolution should be one of correlation, not causality.<br><br>Since the main topic of this thread is about the number of boards we like our balls to cross, I shall not stray too far.<br><br>But ball revs is more a result of proper, smooth releases (that hence maximise leverage positions) than a sudden, whipping action. Many local bowlers from Andrew Fang to Shaun Lim all impart terrific ball action without having to break a sweat. In fact, the two i've mentioned are so smooth, you can scarcely even hear the moment their ball touches the lane.<br><br>Cranking may simply be more "popular" these days because its a more visually arresting style. Some bowlers may crank just to gain attention, whilst some spectators simply notice the crankers more, giving rise to an impression there are more of them.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's correct to note that ball type and ball surface help in part to determining the rate of ball revolutions of a shot. But first, a quick definition:<br><br><strong>Roll</strong> is the motion of a ball when the axis of rotation is mostly horizontal. (i.e., the ball is revolving like a wheel / end-over-end)<br><br>All balls tend to achieve this state near the pin deck, before contact with the pins.<br><br><strong>Spin</strong> is the motion of the ball when the axis of rotation is mostly vertical.<br>(i.e., ball is revolving like a DVD in the player / sideways)<br><br>Spinners aside, this type of revolution is frequently seen from when the ball is released, until around mid-lane when the ball loses its sidewards momentum and assumes more of a roll toward the pin deck.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ball revs, on the other hand, is a different thing altogether. Its just a measure of how many full revolutions is achieved within 60 feet.<br><br>Ball surface / type (side weight, top weight, core, RG, et cetera) all influence when a ball enters, exits, or re-enters either a state of spin, roll, or a combination of the two.<br><br>Even different balls thrown by the same bowler can have different rev rates depending on what that bowler is trying to achieve with the shot. Therefore most experienced bowlers do not really take rev rate to heart. Its just a measure that some people like for its "bragging rights".<br><br>Like Enginboi has pointed out, a lot of bowlers actually give up some revs for control. Because revs does not win you any games. Consistency does.<br><br>Oh, he's right - its not easy to crank. Don't do it just for the "show".<br>So kids, don't try it at your neighbourhood bowling alley without proper training.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha...lets not diminish the effects of high revs which many crankers are very proud of. actually high overall ball rpm has tremendous effects on the pin actions when the high spin actually sends the pins spinning instead of just being hit backwards. it creates much more pin action and usually increases strike probability if it can be used with some consistency.<br><br>however, high revs usually results in increased reactions of balls, and the result is usually a big hook that is often hard to control. Like wat Haz said, consistency wins the game. So For high rev crankers, they will have to make adjustments to their ball drilling, such as mayb placing mass bias point on the left quadrant or such....to reduce the amt of hook, yet able to keep the high rpm for increased pin actions. it is a fine balance i guess.....not an easy thing to do, unless you hav a really good ball driller and you yourself must be real skillful and consistent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>... it means too much energy has been lost, so probably the ball is too strong for the lane condition ...</blockquote>This is correct. Though it is not necessarily true for all of the time.<br><br>And there may be some correalation between pin action and ball revolution-rate. But for the most part, pin action at the pin deck is determined by the angle of ball entry for a hook bowler --&gt; that's the entire reason for inventing the hook ball.<br><br>The optimum entry position is at the 17Â½ board (for right-handers; reverse for lefties). I have long forgotten the optimum angle of entry, perhaps someone who does remember may chip in. I think its something in the region of 66 degrees at that board position.  This angle was impossible for a straight ball to attain (not the board, the angle) without bowling FROM the adjacent lane, which is clearly illegal and not possible. Hence, the hook ball was invented.<br><br>Pin action is dependant on a LOT of other elements such as velocity, ball mass, blah blah blah. But the main two are entry angle and position.<br><br>The "perfect", textbook strike doesn't rely on pins riccocheting off the walls anyway. Strikes with messengers taking out the standing pin(s) are theoretically wrong, and just plain lucky.

But for the most part, pin action at the pin deck is determined by the angle of ball entry for a hook bowler --&gt; that's the entire reason for inventing the hook ball.<br><br>The optimum entry position is at the 17Â½ board (for right-handers; reverse for lefties). I have long forgotten the optimum angle of entry, perhaps someone who does remember may chip in. I think its something in the region of 66 degrees at that board position.  This angle was impossible for a straight ball to attain (not the board, the angle) without bowling FROM the adjacent lane, which is clearly illegal and not possible. Hence, the hook ball was invented.<br><br>Pin action is dependant on a LOT of other elements such as velocity, ball mass, blah blah blah.

Haha   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>ya, there is a optimum strike spot, and a optimum strike angle, but as wat i hav said, this is the old school precision bowling. ie, need to be very accurate, and very consistant for release.  In fact i really find it very difficult to repeat even 5 exact shots for myself. That is why perfect game is a rarity in the past. however recently there seem to be much more perfect games going on...the reason?? because bowlers become more accurate?? i dun think so.  but rather i think, because of this power bowling theory that boost more pin actions. resulting in easier strikes....just my point of view la... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
