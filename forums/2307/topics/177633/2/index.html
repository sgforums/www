I've grown to be a certified 200+ average bowler over hundred of games with SBF for the last 5 years...good luck!!!<br><br>Hiya, enginboi oh enginboi.....I m really tired &amp; I m not going to keep this debate going on and on. There's no point to correct you further otherwise it would be endless. I sincerely wish you all the best in the game. Good luck.....</div></blockquote>i stil did not see how the info i posted in the ball buying guide can be wrong, and you have nv input anything constructive or educational at all. all you claim is that you are a 200plus average experienced bowler....mentioned abit technical terms such as rg, diff, top wt, but wat exactly hav you contributed or justified?? sad to say....nothing...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's all be sensible. This is afterall, a forum, and we all have the opportunity to centre our views.<br><br>I think that engineboi has put in a lot of effort and time, obviously, to list a lot of information that is informative to the majority of bowlers trying to gain access to such knowledge. Granted, it will not apply to all, but nothing does. Ultimately its only a loose guide and the bowler, as in all aspects of his game, has full discretion whether to apply them or not.<br><br>Props to engineboi for effort.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Armadillo<br><br>You raised valid points. As Jae had earlier pointed out - you may help refine the discussion by supplementing addition information. I'm sure you'll agree that its much easier to tear something down than to build it. So perhaps a few bits of knowledge from you will prove more contrsuctive than two pages of grinding out the niggly bits.<br><br>Afterall, let's allow the reader to make up their own minds about whether or not what's written on these boards is applicable to them.</div>

But that does not mean we must bad mouth others whether its right or wrong.<br><br>Not being defensive, I been to many others bowling forums and have nvr have such ecounter. Usually, treads were discussed in a very neutral format. I understand one's feeling should they feel cheated. But there r better ways to vent one's anger.<br><br>I was taken aback that this forum seem to sort of encourage &amp; accept such act/behaviour.<br><br>Frankly, I m not someone like to talk too much in a forums. I like reading treads hoping to pick up some useful information. Like you say, I mostly disregard those I think I need not use it to apply them.<br><br>My humble apology that I 've stirred quite a fuss here.........I just wanna let u guys know that others have feeling too. Remember, whats goes around comes around.<br><br>Btw, I dun think you guy need anything from me to contribute here in term of my knowledge &amp; experiences.
