The service, the ability of the pro shop to drill the ball for you all play a part. I think it is a matter of preference. Personally, if I trust a shop or service provider, even if I have to pay a higher price, I would still go to that shop or service provider. Money is important, but peace of mind is more important. At least that is my opinion. Don't flame me ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

My bowling friend in state told me that brunswick is actually the most enomical brand there. Hmm.....that's strange<br><br>Ya, that's why I am asking for your guidence to find out more about the price since you said that it shouldn't be selling at such "high" price. The shop that I went to is selling abt $330 which is fine with me. You may not be interested to make purchases there since price is your main concern.<br><br>I am just curious that how you justify &amp; reassurre that high-end ball shouldn't be retail at $350??? There are ball selling at $400+ locally......I think is Lane#1. Well, still a lots of bowlers buy. I have never heard any of them complaint about the price.<br><br>In summary, I think it is very individual to one's percieved as far as price is concerned when you make comparision. What is unreasonable to you may not be unreasonable to others. I believe is each to his own as far as he believe &amp; have trust in it.<br><br>So I guess we shouldn't be making negative remarks about what the pro shops here retailing their balls at what price. Remember, you have your choice to choose &amp; make purchases.</div>

My bowling friend in state told me that brunswick is actually the most enomical brand there. Hmm.....that's strange<br><br>Ya, that's why I am asking for your guidence to find out more about the price since you said that it shouldn't be selling at such "high" price. The shop that I went to is selling abt $330 which is fine with me. You may not be interested to make purchases there since price is your main concern.<br><br>I am just curious that how you justify &amp; reassurre that high-end ball shouldn't be retail at $350??? There are ball selling at $400+ locally......I think is Lane#1. Well, still a lots of bowlers buy. I have never heard any of them complaint about the price.<br><br>In summary, I think it is very individual to one's percieved as far as price is concerned when you make comparision. What is unreasonable to you may not be unreasonable to others. I believe is each to his own as far as he believe &amp; have trust in it.<br><br>So I guess we shouldn't be making negative remarks about what the pro shops here retailing their balls at what price. Remember, you have your choice to choose &amp; make purchases.</div></blockquote>u muz be kidding man.. haha.. u are so contradicting.. one post u say u know nuts abt bowling price.. another post u say u bowl for 15 years already and try alot of pro shop b4 buying ur equipment.. so a experience bowler u know nuts abt bowling price..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>and to answer ur question why brunswick is more expensive.. u said tat ur friend in states told u tat brunswick is enomical brand there.. he is rite ah.. in states brunswick is enomical.. but u are in singapore.. is a different story.. u bowling for 15 YEARS u dunno brunswick ball is slightly expensive than other brand in singapore? even target zone a polyester ball is more expensive than other brands polyester ball..<br><br>as u say lane1 ball.. there is not many ppl using the ball in singapore compare to any other brand.. there are alot of ppl complaining abt lane1 ball prices.. i guess u didnt hear any only..<br><br>and i would like to clarify something.. i did nt post any NEGATIVE comment abt any pro shop.. in tis thread we are only comparing price.. u hav ur rights to choose which shop u wan to buy from and we can also provides some info abt wat other shop can provide and the price they offer.. like tat u say is NEGATIVE comments? wat is a positive comment? can u specific?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

And how you guage that their price is 20-30% higher than others. Just curious, what ball did you buy from them?</div>
