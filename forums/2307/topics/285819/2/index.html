Can this be contradicting? Anyway, You claim that pro shop shouldn't retail at $350 for a high end ball. So on what ground it is that you make this statement since you don't operate one. Now whose contradicting?<br><br>Agreed, So Brunswick ball here price higher than most brand locally. That's call branding strategy in basic marketing term. So do you accept that you should pay a higher price for its product? The choice is entirely yours &amp; it don't bordered anyone.<br><br>Ya of course there are people who commented (Not complaint..lol) on Lane#1 retail price. But there are still peoples who can afford it. Complaint? To which department.....you mean CASE? for retailing at $400+...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You earlier commented that "now then sell at this price when others were selling it when its first launched here." Is this positive? Why you care when they want to sell at what price at what time. It seem that its bordering you very much. Is this the way to compare price? Example of comparing price can be done by saying using one particular product &amp; say 1 selling $? 2 selling $? and so on. Then it will be more informative to us.<br><br>The thread starter merely started this thread to share information with us on offer from this pro shop thats all. Do you need to pass such remarks if you are not interested. So, why do we need to behave so offensive. If you dislike someone then, have guts to face him and say right into his face rather then going around forum defaming others. Be careful, it may get you into trouble.</div>

We all have our good and bad experiences. Don't you agreed that these experiences will prepare you better in the future should you face the same situation again?

A man walk in &amp; make a general enquiry on ball price. When the operator offered him a range of 100+ to 300+. The man got angry and shouted at him "Why so expensive???" How do you expect the operator to reply in this situation? Or rather, if you are in his position, what will you do? Relax bro.....</strong>[/b]</blockquote></div>

There are SO MANY pro shops &amp; their prices are quite similar or same to one another.  Only minority are selling at a more lower prices.  Therefore what purpose does it benefit to specially name / contempt this proshops?  its seems like a personal attack more then a general remarks.  If you wanted to share cheap &amp; goods products.. it can be constructive.  Such as where &amp; so &amp; so are having good prices.  Right?<br><br>Suggest since you claim you know Andy.. why dont you be more upfront &amp; approach him to clarify matters.  Instead of continueing this stupid discussion.  It is good to share where you can get good for value products.  But its never good to start on something sensitive such as this fellow "lousy" or "expensive".  Comparing will always be a endless subjects.  I am sure you do not like it if your bosses start comparing you &amp; outright criticising you are not good in front of all your colleagues.  Or your girlfriend start to compare you with their ex's.<br>Whatever it is ,, if you have constructive message ..please post here.  If not please do not HOG the thread &amp; create "negative" messages for all readers.  Really appreciate this help.  Cos its really getting on every nerve when you cannot read any further good chat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
