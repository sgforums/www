In fact i think it is good to do a complete analysis of the bowling style everytime you buy a new ball, for example using some computer programs to monitor current ball speed, rev, axis rotation etc, so that proper recommendations can be made. Just wonder why no pro shop does that in singapore...it improves the image of the pro shop and definitely bring more cutomers right??</div>
