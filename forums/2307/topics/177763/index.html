So it is actually easier if u can learn the right things from the coach by taking formal coaching. But very ex la, bowling is an expensive sports by itself. No choice. But sometimes trial and error by yourself may just get you very frustrated sometimes too. So got pros and cons. for me, no matter how i trial error, i dun get wat i wan, so ultimately i stil get coaching, back to square one...haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>going through the pain of a different set of 're-muscle-memorying'</blockquote>Funny you should say this, Jae (Long time no see!). Muscle memory is the only thing that prevents me from forgetting how to bowl.<br><br>Its definitely worth it though, good coaching. I'm one of those trial-and-error bowlers who never got official/good coaching until my playstyle was more of less ingrained. I 'coached' myself from observing others and video tapes (no VCD or DVDs or downloaded videos then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ).<br><br>Like Jae, I have my share of bad habits that surface when I play nowadays. Every bowler has some. Its not the technically perfect bowlers that do well. Its the consistent ones that collect that honour.<br><br>But remember: being technically correct helps <strong>a lot</strong>.<br>I can't stress this enough. So yes - a <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> coaching clinic is always worth it if you're serious about your game.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

You dun believe, just ask around in the coaching world. statistics would tell, for example, those who attended STBC level 2 certification, almost all passed, but the same people that went on to obtain ABF level 2, less than half pass!!! it would not be nice for me to name who pass or fail....but sometimes i really wonder how well you know this bowling world... you seem to be so naive to think that most of the pro shops are good and knowledgeable, most of the coaches are good coaches...please dun always come and question me on how i know....how i know...it just reveals to me that you may be a great bowler with 200+ average that youn claimed to be, that simply live in some idealistic world of your own....results speaks the truth...if you dun believe me...go ahead and check the passing rates...be my guest, then come back and question me "how i know??"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Spook:</div><div class="quote_body">on certification, even our Taxi drivers these need some N or O's to take  test<br>for their license(correct me if i am wrong), how can a national coaches be less eduacated or not being properly certified?<br><br>Looking ahead, the ABF certification will be here in SG, not sure about neinouring region, it'll take some times to bear fruits........At least there's still hope for our younger ones. we the older oes just enjoy our games <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Just hope that there will be some really good coaches spawnig through the system.<br><br>Way to go........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>ya, ABF certification is definitely here to stay, in fact, overseas coaches such as japan head coach also came over to singapore to obtain his ABF certification, so you can see how important this certification is...if not the japan head coach would not even bother to come all the way to singapore just to obtain this certification...but i think there is some language barrier i think...so that head coach eventually failed...<br><br>right now in the national team, the ex national coach pat henry had left due to some scandals during the sea games, so now the national team is headed by local coaches. But the controversy is that these national and national youth coaches are ABF level 2,, while the recent results have some independant coaches obtaining ABF level 3, so in fact there are some comments going around, where the national coaches are less certified than some of the local independent coaches. So this ABF thingy is indeed really pushing the standards up, because it has become the benchmark in judging a coach's ability. So most coaches in singapore are trying to obtain this ABF certification....many have tried....quite a numer has failed...stress stress stress!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, i apologies to all other bowlers that reads about the confrontation between me and that armadillo...i really dun like to attack another fellow bowler that likes this sports, but all i said is the truth that came from reliable sourse, not just simply logging on the net, reading abit here and there and calling that justified research.<br><br>However i will not want to quote any names or sourses, becuase they have implications...not that i dun wan to justify myself or take some responsibilty. wat i provided is just knowledge that is good for most bowlers to know...my interest is with the bowlers, however you may choose to believe, you may not to believe wat i said.<br><br>So this armadillo guy is really starting to piss me off...because he seems to always question wat i said, and apparently he sides with the other side. He believes in the "TRY La" theory, where you go around trying out, wasting your money on the way...to finally get wat you want.... I hav been through that, but i dun believe in that, i believe in getting my money worth. with some basic guidance and knowledge, you stil wont become a great bowler overnight, but least you can be sure that you r on the right track...and not wasting your money. with the right certified coach, you wont have to spend hundreds and in the end realise that you learn nothing, or worse, learn the wrong things. with the right certified ball driller you will not need to buy ten balls only to find the best ball driller on your 11th ball.<br><br>Bowling, like alot of other sports, is a very political game... there are alot of allies here and there, enemies here and there, some pro shops may hook up with some coaches to push up ball sales... it goes on and on...while it is good to know there are such stuff around, does not mean we hav to get involved, we just want to enjoy the game, so these advise that i posted is in hope that with these facts in mind, you can be more careful, as bowling is a very expensive sports, some of us spends thousands on equipments and coaching, so i bet you want to make sure you are getting your money worth...<br><br>So really, whether to believe anot is really up to you...</div>
