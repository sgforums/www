            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean, Taiwanese rises to the occasion<br>27th May, Singapore: Top-seed Lee Yu-Wen of Singapore and third-seed Huang Chiung-Yao of Chinese Taipei rose to the occasion and crowned the 39th Singapore International Open Masters champions after defeating their opponents in the stepladder finals at Victor's Superbowl this evening.<br><br>National bowler, Lee Yu-Wen gave Singapore its second successive victory when he edged challenger, Surasak Manuwong of Thailand, 197-174 in the final match. Lee captured the title following Jack Wong's triumph last year.<br><br>With a series of strikes from the fifth to eight game, this 2005 Qatar Open champion had the upper edge in the title match while his challenger, Surasak floundered. Both the finalists had a nervous start with an open frame each and while the champion got going from fifth frame, the Thai had another split in the fifth frame which decided the match.<br><br>"The lanes were still fresh at the beginning, but I gradually got into the groove. I'm very pleased to win my first Singapore International Open especially to have done it against top competitors from Asia," said the delighted Lee.<br><br>Lee Yu-Wen of Singapore, crowned the Men's champion<br><br>The second-seed, Surasak settled for second despite ousting third-seed, Chester King of the Philippines and winner of the first match, Mika Koivaniemi of Finland, 253-176-183 in the second match to have a crack at the title.<br><br>In the women's division, top-seed and Manila SEA Games gold medalist, Liza Clutario of the Philippines, failed to stop her challenger, Huang Chiung Yao of Chinese Taipei, when forced into the sudden-death decider after loosing the first match, 176-182.<br><br>The Filipino had no answer to the relentless determination shown by the Taiwanese and found herself training after two splits in the fifth and sixth frames when she failed to convert. With two double strikes in the third-fourth and seventh-eighth frame, Huang crusied to a convincing win.<br><br>Huang Chiung-Yao claiming the womenÂ’s crown<br><br>"I was a little relaxed during the first game which almost gave Clutario an opportunity to catch up. So when it came to the second game, I had to work harder and kept telling myself that I could do it," said Huang.<br><br>The champion earned the crack at the title after she knocked out second-seed, Pan Yu-Fen and winner of the first match, Wang Yu-Ling in an all-Taiwanese second match, 217-206-198 before defeating Clutario in two matches.<br><br>Huang also gave Chinese Taipei its second successive victory following the footsteps of her compatriot, Hung Shu-Chun, who captured the same title last year. The MenÂ’s Open Masters champion won the top prize of $25,000 while the WomenÂ’s Open Masters champion took home $5,000.<br><br>Other Results<br>http://www.abf-online.org/results/39thspore-res.htm<br><br></div>
