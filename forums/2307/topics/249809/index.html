There was once one who even banged his ball at me. It was his turn to bowl at another lane (not even a shared land with mine at the time).  I just merely stretched and took my ball so that I can clean it as it was also my turn. He just banged his ball down loudly back and sulked away. It was so embarassing.</div>
