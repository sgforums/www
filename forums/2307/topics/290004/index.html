Cracks are generally due to defects in balls, mayb due to long storage, or sometimes even hot weather. Dun be surprise that the ball may already be damaged even before you first throw it. i.e. it has been stored improperly in warehouse.<br><br>Basically nothing will help. You can keep it as a training ball thou.</div>

Meaning your ball rolling over your thumb hole at some instance? Then maybe you might wanna change your technique.<br><br>Read from somewhere cracking is usually due to the amount of superglue used to stick the thumb plug/insert. Superglue changes the composition of the coverstock, making it more brittle.<br></div>

Replugs make the ball slightly distorted. It is one of the cheap ways for organisers to disqualify you, esp when u win and is getting some money. So for leisure or for normal competition no harm, but if you aiming to bowl in some big competitions with some high prizes, try not to use a replug ball.</div>

If yes, then how to determine if the ball was drilled before Jan 2008 if this is correct? Hopefully this is just a rumour  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div></blockquote>This is not a rumour, it is a rule that one of the international federation wants to implement. Once it is implement, all tournaments sanctioned by that particular congress will have to follow.<br><br>The reason is that they want to have minimum modification to the balls so that ball drillers cannot alter the reaction too much.<br><br>So it is not just for other countries, so long as that particular tournament is sanctioned, the ule will apply, for example singapore open.<br><br>But I not too sure if it has been fully implemented thou. Previously the ball manufacturers are protesting.</div>
