In my opinion, being a cranker is not about size, rather its all about technique. I have seen alot of small to medium built crankers in Singapore. The reason why crankers plant their last step way before their swings come down (late timing) is to allow them to position their fingers below the ball so as to generate the high revs. In my humble opinion, the main reason why this technique of bowling is not encouraged here is because of the lack of coaches who really know how to coach a cranker.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

( again, purely by arms &amp; fingers strenght to control the ball).<br>so...if u dun hv good arms &amp; fingers strenght, once u get tired, u realise ur bowl line start to out &amp; become very very inconsistant....<br>in my 15yrs of bowling exp...i hardly c any good cranker in sg wif very consistant score....<br>jus to share my view nia....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I share similar view with babyhunter on the consistency part, so if someone is really really serious about adopting cranking as preferred style, he muz be wiling to work hard not only on the lanes, but oso his physical training.<br><br>But who will be that serious other than the Nat'l Bowlers? and have the time.<br><br>But if doing it for chllenging self abilities for being to able to bowl like a good cranker, be prepared to face with inconsistecy problems, many many High/Low games.<br><br>Whether you bowl in league or tournament, if too many H/L games, the entire game is already over before you find your line.<br><br>But I do not rule out the entertainment value of some good hellof cranking shots.<br><br>Last but not least, do take care of your body, excessive use of force on a regular basis may leads to long term injury on certain areas.<br><br>Happy Bowling  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there,<br><br>Was kindda bored and decided to look through your forum. I was particularly interested in this thread.<br><br>I agree that cranking may possibly not be suitable for the typical Asian's built. Besides the speed and rev factor, the lanes in this part of the world just may not always be best suited to this kind of style. Having said that, I know Aloysius personally and he isn't your typical Asian bowler.<br><br>I've been cranking it up recently in Perth, and have been strongly advised against it by my coach, Ken Thompson (ex- Team Australia head coach). According to him, and I agree, we just aren't built for that kind of speed and projection. Perhaps some of us physically could. But why generate so much unecessary energy. In the end, all you really need is to knock ten bloody pins down. Take Cara Honeychurch or Carol Gianotti both from Australia who by no means are any bigger than the average Singapore female bowler, yet they can beat us men hands down any day.<br><br>My opinion to anyone set on cranking; if u really want, learn it. But let it not be your main style. Master another 'safer' style which requires less exertion, yet gets the job done consistently. Remember: this game isn't about who's shot looks the best, or who's got more revs, nor is it about who can crank the ball out of one gutter into the other. Its about Consistency and accuracy. Get one thing done first before attempting something harder. Cranking can be useful, but not as often as efficient as the more conventional forms; stroking, power-stroking, etc. There are so many different kinds of releases and timings, all with their own pros and cons. Mastering at least one,and knowing how to use the others when required should keep us all busy for quite a while.<br><br>Hope this helps. Don't believe me? Ask Aloy.<br><br>All my best,<br>Nick Tan<br>USBC Bronze Level Coach,<br>WA State Junior Development Asst.
