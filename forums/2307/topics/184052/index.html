Other than that, they do actively participative in bowling competitions, esp those held in malaysia, such as milo all star, or the malaysian international open which is stil ongoing now. you can refer to the following url:<br><br><a href="http://%5Dhttp://www.singaporebowling.org.sg/" rel="nofollow">]http://www.singaporebowling.org.sg/</a><br><br>[/url]</div>

But bowling is only starting to gain some significance in singapore in recent years, so i guess it takes more success stories to make sponsers willing to put in more money.<br><br>on the other hand, if u r just talking about local competitions with local bowlers, then it might be quite a one sided game.... the national and nation youth would be trashing even the very experienced veterans pretty often?? taht is wat i see it la...it is not a fair game if only for locals... and if it is not fair...then no one would wan to play...<br><br></div>
