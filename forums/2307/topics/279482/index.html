However there are times when the ball is straight all the way and at the crucial moment, turned. At these times or when it is a pocket throw but always one pin standing, bowlers will say it's time for me to get a new ball and it should not be plastic..</div>

Be it straight or hook. If you look at it closely everytime you roll/throw a ball down the lane. You will realise it actually hook towards the pin either left or right. This is becos all lanes are dressed with lane oil for protection purposes. Hence, when there is oil = less friction = less roll = look straighter at the front 40ft or so. No one of us is 100% straight bowler. Your ball did hook(change direction) while rolling towards the pin. It is just that most don't understand how would it be consider hook or not?<br><br>To me aslong I released my shot on the 10 boards &amp; it reaches at 10 boards of the break point, when it change direction &amp; hit the pin on the pocket which is 17.5 board. My ball hooks 7.5 boards.<br><br>Polyester ball = plastic CS = less friction = less roll = more skid = more deflection = less pin action=less nos of pin knock down<br><br>Why reactive???? Advantage is that they absord lane oil while rolling on it. It flares the CS on different area. (You can see this everytime when the ball is returned with strip of oil on it.) Hence, it give you more bites on the oily surface &amp; harded bites after clearing the front portion on the lanes filled with oil. There are more details to it which its difficult to explained in fews lines...................in general<br><br>Reactive ball = reactive CS = more friction = more roll = less skid = less deflection = better pin action = more nos of pin knock down<br><br>That is why most of us will realised our averages shoot up slightly when we changed to a reactive ball.<br><br>Pls also note that the weight of the ball must be equal when making comparision.<br><br>Happy bowling!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Armadillo:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br>When we talk about pin action, I believe its important first to understand our own releases. Be it straight or hook. If you look at it closely everytime you roll/throw a ball down the lane. You will realise it actually hook towards the pin either left or right. This is becos all lanes are dressed with lane oil for protection purposes. Hence, when there is oil = less friction = less roll = look straighter at the front 40ft or so. No one of us is 100% straight bowler. Your ball did hook(change direction) while rolling towards the pin. It is just that most don't understand how would it be consider hook or not?<br><br>To me aslong I released my shot on the 10 boards &amp; it reaches at 10 boards of the break point, when it change direction &amp; hit the pin on the pocket which is 17.5 board. My ball hooks 7.5 boards.<br><br>Polyester ball = plastic CS = less friction = less roll = more skid = more deflection = less pin action=less nos of pin knock down<br><br>Why reactive???? Advantage is that they absord lane oil while rolling on it. It flares the CS on different area. (You can see this everytime when the ball is returned with strip of oil on it.) Hence, it give you more bites on the oily surface &amp; harded bites after clearing the front portion on the lanes filled with oil. There are more details to it which its difficult to explained in fews lines...................in general<br><br>Reactive ball = reactive CS = more friction = more roll = less skid = less deflection = better pin action = more nos of pin knock down<br><br>That is why most of us will realised our averages shoot up slightly when we changed to a reactive ball.<br><br>Pls also note that the weight of the ball must be equal when making comparision.<br><br>Happy bowling!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Thanks for the great info.
