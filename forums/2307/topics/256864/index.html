            <div class='col-md body'>i've got something to say. you do not want to be a spinner. a spinner demands pinpoint accuracy at just about 19th board to strike. hook has a way bigger margin of error,even if you miss by 5 boards it still <strong>might</strong> come back.<br><br>for bowling balls, there is a correlation between bowling styles and lanes  . for synthetics(eg safra mt faber and yishun) strokers and tweeners are at an advantage. for wood(eg victors superbowl), high speed crankers have an advantage. wood lanes have higher friction. higher friction= higher hook. however, higher friction means more roll out for those who have no strength. thus alot of power is needed for wooden lanes to score well. however synthetics are more forgiving and consistent.<br><br>so if you regularly bowl at wood centres ,i advise you to get a ball which goes long and unleashes its power at the backend(skid- snap) for synthetics ,anything  will do, skid -snap or high hook balls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, there's no right or wrong whichever style, all need to have accuracy, the problem with most spinner is their strike rates, whereas for hook, tweener, stroke, powerbowler is with their spares and splits.<br><br>What I am saying is that , if anyone who is in for serious bowling at the competative level,  should pick up for Hook/Stroke/Power, coz once polsihed with the proper techniques and regular training under coaches(as in the nat'l team) it is advantages. (High Investments on equipments, High Satisfaction and High frustration)<br><br>Whereas for those who is going for leisure and less competative to self learned thorugh trial and error, spinning can achive higher average due to better sparing. (Decent investment, decent satisfaction and less fraustrations)<br><br>Cheers.<br><br></div>
