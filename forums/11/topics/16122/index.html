            <div class='col-md body'>wow...it was really a blast! i actually brought a friend along and she was also really impressed by their "live" voice quality...even their high notes....<br><br>it was actually very entertaining also...even though my seat was like not-very-in-front...apparently the cast of gan gan zuo ge kai xin ren was there to lend their support also and cai li lian was introduced as ric's wife and they sang guan huai fang shi together..<br><br>but the part i liked best was when they sang unplugged and sang other singers songs, including harlem's qing fei de yi, jay chou's xin qing and collin rayes' love me and many, many more..<br><br>i felt that it was a very successful concert.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, indeed they did not disappoint any of us... even other songs, they sing it so well... what's most touching is when everyone stand up last 2 songs and encore, then suddenly came the Bu Zhi De...

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree that dreamzFM's live performance really solid. No audible difference from their studio recordings at all..(or rather, no difference to someone with zilch muscial inclinations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>But they could have started on time couldn't they. I nearly fall asleep in my seat while waiting for the performance to start..what's with the tardiness..If they could not be professional in their work attitude even before they make it big, won't it be worse if (or should it be 'when') they become successful..<br><br>That's a minor gripe though. On the whole, their talents are their saving grace!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmz...actually...i could feel they were singing live and not lip-synching...in fact it seems better than their cd????<br><br>Well...i did nearly fall asleep in my seat...but normally most concerts would start a bit late mah...juz tat the seats (plastic chairs) are uncomfortable...so haiz...</div>
