He looked up and gave her a big smile.  She doesn't like him, and her sister who loves zaizai like xiao didn't get the huge smile from him so she was very jealous...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think it is bad 2 insult a person not to mention calling a person crazy!<br>so, if u(u know who u r)doesn't like zaizai, u can juz skip this message...i stated clearly it's about zaizai....<br>n i really don't get it!if u think u r more handsome than he is, it's ur opinion.u can't make everyone has the same judgement with u.in fact, i do find him handsome.<br>different ppl, different choice. mayb the one that u find handsome/beautiful, it doesn't mean that i feel the same. but one thing for sure, i won't insult or sad bad things about it....what u had done not juz insult me but also to the zaizai's fans.<br>i'm really sorry for u, for thinking such immature thinking....i do hope u think twice before stating something bad like that.</div>
