            <div class='col-md body'>Oops...sorry...<br><br>Well...many albums released in the market recently...let me go briefly into 3 selected albums ... A*Mei, Zhou Hui, Elva Hsiao.<br><br>A*Mei and Elva Hsiao fans have sparked off a big argument in taiwan over whose album sold better...and all that...<br><br>A*Mei's album is a highly commercialised album...personally i dun tink too well of hen jiao se or hen jue se (sg pronuniciation)...Although this album is commercialised...well...it's a different feel from Truth.  I dun really like fast songs...so i personally dun enjoy 54321 and gen wo yi qi feng...all i can say it's a change from her usual fast songs.<br><br>Do pay attention to the slow songs...zhi dao, xia yi ge ren, bie qu da rao ta de xin, ting jian le ma and jiu shi ai...somehow these slow songs prove to be stronger than the slow ones...all of them are equally good...worth mentioning is bie qu da rao ta de xin...is composed by tanya chua...ting jian le ma...is my shunza and it's another touching song...zhi dao appears to be a continuation of ting hai, wo wu suo wei, jian ai trilogy...the hype is on jiu shi ai...this song was the reason why the album was delayed...<br><br>Overall this album is a worth buy especially for the slow numbers.<br><br>Rating: B+<br><br>Elva's 5th album proved to be more successful than 4U...although i found 4U not bad...it did not digest well with the fans...overgoing an image overhaul...looking for natural certainly does help elva...wat abt the songs?<br><br>Ai De Zhu Da Ge is a powerful dance number...u can expect to groove and dance to...the kind which u can hear in discos...U make me wanna is a cooperation between elva and blue...<br><br>Personally...Wen and Ta He Ta De Gu Shi...easy to digest...sing...other songs like chuan yue shi kong yu jian ni (composed by elva), zhuan yan zhi jian and xiang nian sheng dan jie...are all digestable feel good songs...there's a cover of Sandy Lam's Yuan...(chi and canto version)<br><br>RATING: B+<br><br>After an absence of nearly 2 years...not with the old songs recording included...zhou hui is finally back...unfortunately...her ren qi has somehow slipped thanks to this long absence..this album is nothing new...with no fantastic lyricists behind her...but this album stands out as it is an album that is long-lasting...which u wun get tired of...so do grab this album and enjoy her music.<br><br>RATING: B+</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i'm not wrong zhang zhen yue has a new album right?<br>i heard one of his new songs that day, quite an interesting song..<br>called shuang shou cha kou dai (literally: both hands stuffed in pocket)... some very amusing lyrics there... something like he felt very grossed out by his "ai wo bie zou" and earlier love songs that he sang..... and how he doesnt bother about the entertainment industry or how obsessed they are with churning out albums....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for sharing your opinion, Zilch  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I personally prefer A*Mei's and Elva's latest albums to their previous ones, Truth and 4U. Fa Shao is a well-balanced album with a good selection of ballads and fast songs. The fast songs are obviously composed with A*Mei's current world tour in mindÂ… I particularly like the infectious track Fa Shao and the Li Wei Song composition Yes or No, but tend to skip Hen Jiao Se becos of its cheesy lyrics. The standout slow tracks are Ting Jian Le Ma, Xia Yi Ge Ren and Zhi Dao. The ultra-slow Bie Qu Da Rao Ta De Xin is strictly for night-time listening and takes a couple of listen to fully appreciate. Jiu Shi Ai (renamed Katsu, but should've retained its original title) is a song very close to A*Mei's heart which sees her "collaborating" with Zhang Mama again after Jie Mei.<br><br>It's good to see Elva returning to her earlier style as 4U was not quite my cup of tea. My fav tracks are Wen and Ai De Zhu Da Ge.  Like A*Mei, she's one of the precious few Chinese pop singers who can handle fast and slow songs with flair. This album will see her star rise again after that brief stumble with 4U.<br><br>I have yet to get Zhou Hui's album but I noticed she's gone back to putting a drawing of her face on the cd cover, after that full-body shot on her earlier oldies album.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
