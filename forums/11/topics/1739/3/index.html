But now with fierce competition, it doesn't help even if you have talent but don't know how to peddle your ware.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this kind of award ceremonies always full of ironies and long-due recognition all mixed into a single event. Some people who always mo mo gen yun and work hard behind the scenes will get their chance to be singled out for praise in this kind of ceremony. However, at the same time, some people's better works are always overshadowed by others just because these works are not glam or "famous" enough to win the awards.<br><br>Best way to react to this kinda things is to celebrate your triumph and soak in the elation as much as you can. After that, put it at the back of your mind and move on. The world is moving on every second and won't wait for you, so you need to constantly whip yourself to go forward if you don't want to fall from the pedestal.<br><br>For those who did not manage to win the award, see it as a kind of motivation telling you that you are still not at your best yet, and you should always strive to be better than before.<br><br>Enjoy while it lasts, coz after that, it's back to business~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, I tend to agree with Eric. <strong>Getting an award doesnt mean that a musician is at his best. Coz it is all subjected to lotsa factors, whether the song got airplay or not, whether the panel like the song or not, whether your record company would like to nominate you or not. I think Lee Zongsheng and Lin Xi never ever had an award for best lyrics in Taiwan b4 but NOT becoz they are not at their best. c'mon, they are the best lyricist you can ever find in this century! Everyone can sing their song without having to memorize the words, and get touched by the words all the time! so why dun they get an award, right? </strong>like last yr, Naying won TW Golden melody award best lyrics? she herself thought it was a joke!<br><br>Getting an award is nice, but that really doesnt mean that you have to become proud and think that you are great or something. In fact I feel more stressed after that that I couldnt sleep a wink that night!<br><br>ha! I am quite tall, not small and quiet (as all the 933 pple thought small winter). And a little on the plump side (if thats what you mean by CUTE). haha. But I think everyone expanded 30% on TV! haha!<br><br>We are all small time musicians who like to hide in a cave and produce music through the opening for pple who are not afraid of the weird looking creatures inside. So it doesnt really matter how we look or how we dress, right?<br><strong><br>Hey hey, how about getting back to the album review?</strong><br>Anyone heard the COLDPLAY new album? Anyone feel cheated, just like me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes it's not easy also. Some fans expect you to change your style for every album, while some expect you to play safe and remain the same. Got change, they say should not have disturb the winning formula. No change, they say should have been more creative and break out of the shell.<br><br>What factors make you decide to go along the same vein for your next album, or break out of it for a radical change?</div>
