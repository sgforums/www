            <div class='col-md body'>OU XIANG SINGERS.<br><br>If you notice the market now, there are a lot of so called Ou Xiang singers.  Well...I am going to introduce to all some albums from Ou Xiang Singers.<br><br>WEWE'S HAPPY DAY<br><br>Wewe was actually formed 2 years back.  Happy Day was their first single...but however they did not receive enough good response.  Later, they went on to act in TV serials, You Wei in Ma La Xian Shi, Li Wei in Tu Si Nan Zhi Wen...and it made them enjoy fame...thus they managed to come out with a full album.<br><br>Can WeWe sing...i would say so so lar...i wun say they have superb singing skills...music wise...i would say it's very suitable for teenagers taste...with most of them fast songs.  Few ballads...but they have good producers behind the album...if u like music which is easy to listen to, fun, to get u happy and relax...this album is not bad.<br><br>Li Wei and Lin You Wei each have a solo in the album...personally i prefer you wei's voice.  Overall, this album is a must buy if you are into Ou Xiang singers...and if u want it to be autographed by the 2 guys who are coming soon.<br><br>RATING: B<br>RECOMMENDED SONGS: MAO, TING BU DAO NI, HAPPY DAY, SARA, NI BU KUAI LE, YUAN LAI AI NI SHI ZHE ME KUAI LE<br><br>VIC CHOU (ZAIZAI) MAKE A WISH<br><br>Can Zaizai sing?<br><br>I would say alright...has shown improvement since Zui Te Bie De Cun Zai/Wei Ni Zhi Zhuo.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you are not a good singer...as long you know the market and have good producers behind you.<br><br>Hence, an album of ballads/comfortable medium paced songs...I would agree that all the songs are very very nice...<br><br>Zaizai still needs to improve on pronunciation...<br><br>RATING: C+</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sun Yanzi's START ALBUM<br><br>An album of covers.  If you are non-Yanzi fan, you can give this album a miss.<br><br>Basically what irks me is comparison between Yanzi and the original singers, and that Yanzi actually sings better than the original singer...what a joke.  E.g. Ah Mei's Yuan Lai Ni She Me Dou Bu Xiang Yao..<br><br>She also did covers of faye wong's tian kong, karen mok's mei shi jian...i wonder what is she trying to prove?<br><br>Looking on the bright side, i do enjoy the rendition of the english covers...but nothing beats what i feel the highlight of the album, Someone, composed by Yanzi...(this song is recorded in Sammi's Qu Ai Ba album as Zhi Dao De Qing Gao Su Wo)  This song is also Yanzi's first composition...<br><br>For bonus tracks, there are 2 songs jiu shi zhe yang and Up 2 U, both advertisement songs.<br><br>RATING: B</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In this posting, I would like to recommend 2 singers from EMI/Virgin.<br><br>Firstly, let's talk about Shunza.<br><br>SHUNZA'S FRIEND<br><br>After being confronted by Yao Qian on if you don't 40,000 copies, you would not have your next album, and with her disastrous previous hip hop album, and with all the bad publicity, Shunza has decided to shut up, and do less promotion...<br><br>Well...this album well...how would i put it...it's definitely more radio-friendly than her previous MEI YOU CHOU NU REN album...does it mean that Shunza has to yield in to industry standards?<br><br>In fact I enjoy the ballads in this album.  Although Dear Friend is a cover song, it is one again, a touching song, and it does get to me...a very good song.  Next ballad song I would like to recommend is Juan Lian.  Although it is another cover, but once again, it is yet another touching song...and the other ballads I would recommend include Kan Jian Star Blue and Gei Wo.<br><br>Of course you can find the other alternative music, you can find it in Qia Qiao De Ji Mo (folksy).  Would recommend It's cold outside (a demo) and It's gonna be alright.<br><br>And yes, And I know, a duet by Shunza and Elva Hsiao.  2 great R&amp;B singers put together.  What kind of chemistry would you see?  Not bad...sparks manage to fly...you seldom get to see 2 females singing a duet.<br><br>RATING: B+<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ELVA HSIAO'S 4U<br><br>After a long 10 months, Elva is finally back with her long awaited 4th album.<br><br>Four You + For You + 4 You = 4 U.<br><br>This album strives to give us 4 sides of Elva...white, red, blue...hehe...forgot about the last...<br><br>Anyway...image wise, yes, she decides to return to a simple image.<br><br>Yes, she has been dropped by Mcdonalds from singing the advertisement song...and yanzi is taking over...but heck...let's ignore that to focus more on Elva's music.<br><br>In this album, Elva has sort of dropped quite a bit of R&amp;B for some refreshing change of songs.  In fact, she is able to find her own voice and walk out of Coco Lee's shadow...<br><br>She has taken vocal lessons and yes, her techniques and voice have improve tremendously.<br><br>Keeping Jim Lee, Jae Chong and Chen Wei and adding Chen Zihong as producers in addition to the wonderful lyrics by Lin Xi and Yao Qian, this is definitely a good buy album.<br><br>Now let me recommend some songs from this album.<br><br>Track No 3 WO XI HUAN NI KUAI LE<br><br>Lyrics by Yao Qian and composed by Chen Wei.  This song's MTV is way cool, music wise, it's very refreshing, and unique...this is a feel good song in this kinda turbulent days...find that Elva's singing is improving, seen from this song.<br><br>Track 4 Kuai Ge<br><br>Lyrics by lyrics maestro Lin Xi...he compares love to a fast song...very good intelligent lyrics...this song is rather short, and is a cover, it has a spanish-latin arrangement and it would make you wanna dance...Elva keeps her voice a little down to attempt this song...yet another song to prove her vocal prowess.<br><br>Track 6 Zi Ji Ren<br><br>Another lyrics masterpiece by Lin Xi...this song is rather a rock song...although it is not one of the zhu da this is a great song with the lyrics together.<br><br>Track 9 Yin Wei Ni<br><br>This track is composed by Elva herself.  It has the sunny feel of California...it's a medium beat track and it is kinda like cappucino...when it comes to this song, Elva is at her best<br><br>Track 8 Xiao Zhe Ai Ni<br><br>Another piece of work by lyrics maestro Lin Xi...the music is more to zhong ban...in fact this is quite a sad song...that's what i feel...the lyrics can be quite sad...and yes...elva is once again at her best.<br><br>Track 7 Wo Men De Ji Mo<br><br>A slow song combining the finest qualities of Yao Qian and Chen Wei.<br><br>Track 10 Cha Qu.<br><br>A touching song...which uses orchestra music...a slow movin ballad...listen out to the chorus...lyrics by Yao Qian<br><br>Track 2 Wen Zi Ji<br><br>I've seen the MTV.  It's great...composed by Shunza and lyrics by Yao Qian, this is one of the best songs in the album...feel very touched by the song and elva's delivery...a slow ballad...it would easily be one of the best songs in the year.<br><br>Don't miss out on this great album.  Support Elva.<br><br>RATING: B+</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tho many ppl prefer d original version of "yuan lai ni shen me dou bu yao", but I've heard one of the djs,(forgot who), he said that he liked Stefanie's version coz he feels that yanzi has put her feelings into this song...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My views are opposite: I feel A*Mei put in more feelings in her rendition than Yanzi. Can see that Yanzi put in efforts to sing with feel, but to me, nothing beats the original by A*Mei. If I really want to be critical, A*Mei brings out the feelings of a heartbroken woman who gets ditched, Yanzi's version is more "shao nian bu zhi chou zi wei" and borders near the "wu bing shen ying" kind.(no offence)<br><br>In fact, you can only find a more "feeling A*Mei" in her 1st 2 albums. The recent one is not bad, but still her 1st 2 albums have the most "feel".</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well to be fair, A*Mei was already quite a veteran by the time she released her 1st album with that song, having sung in pubs before that. She's probably more experienced in love too, compared to Yanzi, so that helps. When it comes to putting "feelings" into a song, A*mei is really good at that. Yanzi has her emotional side too, but maybe she'll get better when she's gone thru a heartbreak, sth like that... haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Ok, not really good at doing reviews, but here's my some penny-worth comments :<br><br>***<br><br>David Tao - Black Tangerine (Hei Se Liu Ding)<br><br>David Tao's album is pretty good if you are not exactly looking for R&amp;B. Quite a fair bit of rock, and boy, can David Tao ROCK! I am pleasantly surprised at it, though I was a little disappointed at first as I was one who expected good R&amp;B from the "Father of R&amp;B". But it got into me the more I listened to it over the weekend. Will probably add another half-star after even more listens...<br><br>Rating :   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> (out of 5)<br><br>***<br><br>Shin Yue Tuan - Shin<br><br>It's about time for some nice rock, and Shin Yue Tuan provides a good deal of it. Fave track has got to be "Shi Jie Mo Ri". The lyrics about a guy whose love knows no bounds, not even till Doom's Day - the end of the world. Yes, Shin's voice sounds like Steve Tyler of Aerosmith, esp when he plunges into "na han". And yes, "Shi Jie Mo Ri" reminds me so much of "I Don't Want To Miss A Thing", which ironically was the theme of "Armaggedon", a movie about Doom's Day. Nonetheless, it is a good song. The other songs are really credible rock too, and you'll be surprised how good the rock version of "One Night in Beijing" can sound.<br><br>Rating :    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>***<br><br>Elva Hsiao - Wen (1st single off her new album)<br><br>Ok, this is not an album, but the very 1st single off her new album. Written for Elva who is believed to be always falling in love but never have her love requited, as those men are eventually only passerbys in her life. Her voice is still as lovely and silky, it's a song which really brings out the "pain" of her wanting but not getting.

I recommend pple who wants to have inspirations to just stare at the pics and you might just get ideas flowing to your brain! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  My fren from Tw gave them to me..<br>Anyway, our local singer Cai Chunjia sang this song about two pple living in the same block of apartments and they never met each other coz one will turn right and the other turn left while they get out of their aptments. Tat song ripped off the JiMi artist guy man!! He has one book called "turn left turn right". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>
