            <div class='col-md body'>ok lah, i admit i m a leecher. i often leech mp3 off bots so tat i can listen to them for free. but hoh, the mp3 for me is test water purpose. if i like the songs by the artiste, i will usuali go out to buy the albums. eg. recent albums by penny dai, ye shu yin...oni some artistes i will go out straight to buy without downloading their mp3, eg. david huang, david tao, jay chow, jeff chang...aniway nowadays the mp3 i download were all those which u can no longer find elsewhere. if i can't find the album, so wat's the next best thing to do? the answer is obvious lor...<br><br>aniway, now i juz realise tat i m less hesitant in buying english albums rather than chinese ones. i tink i biased lah, but i feel english albums r usuali better and more worth buying/risking. artistes like pet shop boys, jamiroquai, etc, i always buy without test-listen oso. very biased hoh? but can't help. coz i realise many chinese albums usuali play on the marketing rather than on the production itself. wat for u give me towel, keychain, t-shirt etc when i buy the album for gd music?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>oso hoh, the chinese albums i tend to buy later now, coz of the freebies which they give in the later versions. kaoz, i remm tat time i bought tao zhe's 1st album on import coz no local distributor, the cd cost $20+ and come wif nothing at all. then after tat he became popular, local distributor brought in his album then price slashed to $17 or less, plus bonus tracks! dui ah! 2nd album oso like tat, i bought in its 1st week, then not long after, the later edition got free vcd  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> loyal fans were discounted for their support, sigh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>orh, was talking abt mp3. aniway i felt tat now mp3 so rampant, wana stop it oso next to impossible, so best is record labels work out an agreement with the major mp3 servers eg. Morpheus for a win-win situation. instead of wasting so much $ and coming up wif dumb technology like "protected" CD which in the end could be overcome by the simple method of using a black marker to draw a line at its circumference. end up as laughing stock leh...<br><br>cham, i tink i talk nonsense liao, better stop... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thx Zilch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>Actually Eric is more deserving than me la. He has been in the scene for as long as I have and  has written much more hit songs than I have. It is just that His name Huang Yun Ren is often mixed up with Huang Yun Ling (the E-news host). Pple tend to think that it was a typo error on the credit list.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Anyway guys, hope to see your name one day too! jiayou!<br><br>Talking about albums, I have this urge to go and buy all the Chen shan ni's albums. I really admire her for writing all the funny lyrics and the company's guts to release all that!! all the long hair dog caffeine crazy songs!! (actually I love her only serious but spooky song LaibuJi, drives me to tears, esp that line, Lai Bu ji wei ni bian cheng Haoren).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Hope that one day we all get that kind of luck too! to do the music that we really love, and not care abt the market. To be fair, Sandy's album is almost that, coz both me and eric enjoyed the whole process. We get a lot of room to stretch our potentials.  But chances like those are few. Most of the time we have to write commercial stuff as the producers have to worry about album sales.<br>I mean, why cant someone appreciate songs that talk about, say, staples, bread, our toes, tap water or Taliban etc? Why must it be you leave me , but I still love you all the time?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>By the way, what's with the Taiwan market? so many boy bands! I tumed to MTV that day and had a shock.. Energy, 5566, peace etc etc.. all look like korean/Jap bands! I cant even differentiate who is who?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Lai Bu Ji" is my most fave Chen Shan Ni song, though it's not asif I know many of her songs. This is the case of liking the song at 1st listen before knowing who sang it. I saw the MTV and I got the chills - it was filmed in a morgue. Her voice sort of reminds me of a local singer - Liu Xue Fang, the one who sang "Mi Li Ye" theme song.<br><br>5566 and Energy are both tw new boybands. 5566 have 5 members who venture in all entertainment areas, eg. hosting, acting, etc. They derive their strengths (or attempt to do so) from being diversified in all these areas. Energy is heavily modelled after Korean boyband ShinHwa, and their 1st hit "Come On", was covered from ShinHwa's "Hey Come On". Typical boyband lor. PEACE??? That's a locally made boyband. Erm, so far, don't see much of their achievements since they haven't released any solo album, though they can always boast of having Wang De Yuan as an ex-champ of Youth Karaoke competition.<br><br>Alot of new albums, but mostly are from "idol" singers. So I guess people should save the $$$ to go concerts instead! Hiak, Sandy is coming... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Btw, please support Xingpop which will be in Esplanade in Oct. Local compositions from the 80s to the present, with Jeff Chang as guest singer. Pity my fave Roy Lee and AhDo won't be present  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa whoa, relac mate. So many devil faces...<br><br>I'm just a poor working class here who know nothing about music nor play any musical instrument (the closest I ever get to one is the recorder I played during primary school days). But I do appreciate good music (or so I think), tho my standards are of coz far off from those critics who are well-versed in anything from mainstream pop to bossa nova (though I can't stand some so-called critics who always act so damn high-browed in their selections...act seh sia... BAH!). I always harbour a secret fantasy of wanting to revolutionalise the whole Chinese music industry if I have the power, talents and money to do so. Ha!<br><br>Frankly, the Chinese entertainment industry is always seen as a class lower to that of their foreign counterparts - backing, resources, dedication, production quality, manpower etc. Doing entertainment work is seldom seen as a mean of livelihood (not asif you can earn big bucks kind), but more for personal interest/passion. Probably due to the traditional thinking of "xi zi wu qing", people around you will seldom encourage in to be involved in the entertainment industry. Foreign artistes usually struggle to stand out due to intense competition, but for Asian artistes, there is an additional barrier of this misperception. How many cases you have heard of some Asian artistes whose parents threaten to disown just because he/she chooses to sing/act over conventionally prestigious jobs of a lawyer, doctor, banker, etc?<br><br>Ok, probably I'm not in the music industry, so I can't possibly empathise with musicians like xh and HYR. Talk is so easy for me, but the situation they face is probably hundreds times more difficult than what I have envisioned.<br><br>And to answer your qn, xiaohan, I don't think we know each other, and as mentioned before, I'm just a poor working class, not a PRO in anything, except for crap probably. But I must say the few posts by you and HYR definitely enlighten everyone in here immensely. Maybe it'll motivate (or demotivate, depends on how people take to your messages) more music-lovers to go for their dreams.<br><br>Does xiaohansuan mean "little scrooge"???</div>
