            <div class='col-md body'>Haiz...F4 fans are known for being notorious.  Seriously, think about it, do u think any of the F4 guys will fall for a girl who spends money on this sort of idol stuff, queues for 1 whole day to buy tickets to their concert or go crazy and hysterical at seeing them?  I seriously dun think so.  U can luv ur f4 but dun insult other groups!  Go check your facts, Mayday did sell better than F4 in Taiwan.  Stef Sun and Jay also beat F4 by quite a lot in terms of sales.</div>
