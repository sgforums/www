            <div class='col-md body'>It's more like a music gathering than a concert. Just 1 1/2 hour of pure enjoyment of Hong Shao Xuan's voice was the reason why I was in Esplanade's Recital Studio just a couple of hours ago.<br><br>He treated the fully seated audience with a variety of songs, including the "leh deh yo" song by Sakura (local singer), Cai Qin ("bei yi wang de shi guang"), Wan Fang ("xin bu liao qing"), Feng Fei Fei's medley, etc. Hmm, all are songs by female, but all were quite suitable for his voice. He was not very eloquent, but people were there for his voice, not his banter anyway. Liang Wenfu was there with his wife as well. Deng Shu Xian sang only 1 1/2 song, but well the concert was only 90mins...<br><br>Hope they will hold similar xinyao concerts again...old songs are still the best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all... Should share this little tip with everyone:<br><br>This URL allows you to see what's the playlist of 93.3 songs currently scheduled. Sometimes the DJ does not use this, so at times (ie, now) the song list isn't updated.<br><br>I always use this to check what's the title of the song...<br><br>http://www.mediacorpradio.com/ts/playlists/933/refreshlist.asp?fm=933<br><br>Another Saturday passed by.. that's fast!<br><br></div>
