But well, I can't say much except to ask Jieqi to air Liang Jing Ru's "Fen shou kuai le", which I'll like to dedicate to Sherv. It's a good song in the sense that the lyrics really say it all and it is intended to be something a friend tells someone who is having problems with the relationship.<br><br>Hope Jieqi sees this and can accede to my request. Well, there are two versions in the album so perhaps the 'he chang ban' will be better because it really sounds like one friend standing by another during the bad patch....<br><br>BTW, who sang the 'he chang ban' with Liang Jingru?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, thanks for the info on who featured in the song "fen shou kuai le". It's good to hear from you guys ...<br><br>Hehehehe... was quite elated when I heard Jieqi mention 'tinker' last Saturday. Was actually walking alone then... It's a great feeling to be alone in a vast expense of space and suddenly, you hear the flute that marks the beginning of "po4 xiao3". And the sky had some shades of orange... just like daybreak.<br><br>I do know for a fact that DJ's have to abide by some guidelines on the number of songs sung by the same singer within a duration. The Sandy Lam jiu lian huan was more wishful thinking on my part.<br><br>Anyway, here are some of my favourite Sanday Lam songs:<br>-zhou2 zai4 ta4 jie1 de4 nu3 zi3<br>-qian2 cheng2 (the erhu solo in this song is super)<br>-po4 xiao3<br>-hai2 shi4 bu4 yao4 shuo1 bao4 qian4 (the canto version "ye3 hua1" is actually nicer, IMHO)<br>-chun1 yu3<br>-chong2 yu4<br><br>and some others which I don't think I should bore you with. A friend of mine recommended pan4 ni3 zai4 ci3 but I haven't really got a chance to hear it.<br><br>What's your favourite Sandy Lam songs? Anyone?<br><br>I believe in "consistency from beginning to the end". So... if I like what Liu Jieqi does, I'll support it. Never mind the years. It's quite amazing... since years ago, Jieqi's program has kept me company through my industrial attachment , FYP and even now, my convovation this week... It's been a long way. It's like a part of my life now. And for that, I am thankful.<br><br>Thanks Jieqi! Thank you for everything! And of course all those wonderful people who wrote to him and supported this forum. A big thank you to you too!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dick Lee and Sandy Lam are almost like the ultimate super combo in the music scene. "hai shi bu yao shuo bao qian" is Dick Lee's handiwork too! when they work together, a killer song is bound to be produced. Oh yes, I heard they are very good friends. Sandy attended Dick's wedding dinner some years back.<br><br>Well, I really hope Dick and Sandy will work collaborate once more in the future... preferably on slow sentimental songs.<br><br>As for the engine bridge sunset, it really slipped my mine. Sorry about it. But it must happen some time. let's pick a satruday... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>anyway, the sunset these days aren't that great... thanks to the smog/haze/cloud. Sunsets are usually good during the hotter months from May to August assuming no haze.<br><br>I wonder what are Jieqi's favourite Sandy Lam songs. I suspect they are the slower numbers. Sherv, what about you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I really like Sandy as a singer. BUT, I was a little disappointed when she married Jonathan Li. Nope... I am not jealous! Perhaps I am on the conservative side but the idea of marrying a married man is something I have difficutly accepting. To be fair, it is not easy to find one's true love so... In any case, I'll continue to support her wherever she chooses to go.<br><br>Last Saturday (14 Sep), Jieqi tried not to speak too much so that we can have more time to listen to songs... thanks to the large number of advertisements. Maybe we should pretend NOT to like his programme so that the ads will not come in than we can hear more of him and the songs he selects. *hiak hiak hiak* (For starters, we could have a "Liu Jieqi's Programme Sucks!" forum!!!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  BUT, with dwindling support for his programme, Jieqi might lose his part-time job.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Oh yes... I remember Jieqi reading out excerpts from books... such as those by Zhang Xiaoxian. Not sure if he has been doing that recently. Hehehe... perhaps other than songs, we can recommend good books to him yah? It will really raise his programme to another level don't you think so? I am quite a bookworm so it will appeal to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>For starters, please try "Tuesdays with Morrie". It's one of my favourites. I think there is a Chinese translation and it is entitled "xiang1 yue1 xing1 qi1 er4" (Rendezvous on Tuesdays).<br><br>BTW, I have heard that Jieqi is a good friend of Wu Qingkang and they knew each other since school days. And Qingkang is from The Chinese High school. Any chance Jieqi is a "hua2 zhong1 xiao4 you3"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>As for the picnic, that's not a bad idea... the only problem being my schedule. *sigh*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe JieQi has a very solid group of die-hard listeners. These listeners lend their support by faithfully tuning to his programme and enjoying his segment with him in a lazy weekend. Not those which go "JieQi wo men yong yuan zhi chi ni" kind. The definition of "yong yuan" to these people seem to last only for some months then they will switch allegiance to another person liao...<br><br>Anyway, JieQi does have a day-job, so if that job demands more of his time, we can only respect his wishes. But of course, we certainly hope this is not the case! Only one weekend afternoon of his time, surely that's isn't too much to ask for?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was a leeetle disappointed when I tuned in at 6+ and didn't hear Jieqi's voice.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>But well, let's just hope he will be in tommorrow afternoon. Fortunately, I will be at home tomorrow. But with the Esplanade opening, not sure if Jieqi will be available...<br><br>Well, hope it didn't spoil your day at the beach, Sherv.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hmmm... we better come up with a way for Jieqi to inform us whether he will be in or not. Maybe he can e-mail Sherv and Sherv can pose the response on this Forum?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>(My Hotmail filter is on so I can't receive mails from accounts I haven't de-filtered.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sherv: I was just thinking if Jieqi could send an email to you and you just update us via this website.<br><br>Well, for the two weekends Jieqi wasn't in, I felt that my weekend wasn't complete. Sounds like withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict yah?<br><br>Looks like a lot of people writes in to Jieqi. Maybe I should do the same too, especially when I have some books to recommend to him. Would be nice if everyone who writes in to him can also post something at this forum...<br><br>I wonder if this website can support Chinese text. It should be able to right? Experiments? Anyone?</div>
