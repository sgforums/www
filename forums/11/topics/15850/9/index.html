            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Managed to catch the the last 15 mins of Jieqi's program last Saturday  6 July. And... there was this SMS message which one of Jieqi's friend sent to him. The SMS ends with something like "the one who turns around and walk away may not be the weakest" (in Mandarin).<br><br>I like the SMS a lot... so... does anybody have the full message?

            <div class='col-md body'>For the weekend that just passed (20-21 Jul), Jieqi was on air on Sunday afternoon and not on Saturday. It seems that Xiaobing will be taking quite a number of Saturday afternoons because she's back in school. So... you can expect not to hear Jieqi on Saturdays but on Sundays instead, at least for the time being. But I guess it still is a good idea to try on both days lah. Also, there is a possibility he will be on air during the noon to afternoon session.<br><br>Okay... I know some of you can't believe this thread is still running, but the fact is, I just happen to support Jieqi so it should go on for a while.<br><br></div>

I'm surprised tat this thread is still alive after so long.<br><br>3 CHEERS !!!<br><br>I dun log on that often now 'cos sick of staring at pC for the whole day in office so at home dun log on...<br><br>Came in after Jieqi mentioned that a fan wrote in and said that there's actually a forum for him. As I heard Jieqi continued, I was pleasantly surprised... then i hear Tinker's name being mentioned, the topic, etc... All the memories came back to me... Jieqi was quite touched I think, that he actually has fans and who like his programmes.<br><br>Managed to call in a couple of times when Jieqi open his hotline... everytime very happy to talk to him...<br><br>Just an update...<br>Graduated and already working for 3 months already... busy working... still the same...<br><br>also, my real name is Ji3 You1 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>How are the rest of you?<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it? I only heard Jieqi's program from 6.15 pm onwards on Sat 3 Aug. Care to tell me more about what was said? They actually used the word 'Tinker'? Gosh...<br><br>Perhaps the next time you write to him, try to give him the URL to this forum. I thought you have done this some time ago. It would be good if he could sign in and pretend to be a listener but somehow knows when Jieqi will be on air and stuff. In this way, we don't have to play the guessing game every weekend.<br><br>Oh yes... as my mailbox is being flooded by spam mail, I have to filter out everyone except a handful.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi tinker,<br>Jieqi has the url already.

It must be before 6.15pm then. I can go home and check my irc log becos i log in right after hearing him mention the forum. Dun think you will miss hearing your name on air.<br><br>He mentioned that he went through the posts, and read our comments on his programmes, the way we displayed our 'gan3 xing4' side of us (i think he meant the part where he was hosting the mid saturday afternoon programme and the ambience wasn't really there without the setting evening sun). He mentioned that he was really touched by the fact that though he works only 4hrs a week, the songs he play is able to touch us still. He is also very happy to have such a following.<br><br>I think my words dun really fully express the sincerity Jieqi felt. Anyway, that was the best I could remember.<br><br>YEah... as long as Jieqi is around as a DJ, I'll be around too...<br><br>btw, any of you (the usual few of us posting in this thread) going to Wu Bai's concert?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I should be home this Saturday to listen to the entire programme hosted by Jieqi. It would be nice if he could repeat whatever he said!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Also, in my earlier posting, I requested for the SMS message and somehow, it seems that nobody remembers it so it would be good if the SMS can be repeated. No lah... too much to ask of.<br><br>In any case, I was on Industrial Attachment some years back and my IA company was just above Jieiqi's Caldecott Publishing office. Actually dropped by and wanted to talk to him but the recept told me he was very busy. So... I got the drift and never went back. I was hoping to give him the URL. But well, the thread is still alive and kicking.<br><br>My only concern is people sending me mail which I will not receive because of the filter settings I have to use.<br><br>Actually, we can use this posting to 'remind' Jieqi of those older songs that still strike a chord in us. Anyway, has anybody lately heard any good songs that you can suggest to Jieqi to air? I like S.H.E.'s "Tropical Rainforest". I think it is perfect with the setting sun... *hint hint*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Last weekend very shiok... spent the afternoon sleeping and later listening to Jieqi's programme. Heard Jieqi mention about the 'little web forum' that was set up for him. Yerp.. glad to be of service. I think there was one part where Jieqi explained why he chose to air Stephanie's Ren4 Xing4 and not  her latest hit. According to him, the latest hit can be heard quite frequently on 933 anyway. But good songs like Ren4 Xing4 cannot be heard with the same frequency. Yerp... totally agree... if we want to listen to the latest hits, we have some 6+ days a week to do that. BUT, for the good songs, we have only 4 hours per week.<br><br>Anyway, Jieqi can consider airing some of Kenny G's instrumental, non-vocal pieces during the slot between 6-7 pm. I would recommend Kenny G's "Going Home" and "Uncle Al". "Going Home" suits the 6-7 pm time slot pretty well too. "Jasmine Flower" is another one... it is an adaption from the traditional Chinese piece. (Oh yes, for those younger listeners, Kenny G is this saxophonist who was quite a hit in the 80s and 90s. He quietened quite a bit in the very late 90s.)<br><br>"Going Home" was a really big hit on Perfect 10 98.7 in those days... while "Uncle Al" is one sentimental piece I feel that can equal or even surpass "Going Home".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank goodness it's Friday ... because that means we get to hear Jieqi tomorrow. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Anyway, I forgot to ask. Who was the hero/heroine who wrote in to tell Jieqi about the Forum? Be honest. Please own up.<br><br>Just realise that we don't get to hear that many songs from Liu Ruoying's latest album. I keep hearing the 'main hit song' (zu3 ta3 ge1) but not the rest. It would be good if Jieqi could share some of the less common but nice songs from Liu Ruoying's latest album. (I suddenly realise I may be the most troublesome of Jieqi's fans.)<br><br>Well, without Jieqi's introduction, I would not have noticed Sandy Lam's Chong2 Yu4 as it was being eclipsed by the "main hit song's". So... perhaps it would be the same for Liu Ruoying's latest album.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was tuning in to Jieqi last Saturday (24 Aug). It was a fantastic 4 hours! He aired "<strong>Tropical rainforest</strong>" which was followed by "<strong>Sometimes love just ain't enough</strong>". I was on the bus then and I was like smiling to myself through the whole jiu lian huan. The guy beside me thought I was nuts. Anyway, he can never understand why I was smiling so happily. It's a really great feeling to listen to a few great songs in a row... it can be so uplifting.<br><br>One suggestion for Jieqi is that he might want to consider airing the original "Sometimes love just ain't enough", sung by Patty Smyth &amp; Don Henley instead of Stephanie's. It's one of my favourite songs... after all these years. Stephanie's rendition is good, just that the electronica music at the beginning of the song made it sound a little sleazy. The original is better, in my opinion at least. Hope Jieqi knows what to do next week! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Okay...  before ending off, here is an excerpt which I like very much from the song "Sometimes love just ain't enough".<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"But there's a danger in loving somebody too much<br>And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust<br>There's a reason why people don't stay where they are<br>Baby sometimes love just ain't enough"</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just heard Karen Mok's 'yin1 tian1'... and thought how fantas it would sound if Jieqi airs it during his 6 - 7 pm slot.<br><br>BTW, could only tune in from 6-7 pm last Saturday.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am one big fan of Sandy Lam so I'll try to go for this one. From past experience, I have found Sandy Lam concert ticket prices a little prohibitive. <strong>What's the price range this time round?</strong><br><br>Maybe Jieqi can do some kind of a special feature on Sandy Lam... like a jiu lian huan of all her songs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Again, I ask for too much. Well, some kind of a tribute to her will be nice... as a follow up to the awards she got for the 933 Hit Awards.</div>
