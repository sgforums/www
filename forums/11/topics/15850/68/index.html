Before that was asking Shervon what's the title of a particular song..and we tried hard..Shervon managed to tell me it's  but we forgot who's the singer.  I asked JieQi and he cant remember too hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So anyone knows who is the singer?  Flyaway747?  JieQi said he will remember to play this song if he recalls it.  </span></div></blockquote>i thot the song is sung by "Xu2 Zhi4 Zhen1, but when i checked one of my songbks, it was printed as "Xu3 Shu1 Zhen1", so i'm not sure which one now! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  smsd him the name of the 1st one, dun know whether he received my msg or not. anyway, it shd be easy for him to chk with these 2 names given?!</div>

Shervon also dun think it's Xu Shi Zhen..Perhaps that was her real name?

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Harlow everybody~<br><br>I juz came back from Music Dreamer's Live! Cafe.  Omg..marina square is like a maze..i walked and walked..3 rounds..and kept getting back to the starting point.  duiz..well well...this 21 years old girl lost her way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   Luckily frencame to save me juz in time..hehe..but not forgetting suaning me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>There were two segments.  The first segment was from 7 - 9pm by three ming ge ge shou..wei cai, zhi yun and the other one i cant rem..wei cai sang quite well.  And the second segment, Jim and Ric of Dreamz FM, together with Cai Li Lian (Ric's wife)  put up a performance from 9.30pm till 11pm.<br>They sang so many songs....so many nice songs..that made me feel so touched...When was the last time u ever feel touched?  To me, I think it's really quite long ago..nearly a year..tears welled up my eyes as they sang..<br><br>Some of the songs they sang were:<br><br>Ric - Stay, guang huai fang shi (wif lilian), Goodbye Girl (specially dedicated to Tang Yu Xuan), Jin sheng zhu ding (wif Lilian), Liu shui nian hua and some other english songs..<br><br>Jim - I muz say..he really has a great voice..so soothing...some of the songs that he sang v v well (to me, he sang better than the original singer, no offence) are Ai hen jian dan, Forever Love (Wang Li Hong's latest song). Hai kuo tian kong (Shin's song..very touching..he amde this song sounds more beautiful), Open your eyes (zhang hui mei..Tang Yu Xuan said he should try singing this song) and some others..)<br><br>Li lian - Ban xiu (2nd last song..she sang it very beautifully..if only JieQi was around..I rem he said he likes this song..always reminded him of Lilian coz they ever staged a play before (guan tou ai shen, if im not wrong).  Some other songs she sang were zou zai da jie de nv zi (yes! she has a sweet voice, but i still prefer sandy lam's version), Vincent, hao nv ren, duets with Ric as mentioned above etc..<br><br>They were so comical..Jim dropped his contact lens la, kept saying that the finger nail on his miiddle finger chipped la, said his eyes v dry la etc..Ric was kept making funny noises, saying all those 'sh|t', Lilian trying to warm up the people.  Indeed, it was full house..all the spare tables and chairs were used up.  Really worth going.  Actually wanted to go Budak Pantai's concert..but the tickets were all booked.  Thus, my fren suggested that we go to AQH.<br><br>They emphasized on the 'DA JIA CHANG' event that will be happening on 30 April..where everybody sing along..sing those Ming Yao..Quite nteresting..they said it would be from 7pm to 10 pm at Creative Technologies mphitheatre..but if response were overwhelming, they might even sing till midnite.  I'm quite interested in this..but I think it's better to go with someone who will appreciate Ming Yao and sing along..I duno many ming yaos la..but some like Rang ye qing qing ruo xia, shuo shi yi jiu..are my favs..tickets selling at $15.  Do check up Sistic for more information.  AQH is also selling the tix.  Well, if some of us here are interested, we can go together as a gathering.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>JieQi will be back today!  Hurray~~  Remember to tune in at 11pm~!</span></div>
