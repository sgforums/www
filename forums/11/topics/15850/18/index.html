            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it wasn't too difficult to guess that flyaway747 is a lady. Ladies are usually more careful about revealing too much about themselves. Of course, there are other shy guys around like tinker who doesn't really say too much about themselves. But well, the fact is, tinker IS a guy.<br><br>Born in the year that squeaks...There are two years that satisfy this condition in the Gregorian calendar. Year between the old and new generation. i wonder which year that is. Very cryptic eh? Oh well, that makes online life fun isn't it? Anyway, gals ought to be more careful about revealing personal details on the web. If we can have a fake Liu Jie Qi, what is stopping a maniac from pretending to be a fan of his? I might be one such individual for all you know... hiak hiak hiak  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>flyaway747 has a certain maturity about her. so does Hajime. It is not too difficult to guess which age group they belong to. Browniebaobao is clearly a student, untempered and untainted by the brutality of working life. Shervon, no need to guess, knew all about her back in uni. Still owe her an engine sunset.<br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>As for Browniebaobao's friend who decided to marry someone he didn't really love, let's just say that it's not the end 'cos people do grow to love each other given time.<br><br>Ahem... as for voice, I couldn't really hear "Peini" that well on air that day. She sounded kinda soft but from what I heard, she probably has a got a pretty nice and sweet voice. And... from the short short phone conversations with her, Shervon has got a pretty sweet voice too. She should go on and be a DJ leh...<br><br>Uh oh... at this rate this goes on, lots of guys will be joining this forum. But I think they'll be disappointed 'cos I get a feeling all of the ladies here are 'taken' already.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>If you wish to receive a free SMS service to inform you of Liu Jieqi being on air, feel free to drop me a mail and leave me your handphone number. But if you are a lady and don't feel too comfortable, you might want to get Shervon's help. I will usually sms her and from there, she might be able to forward the sms to you. Shervon is guaranteed a lady. You can have your money back if she turns out otherwise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>As for "people come, people go", It's kinda sad yah? I have made some really fantas friends and am glad I am still in touch with them. It is  honour and a privilege, not to mention a pleasure, to have such individuals in my life. But I really don't know how long that will last. At most, it is going to last for another 70 years? I mean, we all leave at some point in time. And with our departure, we leave our friends. The only consolation is that the friendship might still live on... in memories and all the things the friend has shared with us.<br><br>Don't know if you feel this way... but very often, your very best friends are those who show up only in times of trouble. They don't bother you that much on a day to day basis but the moment you are hit by a crisis, they appear from no where and help you out unconditionally. And, usually, these are the friends who will be your harshest critic because they mean well. They are the ones who help you grow. Friends who are fun or cool to hang out with usually don't last that long.<br><br>Ye Qing Zhu's song was nice and it reminded me of a nice song about friendship... Sky's "Qie Xing Qie Zhen Xi". Sky's rendition is better than Jeff's if you ask me. Jeff's version is shorter and the lyrics isn't complete. But Jeff has richer more emotions while Sky's sounds more sincere... it's really like a friend sending another off at the train station.</div>

I have different friends to go shopping, to the movies, to talk and go after idols..We just get in touch when we are free and want to catch up and have some some fun together.  </span><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: blue;">One can have many friends, but most of the time, there will only be a few true friends. </span><br></div>

Maybe yes, maybe not..<br><br>Is browniebaobao a local? She doesn't sound like one from her messages. But I may be wrong. Maybe it's because she is quite young, but yet she knows how to appreciate old songs and leads a rather independent life which made me feel that way. Most locals are not brought up that way, not even for those who live in hostels...or maybe I'm wrong.<br><br>And ya, I am a female, an old one to boot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> My nick do sound male, because it is supposed to be a male name  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  It means start, first in Jap. Not that I know Jap though, I derived it from my fave manga character, Hajime Kindaichi, or Jin Tian Yi...<br><br>I'm now reading Huang Lei's book. He is quite duo chou shan gan...haha, sounds like describing JieQi instead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I guess people who dabble in "di 8 yi shu" are like this? Huang Lei has a song called "Deng Deng Deng Deng", talking about the grand-daughter of a boatman fell in love with a urbanite, but they were not able to unite because during that time, marriages were supposed to be men dang hu dui - mu men pei mu men, zhu men pei zhu men (literally: wooden door matches wooden door, bamboo door matches bamboo door). She kept waiting for him (hence "Deng x 4") but that's only "kong deng dai", much to the heartache of her grandfather. The song title reminds me of "Ye Ye Ye Ye" which JieQi always plays. Only grouse is that he only plays Qi Qin's version but not Panda's. Panda's version is more complete, but I guess Qi Qin sings it better. Incidentally, Panda's "Bai Tuo" is my most favourite song...<br><br>Now I feel like reading Zhang Ai Ling's books, but I guess I have to finish what I have on hand first. I've a few journalistic novels by Zheng Hua Juan, the same lady who composed Zheng Yi's Tian Tang. If you all have any good books to recommend, please post them here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read most of Liang WenFu's books, if not all. "Ceng Jing" and "Zui Hou De Niu Zhe Shui" are one of his first few works. I still have the latter, but not the former which I borrowed from my school library a decade ago. He also has a book which I can't remember the title, but it is like "Alice in Wonderland", when he talked about some of his strange dreams and a cat which always appears in his dreams. Another book "Mei Pi Qing" is a collection of his works, most of them featured in ZaoBao. His more recent works include "Zi Ran Tong Chuang" which has some essays about his encounters with a girl who eventually became his wife. His latest "Zi Ran @ Wen Fu" (published by Popular) documents his more recent lives with his family and himself.  "Qi Shi Wo Shi Zai He Shi Guang Lian Ai" is his poem collection of his works in the 90s. One of the few "Cai Zi" we have in Singapore, who writes many good songs as well, though I was not exactly very keen on his recent compositions. "Qiu Xin Fu" was sung by Yu Guan Hua, Fang Wen Lin's husband. Very beautiful and imaginative lyrics.<br><br>browniebaobao: I didn't hear your voice on air, I just guessed from your messages. Anyway, it was good to hear JieQi on Sun afternoon while I was busy clearing my books. I just finished Huang Lei's book, and going on to Little Prince, the English one. It was shelved under the Children's section in the bookshop, but I think adults may have difficulties reading it instead. Children's minds are so simple and free from complications that they will understand the simple words and meanings, but adults tend to think more complex and try to analyse it. Why do that? Just enjoy the book as it is. Sometimes, learning to live and think more simply may lessen stress and troubles.<br><br>I like JiMi and Zhang Xiao Xian too. I read a bit of Li Bi Hua but her books are too sombre and overly pragmatic. For light reads, can try Ou Yang Lin (who is a doctor by profession, but his style is very light-humoured) and Xiao Ye (a very acclaimed novel and script writer, wrote many books circling his family). They are both Taiwanese novelists. Pardon me, but Shen Xue's style is too similar to another China novelist (Mian Mian?). A bit over hua zhong qu chong. Btw, they used to be very good friends, but after SX released her Shanghai Baby, they had a massive dispute which MM accused SX of stealing her ideas, etc. But their styles are at least a refreshing breakaway from the usual China authors. I am also starting on translated works, esp from Japanese authors. Their views are quite similar to us given the Asian connection, but they can think out of the box at the same time. Their perspective of life is always at another angle different from us. Though I think so far, I read more Japanese-translated mysteries than anything else. For me, "Chi Chuan Ci Lang", whatever his Japanese name maybe, ranks as the top name in Japanese mysteries, and just 2nd to my all-time favourite mystery author after Arthur Conan Doyle of Sherlock Holmes fame.<br><br>Huang Da Wei released a new album! Thought it will not be distributed here, so was quite glad to see it. Have not heard any songs from it, but I've always have faith in his work, so I'll definitely get his album - "TIME".<br><br>Enjoy the week as best you can...</div>

Let me check it out tmr and confirm with you...Shen Xue's works are a little ke1 huang4 sometimes...<br>Zhang Man Juan..., JieQi recommended this book years ago..and even mailed me a few pages..still in the box where i keep letters now..haha..It's quite a nice book ya!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </span></div></blockquote>I think I'm going nuts, really made so many mistakes, so many thanks for pointing them out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Firstly, Shanghai Baby is by Wei Hui, another Chinese author. Anyway she is as good as a one-book wonder. I read another book by Shen Xue which I can't remember the title, I only remember there is trails of blood on the cover picture... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>And yes, it's "San Wen @ Wen Fu", I mixed it up with his previous book, duh...But frankly, I still prefer his previous works, esp Zui Hou De Niu Che Shui, Ceng Jing, and the book on the cat and his dreams...I still can't recall the title. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The &lt;44th sunset&gt; which you mentioned, I've not seen it before. Is it a Chinese or English version? Who is the translator? I'll add it to my shopping list for the upcoming bookfair  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I only read a few Yi Shu books before. Nothing too dramatic, but I think a good novel does not need to be so, her books are the best examples. I quite like "Liu Jin Sui Yue". It was later shot into a movie featuring Maggie Cheung and Cherie Chung.<br><br>Ahem, my nick is actually derived from Jin Tian Yi. His full name is Jin Tian Yi Yi, or Hajime Kindaichi. He is a manga character, not novel... Another detective manga character I like is Detective Conan, the teenage detective who was shrunk to a pri sch student after being forced to eat something devised by the "bad guys".<br><br>Japanese mystery novels seem to be quite well-written, because the Chinese versions - which I'm sure some meanings have been lost during translations - already interest me immensely. The Japanese mystery author which I mentioned previously "Chi Chuan Ci Lang", his Japanese name is Akagawa Jiro. He has 2 sets of detective characters which appear in different novels. The more famous one is a cat - San1 Mao2 Mao1 (literally: 3-hair cat). It always helps a very kind and honest (sometimes a bit naive) policeman solve cases in his cat ways - eg. loitering around a murder location until the policeman notices something - a strand of hair for eg. - which he failed to see the first time around. The other set of characters: 3 schooling who like mysteries very much and form an amateur detective group. Together with another policeman (who secretly likes one of them), they manage to solve many cases which the police failed to crack. There was a Japanese TV drama which was based on the 3 sisters - San1 Jie3 Mei4 Zhen1 Tan4 Tuan2 (literally: 3-sister investigators).</div>
