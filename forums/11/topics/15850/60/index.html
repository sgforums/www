            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">I'm so high after the Euphoria '04 concert!<br><br>Well, supposed to start at 5pm ya?   We waited till 6pm then djs Jean Danker, Carrie chong from Perfect 10 (not sure correct or not) came out..intro a bit then gave us a great shock when they say that the first group that perform is DJ Zetan SPORE...Which would last 2 hours (Faint!)  To be honest, I duno how to appreciate their music..they said they are LIVE..but hey...it's neither techno nor new age ya..well..seeing 2 men on the stage, jumping away and getting very high...taking off their shirt..hmm..din get the crowd high tho..only minority was shaking...most of the people sat on the ground...and whenever we heard them say 'thank you', people were cheering and hoping that they would leave the stage...but gosh!  Our ears were tortured for 2 long hours!  And there I was, stoning away...<br><br>Well, I would say that the next 5 hours was great!  Bukoh Mary joined in to be DJ ard 8pm..<br><br>I went there specially to see MLTR, Lena Park and All Four One...and they were really cool!!!  All Four One melted my heart with all their songs..especailly their accappella, and <i>!!!  All of us were swawying our hands up high..me and frens swayed the lightsticks kekeke ^O^<br><br>Lena Park...never failed to impress me...impress me with her English, her sweet yet powerful voice...her performance!  I like her   all along..and glad she sang it...also ...and u noe what?  She sang !!!!  It was really fantastic...made the song so beautiful..think i will find a way to download it someday.  ^O^<br><br>Shinhwa, Machi really danced well (that's of course)...and they had the most supporters i would say...not to mention MLTR (The last group to perform).  They really sweat...too hot?  Hmm..Some members of Machi even took off their clothes...threw to the audience..showing their 6 pac..haha...Well, they showed a video of SHINWHA..gee...so cute neh..haha...they each got their own charm..Well, the big guy in Machi..duno his name..heard pple calling him xiao zhu?  Me not srue..his voice really very nice..he sang solo...new song ..check it out ya...I feel that his R&amp;B is really good...juz like David Tao.<br><br>Palmy started her performance with the song..famous song...but she is the original singer and version of the chinese song ..this lady in black...gee..shocked me by throwing her bottle of mineral water at the crowd in front.  Gee...Camermen started to take out their tissues and cover their camera..haha..<br><br>The band that rock me away was none other than Michael Learns To Rock!<br>10 Years ever since they last came to spore...I really din want to go..I stayed on till 1 am..die die wana hear them sing ...actually the motive that i went to the concert was to see them perform LIVE.  Feel so great that I could sing almost all their songs...and it's gd to see so many people stayed till the end ya..MLTR even sang their new christmas song..and requested to record it..and will be shown on MTV Asia.  Sounds really new to me hehe..Some of the songs they sang were , , , <i> (not sure abt the title, but it's the eng version of Jacky CHeung's ),  and the song i die die wana hear....at the very last..." i dun want to say goodbye to you.." yup, that's !<br><br>Well...look at the time..im still so high..everything was quite alright..except that some pple got drunk and started swearing and disturbing pple...girls especially..I was standing so near to them..so scared...they were talking very loudly, very action while singing MLTR songs...smoking. shouting etc...lucky never disiao me..hehe<br><br>That's about all.  That day I went Techpoint..din get to see JQ..However, last night, I dreamt of me talking on the phone with him...called his office that is..haha...guess I missed his voice too much..<br><br>Before I end...how's respond about the outing?  I need your feedback ya...Who's on?  Tinker suggested 5 Dec right?  Invite JQ and if possible, Bukoh Mary..Quick quick!!  It's Oct liao...if really wana meet up, then got to grab them fast!  Hahaha..</i></i></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HI all,<br><br>am back! been busy. Gosh....I have really lost touch. Just a while ago, I was still desperately tryign to remember my password.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hope all are doing well and staying healthy. Sad to know that Superman has left us. We are all just as vulnearble, aren't we?<br><br>Anywayz, on a brighter note, I attended the 933's 2046 premiere at GV Grand on Monday night. Gosh...I have been waiting for like 5 years? Was anybody else in this forum there?<br><br>Anywayz, the usual stars came along. I was most happy to see Eric Khoo the director. And Pang Ling Ling...gosh...she is really beautiful.<br><br>Now, back to 2046. Wong Kar Wai's movie usually takes repeated viewings to fully appreciate it. My usual practise is to take it on its surface 1st, totally immersing myself in the mood and music created by him.<br><br>On my 2nd take, I'll really pay attention to the details and the dialogue to link the whole movie together. 2046 requires a lot fo attention from the viewer. Not only do u have to link the whole movie together, you have to link this movie to his 2 previous movies "In the mood for love" and "Days of being wild".<br><br>Being such a big fan, I was very worried that I may over-anticipate and come out disappointed. I do not deny being disappointed when I 1st saw his previous few movies. Its only after I see them again and again that I come to appreciate them. So for 2046, I will say that I am not fully satisfied yet. If for nothing, Tony was very funny and Zhang Zhi Yi was very pitiful.<br><br>But wait...think I'm boring you guys already. This is after all a 933 forum and not a Wong Kar Wai one. Just like to know, how many of you are Wong Kar Wai's fans? Who intend to watch this film?<br><br>and just before I sign off, let me leave you one of the phrase found in the official website www.wkw2046.com/glass1XGA.html<br><br>"We cannot leave our past. The only thing we can do is to hope that one of these days, our past will leave us."<br><br>Strangely this line was missing from the Singapore version of the movie. I hope there will be a director's cut version DVD out soon.<br><br>Meanwhile, with regards to the meeting, I should be ok. Cya all!<br><br>wisefool</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strangely, talking about the past, I was watching Sarah Jessica Parker's SATC last night (yes, THAT HBO show), and the episode "Ghost Town" was talking about "the past" and referring it to being haunted by a ghost. In it, she told us that the past is never "past" until you can truly face it bravely, accept it then release it, then only will the ghost be exorcised and the past be really "past". E.g. when one leaves a relationship without properly ending it, this past will haunt the exs like a ghost. Only by grasping it by the neck and clarifying it with each other will the whole thing be "case closed", and that both will no longer be haunted by it and are now able to really move it ahead.</div>
