For me, I'm still suffering from occasional bouts of bad migraines. Probably because I had been working late the past few weeks and rushing out presentations after presentations... When weekends came, I really collapsed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  I was struggling to keep awake on Sat to listen to JieQi but I was so drowsy after taking med that I fell asleep, though ying ying yue yue can still hear the songs and JieQi's voice...woke up when I heard Zhang JingXuan's "Duan Dian". Good song, like it more and more with every listen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Jay Chow releasing his new album on 31 July. Hu Yan Bin just released his new album in Taiwan (I think), so hope it'll come this way soon. He has a duet "Di Yi Ci" with Ronald Cheng (whom I like very much too...his voice and songs, not his violent behaviour, that is  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ), as well as a new song called "Lao Ba, Ni Bie Zhuang Ku". Think people are bound to compare this song with THAT "father" song of Jay Chow  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Oh, Jay Chou's new song also has the "father" theme...haha, though I believe it is supposed to mean more like the movie's "Godfather"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>David Tao (*SCREAMZ!* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) is coming S'pore for a concert soon, around Sep, so gotta save up for that!!<br><br>I also don't know who MZ is...what's the full name? Jiyou I have some impression, because the nick was quite melodic. And hihi, wisefool, welcome to the JieQi supporter family...haha, sounds like some welfare group  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> No lah, we are just a congregation of listeners who like JieQi's program). It's great talking about his program and the songs he plays, you know? hehe...<br><br>Anyway, I watched a bit of an interview of Ji Mi on Phoenix TV (or was it AZIO?) yesterday. The interview allowed me to have a really much better understanding of him and his works. He suffered from some really serious illness in '95 and he nearly gave up hope of living. He is now recuperating, though the trauma is still shadowing him. He used to have a very pessimistic view of life, but after his illness, he began to treasure and appreciate better what he has now. "Di Xia Tie" was representative of how he felt when he was ill.<br><br>I guess many times in life, we take things and people for granted far too often. We assume that they are always there for us, so we always neglect or even ignore them whilst pursuing other materialistic things in life. When they are gone suddenly and we start to feel the loss, we will blame on other factors (no time, no opportunity, etc) that prevent us from spending more time or efforts on them, when we should actually be blaming ourselves for not cherishing them in the first place.<br><br>Haha, talked so much crap...really is ill until "tao nao pai" (head spoilt). Hope HanMing has a great trip back to Amsterdam and that JieQi will continue to play us great songs one after another. I'm still here, you know?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>
