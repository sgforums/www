            <div class='col-md body'>Watched some parts of the NKF program yesterday. Quite unhappy at the way they risked their celebs like that. I am referring to Zoe Tay's segment. I think that required not only observation and good memory, but also some luck. Of course I suspect there will be some trick involved, but still I expect them to think of better and relatively safer than that. Also are Tay Ping Hui's segment on the needle bed, Chris Lee's "ba guan" stunt, and also last week's stunts by Ho Yeow Sun and Sharon Au. But I also had to recognise that people are so "sadistic" that they will only donate when they watch such dangerous stunts (as evidenced by the huge leaps in number of calls during such stunts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )  I also noticed this year's event was laced with extra NGs drama element (to get sympathy votes?) and constant goading, mostly from Cao Qi Tai. That is very Taiwanese hosting, which garners a lot of sympathy, but also cynicism from some (like me)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> .<br><br>There had been high-profile debates recently over whether NKF is solely dominating a huge share of the charity pie with this kind of tie-ups. I hope TV stations can rotate tie-ups with different charities to benefit even wider range of people. Or at least with organisations which benefit more charities rather than NKF which is solely for kidney patients. I see NKF get millions of funds from these events (and the S$189m in reserves of course), while smaller charities suffer just because they don't get exposure, and also only $0.52 cts per dollar goes to patients only, which is very low as compared to the average $0.80-$0.90 for charities  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  (from what I read from papers).<br><br>Not that I have personal agenda lah, but it does make me upset that even charities have such politics... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can't help but agree with Hajime... while the intent is noble, the means are a little questionable. Just hope nobody gets hurt... a single life is more precious than all the treasures of the entire universe.<br><br>Notice that the level of difficulty and danger of the charity stunts keeps escalating each round? The Ren Ci show where Mingyi priest tried rapelling down the side of Suntec seemed to have sparked off a new type of competition between the two TV stations. (Not pointing the fault at anyone... I am sure the Ren Ci show was purely for charity and charity only. This is just an observation.)<br><br>It seems that TV competition has taken on greater heights on newer fronts... no pun intended.<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>Remember Xue Sushan? The lady who fell from her Sky Commander stunt and lost her sense of smell as a result?<br><br>Perhaps the senior echelon of NKF might want to do some of the stunts themselves, like the way Mingyi priest did... after all, it is for charity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">If it's charity, people should donate if they are really willing and sincere to, right?  However, sad to know that people donate bcos they want to win the attractive prices!  I think they are very clever lor..those videos and songs playing at the right time to gain people's sympathy..and those dangerous stunts..dun see a need for them to risk their lives!  However, I believe they had plans on what to do la..Sharon Au's one really made me OUCH for her..Sun too..Tay Ping Hui..Melody..Zoe's made me sweat for her.  wah...Is it that the audiences are very bian tai or the management are simply out of their mind or inhuman?  Really dun understand!  Ren Ci is much better ba..tho I also dun agree to the special performance by the Ming Yi da shi or whatsoever..walked down a tall building..but at least, they dun do so much advertising and marketing gimmicks.<br><br>Very HOT today!  Angry ar..very irritated.  Received calls at 3 plus..midnite..I was sexually harrassed.  Idiot!  Kept calling and calling..made me so scared that I shut off my hp.  Somemore, it's prvate number!  I duno who's the idiot!!!  Very sickening man!  I told him to go to hell.  Anyone got any idea to help me or not?  My fren told me to divert call to police  station.  I wonder if it is possible for me to track down the number of the caller.  I have a feeling that he will call again tonight lor.  Really so tired today..din wana go school..very lethargic..not enough sleep.  So scary and horny man..panting away at the other end of the phone..I need advice!  Please teach me what to do.  If this persists, I'm sure I will make a police report.  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can try in future to let a male (father, brother, male friend) to take the call if you suspect it's from that pervert. Let them answer the call and ask them to use any vulgarities they can on him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . If not, refer him to police. If he calls everyday around the same time, tell that to the police, and let them hold your SIM card for that period of time while you use a temporary one. If that guy calls again, he will kana the police. Even if private no. not able to track, at least he will be deterred from calling you again. Try contact your operator and ask if they can offer assistance for such cases as well or not.<br><br>Heard about 1/3 Singaporeans have Giro contribution to NKF every month. Don't know is it a opt-out or what, but I certainly have no recollection if I have to make the same monthly payment. I will go check and if it is, I will opt out. Not that I don't want to help, but for charity, shouldn't it be a volunteer basis? I am already regularly donating to Red Cross and other charities, I want to be aware and keep track of what charities I am donating to.<br><br>If NKF is a caring charity, given its success, it should also be more magnanimous in helping out other charities. Like giving guidance on how to organise effective fund-raising events, etc.</div>

Before that, my lecutrer came to tell us that she wanted to talk to her.

I told my lecturer, "You listen, you see, but pls dun interefere."  She said OK.<br><br>So we stayed back after our class and my lecturer arranged a meeting room for us.  We were so called 'conferencing".  She dared to put words into my mouth.  I was very very angry, my expressions changed, my words were real straight forward.

Coz few girls were already having the runs and everybody were packing up..yet she was searching for that cheap face towel.  Hahaha!~<br><br>I juz came home..though still feeling breathing difficulty, but I'm happy that this thing is cleared and it is made obvious that she and I cannot be frens anymore.  My lecturer even advised us not to keep in contact with her after graduation.  She said right now in school, see each other, just smile.  Then I said 'What if I simply can't smile to her?"  Haha..she also bobian..Let me be..then after that she told me 'I dinoe that you can also speak like that.  I knew you were going to erupt."  Think she got a shock..just like my frens.  Coz I simply hate it, dun like people to put words into my mouth.  I said I DID NOT say that, and I'm very firm about that.  Dun think you can trick me into admitting.<br><br>LOL bought durian bobo chacha home to enjoy..give myself a treat after so many things happened.  Finally I have made things clear.</span></div>

There's this stupid fool who believes her story and posted it in friendster to WARN us!  And it so happens that this guy was my buddy's ex classmate and someone my buddy acted as messenger, passed msg between us.  This guy dared us (6 girls) "backstabbers!  My jie dun owe u a single shit1  Got guts come out and talk face to face!...go f*** yourselves!  Incorrigible bitches!"  Very hot when I saw this and I dared him to come and talk to me.  Idiot!  Mind his own business la!  He dinoe anything yet still act hero wor~ What a joke!  And when I told my buddy about it, he said he would apologise to me and delete the testimonial in friendster.  (still gave me the very suck up attitude, not apologetic at all.)  My girls want to confront him leh...My classmate also suggested to let a lecturer know and get him sacked of the community.<br><br>But my buddy told him it's not necessary and then said she want me to learn to respect people.  Hey, testimonial can awlays rewrite, and then who din respect who in the first place?  So angry with my buddy, still not talking to her.  &gt;&lt;"<br><br>That day went OG Orchard Point, got the Djs to sign on my CD..hehe..I had ice cream on the way there..so dirtied my tee shirt..and arghh..went to wash.  then sui~ My bag's colour run off and got my pink tee to be pink and dark blue..no chance but to clean again and get books to hide that big spot..alamak..so I got my frens to help me get the autographs!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be angry with your buddy lah. Think she wants to "da shi hua xiao, xiao shi hua wu" ba. I used to be abit like you, everything also want to confront, but as I grow older, realise what is called "yuan yuan xiang bao he shi liao". If start something, will never end esp with this kind of chow kuan people. In fact, if you engage in some quarrel with these people, later others will think you are like them, then lagi lugi le...<br><br>The same way you dealt with that idiot charbor, just ignore. If people misunderstand, explain as patiently as you can. People will respect you for being magnanimous, and more likely to believe you are the victim since you display such "kuan hong da liang" in contrast to that b1tchy girl and stupid guy. If they don't believe, there's nothing you can do too, right? Don't be too bothered by people's misled opinions and make yourself upset for nothing. Just be yourself and "wen xin wu kui" jiu ke yi le!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah, they so lai pi one ah. Say this kind of things can check one, why not they report to Friendster? Say if they don't dare report means xin xiu, that they lie and accuse people. Dare them to do it lah! If not, you can report user to Friendster for defamation. If they try to accuse you, say that since they PROMISED to delete testi liao, you won't waste your efforts to hack their a/c and that you have better things to do. Unless they are the ones who don't want to delete then just anyhow think up of some lies to accuse you.<br><br>After so many incidents, it will be a surprise people choose to believe them over you, unless they also stupid idiots like them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest Browniebaobao,<br><br>I may not be able to understand completely what you are going through but do have some thoughts to share. If anything, I feel indignant. And you have every reason to feel the same way.<br><br>You will agree with me that life is short... it is too short to waste it on trivialities. You probably have much more important, more constructive things to do than to be embroiled in a tussle like that. Youth is precious, waste it not on uselss pursuits or aimless people.<br><br>I know it is not easy to walk away from an argument, especially one where you have justice on your side. But once you have made your point, silence is perhaps the best response. Stick to the facts and if the other party chooses not accept it, then walk away 'cos there really isn't anything much you can do. There is no point in talking when the other party refuses to listen.<br><br>On the bright side, once you overcome this, you would have grown tremendously from this experience.<br><br>Remember... you have no time for fools... life is just too short for that.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Tinker<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Thanks tinker and Hajime.  I told my frens to let the matter rest and keep a low profile for the time being.  No point finding out who did it coz anyway it's taht stupid fool's account and it's none of our business.  As for the accusation, our conscience is clear, we did not do anything of that sort and we are not afraid of accepting any investigation.  Indeed I have more important things to attend to.  This ah lian is just finding troubles for us to divert our attention and maybe set up another plot and make us fall for it.  We believe that what comes round goes round, she will get her retribution one day.  I just want to concentrate on my studies and graduate in another few weeks' time..then say byebye to that sickening face.  Gees..<br><br>Anyway today my lecturer came to talk to 2 of my girlfrens, asking how's that matter going on.  My frens said 'It's settled last week but some pple juz like to create more problems and dun want to let it pass.  Feels very yuan1 wang4 to be accused for doing something that we have not done.'  It's comforting to know that our lecturer believes that we are innocent.  I juz told my classmate yesterday, I take her as invisible, juz a spirit doing evil things around.<br><br>Haiz another building collapsed today?  1 North Buona Vista.  What's happening?  Haiz..<br><br>Dinoe 933 has been giving andy lau's movie  premiere tix for tonight.  I heard it this morning at 10 plus and couldnt call in..then was so hungry, stomach protesting that I went to eat..haiz...then heard they were giving out tix at Shaw House..but I was in school..arghhhhhhhhh I missed it leh!  This time my frens din tell me about this...so sad..  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have not been listening to 933 for a long while...but heard "Jiang Hu" is banned in China (are we surprised anymore?). Must have struck a nerve with the gahmen there.<br><br>Saw the trailer for "Koma", looks thrilling, but quite hysterical leh, with all the blood...*shivers*<br><br>So far, 2 men died in the Ayer Rajah incident. Really upset about the way things are handled in construction sites like this. Have safety precautions at construction sites been compromised in recent days?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  Although the authorities said it has nothing to do with the Circle Line, the similarity is that it's also the reinforcement structures which gave way this time. Seems that the pre-work done before the actual construction was quite inadequate. Sometimes when I see this kind of things happen, all the problems I have been complaining about seem to diminish in importance. Why trouble myself with all the hassles at work when I have a choice to live a happier life? Hmm, I must keep this macro-perspective in mind...</div>
