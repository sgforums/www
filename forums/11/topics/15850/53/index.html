The special guest on that day was Pin3 Guan4. He sang a few songs such as: "Ai Qing Bu Neng Zuo Bi Jiao"; "Can't help falling in love"; and "When i fall in love" - singing and playing his guitar at the same time. Hm...reminds me of JQ's prog again!!<br><br>Fei4 Yu4 Qing1 commented that Pin guan is a very patient guy. The progm recording started late that day, but Pin Guan came early. The entire team was rather apologetic twds the delay, but he just eased the situation by saying "It's ok". What an understanding person!!</div>
