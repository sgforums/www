Someone commented that they dun like this particular DJ and we all started discussing who our favourite was. Guess what? Everybody's favourite is JQ! One of my friend said he has a very nice voice, just enuf of Ci and Xiong in it. Another said although she liked his voice, she finds his choice of songs very sappy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>well..... nevertheless, i was listening in today again.<br><br>wisefool</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good to see zilchster again...<br><br>anyway, was in a CD shop and I heard this Okinawan tune with Liang Jingru singing to it. The song is Â²Â»Ã�Ã«Ã‹Â¯  with the original Japanese title as ÂµÂºÃŸÃ‚. It's a very nice tune and when you listen to it performed on the Okinawan instruments with a group of Okinawans singing to it, it's kinda majestic and you know that the song is about waves and ocean. (Maybe Hajime can give us more details on this song.) As for Liang Jingru's version, it is very refreshing. Take note of the chorus... the part where she sings "bu4 xiang3 shui4...", it sounds pretty powerful too.<br><br>Go listen to it if you can...</div>
