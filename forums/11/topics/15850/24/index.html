            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Hajime,<br><br>er...can't really remember...might be my mum who tuned into 958 and I happened to pass by. Alot of my friends like "Ni de bao bei" too... Its one of those very "Xing Fu" song... so blissful. Another one of her song that I remembered I like was "Shui zhai qiu tian jian dao wo de xin" "Who in autumn, found my heart"... although I can hardly remember how it sound like anymore.<br><br>Chen Sheng! My fave too....his song is always so melancholic. Was kind of sad when he got beaten up last time....hope he recovers fast and make us those beautiful songs again soon. "kite", "Touring alone", "Leave the sadness for myself", "One night in Beijing", "The house of missing people" , like Li Zhong Sheng, he is one of the few songwriters that can so accurately translate emotions to words.<br><br>I can't remember which but when i first started listening to chinese pop, it was either Zhen Yi "xiang Fei" or Eric Moo and the Three little eagles' "fei yang de qing chun"...that was like primary school? Gosh...they all have the word "fly" in the title!!! Seems like since young, I'm already longing to fly...<br><br>hmmm...my friends just sent me an email containing some quotes...you might have heard of them before but for those hwo have not, they are quite beautiful...<br><br>"It takes a minute to have a crush on someone<br>An hour to like someone n a day to love someone<br>But it takes a LIFETIME to forget someone "<br><br>"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that took our breath away"<br><br>Have a great week ahead everybody....we'll meet on air again next Saturday!<br><br>wisefool<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chen Sheng never gets the same kind of recognition for his music like Jonathan Lee did, perhaps his works are not as mainstream, but I like his music nonetheless. His books are rather good too, he co-wrote one recently with Cao Qi Tai called "Rang Wo Qian Zhe Ni De Shou". The book is like a compilation of letters they wrote to each other over the years, and compiled during the time when Chen Sheng was recuperating after his attack. Pretty good read, the way they "shi ying xiong, zhong ying xiong" was apparent in the book. But his music is really so so so nice! He has a yearly concert in Taiwan where he will count down the new year with his fans.

How I hope my siblings will go out in the afternoon, then i can record in a peaceful environment..Scared of them..like to play music with a very loud volume..very irritating!<br><br>Here is something interesting:<br><br>It's going to be a rare sight so remember - <strong>don't miss the opportunity<br><br>to view 2 moons in the sky -&gt; 27 AUGUST 2003 </strong><br><br>Never again in your lifetime will the Red Planet be so spectacular!<br><br>This month and next month the Earth is catching up with Mars,an<br><br>encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between the two<br><br>planets in recorded history. The next time Mars may come this close is in<br><br>2287.<br><br>Due to the way Jupiter's gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its<br><br>orbit,astronomers can only be certain that Mars has not come this close to<br><br>Earth in the last 5,000 years but it may be as long as 60,000 years.<br><br>The encounter will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within<br><br>34,649,589 miles and will be (next to the moon) the brightest object in the<br><br>night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will appear 25.11 arc<br><br>seconds wide.<br><br>At a modest 75-power magnification Mars will look as large as the full<br><br>moon to the naked eye. Mars will be easy to spot. At the beginning of<br><br>August, Mars will rise in the east at 10p.m. and reach its azimuth at about<br><br>3 a.m. By the end of August when the two planets are closest, Mars will<br><br>rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12:30 a.m. That's<br><br>pretty convenient when it comes to seeing something that no human has seen<br><br>in recorded history. So mark your calendar at thebeginning of August to see<br><br>Mars grows progressively brighter and brighter throughout the month.<br><br>Share with friends, children and grandchildren and with everyone you know, as No one alive today will ever see this again.<br><br></span></div>
