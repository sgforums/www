            <div class='col-md body'>I don't have access to PC over weekends, so naturally I missed JieQi's programs because I didn't see the messages in here until now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Both weekend afternoons I tuned off the radio disappointedly because of no JieQi, little did I know he was on at night. Now I must make sure my radio is tuned to 933 on weekend nights so as not to miss his programs.<br><br>browniebaobao: the song by Sky Wu is called "Shen F Da Diao Xing Ban". It's a song he wrote to dedicate to his most beloved granny. I remember it's in the Zui Ai Shi Ni album. Anyway he released his latest album and it may be his last album before he leaves the scene for good. Apparently he have had enough of the music scene which he felt is getting too ridiculous to stay on. If he decides to "retire", he may leave Taiwan altogether and go to US to continue with his music studies and work there after that. If this happens, the Chinese music scene will lose a top composer/singer. I started supporting him since his debut album Ai Yao Zen Me Shou, which he released around 14/15 years ago. Gosh, it was THAT LONG AGO...If he decides to leave, I as a Sky Wu fan wish him all the best in his future undertakings. But I'll definitely miss him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by browniebaobao:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: indigo;"><br>Star search just ended few mins ago...Disappointed with the results..I support M3 all along..Feel that he is really good in every aspect..Why did M6 win?

He used to release albums under the name of Luo Wei Xiong, wonder if anyone remembers? That kind of teeny-booper albums...naturally it didn't sell well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Anyway, I guess the biggest pitfall faced by local contestants is always the same - speech and compering. Just listen to the short speech by Cui Peng after he won. Eloquent and diplomatic - dian dao wei zhi. How are the locals going to pit against that?? Anyway, though I like M3 too, I knew he wouldn't win. Besides speech, his age is also a big stumbling block. His 29 yrs of age is a definite disadvantage against Cui Peng's 23. MediaCorp will not fork out money to groom someone that old. Notice that many of their stars started young. Those who blossomed at older age, eg. Huang BiRen, is by virtue of their own charisma and acting experience rather than by the company's grooming.</div>

Why don't you drop Shervon or Browniebaobao an email with your handphone number? In that way, they can SMS you when Jieqi is on air. I always SMS Shervon (both her numbers) when Jieqi is on air. You know, we only get about 52 appearances of Jieqi a year and missing out once is like 2%. Miss five and it is 10%.<br><br>And, you don't know who long his part time stint is going to last.<br><br><blockquote><strong>...Anyway he released his latest album and it may be his last album before he leaves the scene for good. .... But I'll definitely miss him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></strong></blockquote>I didn't know that... if that's his last album, it will be tragic. Personally, I don't really support Sky the way I would lay my life down for Sandy but the fact is, Sky has given us pretty good songs over the years. Sky wrote many songs for other singers and they were instant hits. His songs can be addictive. My favourite is still Qie Xing Qie Zhen Xi.<br><br>Oh yes, the only thing about Sky I can't agree with is his former status as an unwed father.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Yeah, I like M3 Scott Li Qi Yang too. He used to release albums under the name of Luo Wei Xiong, wonder if anyone remembers? </strong></blockquote>Okay.. now that you mention. This is pretty impressive. Hajime has this sharpness for the entertainment scene. I bet she can remember the zu3 ta3 ge1 for Luo Wei Xiong's debut album.<br><br>Jieqi: if you have a position for a super snooper to keep you posted of the going on's of the entertainment scence, consider Hajime.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Anyway, I guess the biggest pitfall faced by local contestants is always the same - speech and compering. Just listen to the short speech by Cui Peng after he won. Eloquent and diplomatic - dian dao wei zhi. How are the locals going to pit against that?? </strong></blockquote>Oh yes... this happens when you spend more than 80% of your class room time in English and the remaining in Chinese. Unless of course, you are in a SAP school where the ratio might hit 60% with some luck.<br><br>BUT, that's not the end of the world lah. Just give them some time and learn the ropes. They won't be too bad.<br><br><blockquote><strong>MediaCorp will not fork out money to groom someone that old. Notice that many of their stars started young. </strong></blockquote>Yerp... they have to protect their 'investment' so...<br><br>Anyway, notice how in recent years MediaCorp tend to go for lady actresses with the physical attractiveness? Back in those days, when Xiang Yun was the hottest babe in Caldecott Hill, the criteria was more the ability to act. Nowadays, when Xiang Yun usually ends up with Auntie roles, it's about looks and goods.<br><br>Oh well, it beats the other TV stations that starts off with skimpily clad girls or roping in well-endowed ladies.</div>

Xie4 Hou4 by Liu Lan Ting - A little square picture book with some words. but find the book pretty interesting...<br>2. Chen Sheng's The floating wood of brussels<br>3. Lonely DJ Diary by Ke1 Zhi4 Yuan4<br>4. Rene Liu's Yi Ge Ren De KTV<br><br>Find the 3rd book pretty interesting... quite like short stories... very touching...<br><br>as for the Star Search M3 guy, his lack of family support may be due to another reason which I think it is, but dun think it is right of me to mention it here in case some eyes stumble on it and cause damage to his career.<br><br>Hajime and anyone else who would like to be notified if Jieqi is on air:<br>email me.</div>

Hehe..Heard you last week..I was waiting for my fren at the mrt station..She was late for 1 hour..so i Listened to your program till 8pm..Played the casette tapes (recording of your program for last week) from 11am-3pm..so Enjoy..haha..<br><br>Enjoying my cup of hot milo in this rainy day... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Heard what you said over the radio.  Sometimes time is not enough ba...Always busy with work, with things and finally don't know why you were so busy and whether it's worth it.   Hope you will have a chance to meet up with Han Ming soon before he leaves again.  Well, hopefully you can make the arrangements quick and get him on air next Sat.<br><br>Well..one week has passed and I have been so lag...Laze around..really nothing much to do..Back to school for one week..still the same..have tutorials, projects etc &gt;&lt;"<br><br>Somehow, I feel quite numb towards certain things.  When misunderstandings happened and some of my frens got really angry, i felt nothing.  Good or bad? When people tell me about the death of the Iran twins, i did not feel sad or anything..just take it  easy...Wonder what's wrong with me..<br><br>Anyway..Dun wana think too much.  Enjoy listening to the nice songs in this nice nice weather... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>
