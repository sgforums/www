            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Anyway, Jieqi was on air on Sat 15 Dec from 4 - 8pm He wasn't feeling well but went on. As usual, his show was super. He didn't mention when he'll be on air next weekend but this is what I usually do, in pseudocode:<br><br>If (Sat and time is 12 noon) then tune in to 933. If (Jieqi is hosting), carry on listening. If (Jieqi is not hosting), switch on on radio at 4 pm. If (Jieqi is hosting), carry on listening.<br><br>Repeat for Sunday regardless of whether Jieqi was on air the day before.<br><br>*** You can bet your last dollar I will be doing this on this coming Saturday.<br><br>Sherv: sorry for the late reply. I didn't see your message till today. If you want, drop me an email and let me know your contacts so that I can inform you when Jieqi is on air.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those Jieqi fans out there, take note...<br><br>For the weekend of 22/23 Dec, Jieqi was on air on Sun 23 Dec and NOT Sat 22 Dec. Who knows what might happen this weekend.?<br><br>Wished he has some means to let us know when he will be on air. Maybe he can help by posting here? (It would be better if he can be on air for BOTH Saturday and Sunday.)<br><br>I have recently converted a person who shares the same lab to listen to Jieqi. You guys should try listening to Jieqi on a SUNDAY afternoon in lab while doing your project.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Jieqi was on air on Sat 29 Dec 2001. A listener wrote in and recommended him to read a book entitled "Tuesday With Morrie". Okay... this is one book I think everybody should read; in fact, MUST read.<br><br>Sherv: Not sure if you tuned in but I think Jieqi mentioned that he received a letter from you. What's the address to send if I want to write a snail mail to him? How should I address it?<br><br>Personally, I would like to drop him an email.... But well, never mind.</div>

By the time I got to my lab, I have misseed 2 hours of Jieqi program. *gosh* But well, at least I get the to listen to the 'best' one hour from 6-7 pm and after that, it is the live hour.<br><br>Really hope that Jieqi is seeing all these.
