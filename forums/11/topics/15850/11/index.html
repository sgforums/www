            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>There is going to be a very interesting chinese orchestra concert-.<br>The Butterfly Lovers Concerto performed by a chinese orchestra, with a violin soloist.<br><br>This concert will be quite light as they will be playing music from<br>West Side Story and more than half the concert will be very light/familiar music.<br><br>Date: 08/11(fri) , 09/11(sat).<br>Venue: singapore conference hall<br>Pricing: $ 12, 16, 19, .....<br><br>Programme details:<br>www.sco-music.org.sg/chinese/events/series_master_prog9.html<br>www.sco-music.org.sg/english/events/series_master_prog9.html<br><br>---------------------------<br><br>The Butterfly Lovers Concerto (Liangzhu) is one of my favourite pieces of symphonic music. You can actually 'hear' their love story unfold. Through this piece, one can really understand how powerful music can be, even without words.<br><br>For those who are new to symphonic music or the Chinese orchestra, this is a good concert to try. Liangzhu is  a very captivating piece. You should enjoy it. And Chinese orch is not just for the middle-aged and above.<br><br>Some of my friends shun classical/symphonic/orchrestra music without even trying. They just say it is too 'cheem'. Well, how do you know that you will not like it if you have not given it a chance?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True true... we are actually past the age of camping at airports and memorising the shoe size of our idols. (Not that I ever indulged in that. Didn't even have enough memory for the periodic table and maths formulae, let alone details of celebs. School camps are bad enough; the airport tend to be very cold.)<br><br>Anyways, I just find it a little 'scary' that every week we tune in and hears Jieqi's voice and kinda have an inkling of how he looks like. But beyond that, we know next to nothing about Jieqi unless he mentions it. It's a bit like online chatting, emails and web postings. You know roughly who is on the other end but just do not know for sure.<br><br>Anyway, weekend afternoons of Xiaobing and the Mian Yang Gong Can Dang is quite nice too. She aired a couple of Jieqi's anthems and that helped.</div>

I'll add "start new threads but maintain old ones" to that.<br><br>Managed to tune in at around 7 pm last Saturday 14 Dec. Jieqi mentioned that he will NOT be hosting the show next weekend 21 Dec but will be back with a double whammy the following week- on 28 and 29 Dec.<br><br>Don't know why but Jieqi seems to be going on leave or holiday quite a bit this year. Wonder if work is getting too stressful for him. Well, we always look forward to his show to de-stress ourselves and we write in to him to share our sorrows to him. I was just wondering if we could do something to help Jieqi de-stress and perhaps share his sorrows as well.<br><br>In short, it feels funny that we take so much from him but give little in return. Of course, there is this possibility that each fan mail he receives encourages him to go on...</div>

Dunno why. But well, it's nice to have him back on air.<br><br>Anyway, he seems to like the Ji2mi3 stuff a lot. I'm still trying to appreciate Ji2mi3 stuff.<br><br>As for writing in more... okay lah...I will try. My handwriting is really bad and I don't have a Chinese input software.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice to hear from you again, Hajime. Not sure if others feel the same way but it's always a nice feeling to have a friend drop by, be it one's home or a forum. It's what Confucius says," You3 peng2 zi4 yuan3 fang1 lai2, bu4 yi4 le4 hu1". It's always nice to be in touch with someone who has been a part of one's past, that's assuming it wasn't unpleasant.<br><br>After all, Hajime is one of the 'founders' of this thread. I mean, without her first few contributions, I may not have decided to keep this thing going after the first few posts.<br><br>Now I understand... I remember some time ago, Jieqi did join in the chat but somehow that stopped. Now I get the full picture. Well, I've kinda outgrown IRC but I certainly wouldn't mind a chat with Jieqi. There's just so many things to ask him... which school he attended etc. (Perhaps he has answered some of the questions I have posted here but it so happen that I wasn't listening in when he mentioned the answers.) This time round, if we choose to chat online, perhaps we can have an 'invite only' channel and with one of us as the op.<br><br>And... nope, I have not forgotten about this thread, despite my involvement in Mary's.<br><br>Yes yes... today is Friday. Tomorrow is Saturday. Guess what I will be doing in 23 hours 25 minutes' time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm still trying to appreciate Jimi's book. While I appreciate illustrations, I like beautiful sentences better. So....<br><br>Anyway, Jieqi's slot has a jing1 hua2 zai4 xian4 (JHZX) these days and it is eating into the first jiu lian huan. I wonder whose idea is it to slot in a JHZX during his slot. I mean, he has only 4 hours with us each week (168 hours) and somebody has to force a JHZX down our throats like that. One JHZX = 9 Jieqi standard songs. Let's just hope they run out of JHZX soon.<br><br>Last week, Jieqi mention that a nice Sally Yeh song is coming up soon and I thought it was Shang4 Shi4 so happily, I silenced my family members and TV, tuned up my amplifier, optimise the equaliser for human voice, turned down the bass a leeetle in earnest anticipation of Shang Shi. Guess what? It wasn't Shang Shi but another song.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway, Shang1 Shi4 has got pretty nice lyrics and I love the way she sings it. You know, divas (tian1 hou4) are always different from the usual teeny bopper, semi-adult singer. When the divas sing, they bring out a certain signature that only they have. And that is all that makes the difference and set them apart- Sally Yeh, Sandy Lam, Faye Wong and those from an older generation, Teresa Teng. They make singing sound simple and a joy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree... divas are different... you're always able to identify them once they start singing... maybe that's why although sammi cheng is really successful and popular, she can't exactly be considered a diva... at least i dun, although i do like her songs...<br><br>missed the 6-7pm hour with jieqi... was out shopping...<br><br>my fren commented tat the beauty of jimmi's writing is in the simplicity of the words... he dun use very chim words, but the simplicity makes you think deeper... have to go back and read his book a second time...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found a good singer for the lazy afternoon mood - Norah Jones, daughter of the legendary Ravi Shankar (mentor to my favourite Beatles), though I heard they are estranged at the moment.<br><br>Her "Don't Know Why" is playing everywhere, such a soulful tune and mesmerizing voice. Very appropriate for JieQi's program, if you ask me.<br><br>What is JieQi's regular slot nowadays? Sorry but I don't really keep tabs. Sometimes I hear him for 2 consecutive days, other times I don't hear him at all. But will know it when he comes on, because his signature songs will be played and his dreamy voice will float out from the radio. However, I recently notice a female DJ is also playing JQ's signature songs (many of them exactly the same songs JQ plays, but no mood setting from her in background music or the content she talks about). I hope I don't see a copycat in the making.</div>

I might actually have a chance to talk to him if I have the guts and manage to call in. I'll probably identify myself as Tinker.... shy lah.<br><br>This is a first- Jieqi when the sun has set and not when the sun is setting.<br><br>Let's see how different it will be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haven't heard Jieqi for two weeks... he didn't work on first day of lunar new year while I completely missed last weekend.<br><br>Wonder if he would play ALL love songs for the entire 4 hour slot in celebration of Valentine's. Maybe he would. That's not a bad idea don't you think so?<br><br>Anyway, happy Valentine's to everyone. To those attached, good for you.. to those who are still single... keep looking but there is no need to rush.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does anybody know if Jieqi will be on air today (1 Mar)? I hope he will be 'cos this is one weekend which i get to stay at home...<br><br>Hope everybody is doing fine...<br><br>The nice thing about being a part-time DJ is that you don't get affected by the "big wind blow" where DJs change time slots. Very easy to remember for Jieqi's slot... Saturday afternoons... and once in a while, some variations like Saturday nights of Sunday afternoons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard Nat King Cole's "When I fall in love" and it sounded a little suspicious. And wala... before I know it, Jieqi's voice is heard over the radio.<br><br>Yes yes... Jieqi in on air at 12 noon on a Saturday. This happens once in a while. This time round, Weixiong has something on so he has to swap slot with Jieqi. I remember my 'anguish' some time back when I switched on the radio at around 3.50 pm and heard Jieqi-- saying goodbye.<br><br>The sad thing is, I am leaving the house at 1 pm and my area has another station that clouds out the 933 signal on my puny tuner. It will be 2++ before I can hear static free 933.<br><br>I wonder if it is too much to ask of 933 to have a timetable for the weekends. In that way, we can know who is on and off over the weekend.</div>
