            <div class='col-md body'>A book I wish to read is Rene Liu's &lt;&gt;. Initially, wasn't too interested in the book intitially but after listening to more and more of her songs, I thought her book should be interesting. Then, one fine Saturday, some time ago, Jieqi read out a passage from it. That passage has something to do with her going to a KTV alone. That passage was mersmerizing. she captured the mood pretty well and I could instantly relate to how she was feeling.<br><br>BTW, it's been some time since Jieqi read out nice passages from books eh?<br><br>------------------<br><br>Finally! Found this CD that contains Kenny G's "Uncle Al". You know, it is so nice to find a piece of music you thought you would never hear again. It's like meeting a long lost friend. some time ago, I was talking about this saxophonist called Kenny G. And he has this piece "Uncle Al" which I have been looking for all these years. Watch out for his "Going Home" too. I really don't know if Jieqi has given Kenny G a try. I really think his Going Home will make good background music. Whatever it is, it is not something you want to miss...</div>

It's also sold in S'pore. The book was a very enjoyable read, I remembered. I think there was one passage on her relationship with her grandfather which was rather well-written.<br><br>Her style is rather mellow, sometimes a bit cheeky. It will remind one of Rene during her "da le yi ba yao shi gei ni" days - strong, silent but genteel at the same time. Very Rene book. A very commendable effort from a non-professional writer.<br><br>Would like to recommend her shifu's books as well. Chen Sheng has under his names quite a number of titles, of which I have 3 (not sure how many he had written). There is one called "bu le sai er de fu mu" (Floating plank of Brussels - hope I didn't get the title wrong), which is quite good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">I bought the book when it just launched.  Nice pics, some touching words too..<br>I liKE kenny G's music too.. and  especially.  I have a collection of instrumental cds.  The one i like most is CINEMA, movie themes which include "forrest gump', 'terms on endearment' (my fav!!!), 'dancing with wolves', 'the lion king' etc..very soothing and nice.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I buy instrumentals when im not in good mood.  Whenever i feel very very sad, will just take out those cds and play for one whole day............<br><br>Anybody read  by Yi Neng Jing?  I read it, can be very touching.  Feel like reading it once again..the way she expressed her si nian, holding the newspapers tightly in her arms as if holding Harlem in her arms --------- that touched me most.  The way she broke the news to Harlem that she was pregnant, so sweet, so wen xin..</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">I read Chen sheng's books too.....one i can remember is  if im not wrong..Think JieQi know all the books i mentioned..haha..I remeber he recommended this book on a tv programme..can't really remember the name...  (Art).<br><br>Oh ya..I met Liang Wen Fu yesterday, with his wife. Hehe..just mentioned his books here few days ago..kekeke..</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to browse through my books over the weekend. The book about dreams of cat and strange things is titled "21 dreams of Liang Wen Fu". I am now re-reading his "Mei Pi Qing", a collection of his works in Zao Bao.<br><br>Anyway, the bookfair was quite a disappointment. I was eagerly anticipating it, after the long wait since its postponement because of SARS. There were noticeably less exhibitors and many were companies selling children learning materials, like encyclopaedias, CD-ROMs etc. Popular Bookstore was prominently absent, unless I was really blind. Union and Commercial Press were the only stalls which I was really interested in. Even my favourite Cite Publishing (of Taiwan books) were not there.<br><br>I also bought Huang Da Wei's and Hu Yan Bin's albums. IMHO, HDW's "TIME" was not as good as the previous "Qiu Tian 1944", perhaps the music genre was so diverse that the flow of the album seemed a bit too jarring. Hu Yan Bin's album was quite easy on the ear. Music style is similar to Jay Chou, but of course his singing is much clearer. His music is also more safe and less experimental. The spoiler is his duet with Rain Lee which seemed so out of place. Even his recent duet with Elva was much better.</div>

Seems that you like to read Wenfu's books a lot.  Ya right, Popular did not participate in this year's bookfair..Dunno why, but there is a new one opening in Majestic...so many categories..I'm sure there is a wide variety of books.   You went to bookfair for the sake of purchasing taiwan books?  Then Popular and Kinokuniya carry a lot.<br><br>My buddy likes Hu Yan Bin's voice..she said it is sexy.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>However, i prefer Van Fan Yi Cheng's songs..like to recommend one here....Dunno how to describe here, listen to it if you have the chance to..It's simply FEELING. </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Because I have Popular card mah hahaha...Anyway, I bought most of my JiMi books from Popular. Popular Majestic has a whole shelf of it.I now have about more than 10 JiMi books, but I am still stuck with my Rich Dad Poor Dad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Nevermind, am finishing it up soon, so will be back to the JiMi routine again... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Oh I also bought a novel "Dan Bai Zhi Nu Hai" just because I find the title very interesting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Hope the book will be good...<br><br>Hu Yan Bin sexy?

The latter is now a very special song of mine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Will take note of "Wang Le Ai"..."Bai Mu Da" doesn't really suit him though. It is a fresh take nonetheless, but he is not Enrique Iglesias... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Have you heard of a new author called Teng Jing Shu? Was wondering whether his books will be good...Haha, it's that kind of a "suddenly feel like doing something" feeling. I "suddenly" decided to cast one more glance at his book, and "suddenly" felt like giving his books a try...think I will end up buying it "suddenly"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
