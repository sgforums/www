            <div class='col-md body'>No leh, marriage not necessarily will bring happiness. In fact it sets the stage for more conflicts because of more interactions and more time spent together. Happiness won't come to people. People have to search and build happiness themselves. Happiness in life depends on whether you know how to find it.<br><br>It is also perspective lah. Like for us, we may not be rich and don't own car, but we find happiness in taking public transport. I will see it as he will have more attention on me rather than on a steering wheel. We can read the papers together on MRT or just talk, rather than him concentrating on the road and me on the radio. Don't know leh, to me I am contented with just little happiness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmm, the last time I laughed really whole-heartedly was when I played with my dog <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  I don't know leh, everything I felt towards people I don't feel the same with her. I see her I already very happy le, even though she is so naughty and refuses to listen to instructions. Because I know only she will not let me down no matter what. Dogs give you unconditional love and even if you are bad to them (not that I am!), they will still want your attention. Sometimes I think human beings are really lucky, because animals like dogs are willing to give their all just to have a bit of attention from us. But ourselves, what do we do to deserve all these?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>So your friend went to Turf City ah? Wah, think of the ulu place I already sianz half. Unless you want to go there makan, if not, there's nothing there which you can't find elsewhere.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Story for all...<br><br>There was a scholar who was to marry his fiancÃ©e, but on the day of marriage, his fiancÃ©e changed her mind and married someone else. The scholar was devastated and fell ill. His family seek all kinds of medical treatment for him, but still he showed no sign of recovery.<br><br>They were about to give up hope on him when a wandering monk passed by. After learning about the scholar's condition, the monk walked to the scholar's bed and took out a mirror for the dying man to see.<br><br>In the mirror, the scholar saw a vast ocean, and the naked body of a murdered woman lay on the beach. A man passed by, looked at the body, shook his head and left. Another man who passed by saw the body, took off his robes to cover the body and left. Finally came a man passing by who saw the body, dug a hole and laid the body carefully to rest before burying it. The scene in the mirror suddenly changed. The scholar saw his fiancÃ©e in a nuptial chamber and another man was lifting her wedding veil...<br><br>The scholar blinked at the monk, confused. Slowly the monk explained, "The woman whose body you saw on the beach as your fiancÃ©e in her previous life. In your previous life, you were the second man who gave her his robes to cover her body. To repay your kindness in this lifetime, she loved you for a period of time and became your fiancÃ©e. However, ultimately the man whose favor she has to return for the rest of her life is the third man who buried her. And that man is now her husband."<br><br>Enlightened, the scholar sat up and recovered from his depression.<br><br>It is truly amazing -- this thing called "Fate". There was a movie in which the theme song went like this: "You can say it is a big world, you can say it is a small world. But for the promise of this lifetime, we shall spend our entire lives to fulfil."<br><br>All of us are in this big grand masquerade, among the throng of people, we seek expectantly... in that electrifying moment when our fingers touch, the masks are removed to reveal our true selves. Before this moment, we were drifting aimlessly, not knowing what we really wanted. Till you meet this particular person, you finally realize what you really want is not what you have wished for in the first place. It amazes you that standing in front of this person is a different you! You without any mask!<br><br>Fate is not something meant to be forced upon. What is yours will eventually come to your arms; what is not yours will never come to be. In any case, we should not lose heart and give up on our hopes for love that is true, good and beautiful. The value of life, in a certain sense, is determined by the maturity of how we love, of how we give and accept love.<br><br>Treasure what you have...<br>Time is too slow for those who wait;<br>Too swift for those who fear;<br>Too long for those who grief;<br>Too short for those who rejoice;<br><br>But for those who love...<br>Time is Eternity!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Weird encounters in chalet? hmm, not that I remember...but since you visited/passed by some haunted place during your 1st night (old Changi Hospital), maybe that's why got that kind of weird encounters? However, I feel staying in chalets with friends can be a good experience. Usually people staying in chalets behave more or less the way they do at home, so can know what they are really like...some people refuse to help out in dishes (so you know they can be quite "da xiao jie/da shao ye"), some can't stand rubbish being thrown around (neat people), etc.<br><br>eh buddy your colleague like bo simi common sense. Canned drinks esp soft drinks will actually expand in freezer and after that the cans may be quite bloated and spoilt until the gas runs out. Maybe her house freezer is spoilt, that's why not cold enough to spoil her canned drinks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Food how can put on floor? Tell her the only time can put food on floor is to offer food to dead people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Cannot lah, so dirty some more...wet the table cannot use rag to wipe meh? Or wipe the bottom before putting on the table, or put the box on top of some newspapers so won't wet the table mah. Duh...but blur blur people can still have kids lah, why not? Just that the kids will grow up blur blur also, and argue with their friends that canned drinks should be kept in freezer and food can put on the floor.<br><br>bbb, Chen Sheng was very very funny! He kept scampering around the stage and danced some stupid dance (a bit like Mr. Bean dancing, if you have seen it before!).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> He sang a few tribal songs with the "pai2 wan1" tribe band, so the whole atmosphere was quite "nature". Was hoping he would sing a few of his own songs, but again he was here to promote Taiwan's traditional culture. So you didn't miss much if you were expecting him to sing his own songs.<br><br>How come your friend so "yao gui" one towel? Got $ get married, no $ buy towel??? Plus why would she want the free towel from a chalet? Hadn't it been used by countless people before her??? How clean can it be? Yucks... even if not, for one towel wanted to search friends' bags, really too much liao. Just retort her no one so yao gui until will want to steal a towel from a chalet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Wah BTH la..I typed so much and there was an error, couldnt post my message..argh!!<br><br>Hajime and attitude really BAGUS ar!  'Yao Gui' has never came across my mind..my fren also laugh..haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cut it short here..<br><br>1) The towel is new, nicely wrapped.  Power puff girls towel..she wanted the tix and towel.  Think she suspect my fren who booked the chalet took it.  So that fren purposely unpacked and repakced her stuff in front of her, to prove to her that she din take the towel!  Then that girl was there 'siam-ing'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">   I said already, need to search bag meh?  She still din abort that thought, still suspecting my frens!  7 of us are very good frens in school la..<br><br>2) Second night, 4 of them LS throughout the night.  LS = diarrhoea.  Early in the morning when she opened her eyes, she immediately went to search the plastic bags, the cupboards etc.  Then told another fren that there were another 2 cups of cup noodles left and they should eat them up.  Please lor, that cup noodles belonged to me and the girl who booked the chalet.  If you really so yao gui want to eat, please ask first whether we want..Duno what is manners ar?  Kan bu guo qu..she wants everything..even things that she did not pay for...It's easily understood..7 of us went chalet..7 cups of cup noodles only..no extras..paid for our own.<br><br>3) She stepped on my precious tatty teddy!  I screamed!!!  Another fren got shocked~ LOL For the first time I screamed like that..that's my precious tatty teddy..means a lot to me and yet she dared to step it in front of me!  Please lor, that cute bear is lying on the bed, right in front of her leg, she got two options. One is to put it aside nicely and secondly is heck care, just step on it and stretch her legs.  Apparently, she chose the latter without thinking!  Use your brains la, think your legs very clean meh?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  my poor teddy.<br>I can't sleep without that teddy lor..should be able to tell how much it means to me.  Seriously!<br><br>4) She said my best fren is Qian Jin Da Xiao Jie..did nothing but only sleep.  Please lor, people need a lot of sleep wan..all along we know lor.  Let her sleep will die is it?  Need to say her like that meh?  At least people din grumble so much and not so calculative!<br><br>5)  She asked a fren to send her home in her dad's car.  My fren had very bad diarrhoea..LS and vomit throughout the night liao.  For goodness sake, pleaseeeeeeeeeeee let her go home earlier and rest lor.  Din even bother to help her carry her things still wana ask for a free ride. so thick-skinned!   People live in Jurong East, she lives in Choa Chu Kang, really not very 'shun lu' lor..why still so bui paisei leh..haiz..Then at clementi, a fren's hp rang..her fren wana send her home.  Then she asked again..kaoz..BTH her.<br><br>6) She told us she got no money..but still bought a cushion leh!  Bought and bring it to chalet...hug hug..no money hor?  really 'no money'..still got money to depost into her joint account with her boyfren.  Almost $2000 ok..money to get married?  Haha..she suggested to get married on next August..really jin da xi suan lor.  She said it's her 21st birthday mah...might as well wed and have buffet..hit 2 birds with 1 stone.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   Thrifty har?  I pity her boyfren..how to stand her..haiz.<br><br>I went to work today..really fed up that i wanted to quit just 1.5 hours later..Did survey work..few hours only..but I got rejected by more than 10 people and after 1 hour, my forms were still blank.  Very disheartened..and the angmohs are sooooooooooooo dao.  Hey hello, at least smile at me and fu yan yi xia mah..took me as invisible..Wah leh..so angry that I nearly burst into tears when I talked to my fren on the phone..Money really not easy to earn.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  My legs are so suan now..went to City hall, Raffles City, Orchard and also Bugis to do the survey leh..and got drenched after I knocked off..really suay...One day job only..no next time!<br><br>Hajime saw Chen Sheng har?  Happy for you..too bad I missed it, but come to think of it, I really had no energy yesterday lor..after doing the laundry and cooking etc..even overslept today..haiz..but lucky still very early for work.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Very tired liao, hope this msg can be posted successfully!
