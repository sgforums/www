            <div class='col-md body'>So it isn't just me and my close friends who are troubled by work...seems like everyone wants out. I'm more or less "ting2 zhi4" at my current situation, so am also trying to look out, but my current job warrants a 3-month termination notice, so it will be even harder for me to look. We'll see... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Me and my friends will be going to David Tao's concert. The public sale will start on 6 Oct, but Unusual regulars now have priority booking. Really looking forward to it, it'll be a nice X'mas in advance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Hope he offers me his lip balm during his concert! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Haven't read i-mag this week, no time ah...but ya, it's true every guy can be a takeshi, and every girl a gigi, but it depends on who the other party is. A takeshi to girl may be an edmund to another, a gigi to a guy may be a terri to another. "ge4 you3 suo3 hao4", that's why qing ren yan li chu "xi shi/pan an" mah. The movie just premiered in Taiwan, but the leads did not turn up. Only the director, Terri Kwan, Sun Yan Zi and JiMi were there. I guess it will be a big hit over in Taiwan, since the story was written by a Taiwanese, and the scenario and settings are all "made-in-Taiwan".<br><br>I myself am looking forward to Infernal Affairs. I really enjoyed the 1st one, and the 2nd looked exciting as well. Hope it'll be up to expectations, if not it will definitely hurt the 3rd and last instalment. Both Shawn Yue and Edison Chen will be in Singapore next week, so their fans should be quite excited ba?<br></div>
