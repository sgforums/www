I think it was good she started out with "Ling Wu", because that gave her the attention which would otherwise be lacking if she started with songs like "Wei Dao" which had less impact. When I heard she was attached (to a younger fan), I thought she would "retire" from the scene, but now they broke up le, so she should be preparing some new work soon ba, since her album of Korean works was well-received.</div></blockquote>cool cool ... wow, Hajime, I am quite surprised you do know quite a fair bit on Winnie.  When the entertainment industry/ record companies/ singers were really hard hit by the piracy business, she did think of retiring a few years back.  But one day in 2000, when she was so touched by the warmth and love of her fans, she realised that she could not just simply walk out on them.  And so she continued singing, and from there, she cut two albums, Forever and Oh Lover! (I love both)<br><br>Very very very soon, Winnie will be releasing her new album.  This time round, she has become her own producer. We can look forward to songs closer to her heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Anyone knows?<br><br>LoL. I "38" mah, that's why know quite a fair bit of goss hahaa. Was a little annoyed at the TW Golden Melody nomination list. It's really getting too mainstream for my liking. Jolin in Best Female Singer category? Not that I want to have anything against her, but while I don't deny she is popular, I also don't think she quite qualify as Best Female when people like Sun YanZi and A*Mei (and again no Virgin singers, which show how much disdain Virgin has against the awards) are not even being nominated. I am more inclined to believe it is to attract younger viewers as the popularity of the awards ceremony has been declining. Even Jiang Hui offered to decline the nomination for Best Hokkien Female after dominating for 5 years. She openly criticised about last year's treatment to Best Hokkien Male when there was no winner, as she felt it insulted the nominees. Well, I know it's all a game lah, just like their political scene, but still...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
