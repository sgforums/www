            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Can somebody pls advise?  This ah lian got another ah lian to call up my fren and threaten her not to anyhow talk in class.  Got fault ar?  That ah lian is oversensitive ba?  Think we like to talk about her ar?  The sight and thought of her juz turns us off!  This ah lian has strong backing, threaten us.  Should we call the police?  My fren juz ask whether we should ask her out and talk, then tell her everything and ask her not to interefere.  But to me, gangsters are all gangsters..and I dun have time for gangsters?  My fren is scared to inform my lecturer.<br><br>I did not sleep well last night. I heard noise..a man's voice talking by my right ear.  It's like the sexual harrassment calls I received last week but this time it's more scary and I could not figure out the talking..If you watch ghost films, yup, it's that kind of tone.  I thought I answered the pervert's phone call without knowing.  But then I opened my eyes, saw my handphone beside my pillow, left ear.  So you get the picture?  'Somebody' was talking inside my ear.  I covered up my ears and worse!  I heard a female voice by my left ear and a male voice by my right ear at the same time!<br>Frustrated, I put down my hand and closed my eyes.  Then it was there again...heard the noises..I screamed but heard no voice, I tried to get up but felt a strong force on me.  Then I called out to my parents but I think they could not hear.  I tried with all my energy to call them but I think it was still very soft, as if something was in my throat.  Then in the middle of the night, I knew I woke up a few times in shock.  I duno why..but the feeling is like you had a nightmare and you woke up in shock lor..But I know it was not a dream.  Coz I did open my eyes before..to check my hp and the time..but I only checked the time once..about 2.45 am.<br>This morning I woke up and asked my mum and sis whether they heard me calling for them, they said no.  I juz asked my brother, he also said no.  Then my sis said this is not the first time I encounter this.  True, I had one similar experience last year but not as bad.<br><br>Last year, on the day of my final exam paper..I studied till 4am then went to sleep for a while.  Then between 4 - 5 plus I heard a female voice talking non stop at my ear.  I screamed but heard no voice and really felt very weak, no energy at all.  Resulted in me not having enough sleep..already not enough..still such 'nightmare' which made it worse..I think I did badly for that paper..that was my best subject leh..first page of the question paper, I did not know how to answer almost every question.  But luckily I still got an A for that paper la..coz of my overall performance..<br><br>I dun think this happened bcos im under stress..Think I should go and pray tmr..What I need now is sleep!  So many things happened recently leh..really really very tired of it!</span></div>

A talented and modest guy I must say.  He even asked me to support him haha..he will relief Peifen's slot on Monday to Friday, .
