            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have always thought "LOL  = Laugh out loud".<br><br>I might be on a business trip over the NDP weekend so I might miss it. In fact, I might miss as many as THREE Jieqi weekends. My best chance will be to tune in from overseas.<br><br>You know, some time ago, I was searching the net for one of those free downloadable software audio recorder from tucows or download.com. There was none so I tried to write a simple one in VB invoking ready-made DLL's. It turned out to be something beyond me. Sadly, I had to concede defeat and resigned myself to missing Jieqi for the weekends I cannot be at home.<br><br>All we need is a simple audio recorder. Please advise if you find any.<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>Fixing a broken heart? Ah.... yes... by Indecent Obsession and Mari Hamada. it belonged to the era where I tuned in to English stations on a regular basis. I remember the eighties with great fondness when they have got really fantas ballads and love songs. It peaked around 1990 and went on for a while to the early 90s. Then came the rappers who smashed up everything... Boy bands and girl power followed pretty soon. (Having said that, I am sure rappers and boy bands have their appeal and deserve the popularity they have.) You still get the occassional nice love song like "How do Iive" (Trisha Yearwood) but gone are the days.<br><br>Most importantly, 933 started at that time and Mandarin pop kinda ruled my life.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>A walk down memory lane back to the eighties and early nineties never fail to bring back to good old songs and singers who could really sing. Pan Yueyun was pretty prolific. Wang Jie was at his best. Sky was like on a rampage scoring hits after hits. Jiang Hu's songs sounded almost all alike but what the heck, they were nice. Sandy Lam had a few good ones, slugging it out with Sally Yeh and their competition meant more good songs for listeners. You can join me in reminiscing about the 80s and early 90s<br><br>But this doesn't mean these days the songs suck.... I'm still enjoying myself, especially every Saturday afternoon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"If" is a beautiful song, in fact many Bread songs are too. I also like "Everything I Own". Think David Gates wrote it after the death of someone close to him (his parent?).<br><br>LOL is Laugh Out Loud in internet language  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There are good songs and singers in different eras. In the present world where packaging rules, there comes a lot of can't-sing singers who rule the scene with the "black hand" behind making use of them to milk $. But there are those who can resist the temptations of going the easy way, just that they are outnumbered by these pop idols, because there are more talentless people around than talented, so it's easier for the "black hands" to just find someone and package it nicely to sell out rather than hunt high and low for a  real talent. So the result is good looks, talentless people rule the scene while the real talents have to struggle on their own to come out from the shadows.<br><br>It's the nostalgia which makes people keep wanting to go back in time, because many songs are reminders of the different phases in life which they relished, eg. first date, first break-up, etc. I remember "Ni De Yang Zi" from the movie Ah Lang De Gu Shi from a decade ago the same way I remember "First Love" from Mo Nu De Tiao Jian some years ago and "I Believe" from My Sassy Girl just last year. Wham's "Last Christmas" will always pop up my mind when Christmas comes by. When it's drizzling outside, I'll think of Zheng Yi's "Xiao Yu Lai De Zheng Shi Shi Hou". When it's a downpour, I'll think of WaWa's "Da Yu"...etc etc etc. hahahahaa...I've got a very busy mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Oh, when I think of JieQi, I'll think of Wan Fang's "Shi Zhe Liao Jie", Eason's "Quan Shi Jie Shi Mian", Fang Wei Zhen's "Wo Dao Di Shu Hu Le Ni Shen Me", Zheng Zhan Lun's "Ru Guo Ni Bu Xiao Xin Xiang Qi Wo", Sandy's "Zou Zai Da Jie De Nu Zi", Qiu Ze's "Ta Men Hen Mang, Easy For You", Faye's "Tui Fan", Cai Li Er's "Zhi Xiang Dui Ni Shuo Yi Ju", etc etc etc...hahahaha this is a long long list... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Digress: David Tao is releasing his new album (well, 6 new songs + remixes of old songs) in Aug! 8 Aug to be exact, barely a week after Jay Chou releases his.

Everyone wishes to be like what George Lam said, "Why change yourself to suit the surroundings? You should change the surroundings to suit you", but that is provided you are the boss and have the final say in things. Others like us lowly-paid sufferers have to just REN3! Lun! Tahan!
