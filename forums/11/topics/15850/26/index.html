Or one-day love..."24 xiao shi de ai qing shi wo yi sheng na wang de mei li hui yi" ; "zhi yao jin tian bu yao ming tian"; "zao gai ting zhi feng liu de you xi" etc. But it was a beautiful song. Miss Zhang Hong Liang in fact. I used to like to sing along to his &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;...<br><br>"sgforums" always loads very slow. Didn't get to listen to JieQi much as I was out, but was glad to hear &lt;&gt;Such a fab song, best listened when the sun is setting. Not in the morning though! Don't want to chu fa to workplace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Ya, &lt;&gt; was a nice song, though I prefer the part 2 - &lt;&gt;. "ai shang le jiu you ku, ai guo le jiu gu du", such heart-wrenching lyrics...Li4 Qi3 is a good singer but with not much luck or appreciative listeners. She has such a nice voice like Jiang Mei Qi, but xiao mei is considered so much luckier than her. Probably she is too low profile...wonder how is she doing now?<br><br>Heard a lot about "City of God" too. A movie about life in a Brazilian slum. Think it is out for quite long already, or that it was featured in one of the film fest. Well, I am not good in appreciating the "thinking" type of show, more into Mr Bean kind...superficial eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">"Oh mei mei mei mei ni de yan jing...Qing ni bu yao hai pa bu yao shang xin.."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Reminds me of an ex-colleague..she likes this song a lot..<br><br>That  was nice...and also !  Bagus ar!<br>Nah, you are not superficial...just different thing attracts you.   I also dunno "City of God"..saw it in the papers...too serious..i prefer something light and romantic, just like .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Li Qi has a nice voice..almost the ame kind as Lin LongZhi's (qian dong ren xin)...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Unbelievable... I missed Jieqi's programme for 3 straight weeks. Business trips can be so ridiculous... That explains my absence from this forum.<br><br>To those who have recorded the programme: may I borrow your recordings?<br><br>Guess what? I will be not be able to tune in this weekend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>As for migrating to another server, it's an option but it is quite hard to leave this thread behind. After all, I think this thread holds the record in sgforums for the most number of "views" and "replies". it's a subtle way to support Jieqi... You know, this thread might find its way into the Guiness Book of Records.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm also quite interested in the movie. Edmund Chen also has a rather big role inside, wonder how he did?<br><br>Like I mentioned before, I always hoped that Joi Chua's "Ta He Ta" can be used for the movie, but I guess Sun Yanzi is more popular ba...even if so, why not have "Ta He Ta" as a sub-theme? But well...Anyway, the story is still my most favourite among JiMi's. Maybe it's always a girl's dream to have such a chance with fate like this - ren sheng zhong de ji yu &amp; xie hou. Hahahaha shou nuu qing huai zong shi shi... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>hope the movie will be as beautiful as the book.

Like you, I bought it based on the cover and also becos of my love for sea, blue &amp; white... I like Greece...<br><br>the words and photos were simply so captivating that I couldn't put it down, kept smiling at the photos and captions...  what's your favourite photo?  mine are from Pg 9,30, 31,43,63,81 &amp; 93, and all photos showing those little cute white houses on the slope... his scenic photos were all pretty well taken. I think the photo on Pg 44 is Justin. Now at the website...<br><br>My heart flew to Aegean Sea too...<br><br>Strongly recommend this book to people who are into photography cos of the beautiful scenic photos and natural people shoots.</i></div>
