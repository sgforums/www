            <div class='col-md body'>Watched the Golden Horses awards, upset not able to see Tony Leung  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Was glad for him that he won, I think IA1 was very good performance by him, though I thought Andy Lau would stand a better chance because his role was richer - usually baddie roles are more memorable. Tony's role in IA1 was supposed to be very suppressed so I thought he controlled his "shou1" and "fang4" very well, though I felt some scenes could be done without, eg. the reunion with his ex-girlfriend, unless it had any implications later. Anyway, it took 7 rounds of re-voting before Tony Leung edged out Andy so I guess it is also a form of subtle recognition of Andy? Will have to watch IA3 to decide who is better though.<br><br>As for Megan Zheng, was proud of her as the 1st Singaporean to win the Horse, and had a small laugh when I heard her speech which was obviously read off a script (later read that she indeed did it as told by mum who wrote the speech - she even memorised it on the plane and in toilet breaks...typical Singaporean behvr hehe).<br><br>Was quite happy to see one of my hosting idols Cai Kang Yong was on a good form that night. His "tribute" to Huang Qiu Sheng was hilarious - instead of the usual crow on his shoulder, he had a small replica of HQS being stabbed in the heart and landed in a pool of blood a-la IA1 on his shoulder. HQS was quite worthy winner too, his role in IA1 was the kind the panel would like. But the atmosphere was a bit dull and uptight, even homeviewers could feel the tension so can imagine how nervous the nominees were.<br><br>Only caught a bit of JieQi because was out for most of the day. Was shopping for stuff to dress up my X'mas tree! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Was quite fun lighting it up at night and it looked like the greatest tree I ever saw. Hehe just biased lah...<br><br>Wishing All a fun and lovely X'mas!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Nowadays, u always see the same guys nominated and winning...dun get me wrong, i really like tony (he is always in my favourite director's movie). But i miss the days when all those obscure movies were winning. It makes me want to go out and watch them, to enjoy the freshness of it. Come'on, even Leon Lai has won one (or was it during the HK film award?)<br><br>and yap, throughout the whole of IA3, I was trying to figure out the script, hardly had the time to judge their performances. And yap too, my fave scene was the Kelly, Andy and Tony one. Very well done.<br><br>er...just a qns....did tony win for IA1 or IA3? GH was shown only on SCV right?<br><br>wisefool</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leon Lai won Best Actor last year for "3 jin". Tony Leung won for IA1 which fell within GH qualifying period for this year. IA2 and 3 should be for next year.<br><br>Many of these Taiwanese films were not shown outside Taiwan so the foreign judges will have a vague impression of it. Of course they are supposed to be unbiased, but as long as the human factor is involved, there is bound to be some subjectivity. The thing is GH needs the more popular HK movies to be nominated so that people will pay attention to it. In the 90s, many awards were won by Taiwanese films which had good reviews but poor takings, and it was not able to create a "gong4 ming2" with the audiences or viewers and affected its ratings and popularity. In fact, this year's awards was almost dropped because of lack of funds, leaving the filmmakers who view it as the most coveted award in Asia shocked, so they started some fund raising campaigns with the locals to get it going.<br><br>Another worry is that as the China movie market is starting to open up, the general view is that the already fierce foreign competition  (esp from HK) will further subject the Taiwanese movies into obscurity. Then the funding of the mostly independent movies may just dry up and GH, a Taiwanese award ceremony, will end up having no local nominations eventually.</div>

JIEQI!<br>Haha..I was so excited..almost could not sleep last night..slept at 2plus..now big panda lor..<br>Well, sorry to Shervon and Hajime, I still did not say hi to him..avoid the embarrassment..think he will get a shock if I approached him..He was with frens too..I really wanted to take a pic with him with my camera phone..low-profile he is, once the show ended, he was the first to get out of the theatre..<br><br>That's a very nice show!  Very different from the sketches..but, very sweet and heart-warming.  I was a bit blur in the middle of the show, but managed to sort them out when it's nearing the end. Yang qian hua and Tony Leung really acted well in this show..especially Tony Leung..Dinnoe he could be so gao3 xiao4!  He and Yang Qian Hua together, is quite a good match.<br><br>The songs inside are also very nice..there was one song..I think it's korean song..very nice...looking forward to the sound track.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha haven't even watched TurnLeft TurnRight, but anyway just bought the VCD so can watch at home instead hehehe...but got some reviews from friends say it's quite average so won't be having high expectations. I think I will prefer "Di Xia Tie" because got Tony Leung and Zhang Zhen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Last time watched some comedies of Tony Leung before so remember he quite gao xiao. In fact it's his gao xiao role in Lu Ding Ji as wei xiao bao which caught my attention. He was very funny in "Tian Xia Wu Shuang" as well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>bbb I think he should be okay if you say hi to him, you won't eat him up anyway!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Am now into watching "Qiang Wei Zhi Lian", quite a cute show, Ella is very ke ai in the show, think she is very suitable for the role. How many episodes are there in all, any idea?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Tony Leung is quite withdrawn from the ent circle despite his fame. He is very low profile in contrast to the high-profile movies he is involved in. I believe his melancholy and philosophical character was built up over the years. Doing his own things and keep out of matters which do not concern him. Frankly he is quite "jie shen zi ai", not many rumours about him. The last one I recalled was with Zhou Jia Ling somewhile ago but that fizzled out, luckily because I think that woman is really quite erm...hahaha... That's why a lot of people like him, because he is one of the few who do not milk publicity to up his exposure or fame, and very down-to-earth. Needless to say, his devotion to Carina Lau also made many girls  (including me hahaha) jealous of her to be able to have this kind of near-perfect man  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
