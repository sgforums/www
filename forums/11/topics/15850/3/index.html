I don't remember Jieqi taking many phone calls during his show. Good luck! Anyway, who are you going to dedicate the song to? Jieqi himself?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>... now I think I can't even promise to love someone for the length of my life. Now, I only "zai hu zeng jing yong yo".</strong><br></blockquote>Hey... you sound like some expert in love.. been in and out of love many times? (It is okay if you don't want to answer that.) For me, I was never attached.... too ugly, too bad personality for that to happen. So... most my concepts on things like that are from books, observations and friend's experiences. Although I am a guy, I don't have much confidence in guys... most guys I know are out for 'fun' or 'play play' in a relationship. You should see how many guys actually sleep around despite being attached. From there, plus those song dedication programs, I have little or no faith in relationships. Relationships these days are so cheap, having lost its value and sanctcity. (I know, there are exceptions and I congratulate those who belong to that category.)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Just like this song with a line "yong yuan yo duo yuan, wo kan bu jian"... yong yuan is never-ending...<br></strong></blockquote>Hey! that is a nice piece. I suddenly can't recall who sang it or who wrote it. any idea?<br><br>To Liyan:<br><br>Receivers these days are pretty cheap. Can consider buying one. Try to get a Sony.... they last longer and sound better. It is good to listen to Jieqi's program on the bus... I remember one weekend where I in a bus travelling along Bedok Reservoir during sunset. The tinted glass on the aircon bus made the sunset even nicer..... plus Jieqi's song, and remember the reflection in the water... I nearly died on the spot....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah... if you have a bigger budget, then go for a digital receiver. They might cost 1.5 times more. Those with dials and knobs and what-nots tend to be less sensitive. What's more? You can tune to within 0.05 of a meaghertz with a digital one. 0.05 of a meg of difference can be big, especially listening to Xin Dong that Jieqi always airs.<br><br>Perhaps I am prejeudiced... but I really swear by Sony. For a Sony product to make it to the market, do you know how many times it has been shot down even while it is still in R&amp;D? Sony engineers are really excruciating people. (BTW, Sony is a major shareholder of Aiwa.) What's more? I have NEVER been failed by a Sony. Phillips and Panasonic conks out after a while. But NEVER Sony, at least for me. Take it from the EE student that Sony is the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Just wondering... Did Jieqi go on air on Saturday (10 Mar)? I tuned in at around 2 pm and the jiu lian huan selection of songs was very 'Jieqi'. I thought he changed his shift. BUT, I had to switch off my receiver before I could hear the voice of the deejay. Then I didn't have a chance to tune in until 10+ pm. So.. the question is, did he go on air and at what time if he did?</div>

As for mambo, it does bring back all the memories. During mambo, you get to hear songs like "Yue Xia Tong Xing", "Dang Ye Qing Qing Luo Xia" etc etc which we rarely get to hear normally.<br><br>As for the chat, I felt very left out so I didn't stay long. Figured that Mary's music is enough entertainment.<br><br>Most of us in this topic will strongly recommended you listen to Jieqi's time slot: 4-8 pm on Saturdays.<br><br>Sherv: Although I would like to support your topic, I thought it might be better to answer Zilc here.</div>
