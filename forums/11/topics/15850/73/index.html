My uncle also passed away 3 years ago bcos of lung cancer. Heard from my cousins that he was in great pain but he put up a strong front.  It's also a relief for him..<br><br>I know how it feels to lose ur loved ones..my dad passed away this Jan also. But the live also have to live on..coz it's parts and parcel of life.<br><br>I had a bad dream last night.  In fact, I keep having bad dreams every night.  I dreamt that my cousin passed away due to cancer.  This morning I woke up, I was shocked.  Prayed to my ancestors, hopefully nothing bad will happen.  My little niece is still so small..in kindergarten only.  Haiz.   </span></div>
