Haha..I'm quite a fan of Dreamz FM..Like their singing..bought their CDs..never disappoint me!  Went to their concert held at Down Town East..I think it was 2 years ago...a starry starry night..Then they sang   by Collin Raye..first time i heard that song and like it so much after they sang it.<br>Chen HanWei can Cai LiLian were there...including some other crew of ..they were recording an episode there...so funny..haha...Cai Li Lian was asked to go up on stage..Rick (Liu Rui Cong, Her husband) composed the song ..so sweet neh!  ^^  Then they were asked to sing the duet,  and Cai Li Lian said she would rather sing with Chen HanWei..haha..<br>That  talks about a love story of a man and a Geisha..I heard HuiShi introduced this film one day..over the radio..It has a sad ending..What's the story behind the raincoat?  When a man likes a woman, he will share a raincoat with her..Think that's the romantic part.....Awwwwwww...how i wish i can catch it in cinema!  So disappointing... also delay...haiz..<br>I dunno 'Pi Zi Cai and Qing Wu Fei Yang' though..paisei..<br>Looking forward to this Saturday's prog..wonder whether HanMing will host with JieQi?

            <div class='col-md body'>So... who is MZ? How come everyone seems to know everyone here? I really wonder who flyaway747 a.k.a. MZ is...<br><br>Anyway, it seems that Browniebaobao and Shervon have become very good friends eh?<br><br>----------------------<br><br>Speaking of singers from the PRC, there are a few outstanding individuals. Talents abound in a population of more than a billion. I remember a lady singer by the name of Mao-something-Min. I think it is Mao Ah Min or something like that. I first took notice of her when she sang the pian wei qu of "San Guo Yan Yi". Along the way, I heard her songs once in a while in public functions here and there. According to my friends from the PRC, she is pretty popular in some quarters.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>Saw an ad on TV. A certain record label is releasing a compilation of local hits. It's called "Ben3 Di4 Jiang1 La4" and comes in a double CD pack.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>Hahahaha.... suddenly have this urge to organise a "listering" Nope... not an outing to use Listerine but a gathering for listening. Listening + Gathering = Listering. Yerp... maybe we should meet at a place with a decent stereo, preferably with air-con, just to listen to Jieqi's program together. There used to be a bubble tea shop in Tiong Bahru Plaza that is permanently tuned in to 933 with a cosy setting. The place was pretty quiet on Saturday afternoons. Something like that would be nice.<br><br>A trip to the beach will not be a bad idea...<br><br>And before we do that, let's make sure Jieqi will be on air at the designated time. It will be a cruel twist of fate to travel half the way across the island, gather at 4 pm all ready for indulgence only to find that Jieqi is hosting the 11 pm slot.<br><br>----------------------<br></div>
