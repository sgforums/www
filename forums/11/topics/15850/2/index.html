            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]Originally posted by liyan:<br><br>[B]JieQi wasn't on air today rite?<br><br>Yerp... it wasn't Jieqi! I was down with flu wanted to sleep but made myself stay awake for his session. Then, the jiu lian huan at 4 pm was rather fishy-- the songs were not so nice, they were unlike what Jieqi would play. When i hear the DJ's voice later, i knew it wasn't Jieqi and just went to bed.....<br><br>BUT, that means that there is a good chance Jieqi will be on air from 4 pm to 8 pm on Sunday. So... stay tune and try your luck!<br><br>anyway, when all DJs change shift next yr (that is like 2 daes away), would it affect JieQi?<br><br>Unless Saturday afternoon becomes a slot for full time dj's, it is unlikely that there would be any change. Let's just pray that Jieqi will still do part time.... or perhaps even go full time...<br><br>i only started to listen to JieQi (or rather really like his slot so much that i try to stay at home) only this april or may, so i am not sure of the previous slots he held...<br><br>Usually, Jieqi takes the Saturday afternoons. When he can't make it on Sat's, he may be on air at the same time on the next day- Sunday 4-8 pm. I thought I have heard him once on a public holiday when I wasn't at home and listening to my pocket tuner. I don't think he will be on air on working days as he holds a full-time job as an editor at i-weekly.<br><br>Yerp... there seem to be a number of NUS people over here. But whatever it is, we are all fans of Jieqi, right? Maybe we can form a fan club???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>Things have been a little quiet eh? Just have something good to recommend to everyone.<br><br>I just realised that 933 sounds pretty good after 11 pm on weeknites. Mary has taken over and out of 10 songs, I like 7. This has been the case for the past 3 nites. What's more, she doesn't speak that much. While a dj's voice isn't very important, Mary's voice is pretty sweet and her laughter isn't too awful.... that's a bonus!<br><br>Let's start exchanging tips on which times is a good time to listen to whatever station.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yerp... after the da feng chui, 933 seemed less attractive.<br><br>The only program worth dying for is Jieqi's. Mary's program is worth staying up for as the songs she plays are usually good. AND... she is nice enough to do dedication by phone or by chat. As for the rest, all I can say is that it is a good thing Liyi is in the morning so I can have some good music on the bus. Wen Hong sounds like he has an ego problem.<br><br>Good news! I never heard Huishi on air ever since the swap. Good riddance! Used to like listening to her speak but now... errr... she speaks a little too much and trys too hard. Chongqing has some good songs but well, speaks a little too much. But then again, these are just my preferences.<br><br>In case you haven't guessed, I don't paticularly like programs where the dj's talk too much. (Remember those good 'ol "ting ge bu shou gan rao" days 10 years ago?) And if they speak, all I ask of is a little more substance. And please, I hope they can stop laughing like hyenas.</div>

I really dislike the previous time she partnered with Chongqing... it's the way she cracked her joke and act like she's Ah-Jie of 933... well, a little try too hard...<br><br>Chongqing: Too cartoon for my taste, but he has his charming side, when he's "gan3-xing4". When he was doing nite program (part-time on sat and sunday nite) he was quite fantastic!<br><br>Liyi: I feel that she should try to improve on the way she speak... sometimes when she speak, she's a little lazy with her pronuciation... that's how i feel... listen to her a bit sian...<br><br>Mary: Still like her among the newcomers... Weibing is quite promising... but I still prefer Mary... but my no-fight favourites are still Baobao and Jieqi... Really like the way Mary develop her style... listen to her since the day she started with 933... she has grown a lot and developed her own style (a little "sha da jie")...<br><br>General: Yeah... missed the time when the music is really "ting ge bu shou gan rao"... but can understand that they also have to account to advertisers and to protect priracy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah lor... Baobao and Jieqi are the no-horse-run dj's in 933. Never knew anyone better than them and it is unlikely anyone else will do so in future.<br><br>Baobao's sense of humour is one of a kind and she dares speaks out on what she feels about. Really missed the ou tu ju chang.... the way she spoofs everything around her, it deserves an award. I remember one OTJC where I laughed so hard I thought I was going to die! When she was doing the 4-8 pm slot back then, I find myself always wearing a smile on the bus on my way home. I even dashed out of LT's straight after lecture just to plug in to her show. Right now, in theatre, she is having a hard time and getting flak for some of the things she do.*sigh*<br><br>The title of this discussion should be"Liu Jieqi's email? Lin Baobao's email? Anybody?" Seriously, come to think of it, anyone has Lin Baobao's a.k.a. Li Xie's email?<br><br>Jieqi... substance... that is what he is... substance. Good thing Saturday is in two day's time.*smile*<br><br>I am fine with advertisment and stuff like that. It is the crap they talk and the wail-like-banshee laughter I can't stand. Of course, the ultimate in horrid laughter belongs to that of Dong Fang Bi Li of 958! To be fair, it was reaaaally bad some years back, nowadays, it is slightly better.<br><br>How long have you (everyone) been listening to 933? I started way back in '90 when it started. *Gee* I feel like a dino.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like the way Baobao air her views. I'm basically crazy about Leon Lai and I can still remember this interview she did with Leon Lai for a concert that never happened... Well, it's common knowledge that conducting interviews with Leon Lai is very tricky. But Baobao handled it real well and gave me a new insight to Leon Lai, and I actually learnt certain aspect of life from it. I still have a transcript of the interview...<br><br>Her 'ou tu ju chang' is no-fight one... even though Danny is very creative, noone in 933 now can come close with the talent that Baobao has with this kind of drama. I can still remember the "Lian Qu 1997" I think... i know it is lian qu something... the one where she and danny were lead voice... I really cried during the last episode... it was so bitter yet sweet... Those laugh until can't stop one also very good...<br><br>I feel that it is really a loss when pple like Baobao leave the radio industry... Now Danny also leaving soon...<br><br>I started listening to 933 quite late... around 1995...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Even her Ah Lian's were done very well....<br><br><blockquote>I started listening to 933 quite late... around 1995...</blockquote>hmmm.. 93-95 were years where 933 was really tops.. at least IMHO. Between 90-93, it was really good but there wasn't a passion about it. Back in jc (94-94), a large proportion of my class were 933 addicts! That was really unheard of! (I come from a very English, very competetive, very Westernised jc) Together with some friends, I remember writing the lyrics of nice songs on my class blackboard back then! That was how nuts we were about 933 and Mandarin pop in those days. *sigh*<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tinker:<br><br>That transcript is 2.5 pages long... I dun mind sharing it, but no idea how...<br><br>Well, what did I learn? There was a period of time when I feel that some people dun understand me and difficult for me to develop friendship further. It's rather difficult for me to communicate with them and listening to the interview, I realised that the problem might not be totally my fault. Communication is a two-way things. If I've tried and still can't, maybe it's the other party who is unwilling to open up to me. I can't change my character to suit/accomodate to others. I can't control what people think about me.<br><br>The interview sortof opened up my mind, and afterthat, well, in a way, my character gradually changed and I grew to take things easy and as it is... I dun feel the need to be frens with everyone I know.<br><br>I started listening to radio since 1990... for me, it was FM 98.7 then, well, 'cos of Richard Marx's Right Here Waiting... Anyway, tried listening to 933 back then... but dun really like the music 'cos it's all about Love... to me, it was boring and meaningless... Then, it was Leon Lai who prompted me to switch back to Chinese pop... Have been listening to Chinese pop until now... well, gradually switching to 90.5 for their relaxing oldies and jazz...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think Jieqi was on air last Saturday right? Was he? I heard something around lunchtime that he hurt his neck or something... Any news, anybody?<br><br>Sherv:<br>If the the transcript is in hard copy, forget it lah. I think you got better things to do. BUT, if you feel that I should see it, maybe you can drop me an email then I tell you my address than you can post it to me. Personally, I feel there really isn't a need to.<br><br>You are beginning to sound like a loner... which I am and am proud to be one. I have really good friends but by and large, I ENJOY being alone. I just like to plug in to my receiver and work on my own... something like hiding in my own little universe, oblivious to whatever that is around me. Yerp.. sometimes, some things are just not meant to be. You just can't click with certain people and there really isnt' a cerebral reason for that. Hindus and Buddhists would call it karma. Psychologist will probably call it personality or type mismatch. The Chinese have a saying "you yuan qian li lai xiang hui, wu yuan dui mian bu xiang shi", which sums it up very well.<br><br>As for 98.7, I did listen to it since its birth and it was good. I remember tirelessly trying to tune my radio to 98.7MHz back in Dec 89 just to catch the opening of 98.7 English pop was at its height from 90-92 I think. There was Escape Club's "I'll be there", Surface's "Shower me with your love", Marx with "Right Here Waiting", "Angelia"... almost every song in his Repeat Offender was good. Say it with Music was in direct competition with Xiang Ge Ji Yi and my radio dial oscillated between 987 and 933.<br><br>Then, all hell broke loose with the raps coming in... MC Hammer, and all the messengers from hell... with that, I stuck to 933 until this day while others tune to 95. Oh yes, my sis likes 90.5 and it has rubbed onto me...<br><br>*wow* this is a pretty long reply eh?</div>

What pen-name did you use? I quite liked what you wrote about a promise.. it is true, it is so easy to give a promise but does one know what he/she is in for? When Jieqi read it out, it struck me from the bottom of the heart. If you listen to those dedication program, you hear all these sec3 students saying "yong yuan ai ni" and stuff, it make me wonder if they know what yong yuan means. Promising something is no joke okay.... never promise anything you aren't prepared to or you are not sure if you can fulfill.<br><br>*hmmmm* I wonder if Jieqi know he actually has a discussion board specially about him....<br></div>
