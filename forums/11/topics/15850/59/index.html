Probably Nov or Dec..I'm not sure yet coz I might be working in November..anyway I'm definitely On for it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>This gathering will go on with/without JQ if response is good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>You know, i was just thinking about the outing... and I thought perhaps we should hold it on 15 Dec. Why? It will be the 4th anniversary of this thread! Plus celebrate Bukoh Mary's birthday in the meantime...<br><br>Anyway, if it is an outing, let's keep it small... I shy lah... plus big group hard to manage.<br><br>As for SMS song dedication, nope. I wasn't responsible for it. I got a really BIG song dedication some months back from a long lost schoolmate and out of a sudden... a lot of my friends started calling me after they heard my name announced over national radio.

            <div class='col-md body'>Will be going on holidays! Phew...Though just somewhere nearby, it's still some time to relax.<br><br>Recently I bought this album by a China singer called "Dao1 Lang2". Very shiok album, if you like music which will remind you of vast land clear skies...his voice resonates wilderness of plains and magnanimity of bravemen. Some may call it world-music, but this genre actually doesn't exist IMO - it is just a convenient way of classifying music which doesn't belong to any genre  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And yeah, Joi Chua's new album is a very good effort. The songs showcase her crystal-clear vocals to the optimum, and the compositions are full to brim with sincerity, something which we did not wait in vain for.<br><br>She sold 50,000 copies of her debut album Taiwan and I must say that wasn't an easy feat, considering the miniscule attention and promotion from the media and her record company. If the promotion efforts are better this time around, I am sure she can make a bigger impact in the Taiwan market. That is, if they know how to appreciate a good voice like hers. All the best to Joi!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
