Browniebaobao = Pei Ni<br>I have heard of the name Pei Ni on air several times but did not know who it is. I can't help but wonder how old you are. Are you still schooling?<br><br>Anyway, it's nice to know Jieqi has been here and could very well have posted messages somewhere.<br><br>I have never heard Ji You or Pei Ni on air. But I have heard Ji You on the phone once and only once.<br><br>Speaking of Zhao Yonghua, she was on Music Happening yesterday (Sat 15 Mar). She sang some of her songs like Qiu Hun. She is now happily married to a vet. Someone was telling me she was on the 'sex and love talkshow' over Channel X the day before... oops.. I mean Channel U.<br><br>And yes... today's songs were good. But somehow, I still prefer the 4-8 pm slot. The mood more suitable lah. The nice thing about the 12-4 pm slot is that there are fewer interruptions. I hung around 933 until about 6 pm.... and the DJ was Jiahui... she played Sandy's Qian Chen after 5 pm and it felt good.<br><br>And... does anybody know what happened to liyan, otterised, joanne, Zilchster and others? Haven't seen them around. Joanne should be going to or in uni now...<br><br>People come, people go, but I can't help wonder where they are now.</div>

I forgot she mentioned listening to 933 on her way to school in one of the postings.<br><br>anyway, i think all 933 dj's deserve our accolades. but well, it is a fact that different things appeal to different people. I like Bao Bao and Mary to a very large extent. Lingzhi, Liyi and Weibin are special in their own way and I appreciate their efforts. Other DJs probably have their own following too.<br><br>Lingzhi's Music Diary is very well produced. My only question is if the letters are the imaginations of bored teenagers. I mean, what's stopping me from writing a really gripping letter that is pure fiction?<br><br>Liyi is very 'cute' in the way she speak... Bao Bao has left so... For Mary, I like her programmes enough to start a thread for her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's almost 1am on Monday...*groan* hate Mondays....<br><br>Now listening to Chen Sheng's "Ba Bei Shang Liu Gei Zi Ji" on 933. Not sure who the DJ is, heaven't heard the voice yet. But this is a fantastic choice, bcoz I like Chen Sheng's songs too. I am in fact now reading a book co-written by him and Cao Qi Tai. Surprising to learn they are good friends, they seem like completely different types? Most part of it is talking about the recent incident involving Chen Sheng, who was hit on the head by someone with a bottle and ended up having a head surgery. Was quite shocked to hear the news at first, really glad he is okay now.<br><br>Hope he maintains his consistent quality songwriting, I really enjoy his songs...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops, I wanted to write about Sat's prog, ended up talk about Chen Sheng because I heard his song haha...<br><br>Anyway, was REALLY HAPPY to hear Huang Da Wei's "Rang Mei Ge Ren Dou Xin Sui" (or known as "Xin Sui" in earlier days). Everytime I hear his songs, emotions will take over, and I will stop doing everything to concentrate listening to him. My mind just empties and only fills with his voice...hui dang zai nao hai, jiu jiu bu qu...I elapse into a trance and slowly awake only after the song ends....haha, sounds like possessed...actually too hypnotised...Ya, that's the word, I'm always hypnotised by his voice...<br><br>Huang Da Wei, wan sui!~ I hope I have not heard the last of his songs yet...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello...<br><br>Jieqi is on air... got a shocked when I heard his voice at 11.30+ am. Well, I am not complaining...<br><br>I nearly forgot about this group that I like a lot... Fan2 Ren2 Er4 Chong2 Chang4.<br><br>Not sure if Jieqi likes their music... but I thought their "Du4 Juan1 Niao3 De4 Huang2 Hun1" and their "Wo3 Yuan4 Shi4 Ni3 Zui4 Wen1 Rou2 De1 Feng1" are good. There is another slow song which I like but I can no longer remember the name of the song.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>I remember mentioning a book entitled "Tuesdays with Morrie" (TwM) some time ago. I hope you will try to read this book. Anyway, it feels like "Saturdays with Jieqi" for us.<br><br>In the book TwM, it's about a journalist who meets up personally with his former college professor  every Tuesday to talk about life. It's a beautiful dialogue between two individuals.<br><br>Over here, we have Jieqi, a journalist of sorts, who meets up with his listeners on air every Saturday but it's about beautiful music.<br><br>Interesting parallel eh?<br><br>Okay... he is on air... enjoy!</div>

But that was about almost the only complete song I  heard, because I was out, darting in and out of buildings because of the rain. I should be at home listening to JieQi if not for some errands which put me in the great risk of getting SARS. The roads were expectedly much quieter than usual... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>By the way, I'm surprised that the Eric Moo concert was not featured in the i-mag. Hope to see a report on it in the forthcoming issue, I really want to know how are Roy Lee, Jiang Hu and Liang Wenfu getting on.
