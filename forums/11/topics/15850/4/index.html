Right now, I am an NUS 3rd year guy. Listening to 933 for a looong time already... since its birth in fact. Sherv's in NUS too.... year 2 i think. I think you may not be the only jc gal around.<br><br>Joanne &gt; Welcome.... there aren't that many 17/18 year olds who like Jieqi's program. I gotta feeling the majority of people who complaint about him are under 20.<br><br>All ( and Joanne in paticular) &gt; So... what exactly do you like about Jieqi's program?</div>

He will play one song at the start of his program and will play another towards the end, sometimes during the 'live' hour between 7 and 8 pm. I believe he has to space them apart becos there is a ruling that the same artiste cannot have more than one of his/her songs aired within a 2 hour block.<br><br>Rene's singing is actually so-so... no powerful vocals (in fact quite weak), voice isn't too sweet, not that much emotions BUT somehow, all her hits are good, from "Ta Le Yi B Yao Shi Gei Ni" to "Cheng Quan", they are all very enjoyable.<br><br>Somehow, Sandy, Julia, Cass and many other singers can outsing Rene any time. It is just that Rene got a good song and she has a certain qi zhi when singing. Oh yes... Rene can act well....<br><br>Jieqi likes to air Shino's "Xin Dong", some of Wan Fang's songs, Chen Qizhen's "Hai Shi Hui Ji No" but definitely, guarantee-or-your-money-back, "liu lian bao chiah", there will be one Rene song for Rene fans like me to be happy about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Joanne &amp; all...<br><br>Hmm... Just like the songs he play... ever so nice and soothing... Sometimes, when I listen to his songs, they will evoke me to think about indepth stuff. Sometimes, when I'm sad, I will feel better after listening to his music.<br><br>I like the songs he play also cos the lyrics are usually meaningful... For example, Zhang Ai Jia's "Ying Wei Ji Mo"... At first when I hear that song, not really impressive, nothing much... then one day, I hear it n it suddenly become apparent n similar to what is going on in my life, and then evoke a lot of thoughts again...<br><br>Now Jieqi's top favourite is "Yuan Zou Gao Fei". Always sure play one... and sometimes, after playing Sandy's song, he will play Li Zhong Sheng's "Ji Mo Nan Nie"... And usually he will also play Zhang Ai Jia and David Tao song...<br><br>Haven't hear "Wo Dao Di Shu Hu Le Ni She Mo" recently...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the new time slot, it feels a bit funny. I am too used to listening to Jieqi and the songs he airs with the sunset. Without the sunset, it is less melancholic... this takes away a little of the charm.<br><br>What's more, the 12-4 slot is a busier slot in the sense that it is when the promotions usually take place eg. KIA Motors promoting their latest cars. 4-8 pm is a 'quieter' slot with fewer interruptions, albeit there is the 4D results and remnants from the earlier promotions. A quieter slot implies that we can hear more of Jieqi and his selections.<br><br>BUT, I'm not complaining! Becos I usually have something on every Saturday afternoon to night which means I usally miss his shows totally. To be able to catch him from 12-2+ pm is good enuff for me. That day, I actually tuned in just before 2 pm and had to switch off just before 3 pm. I didn't know it was him hosting the show but the songs did sounded a little suspicious. Then, I heard his voice and I knew it. I was hoping Sherv, Liyan, Ott, Joa, Zilc and gang were tuned in at that time. Although it was just an hour, there were a few songs aired on last Saturday which I liked- Sandy's Chong Yu, Power Station's, Zhang Aijia's... etc I was smiling to myself the entire time. People on the bus thought I was nuts!<br><br>Maybe we should exchange pager and handphone numbers eh? If Jieqi has a new slot, we can contact each other and tune in. (Ladies, I can understand if you have reservations about this. On the other hand, we can just tune in at 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm on Saturdays to find out for ourselves.)<br><br>*tsk tsk* Mary's stand in isn't too bad eh? (sorry... no disrespect ... but I just can't remember if it is xiao- or wei- bing. anybody?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Zilchster:</div><div class="quote_body">How do u intend to get Jieqi out?<br></div></blockquote>Good idea to meet up! As for Jieqi, I think he is pretty busy .... so he may not be able to join us. But still, the party can go on... (Hey! This is the first time I see a 'thread' outing initiated by a lady. Usually, the channel outings or invitations to meet up were initiated by guys. Thanks Sherv!)<br><br>Yerp .. for the sake of those having exams soon, it should be after the exams. (For me, this sem has no exam so any time is fine with me.)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Btw...did anyone listen to Mambo No 1 tonight (Tues to wed)...<br></strong></blockquote>Yerp.... Mary's back! Her Mambo selections are once again, absolutely enjoyable...  even Wa Wa's classic was brought out.<br><br>The other day, I saw Jieqi on TCS 8 news and he was commenting on the Oscars. Didn't know he looked like that. Quite different from what I expected actually, especially the hair style.... (hey! I am not complaining.) A guy with a rather thick pair of glasses that belies the intelliegence beneath them, with really short hair, speaking fluently in Mandarin.....<br><br>So now, I know how the guy behind that voice and those fantastic songs on Saturdays looks like.<br><br>*tsk tsk* you guys ever read this simply wonderful book "Tuesdays with Morrie"? Maybe we can write a book on "Saturdays with Jieqi".....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ops... I missed Mary's Mambo again... I think i also need reminding on this....<br><br>How to get Jieqi out ah? Special invitation from me lor... since I'm the initiator and I think he knows my name... come to think of it, I think he knows my address also since I always include my postal address in whatever I post out...<br><br>Yeah... I think he's busy too and we just invite him and see lor...<br><br>Err... Does the gender matters? Whatever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
