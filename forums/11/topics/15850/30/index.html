            <div class='col-md body'>Wah, think the no. of posts this weekend were higher than normal? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Anyway caught most part of JieQi's program from around 5pm onwards, was doing mundane grocery shopping before that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  But heard Zheng Zhan Lun's song so quickly went home  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  This weekend was like a trip down the memory lane, all the songs which I thought I would not hear on 933 again. I agree Pan Yue Yun's &lt;&gt; was not bad, but I always prefer Yin Zheng Yang's version. But maybe listeners won't really appreciate his style of singing ba? I think Huang Yao Ming's &lt;&gt; was a cover of some very old song, right???<br><br>Chen Shu Hua's &lt;&gt; doesn't feel like it's already more than a decade old! Ronald Cheng sang it before but somehow I found it a amusing cover  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I notice DJs nowadays seldom play Ronald Cheng's songs (his duet with Anson Hu doesn't quite count) IMO he was one of the best HK singers ever (before that was Jacky, after that Eason) but his scandals really spoilt everything. People esp celebrities like him should jie sheng zi ai more...<br><br>Hope to hear more of the 80s/early 90s songs...esp now that the retro wind is becoming stronger with Feng Fei Fei's the latest star to return. My idol Liu Wen Zheng is having such a good time outside the circle, he will never come back le  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Well, maybe it's good too, because he left what's his best - image and songs wise - in the memories of us fans.

            <div class='col-md body'>btw, I was very very happy when I heard Joi Chua's &lt;&gt;! I knew JieQi purposely played it right after &lt;&gt; <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> He agreed with us too that this song was so appropriate for the movie, but again, it's only our yi xiang qing yuan...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>What can I say, SunYanZi is definitely be a bigger selling point than Joi Chua...reality bites... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Just feeling sad that such an appropriate and good song gets neglected like that...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, i agree this weekend posts more than usual. must be becos jieqi mentioned the forum so his fans come here gather... haha... good also... more people to discuss about music...<br><br>actually i'm not that busy until can't write letter... but cos now post in the forum regularly, and jieqi checks the forum, so might as well post here... a bit bo xin...<br><br>For jazz fans:<br>just caught Michael Buble in Concert. He has a very good voice, as shown when he sang the last song "My Funny Valentine" solo without instrumental accompanion and mike slight away... his voice really sang out... Suntec sound system really bad... kinda spoils the concert... maybe due to low ceiling too. The concert was too short, just slightly over an hour, and Buble sang songs mainly from his album. Way to go...</div>
