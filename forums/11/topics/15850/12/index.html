            <div class='col-md body'>Only switched on around 3.30pm on Sat, thinking I could listen leading up to JieQi's program @ 4pm. Then I heard San Xin by Zhao Yong Hua...and I knew it...Argh! He was on the 12-4 slot instead!<br><br>Well, hope he can fix a slot which he requested for, if not I will keep missing his progs. Actually I prefer 4-8 slot, but since 7pm is always taken up by "live concert", so I guess 12-4 is a better slot? But I'm having my lunch then, usually outside. Can't have both the fish &amp; the bear's paw, I guess?<br><br>Hope he will be able to play more good songs by more varied artists. Zhao Yong Hua is a good choice, pity she is not contracted for any albums now, so I heard. Huang Da Wei will be a PERFECT choice too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  He is my most most most favourite male singer, but I hardly hear his songs, maybe like once or twice a year, and only songs like "Ni Ba Wo Guan Zui" &amp; "Xiang Ai Ni". Others like "Xin Sui" &amp; "Xiang Fei De Xin" are very nice too. Lu Fang, Ye Shu Yin, Huang Xiao Hu, Li Guo Xiang... are all good choices too.<br><br>Whatever JieQi's choices, I'm sure they will be much better than the predictable ones in the weekday slots. I am already sick of hearing the same songs 5 times a day every weekday. His slot is the only refuge I can turn to for a nice afternoon.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>oh... he mentioned he might switch to 12-4pm on saturday from May onwards. dunno... thinking of taking up driving, so not sure when classes will be. </blockquote>Well, that is not such a bad thing also... but I'll miss hearing his voice in the sunset, but that beats missing him altogether. Anyway, I just hope that he can do this as long as possible so... I'll be glad so long as it is good for his schedule. He seems to be busier and busier these days.<br><br>As for driving lessons, you probably will not take more than 2 hours per lesson so... it's not that bad. And... maybe you can 'cham siong' with your instructor and tune in while driving. I would recommend you go for the driving school one though it costs more.<br><br><blockquote>oh.. and Jieqi mentioned our name... so funny... the two of us still persisting, posting in this thread... now page 11 already... just the two of us  </blockquote>Well, what did he say? Unfortunately, I couldn't tune in after 3 pm so I probably missed it.<br><br>And of course, there is Hajime who has been supportive all these while. And... the occassional onlooker too.<br><br>Notice something? If Jieqi mentions our thread on air, it will get a re-surgence of life?<br><br>Anyway, I'm not aiming for any record or to prove any point. I just want to keep this going as long as Jieqi is still part timing as a dj. It's my way of saying thanks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that period of Zhao Yong Hua was very upset or sorts, with San Xin and after that Xiang Jian Tai Wan. Heard that it was because she couldn't be with Li Zheng Fan, her mentor cum supposed-lover, because he was already married. Before that, she used to sing rather happy songs like Zao Can and Qiu Hun. But I guess as long as she is happy now, what has passed has already passed and I wish her all the best.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi...<br><br>I am not Ji You. That's Shervon... She's an old friend of mine, and a loyal supporter of Jieqi and this forum all these while. The fact is, I've never met her before but I do know she is somewhere out there. I suspect she is one hell of a beautiful babe!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I remember calling her once or twice to tell her Jieqi is on air... but lost her number somehow. But that's okay lah... if I call too much, she might think I am up to no good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   As of now, I am just more than happy to know that she is fine and doing well. It's nice to hear her letter on air too!<br><br>I happen to have an unfulfilled promise with Shervon... that is to see the sunset over NUS engine blk 1. That should happen, but perhaps not soon. Talking about unfulfilled promises... have you ever made a promise to a friend and by the time you want to honour it, you can no longer find that friend? it's sad but it happens. And... a long lost friend once told me I am one of those if gone, it is next to impossible to find locate. So... make new friends but cherish old ones, break no promises and hurt no one.<br><br>My mailbox is set to exclusive which means I won't receive mails from you unless I register your email address. I'll undo that function for the next 3 days so feel free to drop me a mail. I can start having this silent mobilisation excercise where I can notify any interested party each time Jieqi is on air. it's quite cute how all these SAF/MINDEF terms becomes a part of Singaporean lingo...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tinker:<br>Thanks for commenting that i'm one hell of a beautiful babe, though you never know cos u never see me too. I don't have your number too. Shall email u later. We can alert each other when Jieqi's is online. Actually, I only bring out my earpiece on Saturday, so that I can catch Jieqi's program while on the move.<br><br>Dun think you are up to anything after so long. Is it almost a year? Yeah... the outstanding promise of seeing the sunset over NUS engine Blk 1. Is it better during summer? One day...<br><br>I guess the feeling of hearing his program in the evening and during the afternoon would be much different. There is usually a lot of buzz during the afternoon slot, so there would be a different feel about it. It's just like you wouldn't want to listen to noisy songs at the end of the day when you are trying to rest your mind. Then again, it's up to Jieqi.<br><br>Oh, the driving lessons? Intend to spend the whole day at the school.<br><br>Agree Mary is another person who tries to play other songs. Wei Bin is also not too bad.<br><br>Well, Jieqi's program just manages to strike a chord with me. I still remember once when I'm on the bus, tuning in. He played Sylvia Chang's "My Friend", a narration about a friend who died of AIDS. I was so sad and moved by her voice that I started crying on the bus and my ex-bf didn't know what to do with me. Or the song "Xin Dong"...<br><br>BrownieBaoBao:<br>That was so long ago... Can see you have been reading through the posts... 11 pages...<br><br>Yeah... Jieqi never post in here. Or he did not openly declare his identity.<br><br>Hajime:<br>Like Zhao Yong Hua's hits. And they were not the usual romantic ballads, the lyrics are not the standard types...but sadly, she dun see that often now, but her top favourites are evergreen. like qiu hun...<br><br>Liang Jing Ru is not bad too, but the voice is just different. hers is more sad than peaceful...<br><br>All:<br>Just my personal opinion.<br><br>It is hard for singers to be raised to the status of divas. Even Mariey Carey has fallen from that status.<br><br>Sadly, in Asia, looks is very much a determinant of status. Sammi prob would have a harder time if not for her effort to try different looks. Ah Mei &amp; Sandy are really quite incredible, able to dance, sing, try different looks, singing style, etc... they are really talented... and media is as usual, rather cruel and selective.</div>
