            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All!<br><br>Does anybody have Liu Jieqi's email address? I really like the music he airs and the books he shares, on radio. Look forward to his programs every Saturday. (I think he will be absent on 16 Dec. *sigh*)<br><br>The best, IMHO, is to listen to the songs Jieqi airs with the sunset behind, around 6++ pm.... the tinge of melancholy in the air, coupled with sky in a thousand shades of hue, with the music in the backgound.....<br><br>I thought of getting in touch with him to 'share' with him some other nice songs, and of course, good books too. Somehow, I just couldn't find his email address anywhere. His email? Anyone?<br><br>Oh yes... it would be good if anyone has Lin Baobao's email as well.... But I think it might be a little difficult 'cos she left some time ago.<br><br>Are there any other fans of Jieqi out there? Looks like only the 'older' listeners enjoy his music.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all your suggestions! Guess I will mail 933 for it.<br><br>Yerp... I like Baobao's way of hosting- especially her sense of humour. Usually, I will listen to her ou tu ju chang and nearly die laughing. The off the cuff comments she made are side-splitting as well. Too bad, that is all in the past.<br><br>As for Jieqi, it is the songs he airs and the books he shares that draws me to his show. Yerp... even before I know hear the dj, I can tell it is Jieqi himself through the songs he plays. Sad he takes leave on Saturdays sometime, especially recently. Really look forward to 23 Dec.<br><br>Oh yes... in those days, I think there was also Jingying and Rongcheng and some others who aired pretty good songs too. Too bad they have left.<br><br>Apologies if I have 'hurt' anyone's feelings with the comment on only older people can appreciate Jieqi better. The fact is, most who complain about him are younger listeners while those who write encouraging letters to him are usually older.<br><br>For me, I am a 23 y.o. guy in NUS. (sorry to diappoint- I am a guy and a really ugly one at that.) What about you guys? Attitude? Otterised? liyan? and whoever is reading/responding?</div>

Partly becos their name sound close but I still cannot remember their voices. I only remember one of them has really nice background music. Both are pretty new and will become more experienced.<br><br>Notice something? When a dj becomes more experience, they tok more on air.. which is something I prefer they dun do.</div>
