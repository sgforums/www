I miss his letter reading days. The music is of course good but I think he is making less and less comments about the songs he plays.

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally find Elva's "Di Xia Tie" for the movie not as heartfelt as her "Ye" for the movie  which is so much nicer. Frankly, I feel her new songs are becoming "run out of the mill", no longer the kind I feel for like "Qiang Wei", "Chuang Wai De Tian Qi", "Tian Shi Zhan Shi Li Kai", "Zui Shu Xi De Mo Sheng Ren", "Wen", etc. The same way I felt towards A*Mei's songs too...bbb I think the original "Di Xia Tie" should be Jap?<br><br>I quite like Zhang Jing Xuan's "Duan Dian" which make me feel like buying his album. bbb: is the album nice? Must be unbiased hoh hahaha...<br><br>It will be CNY next week. Ya, I hate the visiting part too, but I enjoy the tidbits munching part  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Be buying a lot of pineapple tarts, and I only eat the Malaysian brand "Seasons", because I really like them!

            <div class='col-md body'>yaya I still remember the time squatting behind the doors and drinking the packets of hot kopi to beat the cold. Think someone specially drove out to buy them somemore...haha needless to say, we got weird looks from some people who passed through the doors for toilet breaks...<br><br>Think hot drinks not allowed inside was because of the smell, remembered someone told me that before. Cold drinks usually no smell, but if hot drinks are inside the theatre, then everyone will smell kopi, teh, milo, etc. Haha, the movie experience will kana affected mah...<br><br>That time movie marathon Dasmond Koh was there for 1 or 2 movies and some games, after that he zao liao, left one er xin person still there trying to get attention  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Ahem. The Bugis Shaw usually quite quiet, think only been there once. Long time no watch movie liao...so out of touch hahaa...but movie marathon is quite fun if the movies are not bad, so enjoy it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That time we went movie marathon quite orderly...think people were more concerned if they brought enough sweaters to last through the night. I don't recall got any seat allocation, but we sat quite front, think 3rd/4th row on the left.<br><br>I think US had some survey that females need 3 times as much time for their toilet break as compared to men. I think it's quite obvious why... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> moreover, some females still need to powder face etc, which add on to the time lor...<br><br>Saw a Mayday special on TV. It's a special tribute concert to the Beatles. I know they like Beatles, but no idea they are so into them. There's one part which I was quite touched. Ah Xin mentioned that in an interview, there was a question asking them if they can go back to the past, which day will they choose and why? Masa's reply was 8 Dec, 1980. The date sounded like any normal date to most people, but for Beatles fans, it was the most heartbreaking day ever. John Lennon was shot to death by a fan just outside his home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Masa said he wanted to go back to that day to help Lennon take that shot, so Lennon could still live and write more great songs for the fans. Being a Beatles fan, I was really so touched by this. They even held a concert in the rooftop of a Taipei building singing Beatles songs. This is their special tribute to the great band who also held their last Beatles concert ever on a rooftop just before they split up. Oops, not that Mayday will be like them too lah hehe. Mayday still has a lot of material and potential which I feel can catapult them into one of the best Asian bands, especially when they are getting even more experimental in their recent music records.<br><br>Short week this week, hooray!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
