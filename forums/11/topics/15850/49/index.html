Maybe no visual images so not so scared?<br><br>I read reviews about "Passion of the Christ" and they were pretty good. A few of my friends are going to watch it, but of course I will give it a miss  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Heard a woman in US and a priest in Brazil died of heart attack while watching the film. Another US guy confessed to a murder crime after watching the show (because the story about Christ provoked his conscience?). So the show seems like really got impact.

Heard Liang Jingru's "Bu Xiang Shui" this morning... looks like this song is gaining popularity. was elated when I heard it during Jieqi's slot two weekends ago.<br><br>Hajime scared scared of horror movies... I used to have that problem too... Back in primary school, I remember watching one of those Chinese vampire movies (yi jian fa cai, meng gui xue tang etc.) and couldn't sleep well for weeks.<br><br>After a while, i figured the way out of this is to mentally include the director, the cameraman, the lights, etc. of the set of the horror movie each time I think of the horror scene.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Reading the postings... I tend to form mental images of everyone... somehow, such mental images changes with time.<br><br>For example, I used to think Hajime is a pretty well-built lady standing at 1.7 m or slightly less. Perhaps athletic, sporty and sporting a short hairdo. But now, after reading about her horror story with horror movies, I tend to think she is a petite, kawaii, sub-1.65 girl with shoulder-length hair.<br><br>As for Browniebaobao, I can't help but think she is a bubbly, happy go lucky type of person.<br><br>Shervon sounds like a pretty 'hip' person on the phone while her postings give me the impression that she is sophisticated. Very gan3 xing4 also.<br><br>Also, my guess of how Jieqi looked like was totally off the mark! I was quite surprised when I saw Jieqi on TV. I nearly flipped!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br>I don't have an ego problem but would be fun to know what your impression of me is like...<br><br>So... anyone else want to try guessing how the rest looks like?</div>

Winnie Hsin a.k.a. Xing Xiaoqi.<br><br>I thought she has got some really good songs... a newer one being 'tong2 hua4'.<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br></div></blockquote>Agree with tinker.  Winnie Hsin (Xin Xiaoqi) does have many good songs besides the better known Scent (Wei Dao)/ Understanding (Ling Wu).  Unfortunately, she had not spent enough time in this part of the world and few listeners here know her beyond these two great compositions.<br><br>Although I must say that it is heartening to know Love 972 does play her songs almost daily.<br><br>By the way, she is currently working on her new album and we can look forward to at least one new album from her within the year.  Hope that we have more oportunities to see her here this year.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Friends who wish to know more about this great vocalist can visit the following website.<br><br>http://www.winniehsin.net<br></div>

I am bad in forming impressions of people, so I will skip trying hehe...<br><br>I was singing Winnie Hsin's songs in KTV some days ago - Cheng Ren, Huang Tang and Tan Qing Kan Ai. I like Cheng Ren a lot, esp this sentence "xian gei ai de ren bing bu ke lian". This song is not so hysterical, very soothing and wen rou. I don't even like Wei Dao at all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I won some stuff from i-Weekly before too. The building is quite ulu in AMK industrial area. The nearest MRT station is Yio Chu Kang. Walking from YCK MRT to the building is about 20-30mins, with no shelter practically all the way. Or you can taking a bus (think 268 or something like that) near the MRT station for about 2-3 stops then walk another 5mins...erm, I also don't know how to describe leh...go www.streetdirectory.com.sg to look for the building ba.<br><br>Oh, I just finished Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code", and it was a great book, though some people may not like it for his controversial take on Christianity. But don't be mistaken, it's a suspense thriller, not a religion novel, just that the a fair bit of the story had some Christianity background. I just bought his other books because I like the way he built up his story. But I will finish the "The five people you meet in heaven" first. Haha, was reading other Chinese books before that, so that's why this book had to "queue" so long for my attention  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

If i am not wrong, I believe that tinker's message was left exactly a year ago. Coz it was in April 2003 when Winnie and some others from Rock braved SARS to perform here for NKF. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I am also very surprised to read that Hajime knows the song "Admit" (Cheng Ren).  I do not like Ling Wu.  Wei Dao is ok.  But i prefer other songs such as those in her album called "Every Woman".  Songs in this album reflect her true character more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know leh...the moment heard "Cheng Ren" for the very 1st time, I liked it very much. I think it was good she started out with "Ling Wu", because that gave her the attention which would otherwise be lacking if she started with songs like "Wei Dao" which had less impact. When I heard she was attached (to a younger fan), I thought she would "retire" from the scene, but now they broke up le, so she should be preparing some new work soon ba, since her album of Korean works was well-received.</div>
