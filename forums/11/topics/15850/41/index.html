So there we were, pushing and shoving in the crowd, only to see her breezing by.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  well, I have never embarked on any idol chasing before so I guess it was fun to a certain extent.<br><br>So, while I was waiting for Vivian, I didn't get to hear JQ's program. Only managed to catch some parts. Yap, he did mention he has not been coming to this thread. Well, guess its the old saying "There are no non-parting companions under the sky"<br><br>I guess he is right too....if he makes this a weekly obligation, it will soon be very stale in his life. No freshness, so routine, nothing to look forward to. Have our lives been in so much order that once a week is once too often?<br><br>regards<br><br>wisefool</div>

Never seen her Xie Zhen Ji before and although she's pretty, she doesn't appeal to me. I would have much prefer Rene Liu, which I'm sure JQ will be there too.

Of course not. In fact, its an unique experience. How many times in our lifes when we are listening to the radio and wishes to talk to someone about what we heard and we are actually able to do it? He connected us. Suddenly, I feel that I'm not actually someone with the weirdest musical taste around and there are actually people around who like the same songs as I do. Regardless of the bigness of the world, its actually not so lonely afterall. Regardless of the thousands of kilometers of cables connecting our computers, we are actally quite close to one another.<br><br>ok....am i too, talking sense? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>wisefool<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am trying to stay positive in my personal life but sadly the same still hasn't happened in my worklife... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Btw, good news for fans of oldies: Luo Da You will be coming to Singapore!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> He will be holding a concert in the Esplanade on 24 Jan 2004! So he'll sort of be celebrating CNY with us? Was quite surprised to hear the news as he had been very very low profile in the recent decade, but nonetheless I was glad. Even David Tao admitted Luo Da You had been a major influence to him. Haha my liking for LDY not because of David Tao, in case you are wondering  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> My most memorable LDY song is &lt;&gt; from "Ah Lang De Gu Shi" movie, so touching.  That was another song in the movie I quite like too, but I forgot the title le...I also like many of the songs he wrote for Pan Yue Yun...I think he likes PYY's voice, because I don't recall he writing that many songs for other singers.<br><br>I guess when JQ started out, he just wanted to share good songs, meaningful thoughts to like-minded people, but it seemed to gradually evolve into an obligation for him to perhaps do certain things? Actually I don't mind he goes back to the time when he didn't know the existence of this forum and just carry on playing and doing what he likes. He doesn't even need to host every week if it gets mundane, because the hosting stint is supposed to take stress off his daily work, no? It's back to guessing for us again if the coming weekend is a JQ slot, but I guess that's also part of the fun for us? The anticipation, the joy, the disappointment, the fulfilment...these basically sum up LIFE for almost all of us anyway. Hope JQ will be happy in whatever he does, jiu ke yi le...Finding joy in life is never easy, so hopefully all of us, including JQ, can treasure it when we are blessed enough to have it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i suppose when u get too used to doing something regularly, it becomes a habit..so much for listening in to jieqi's programs.<br>not nec a bad thing, as long as u enjoy it.<br><br>listenign to jieqi is not so much of a habit for me, firstly coz i dun really spend much time listening to radio nowadays.2ndly, it's actually an enjoyment, to hear these good songs u rarely hear on 933 at other times, and it's really a pleasure to know that there're still djs who appreciate and play good music for listeners like us.</div>

I like "2 dai dian li gong si" hosted by Cai Kang Yong, because I find it very interesting to see both sides debating certain issues. Eg. If the theme for the week is young mums, one side will comprise of all young mums and the other all older mums. They interact on issues faced by young mums, eg. whether they are doing certain things right, how are their feelings on being a mum at a young age, the advice they dispense to the viewers as a guo lai ren, etc. Sometimes it does lapse into senseless arguments especially when there are many females there, but their views are quite insightful.<br><br>Cai Kang Yong's hosting style is quite versatile and unthreatening. I always want to catch his "zhen qing zhi shu" but many a time I just forget the timing and end up missing it. Unlike Zhang Xiao Yan's "xiao yan you yue", his zqzs usually feature behind-the-scene people like the directors. He also hosted last year's "Golden Horse Awards" with DoDo Cheng and they will be doing so again this year. "2 dai dian li gong si" and himself were also recognised in this year's "Golden Bell Award". One thing I also admire is that he is brave enough to come out of the closet like Da Bing. Apparently this did not affect their popularity much.<br><br>Haha asif I am writing his biography...no lah, just want to fen xiang xin qing mah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Friday le...YEAH! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
