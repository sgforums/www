            <div class='col-md body'>Two more days to Saturday.... did Jieqi mention what time he will be hosting this Saturday? Anybody any idea?<br><br>Maybe for those who write to him or managed to cal him, we can suggest that he announce what time he will be hosting on the following Saturday.<br><br>As for the 'outing', I am really not sure if he can/will join us. (You know, he is some kind of a celebrity. ) The fact is, I did go down to his office and see if it was possible to talk to him. According to the lady at the front counter, he is very busy and I have to make an appointment and stuff like that. Figured that he is a really busy man so didn't want to bother him anymore.<br><br>Well, the outing is sill worth a try lah.... I don't think he is the 'tau' type so if he can make it, he would most probably join us. Even if he can't join us, most of us will very much like to meet up with the rest of the gang.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>12 May is a good day... except that there wil be the FA Cup final between Liverpool and Arsenal.

So... you guys please go ahead.....<br><br>Jo &gt; I believe EVERYBODY is invited. So please join in if you can.

You know, he is probably a very very busy man and he is probably trying very hard to fit 4 hours on a Saturday just to host the show.<br><br>Did Jieqi mention anything important on last Saturday's show?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just noticed that Sherv's signature on this forum is an excerpt from Faye's "Eyes on Me" (EoM)<br><br>I've always thought EoM was a classic- one that will go down in history and last for a looooong time. If you have seen the 'MTV' and with the song playing, you'll know what I mean. I can't forget the scene where the flower petals were showering down. Never knew a PC game can have a theme song of such quality.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't recall hearing Jieqi air EoM. Wonder why? Is it becos he hasn't notice it or becos he didn't like it enough to air it?<br><br>Music taste can be so similar in one sense but yet differ so much in another.......<br><br>One more thing: for those of you who chat online, we can actually meet up in IRC or somewhere else online before the 12th. Just a suggestion.... personally, I don't chat anymore.</div>
