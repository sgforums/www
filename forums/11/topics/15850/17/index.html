            <div class='col-md body'>Didn't catch JieQi last week, but hopefully this week I'll be able to tune in. Wah, I don't mind going back to study, but now finances a bit the tight...<br><br>I bought some books over the weekend, including JiMi's "Xing Yun Er", I am only starting on JiMi after the hype has died down. Maybe I should start on Le Petit Prince too. I am looking forward to reading Huang Lei's book. I enjoy his shows and songs a lot. He can't sing well, but his songs are so reflective of his "shu1 juan4 wei4", they are a joy to listen to. It's like reading Chinese classics or Xu Zhi Mo's poems. His "Ye4 Ben1" is one of my most favourite movies.<br><br>Recently Wan Fang and a lot of older artistes are making a comeback. Frankly, I'd rather they just release their old compilations and not relaunch their careers, the feeling is somehow not there anymore. Wang Jie's new album I bought purely for support, because Wo Bi Ta Hao is definitely nowhere like Dian Ji Zhe Yi Xie, Shi Ni Shi Ni Shi Ni or Wang Le Ni Wang Le Wo.<br><br>Oh, LA Boyz released a compilation. Quite happy to see it, I used to like them a fair bit. People who want to take a listen to one of David Tao's earlier production efforts can give it a try. He has been producing (with Luo Bai Ji) for LA Boyz since their first "Shiam!" album. Cheers, Jeffrey, Stanley and Steven. Tension's new album out soon too, hope it will be a good sophomore work from them.<br><br>Cheers to all for a good start to the month of June. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

Wait till I really become jobless then I'll seek refuge in grad school...<br><br>And if you want to read the Le Petit Prince, you might want to read it in English instead of Chinese. English is closer to French and you probably won't 'lose' too much to the translation reading it in English. But then, a lot of it depends on whose translation you use. I tend to trust Penguin better when it comes to translation. The best is still to read it in French lah.<br><br>Well, I am not too big a fan of Xu Zhi Mo... 'cos the modern free verse poetry doesn't appeal to me too much. Prefer the classical poems better... those with the rhymes especially. But still, his prowess is obvious.<br><br>Anyway, I like the way Huang Shujun recites "wo shi tian kong li de yi pian yun..." at the beginning of the wu2 yan2 ge1.<br><br>And yes, I like things with shu1 juan4 wei4 very much... I find it most intoxicating... A fantasy of mine is to have a study, with the Chinese bamboo curtain (zhu2 lian2), Japanese paper lantern, shelves and shelves of books, and a nice midi compo with all the nice nice songs. Of course, a pot of Chinese tea will be good. Time to pay more attention to Huang Lei's songs...<br><br>Another fantasy of mine is to read books under a tree with falling red/orange leaves in autumn. Unfortunately, that cannot happen in Singapore.</div>

Thankfully, I could tune in to Jieqi's on Saturdays to hang on to whatever shreds of sanity I still have.<br><br>And... it is after working through a few weekends did I realise how much effort it is for Jieqi to come in on Saturdays. (Not to mention the occassional bonus Sundays.)<br><br>Since my uni days, I kinda know to some extent what it means to work on Saturdays and could appreciate Jieqi for doing that. (And hence the birth of this thread.) BUT, it is after working did I realize how excruciating it is to <strong>consistently</strong> put in extra hours <strong>almost every </strong>Saturday.<br><br>Well, if I 'disappear' for a while, you can say that I am stuck with work but I will definitely be reading your postings.... and of course, tune in at the right time on Saturdays.</div>
