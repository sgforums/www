            <div class='col-md body'>39 pages and still counting...<br><br>On the question of whether I got Jieqi's email eventually, the answer is NO. Somehow, I didn't keep up with the efforts to find his email. I think it is good enough he knows about this thread and drops by occassionally. It's a bit like my relationship with my good friends... we don't meet up often, but when we do, we have a great time and I will literally drop everything just to support them when they are in trouble. Like what my friends say about me- my friendship is not obvious but it certainly is there.<br><br>Incidentally, I managed to correspond with Bukoh Mary for a while. She actually replies to EVERY mail. I like artistes like that... not stuck up. Hers was easy 'cos they actually have a facility to drop emails to deejays.<br><br>good to see you again attitude.... wonder where Zilchster is too. otterised, liyan, ...<br><br>perhaps we should really have an outing... more about this in my future post.

So... I am probably too shy to show up for outings. Inferiority complex maybe?<br><br>And... my understanding about outings (especially irc channel outings) is that once there is an outing, chances are, the channel collapses. It's like the people will evaporate together with the sense of mystery. Also, outings are often debased by desperados as fishing trips to get to know gals, or insurance agents who want to cut a quick deal. It would really pain me to see that this thread of ours be reduced to just another avenue for exploitation. I suppose there have been too many bad expereinces with IRC channels that were painstakingly built only to be exploited.<br><br>Just hope that people with not so honourable intent will stay clear or leave on their own accord when they understand the objective and spirit of this thread.<br><br>Honestly, I would prefer that this thread of ours would perpetuate and remain <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"totally different though...cool-headed..mature...focused...a joy to read". </strong></span><br>---------------------<br><br>On a more personal note, I won't mind meeting up with Shervon, Browniebaobao, Hajime and the rest to personally thank them for being there. Seriously, your presence has been a most delightful present.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To a certain extent ya, not meeting does present a mysterious aura. Usually a channel collapses after meeting is because the people will have each other's contacts then they will meet up rather than still talk virtually. Not meeting will make it more xi shui chang liu, but some people may after that disappear then won't know how to contact them anymore. I feel lucky that I am still in touch with some worthy online friends even though we don't meet each other online anymore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>There will be a year-end count-down concert in the Padang. There will be some Hype Records artists which mean Dreamz FM will be there! But not sure I can go or not...For those interested, it's $10 per person with special discounts for Hang Ten members. I still remember the Dreamz FM mini-concert I attended some years ago in Downtown East. It's just DFM, their music and us. A pity it was the first, and seem to be their last...at least so far...I still support Dreamz FM so hope they will be able to release new albums in the near future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Haha I work in neither Sistic nor Ticketcharge. I just happen to pay more attention in case I miss some good ones. Btw, Corinne May will be holding a late nite concert in the Esplanade's recital studio on 26 Dec.<br><br>I just bought The Definitive Edition of "Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl". This new version is the one edited by her father to include some information which is now appropriate for release. It also included other previously unreleased materials. Hope I'll get the time to read "Tuesdays with Morrie" and "The Five People You Meet In Heaven", but there are still many unread books in my shelf...then I still bo liao went to library borrow some more books to read, really is dui bu qi my own books hahaha.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hope there will be JieQi this weekend...miss his program very much...Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>irc outings, i was very onz abt this with my 1st grp of irc frens, but there was some really bad experience then. well, perhaps tat channel dissolved partly bcoz of the changed r/ships after all of us met up. but another major reason was, we started being quite busy with our own lives, and gradually lost touch.......<br>can say, the bond wasn't strong enough to keep us together lor...........but there're a few frens who i still contact ocassionally.....<br><br>from then, i never expected myself to turn up for outings; i wanted net friends to remain as net friends. in the 2nd irc channel i chatted in, actually i didn't take their frenship very seriously, but still, call it fate, i eventually met up, wif some of the supposedly closer ones..and dunno y, tat 1st outing became a really big big outing, even pple whom i've never chatted b4 turned up!! and some of us continued to hang out together....until today.........which is like 4-5 yrs already........though the outings became less frequent, but there're many other ways we managed to keep in touch........and on and off, i made new frens via them, via irc etc...we're still frens now, and some of us even became really good frens.......i count myself as very lucky to have kept all these pals, who stepped into my life during a very difficult period..........<br><br>in my view, pple come n go in your life, if it's not meant to be, juz let go; no use holding on so tight to something that dun belong to u; wat matters is, u had and u cherish the memories u once held, for no one can change the memories.<br><br>another off-the-point thing i wanna bring out, dunno abt u guys, but for me, most of the close frens i've now, our frenship developed becoz of the cyberspace. it's amazing, and ironical, cyberspace was supposed to be a virtual world, which u can't take it too serious, yet, i made true frens thru this virtual world.</div>

Usually a channel collapses after meeting is because the people will have each other's contacts then they will meet up rather than still talk virtually. Not meeting will make it more xi shui chang liu, but some people may after that disappear then won't know how to contact them anymore. I feel lucky that I am still in touch with some worthy online friends even though we don't meet each other online anymore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>There will be a year-end count-down concert in the Padang. There will be some Hype Records artists which mean Dreamz FM will be there! But not sure I can go or not...For those interested, it's $10 per person with special discounts for Hang Ten members. I still remember the Dreamz FM mini-concert I attended some years ago in Downtown East. It's just DFM, their music and us. A pity it was the first, and seem to be their last...at least so far...I still support Dreamz FM so hope they will be able to release new albums in the near future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Haha I work in neither Sistic nor Ticketcharge. I just happen to pay more attention in case I miss some good ones. Btw, Corinne May will be holding a late nite concert in the Esplanade's recital studio on 26 Dec.<br><br>I just bought The Definitive Edition of "Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl". This new version is the one edited by her father to include some information which is now appropriate for release. It also included other previously unreleased materials. Hope I'll get the time to read "Tuesdays with Morrie" and "The Five People You Meet In Heaven", but there are still many unread books in my shelf...then I still bo liao went to library borrow some more books to read, really is dui bu qi my own books hahaha.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hope there will be JieQi this weekend...miss his program very much...Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>hey hey...<br>I read Tuesdays with Morrie, it's quite a good read..<br>I'll want to get "The Five People You Meet in Heaven" as well, since Kino has the 20% coupon thing..<br></div>

To be frank, D Usher's version is so much nicer than the Chinese one =P Rene was trying to shift from her previous xiao nu ren image to a more "experimental" one under her new co, but I feel she not really suited lor...though I applaud her hands-on efforts as a producer in her new album. If you haven't heard of David Usher's version, go listen to it. There was a time I played it on "repeat" mode everyday for a whole week.
