Welcome aboard! Care to intro? Age? Gender? Occupation?<br><br>What song did you request?<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Something silly happened and I missed Zou Zai Ta Jie De Nu Zi *AGAIN*. Beginning to feel like a born loser.<br><br>Yah... looking on the bright side, I am glad it was just a few songs I missed and not the entire programme.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Well, I thought the song selection was exceedingly good today. I just sat in front of the radio, dazed and on high, for more than 3+ hours, absorbing the songs.<br><br>Nothing much to complain about.<br><br>My sis was complaining Jieqi talked too much! She even added that he spoilt Lan Xinmei's "bu4 pa4 fu4 chu1" by talking during the song's kuo4 men2! (No offense hor, Jieqi. Different people happen to like different things. We will still tune in to your program next week) The mood these days isn't too good and I can understand Jieqi's wish to share his thoughts.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I was very surprised he aired 'Friends'. It's a song I like a lot during my teens. I like the lyrics very much, especially "That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends". It tells me it is better to forgive and forget and embrace those whom we call friends but have hurt us by accident 'cos we don't have that much time to be friends. BTW, Michael W Smith is a Gospel singer and Friends is actually a church song. I just want to state here that I am not in anyway making a religious statement here. I am sure this is the case for all the radio stations too.<br><br>Here is the lyrics of Friends:<br><br>Packing up the dreams what God planted<br>In the fertile soil of you<br>Can't believe the hopes He's granted<br>Means a chapter in your life is through<br><br>But we'll keep you close as always<br>It won't even seem you've gone<br>Cause our hearts in big and small ways<br>Will keep the love that keeps us strong<br><br>(CHORUS)<br>And friends are friends forever<br>If the Lord's the Lord of them<br>And a friend will not say "never"<br>Cause the welcome will not end<br>Though it's hard to let you go<br>In the Father's hands we know<br>That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends.<br><br>With the faith and love God's given<br>Springing from the hope we know<br>We will pray the joy you'll live in<br>Is the strength that now you show<br><br>But we'll keep you close as always<br>It won't even seem you've gone<br>Cause our hearts in big and small ways<br>Will keep the love that keeps us strong<br><br>(CHORUS)<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>here's a suggestion to Jieqi to squeeze in more songs...<br><br>If the DJ can decide what songs to play for Xian4 Chang3 Yi4 Xiao3 Shi2 (XCYXS), Jieqi can actually 'kelong' and make it such that is is all the nice nice songs he wants to play BUT have to find the live version lah...<br><br>Today's medley of Leslie's songs for XCYXS was a really good idea.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Browniebaobao: Sorry I wasn't able to use my computer until now... so didn't manage to log in in the afternoon.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In a nutshell, Jieqi outdid himself on 12 Apr 03.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yerp... there is lots of gloom but hey, there's music too. Not sure about the others but whenever I am down, all I need is  a nice piece of music (be it contemporary pop or classical), and I can feel my worries melt away, replaced by a certain cold, detached calmness that can see the situation in the proper light. And more often than not, hope is born and solutions stumbled upon in time.<br><br>And... SM Lee Kuan Yew also mentioned in his memoirs about music being able to uplift the mood, the spirit. Can't help but agree.<br><br>There are some songs with pretty encouraging lyrics, like Ah Mei's Lu3 Cheng2 and Wang2 Jie2's Lu4. But well, somehow, sad love songs will work for me too! So Jieqi can play all the sad sad love songs and I won't complain!<br><br>In short, music does wonders. And the job of musicians and singers and deejays becomes pretty important if you see music in that way.<br><br>To sum it all, here's an excerpt :<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>Which is the hot condition of their blood;<br>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze<br>By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;<br>Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,<br>But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>The man that hath no music in himself,<br>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<br>Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<br>The motions of his spirit are dull as night<br>And his affections dark as Erebus:<br>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.<br></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Act V Scene 1</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't log in on weekends, at least not until Sun night. I seldom listen to 933 programs except for JieQi's one, but I am now breaking the norm. It's nearly midnight, and good songs are abound. Sandy's "Zou Zai Da Jie De Nu Zi" had just ended, now is my fave Jeff Chang's song of all time "Teng Ni De Xin", which was written by Roy Li Fei Hui. I like this even more than the other composition of his, "Ai Ru Chao Shui". I heard of Roy's own version of "Ai Ru Chao Shui" (which was under another title), and the lyrics and rendition is nowhere as good as Jeff's  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Wonder who is hosting now...<br><br>And now is Valen Hsu's "Po Xiao" which is really a nice song too...have a beautiful night..."guan shang men chuang, suo zhu chang ye man man...pei ni yi tuan, que pei shang wo yi sheng yi han..."</div>

The computer dummy here needs help on all these advanced stuff.<br><br>------------<br><br>Yerp... Finally heard Sandy Lam's Zou Zai Da Jie De Nu Zi (a capella version). Well, I must say, it was a breath of fresh air. I just turned up the volume of my radio and blasted it. Gotta thank Jieqi for it!<br><br>Sandy Lam's voice is so magical don't you think so?<br><br>Hey hey... did you hear? The Seven guy is actually Jieqi's "comrade in arms" back in NS. They were from MDC apparently.<br><br>Yah... I still would like to know which secondary school and jc Jieqi went to. I think it is Chinese High (or some SAP school) and then Hwa Chong.<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>I think the Mian2 Yang2 Dang3 on weekend nights is not bad also. They talk quite a bit but the music is quite nice. And if you call in, you can even get a serial number.<br><br>Honestly, I really miss the original 933 where they really talk very very little and play lots of nice songs. The "ge duo hua shao, ting ge bu shou gan rao" era. But well, it's not too bad nowadays... with the jiu lian huan... and of course, our weekly dose of opiate dished out by Jieqi...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
