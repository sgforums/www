Where?  I was at Pasir Ris beach..hehe..<br>Ya, i think it is Li Fei Hui...got to ask JieQi because i was on my way back home too..was in underground tunnel then.  When the train came out of the tunnel, i heard the last part of the song..<br>Under stress..there are pros and cons lah.  I worked before too...I chose to go back to study.   No matter where you go, there will always be people who are not pleased with you lah..It's also dog-eat-dog environment in school..Results too good is also an eyesore to some people.  Jealousy...haiz..<br>You can alwsays go back to school right?   Perhaps no more morning lessons, no more uniforms, no more naggings by teachers etc..but as long as you like it and are keen on it, you can always upgrade youreself right?  All the best to you!<br>I will be staying at home this weekend.  However, i don't think i will come online.  My radio will definitely be on ya.<br>Take care people!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>

Mr Bean is no longer there at Tiong Bahru Plaze but i can still find it in Clementi.  Just opened not long ago.   Got a craving for the 3-in-1 riceball today..hehe..Will get a bowl on Monday.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   The taste is of course, different lah..sometimes people like a song or food because he can find memories in them.<br>As for Feng Ling Bubble Tea Restaurant, well, it's a pity.  I like that place...used to sit by the window...the table near the cashier..was able to see cute kittens playing outside, purring away...<br>Those were the days...It's a fact that things keep changing but perhaps people change much faster..Maybe your are right, we have the memories.  Who knows, memories will fade someday..Right?</span></div>
