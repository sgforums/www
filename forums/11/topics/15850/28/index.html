            <div class='col-md body'>Many singers cover Sarah McLachlan's &lt;&gt; before but the original still sounds best. It's such a hauntingly nice song, though I'm a bit surprised now then JieQi recommended it to us. Maybe he's too obsessed with Norah Jones before this! hehe kidding... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I watched Happy Sunday some weeks ago and spotted Huang Xiao Hu on the program. Such a good singer gone waste because of "no looks, no luck". I still remember her receiving the Best Newcomer award from previous year winner Sky Wu (who happened to be her mentor and wrote some songs for her too) and feeling so happy that a good singer was duly recognised. Turned out the Best Newcomer award was "cursed" for many of the recipients, eg. Kong Ling Qi, whose achievements were remarkedly much pale than the others who did not win it. &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;...are such classics. Oh she released a live album recently, right? But can't seem to find it...can't find Jiang Hu's album yet too, though I've heard about it from several friends already... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I agree studying is very very important in the paper-mad Singapore. I have friends working in stat boards who have not been able to move up the ranks because of their lack of paper qualifications despite proven track record and impressive appraisals. Some had been told bluntly in the face that they should not be asking for raises and promotions when they can't even study properly. How lame, but sadly true. Study as much as you can, even though eventually you end up working in a job which has nothing to do with your field of study, because employers just want to see the PhD, MBA, BBA, BSc... in your CV. So realistic hoh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So JieQi will be hosting late night slots soon hoh? Hmm, the good thing is that I'm usually at home then so at least I won't miss his programs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I have my dreams, I'm still working hard and not giving up...Things might get better next year...Right now, I'm doing well..Of course I want paper qualifications ar, Sg is afterall, a very realistic place..Look, doesn't mean that the more certs, the higher educated you are, you will get better pay.  That's a very wrong perception hor!  Heard from my ex-colleagues and those in NS..see their salary..What is diploma as compared to cert from techinical institution?<br><br>Study and study...dunno how to think...always think straight, then study for what???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   It's a feeling of being 'protected' and bei4 gui1 ding4..BGD do this, BGD do that...kids since young, have been told that it's good to be a doctor, lawyer etc...then so called 'inspired' to study hard and get a good cert etc...Dun want the future generations to follow our footsteps..haiz..Look at the kids nowadays..so young wear specs, schedule packed with piano lessons, tuition etc..really no freedom..At my parents' time, they were still able to play with mud etc leh...nowadays kids play computer games..Isn't it sad?<br><br>My cousin is here...got something to do liao.....Sorry if I sounded 'fierce'.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   To sum up, qualification is not the most important thing afterall.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember hearing the English DJs pronouncing it as "Mc-cluck-learn".<br><br>SARS may be back, so you guys better take care. I only hope it will not hamper my holidays coming up in less than 2months' time after all the planning efforts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>bbb: I'm sure many people do have dreams. No one would be asked to give up their dreams - it's their own lives, they were just advised that paper qualifications will be a good back-up if things do not work out well. Dreams many a times cannot dang fan chi, but if you really want to, make sure you are able to put a bowl of rice for you and your family before pursuing your dreams.<br><br>Andy Lau is a good example. He had longed to shoot movies in the way he liked but would definitely not sell. So he worked and worked and worked in many movies which he didn't enjoy but could provide him the earnings. Finally he was at a stage where he decided he could pursure his dreams while making sure his family had enough to get by, he set up  a movie company and produced movies which he liked. Some of them won critical accolades (eg."Made in HK" by Fruit Chen) but all bombed in box office. Still he was happy he could fulfil his dreams without having to compromise his family's upkeep. His company eventually folded, but I think he might make a comeback again.<br><br>Just trying to say that you don't have to give up your dreams, but one needs to find a balance / trade-off to fulfill your dreams and at the same time will not make your loved ones worry about the next meal. Afterall the dreams are all yours, but your family is yours too. It would not be fair that while you actualise your dreams, your loved ones' tummies have to suffer because of that, right?<br><br>Entrepreneurship is not that easy too. I had a friend who started a shop with her friend not long after graduation, while her fiance (now her husband) was the only one actually making money and contributing to the household because she spent all her savings on the shop. He also had to do the household chores because being an entrepreneur meant she was engaged day to night everyday and had no time at all. However, the shop eventually folded and she had no personal savings left. Of course her husband did not blame her since he encouraged to her to fulfil her dreams in the first place. However, she felt guilty that for the sake of wanting to fulfil her dreams, not only she did not contribute much for the family, she had to make her husband worry. She eventually made a decision. She now holds down a regular 9-to-6 job and lives a prudent lifestyle, but she's not giving up her dreams, just that she decided that will come later. She weighed her priorities and decided to start contributing to the household but at the same time save up to a target when she can start pursuing her dreams again. (frankly, entrepreneurship in some extent has to have some capital to start on)<br><br>Haha sounds like preaching, but it's laying to you what the real world holds. I know there are cases of successful entrepreneurs, but for every successful one, there can be hundreds of failed ones. Where will the means of support come from for the families of the failed ones? Unless you come from a rich family (who can self-support) or are no-string-attached (no families), I guess it's something we had to face up to in reality.<br><br>Just some experience to share with you. You can take it as just a read and ignore it, but perhaps it can also provide you with more details of the what-ifs when you eventually want to take the plunge.</div>

Feel tat study so much is a waste of time, but given a choice and with cash, I will want to go back to school to study again and enjoy the process of studying.<br><br>BBB, a minimum qualification is important. But do what you ultimately want to do with your life, what makes you happy and make you feel that you have not live your life in vain.<br><br>Right now, I'm still doing my soul-searching, reading a lot and listening to lotsa different kind of music to discover myself and what I want to do with my life. I know I don't want to be just a nobody and so I'm still trying to figure out what is the 'Somebody' I want to be.<br><br>Ono Lisa's recently albums are quite nice. But I feel her best album I've ever heard is a jazz album by title "Dream" - Y1999. Her rendition of ''As Time Goes By' is simply beautiful and soulful. Taiwanese fren brought from Taiwan. I can't find it in Singapore at all. Intend to order and import it.</div>
