LoL..Well, I read through those threads before too and I also asked Shervon whthether they eventually get to meet up with JieQi.  Well, sad to say, No.  Hee hee..But some of us personally met up with JieQi in some special occasions.  Well for me, I  went to catch him at a drama,  on 2 Nov 2000.  I met him again at 933's 13th birthday.  Hee hee..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  And if you are wondering whether we, the forummers here, ever met up.

Do join us here whenever you can. ^^<br><br>I muz say JieQi has penetrated into our lives..not all, but most of us here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome aboard / home!<br><br>Personally, I am amazed that this thread survived. I mean, I haven't really started that many threads (two if I recollect correctly, one for Jieqi, the other for Bukoh Mary) and neither was anyone paid to do this. It astounds me. Well, there are times when things go quiet and you don't see new posts for some time. Just hang in there and keep it going and wala... you get all the Browniebaobao's in the world appearing.<br><br>I guess it is the same with life, you just need to hang on during bad patches until you turn the corner.<br><br>Ã‰Â½Ã‡Ã®Ã‹Â®Â¾Â¡Ã’Ã‰ÃŽÃžÃ‚Â·Â£Â¬Ã�Ã¸Â°ÂµÂ»Â¨ÃƒÃ·Ã“Ã–Ã’Â»Â´Ã¥<br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>Meeting with Jieqi? Well, the closest was back in 2000 or some time there where I was having my attachment in the same building as Caldecott Publications where Jieqi was based FOR HALF A YEAR. I actually went down to the office and asked the recept if I could have a few words with Jieqi. According to her, Jieqi wasn't in and "he is very busy" (mandarin). From then on, I told myself I just needed to tune in, support him, send him emails or post threads...<br><br>I certainly wouldn't mind meeting him... but won't go out of the way to do that.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br>Oh yes... sunset over NUS... something I owe Sherv for so long liao... 3 years.<br><br>Anyway, I find it hard to believe that we have people who actually record Jieqi's program and archive them in tapes. Well, it's not such a bad idea isn't it. You know, we could actually digitise them into mp3 given the right hardware. A cassette player, an A/D convertor, a computer, mp3 coder etc. It can be done. You can even edit away the ad, call-in's, 4 D results etc.<br><br></div>
