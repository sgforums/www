Hoping to hold somebody in his arms while watching the fireworks..<br>Haiz..did not get the tickets this year..It's very contradicting...Always anticipating for the day to come, wanted to see the fireworks, but once it ended, there's sadness..To me, it means 'luo mu"(Ending)..</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tried to sing "Lai Bu Ji" once, but it was so difficult esp the zhuan ying at the chorus. Great song nonetheless, though the morgue in the MTV looked a bit chilling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>browniebaobao: have you read &lt;&gt;? I think that is a good introduction to Cai Zhi Hen. After that follow up with &lt;&gt;, then &lt;&gt;, and his most recent &lt;&gt;. I still prefer &lt;&gt; and &lt;&gt; though. XJS is very long, YMG is a bit bland.<br><br>I heard "Tian Tian Deng Tian Tian Wen" in JieQi's slot. Suddenly thought that this song is very "bitter" = ku3 qing2, because both Jiang Yu Hen and Ye Huan give me that impression, and the song itself - "wo jue ding pei ni dao lao gan ku guo yi sheng" = I decide to be with you for better or for worse forever till the end. Wah, ku shang jia ku. Then on Music Happening, coincidence or otherwise, Zhang Qing Fang sang Ye Huan's "Fang Ni De Zhen Xin Zai Wo De Shou Xin". Such a nice song... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Bought a few albums (including the Xinyao one) but didn't manage to listen to all yet. Shino's compilation was rather good, because the music variety was quite diverse and she can handle both fast and slow songs pretty well. My fave Shino's songs are "Xin Dong" and "Na You Ru He". Well, too bad she does not enjoy good marketing and image makeover like A*Mei, if not she will also be a "diva"=tian hou.</div>

Hmm, that's about the time I was really into Chinese music (modern pop). Of course, if you include the era of Liu Wen Zheng, Yu Tian, Li Mao Shan, Lin Shu Rong, etc, then I started even earlier  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, a note to those who like Hu Yan Bin and yet to buy his 1st album, please don't buy it! Because his new (2nd) album &lt;&gt; includes his 1st album! What a duh, I bought his 1st album too early liao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  But nonetheless, that was a good album.<br><br>&lt;&gt; is a fantastic double CD! Has many great songs in it, eg. Qi Yu's "Stories", Huang Yun Lin's "Lan Se Pi Jiu Hai", Wa Wa's "Wei He Meng Jian Ta", Pan Yue Yun's "Tian Tian Tian Lan", etc. Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I'm enjoying!  ^^  Know that JieQi is going to play  theme song of  later..very nice song!  I heard once only..but the lyrics is also well written...At first, I was hoping that they would use Cai Chun Jia's  as one of the theme songs..well, Yanzi also sing well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I went to watch HomeRun yesterday.  Very nice movie, xin suan and gan dong..that little girl is so poor thing..everytime see tears in her eyes, heart just twist a little.  Well, the ending is interesting..When you dun have shoes, you have a worry, when you have new white shoes, you will be afraid to dirty your shoes walking in the mud.  I read the article by our DJ here, aherm..Mr Liu JieQi on ..hehe...After watching, I was speechless for a while..Well, funny show but I realise how fortunate we are...Those kids in the show are worried about not having shoes to wear, whereas for us, we always want to wear nice nice, expensive shoes.  Some of my friends even wear once and throw...What a waste!  Have to reflect liao!<br>It rained heavily this morning..went out to have lunch with a buddy and was took a train home.  I missed the few songs as the train  was moving in the underground tunnel..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   But glad I managed to tune in to time to catch that song by Gu Ju Ji.."Ai qing jie shu wo he ni bao zhe ku........"<br>Composed a new ringtone last night,  by Eason Chen Yi Xun  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Now using..^^ </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think &lt;&gt; was socially immoral because it talks about one-night stand? Or one-day love..."24 xiao shi de ai qing shi wo yi sheng na wang de mei li hui yi" ; "zhi yao jin tian bu yao ming tian"; "zao gai ting zhi feng liu de you xi" etc. But it was a beautiful song. Miss Zhang Hong Liang in fact. I used to like to sing along to his &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;...<br><br>"sgforums" always loads very slow. Didn't get to listen to JieQi much as I was out, but was glad to hear &lt;&gt;Such a fab song, best listened when the sun is setting. Not in the morning though! Don't want to chu fa to workplace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Ya, &lt;&gt; was a nice song, though I prefer the part 2 - &lt;&gt;. "ai shang le jiu you ku, ai guo le jiu gu du", such heart-wrenching lyrics...Li4 Qi3 is a good singer but with not much luck or appreciative listeners. She has such a nice voice like Jiang Mei Qi, but xiao mei is considered so much luckier than her. Probably she is too low profile...wonder how is she doing now?<br><br>Heard a lot about "City of God" too. A movie about life in a Brazilian slum. Think it is out for quite long already, or that it was featured in one of the film fest. Well, I am not good in appreciating the "thinking" type of show, more into Mr Bean kind...superficial eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
