            <div class='col-md body'>That is &lt;&gt;. Aiyo, don't hate him lah, he's only portraying Xu Zhi Mo. Actually I don't hate Xu Zhi Mo too, because he is brave enough to live up to his life. He had to marry a woman whom he had not feelings for while he pined after another woman who was too afraid to pursue love like he did. He actually taught his wife (whom he later divorced) how to live her own life the way she wanted and not what her family dictated her to do. She went on to be an independent woman who took control of her life. Sadly, the woman whom he loved was not as brave. He ended up with a socialite woman who basically ruined his life. It was also so sad that he died in a plane crash at a young age of 32 while on the way to listen to and give support to his beloved woman to do her public speech.<br><br>Haha, fu xin ren ah? Don't know leh, to me it's not his fault that he had to marry someone whom he didn't have any feelings for, and being forced to have children with just so his family will be proud of it. If I were him, I also don't know whether I will be so brave, esp during those times. You should read some of his poems, you'll fall in love with them. His most famous should be "Zai Bie Kang Qiao" (Farewell Cambridge) - "qing qing de wo zou le, zheng ru wo qing qing de lai..."<br><br>Go watch Huang Lei's &lt;&gt;, it's much nicer...hehe unless you hate gays lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  because his tendencies inside abit the ai4 mei4...wonderful movie, lovely song ("Ye" - Elva).</div>

I find it romantic (They make it so beautiful..the daybreak Shanghai, the night Shanghai, the Shanghai with lots of beautiful fireworks..) and touching.

            <div class='col-md body'>Saw Shihan only once I think, during the Golden Mic some years ago (not the previous one). He was always quite by himself, and even left much earlier than most of them. Heard his "reason" for not attending many of the events was because he needs to travel back to Malaysia. Well, I guess he has his freedom of doing so, plus he is a very low profile person. What a pity, he is about the only male full-time DJ I like. Much more down-to-earth than most others...<br><br>Turf City is a very ulu place, really don't know why should people travel there at all. There many shops have closed down liao, so better pray his shop can take it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I still think a shop selling silver accessories should be more centralised in places like Far East Plaza where a lot of young people hang out. But in case got DK fans here want to support him, can go to D'Desire @ #01-32. Got a lot of pop star stuff on display for your viewing pleasure LoL.<br><br>Chen Sheng's books are like his music, either you fancy or you don't like it at all. The stories are rather zi yan zi you, tian ma xing kong, ni ni nan nan...quite relaxing to the mind, like reading the stories of a friend. Though my favourite book of his is the one he co-wrote with Cao Qi Tai - "Rang Wo Qian Zhe Ni De Shou", some insights into their friendship and how they deal with life.<br><br>Ya &lt;&gt; was the album title. I quite like that album leh, very wen2 xue2. It's like a songbook Xu Zhi Mo would have liked. The songs are quite literature-like. Quite unlike his previous albums which are more run-of-the-mill. I guess it is to da tie chen re for his Xu Zhi Mo role...but ya, I like the album <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Recently very into detective novels by Japanese authors. But since I am Japanese illiterate, so I have to go for the translated works. If you all going library, can spare a few mins help me see if the library you go to has many such books, because the one I went to (Toa Payoh) didn't stock many...thanks hoh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Weekend again!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
