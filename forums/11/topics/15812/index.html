            <div class='col-md body'>Heh, did any of you here catch JieQi's show on Sat (26/02)? That part where he jokingly called the songs that he ALWAYS play everytime he's hosting?<br><br>Dunno why some pple keep on complain that he always plays the same few songs... actually they are really nice songs, dun mind hearing them more often  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Like yesterday (sat), I was really sad and disappointed that afternoon... luckily Jie Qi was on that time, and upon hearing the nice songs that he played, I didn't feel that bad in the end.<br><br>How do you pple feel about his anthem?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jie qi has alwiz been one of my fave DJ. pity he is just a part-time. He plays fantastic songs. I didn't listen to tat day's prog, but I know some std songs he plays...esp Cai Li-er's "Zhi Xiang Dui Ni Shuo Yi Ju", &amp; Zhang AiJia's "Wo Zhan Zai Quan Shi Jie De Wu Ding".<br><br>A word to those who complain that he alwiz plays the same songs: this is bcoz it is the only chance us real music lovers will get to appreciate the nice songs. During other times, we have to subject ourselves to the overplayed hits. I love the songs he plays, and I hope he will continue to play those pure classics which will never be outdated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...he likes to play songs by certain singers, and these singers are usually very good ones... And I do like those singers too...<br><br>Guess wasn't that lucky and you guys who managed to catch him with Baobao... Baobao also my favourite... top is JieQi and Baobao, then Danny and Mary. Really missed BaoBao too... how I wish she can come back and part-time on weekends.<br><br>Another of his standard song is "Wo Dao Di Shu Hu Le Ni Se Mo"... can't remember the singer... but it's really a nice song too.<br>And he plays Huang Lei's "Bian Zo Bian Chan".<br>Not forgetting he plays those lovely jazz hits in the background!<br><br>Hope less pple will complain about him playing the same songs (not exactly true). If not, weekends won't be the same  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

And it really tells a story almost similar to Ji-mi's Turn Left Turn Right - in the song, both characters are lonely souls who live in the same building.

I think HSX did sing it in live performances before, but not recorded version. The Eric Moo version is with Huang Hui Zhen, who was also a XinYao pioneer now practising Chinese medicine/ acupuncture.<br><br>Hong Shao Xuan has many nice songs in the past. If interested, can find those Liang Wen Fu's / Xinyao's compilation which has a lot of HSX songs. Ni Shi Bu Shi Hai Zai is the title track for "Gui Dao", a movie by Robin Goh and Cai Li Lian which also had that Xie Hou version. His other nice songs include "Sui Yue De Ning Yi Zhang Lian", "Dan Yi Zhi Liang Liang De Ge", "Ni De Dao Ying" (with Yan Li Ming), etc. He was my fave Xinyao singer, together with Xu Nan Sheng and Zheng Zhan Lun (ZZL not really in the Xinyao pack, but around that time...).<br><br>Now Singaporean compositions have already lost a lot of the Singapore flavour and becoming rather globalised. Even Liang Wen Fu's compositions are going along the same route. (eg. Kit Chan "Ni Ku") Good or bad, I guess it's up to individual.</div>
