But is there a need to trample others to elevate its status? I think not. It hass already a stamp of approval all over it as good music, it doesn't need negativity of other music to reflect its superiority.<br><br>Especially the comparison, it's laughable. Comparing Hide with Jay Chou? It's like comparing Morning Musume or Tokio with Beyond, it's an ultimate insult to Beyond. J <strong>ROCK</strong> vs Chinese <strong>POP</strong>? How did you ever get to this point?</div>

It's really up to personal perspective. Being a japanese myself, sometimes the lyrics from jrock and jpop songs don't make a single sense.<br><br>Furthermore, I do listen and understand very well, both chinese and english songs. Frankly, some of them are real good and meaningful. Also,  modern jap music is greatly influence by western style and has adapted greatly from it. Please note the obvious similarities in their styles and genre. But, what's new everyone is doing it...<br><br>Like I said music is universal, so don't go around insulting others just becoz you think hide is cool. It only makes you look like a moron. Live and let live...it's a free world after all... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regarding about commercial sales look if you were a record producer, would produce something that the general public won't but and vice versa will you the general public buy something that does not have any selling power? Think about it?<br><br>Music like many other things is about making money nowadays, so tell me what feeds your dear hide's pocket and stomach as a musician. Music or record sales? If his music does not sell...he will be most probably out looking for work...<br><br>It's not about whose values..it's more about facts and rationale..</div>

Of course, everyone have their own opinions, but that doesn't mean you have to go around bashing others while voicing them out.<br><br>I myself am a fan of hide and X Japan for 8 years and still counting, but I do not compare them with other singers and bands. Why? It's not fair. Different people have different views on music so as different artistes have different genres of music.<br><br>Peace ^^v<br><br>PS: Seshiro, FYI, hide is there *points to sky*</div>
