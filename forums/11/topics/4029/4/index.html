            <div class='col-md body'>i had been quite ignorant abt music varieties and it is david tao who taught me what is R&amp;B... but i was pretty disappointed with his second album, which no matter what, can't match up with his first album.... but i think he's really a good composer... esp like that yi ye qing and jin si dun de meng xie that he wrote for other ppl...<br><br>As for Jay, i think he's pretty talented... i'm not only saying abt his own songs, but also songs that he wrote for other ppl... personally, i dun listen to the lyrics as much as the melody... and thou he sings in his own muffled, inaudible way, ppl will still take the time to read what he's singing... doesn't it make him a success?? he's able to make u interested in what he's singing even thou it's inaudible...<br><br>For Lee Hom, i had always been prejudiced against him... cos i can't imagine how can someone who looks good, can write and sing so well too... hahaha.... but he did, and well, what can i say... he's talented... like a lot of his songs, that's why i bought his compliation instead of all those individual albums...<br><br>Harlem... he's so funny.... in his hosting of super sunday... hehehe... but of course he's got some really great songs too... like his shu xi and all those songs mentioned b4... so it's not qing fei de yi that make me knows him....<br><br>but to make me choose between the 4 is really difficult...<br>i like each of their songs.... well, out of the 4, i have heard 3 of them sing live... have to say, their live singing is quite good... lee hom, harlem.... jay, as usual, u wun know what's he's singing.... and for david tao, i heard his live mini concert over 933 once and he sang out of tune for a song.... makes me a bit disappointed....</div>
