            <div class='col-md body'>David Tao is my choice. The definitive of a R&amp;B pioneer in Chinese music scene. Alex To did have R&amp;B elements in his music earlier than David, but to me, he is more like a disco king hehe...<br><br>I much prefer LeeHom in his earlier days, with "Qing Di Bei Duo Fen", "Ru Guo Ni Ting Jian Zhen Shou Ge", etc...But then, his music was not recognised until around the "Gong Zhuan Zhi Zhuan" album. That is when he started to become commercialised... sigh..<br><br>Jay Chou is not totally R&amp;B, but he is pretty talented. Though I admit I can't understand a single word he mumbles unless I look at the lyrics hehe. But again, who can mumble like he does? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Harlem is not R&amp;B, and again, I much prefer his older songs like "Rang Wo Yi Ci Ai Ge Gou" and "Gai Bian Suo You De Cuo". His popularity dipped after that though, and he switched to hosting, and occasionally releasing songs like "Kao Jing", "Qing Kai Chuang" which were not bad, but did not make him really popular until "Qing Fei De Yi". Before the song, his nomination in awards were always the "supporting role" - good enough to be nominated, but yet not good enough for the award that kind. So the Best Male award is sort of long overdue, I guess..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personal comments on those whom you feel have got talents but no luck: (long message, you'll need patience to finish it)<br><br>********<br><br>-Sky Wu-<br>Hit the scene with his debut album "Ai Yao Zen Me Shuo" in 1989. In fact, he was one rare case of a Taiwanese singer who gained his popularity overseas (in this case, Singapore) before he was accepted by the Taiwanese fans (PS: does that mean that fans in the 80s/90s had a mind of their own rather than those nowadays?). Anyway, all his zhu da songs hit the peaks of local charts, esp the "Te Bie De Ai Gei Te Bie De Ni" album. Was firm with his principle of releasing materials only when he was satisfied with it, which means one album a year. With the birth of his child, he mellowed considerably as seen in "Xin Dong Le". Had since reclused much to his own world and released an album on an on-off basis. Last seen as an audience in Golden Melody awards.(One can't say that he was not popular before, he was pretty hot stuff back then. Perhaps some fans were not old enough to witness it then?)<br><br>-David Tao-<br>1st album did not catch much heat, listeners only knew of "10.30 airport", until the popularity of "Ai Hen Jian Dan" caught on with the listeners (weird case this one, coz there was no publicity of this song on the record company part, but the song just became popular out of the blue). Not much news after his 2nd album, and fans could only appease their hunger pangs for him by listening to his "offspring" - Tension. But still, nothing like the real stuff from the Master.<br><br>-Julia Peng-<br>"Jiu Meng" threw her into the limelight, and suddenly retro was everywhere. Stepped on her own foot after venturing into unknown territory with "Qiao Qiao Wo De Tou". She is no Tanya, mind you. People still prefer to listen to her singing the ballads like "Zou Zai Hong Tan Na Yi Tian" and "Xiang Jian Hen Wan".<br><br>-Valen Hsu-<br>Valen released "Tao Hao" without much fanfare, but with "Lei Hai", Boom! Yun style singing became the "in" thing. Had a lot of successes with follow-ups like "Ru Guo Yun Zhi Dao" but after she changed company, the heat just died down. Heard her company was seriously affected by retrenchment, so maybe that's why there was not a lot of publicity for her releases. Pity, "Zhi Shuo Gei Ni Ting" was nice. Now into drama acting.<br><br>-You Hong Ming-<br>"Lian Shang Yi Ge Ren" is his most famous song, I guess? "Wu Yue De Xue" was not bad too, but listeners just couldn't warm up to him much. "Lian Shang Ning Yi Ge Ren" would be a good song if not for the snippets of "Lian Shang Yi Ge Ren". Totally unnecessary and spoil the song!<br><br>-Mavis Hee-<br>"Ming Zhi Dao" introduced her to local listeners. Hit Taiwan with "Yi Han". Sang many drama serials' theme songs. "Cheng Li De Yue Guang" was perhaps the song which most locals really love, because it was a really heart-warming song. Wrote a song (hope I got my facts right) "Ji Tuo" which Zheng Zhan Lun sang, but after that she took it back to sing to good effect. However, "Hong Yan" was a poor effort.<br><br>-William So-<br>HE WAS POPULAR!! KTV songs KING! "Nan Ren Bu Gei Rang Nu Ren Liu Lei" hit everywhere. Hit another high with "Yue Wen Yue Shang Xin". Many memorable songs in between too, like "Jiu Ai Hai Shi Zui Mei" and "Ru Guo Zhe Shi Wo Ai Zui Hao De Ju Li". Pity his music not variety enough, but I guess it's better for him to stick to what he does best...<br><br>-Tanya Chua-<br>Tanya started out as the female version of Wu Bai with her angst-filled compositions, and did a admirable job composing for other singers too. However, her works mellowed and lost much of her angst after she met with her boyfriend (Buppo?). Still, her talents are still out there for all to see, especially with the recent nomination in Golden Melody. She might not have won it, but at least one know that she was really nominated for good composition, not just there to fill up a vacancy.<br><br>********<br><br>Ok, apologies for the long para, but just need to justify certain things : Not popular now does not mean was never popular before.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Hajime (edited 14 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank Hajime :<br>Actually what you had said were true.<br>Some of them gained the popularity and fame before but that was because one or two of their songs are good, like Sky Wu - " fen Xian" , " xin dong le" ...... , but after that not many people remember them.<br><br>Let say between Fave Wong and Mavis Hee, once their names are being mentioned , most people would have had a immediate thought of Faye Wong rather then Mavis Hee.<br><br>However, those who are in The third category actually can overcome those in secong and first categories , but they are lack of luck. Anyway , the above list were concluded  based on the trends of anually chart songs over Hong Kong, Taiwan, China , Singapore and Malaysia. They might be incomplte, just for sharing and disccusing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I would say David Tao...He has a more easy and natural style and lets not forget he helped kickstart "Tension" as well... Anyone in the business would know how difficult it is to produce and conceptualise an album...<br><br>HIs style is the also the least contrived of the four. Lee Hom has a terrible way of singing sometimes which marred the presentation of the song. Sometimes his musicianship as well as music accompaniment for certain songs overshadow his singing... Less is more for his case. Harlem Yu tries to hard sometimes and has too much of a nasal quality to his voice. I think Yin Yue jiao Fu (roughly translated as the maestro of music for Taiwan) is too hyperbolic and overrated. Jay Chou has a very unique style and I would give him credit for his composing talent.. but what is the point of singing when you don't hear the lyrics sometimes.<br><br>I wouldnt call anyone above a tian wang actually.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I support David Tao! It's not true that he's got talent and no luck. His second album sold 500,000 copies for your information. And his year, when he released his album, it sold more than 200,000. Sigh, i guess pirarcy is the reason for the downfall. Anyway, You Hong Ming is quite good too. I do support him but I love David Tao more! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> You Hong Ming's album Lian Shang Ling Yi Ge Ren sold more than 100,000. Please note that i got these statistics from Lianhe Zaobao. And also note that not many people can sell more than 100,000 albums nowadays in Taiwan.</div>
