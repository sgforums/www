            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bbb... I went to watch the Phantom of the Opera as well... it's nice. I like phantom's voice and Raoul's as well, though Phantom has a more expressive and powerful voice that is suited for the role... think he sings even better than Michael Crawford (with all due respect to Michael cos he is also a great singer.)<br></div>

I have seen Lilian in person so many times, and few times I brought her album along, hoping to get her autograph, but always din have the courage to do so.  But juz now, I DID IT!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  She was so surprised and delighted when she saw her album in my hands.  Then she asked for my name, and wrote "Dear xx, Enjoy the music, Enjoy life!"  and she signed off.<br><br>I even told her, I made a song request -  but she din sing.  Anyway her voice was a bit hoarse.. and I told her Jieqi got play this song leh.. and at times he will be reminded of Lilian.. She asked me 'Jieqi got play this song?"  I said ya.. but i think she dun listen to 933 la.. coz she's from LOVE 972.. haha.. juz now Wei Jian played the 933 version of 'happy birthday' already kena scold by her.. hahaha..<br><br>Oh ya, advise Jieqi not to mention 'sgforums' on air tonight.. recently many things happened, maybe u read in papers also.. got chance then fill u in.<br><br>i better go take a shower now, be right back~!</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Recently very into watching the "One Million Star" (chao1 ji2 xin1 guang1 da4 dao4) online. It's a Taiwanese version of the American Idol, similar to our Superstar but IMO far better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  This contest is not broadcasted on local TV, so have to go online to search for it.<br><br>If you all have time, do go and take a look at the clips of some of the contestants. My favourite is a guy called Yang2 Zong1 Wei3, who is nicknamed "caveman" (LOL) and zhou1 kou3 dian4 ren2 (ancient man) by most people including his fans LoL. But his voice is really good, so don't judge him by his looks lah!<br><br>Here are some of his singing clips, what do you think??<br><br>* <strong>Zai Jian Wo De Ai Ren</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghaF_tdImDg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghaF_tdImDg</a><br>* <strong>Ren Zhi</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9dwdNwwpO8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9dwdNwwpO8</a><br>* <strong>Bei Pan</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgjJP5AU37g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgjJP5AU37g</a><br>* <strong>Zhu Wo Sheng Ri Kuai Le</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kBqC0Wi4Sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kBqC0Wi4Sg</a><br>* <strong>Yi Liao Bai Liao</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBq2ziwACXw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBq2ziwACXw</a><br>* <strong>Ni Na Me Ai Ta (duet)</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Q_KNfWInA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Q_KNfWInA</a></div>
