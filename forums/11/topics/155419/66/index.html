Enjoyed the concerts so far?  Hope to see u at Cheer's concert next Sat!<br><br>i tuned in since 11pm, but was not able to login until now.<br><br>i had a busy day.. only came home around 10 pm.<br><br>heard jieqi saying that baobao will be having an autograph session at Kinokuniya on 6 October.  I'll be in taipei at that time.  hee.. Is 6 Oct an auspicious day?  bcos Teng Jing Shu will be holding an autograph session on 6 Oct at Taipei Zhong Xiao Fu Xing Page One Bookstore.<br><br>I really hope I can go and meet him.. all these years, everytime i read his books.. im always wondering how he looks like.. and have been hoping that I will be able to meet him one day, tell him that I'm his fan from Singapore.  haha..<br><br>Juz weeks ago I was telling coolger that if I happen to bump into him on the road, I'll ask him to take a picture with me.  So coincidentally that he will be having an autograph session at Taipei.. I'll be there from 5 Oct to 9 Oct.  But 6 Oct is scheduled to be my one day city tour.. I am willing to forgo the one day tour and go to the autograph session instead.. but my sis dun allow.. and we have been quarrelling about it.. I'll be very sad if i can't get to meet him and get his autograph.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>But if I really cannot change my city tour to another day.. I will make a trip down to the bookstore on the day i touch down at taipei.. and request the staff to help me get a few autographed copies.. i will be very yi han if i'm there but can't even get his autograph.  I pray hard that everything will go smoothly as I wish..   </span></div>

I remember i ever received a PM from someone, asking me whether im that 'baobao' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, Jieqi said that he would ask ChongQing to record so that he can play the interview with baobao.. talking about the launching of her new book ba.. and i think it is part of I-weekly advertising campaign also.  For those of you who missed it, tune in to Jieqi's slot on 22/09/2007 at 11pm, most probably Jieqi will be hosting that night.<br><br>Well, it's a long wait~  but good things are worth waiting for~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  </span></div></blockquote>yea i catched the radio interview accidentally after work. didnt really know who's baobao but find the interview quite interesting.<br><br>btw issit replayed during 11-12?</div>

So I juz told them 'i want to go to the autograph session, so most probably i wun be going to the one day tour with u girls'.<br><br>I understand that my sis also rang bu le.. they even suggest to ask the tour guide whether we can go for the tour on another day... and agreed to accompany me to the bookstore on the day we touch down.. but what if the agency and the bookstore are not willing to make exception for me?  arghhh!!! I'm not a kid liao leh.. although it's my first time travelling so far, first time going to taipei.. but i believe i will be able to find my way lor.. why does my sis like to restrict me so much?  i also have net frens in taipei ar.. but she also dun allow me to meet them.  they can be very good tour guides leh.<br><br>im really going mad... &gt;&lt;"  Really regret going with her.  Really dampen my mood.  Haiz~! </span><br><br></div>
