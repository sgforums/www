I understand that Evonne is going to the therapy every week.<br><br>Both Evonne and her bf are looking for a lawyer to sue the driver.  The traffic police told them that the driver was drunk but they did not mention anything about pressing charges against the driver, since it was his first offence.

I dun understand why the traffic police can let him off because it's his first offence.  What if someone was knocked down?  Would he be let off lightly also?<br><br>I duno whether Evonne had her safety belt on.  If not, the defendant can say there's contributory negligence, then of course the compensation, if there is, will be much lower la.<br><br>Juz yesterday a fren of mine was knocked down by a vehicle somewhere in school.  I was shocked when I received the sms from my fren.  The driver actually hit and run.  But luckily she was alright, just some brusies on her arms and legs.  </span></div>
