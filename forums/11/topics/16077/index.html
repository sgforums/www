            <div class='col-md body'>The US Terror incident is a shocking news to the whole world. I personally condemn such barbaric and inhumane act. The lose of so many lives is simply devastating and incur the wrath and sympathy of many people over the world i would say. Yet, on Tuesday, I saw over the news on tv that the palestinians were rejoicing over the tragedy.<br>It simply puts me off!! I cannot tolerate such behaviour in the world. In the news, u can see people at the windows of the NY twin towers struggling helplessly for their dear life. Most unfortunately, the next moment, the whole of the towers collapsed in a few seconds, killing countless of innocence lives. To add on to the tragedy, the collapsion of the towers buried those would be life-savers ( eg firemen) alive. If u see over the tv the part where a few people jump off the towers during that moment, u should have guess how shocking i felt at that time.<br>I SIMPLY CONDEMN SUCH BARBARIC AND INHUMANE ACT DONE BY THE TERRORISTS!!! I also agree with what Mr Bush had said. That the enemy who terrorised US is as well as staging a war against freedom loving countries like ours.<br>MAY THOSE WHO HAD UNFORTUNATELY PERISH IN THE TRAGEDY FIND PEACE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For the last person who replied, with the 'eye for an eye' statement....I would just like to say that that shows a lack of compassion or our own kind. It shows a sort of ignorance that is still sadly enough alive in the world today. It is people like you that keep hate and discrimination and constant stereotypes constantly flowing through the minds of people in the twenty first century. The tragedies which occured are horrendous and due to false fundamentalism, because a true Muslim would believe differently than Bin Laden. All the world can do now is pray for this to all end soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok well then *genius*, how to you propose America goes after Osama and not the country, if Bin Laden is being hidden and protected by the goddamn country? If America just sits back and does nothing...does not atleast attempt to bring Osama to justice...then many more mindless followers of his will think that they have won. And furthermore......what will that say of the world? That terrorism is okay, that someone can kill millions of lives and not pay for it at all? I think not. America had no other sensible choice but to attack....THE COUNTRY CHOSE THE TERRORIST OSAMA BIN LADEN OVER JUSTICE IN THE WORLD IN AMERICA'S ULTIMATEM. They brought this injustice upon themselves and their own irresponsible acts are bringing unnecessary death to its people, trying to turn more Muslims against the U.S., other countries are jealous of America's confidence, democracy, and economy. They envy its quick success. This jealousy soon turned to hate....hate turned to violence. And to answer your question, no I am not Muslim, I am Christian.<br><br>-=-R.I.P. to all people victimized by the HATE-=-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever that has been done is done. It's very clear Us has aimed Afghanistan and has carried out attacks..<br><br>If there was sabotage against Afghanistan .. it worked! And it's too late to undo the damage done.<br><br>BUt at the same time.. Getting rid of Taliban is not such a bad thing. It will help to aleviate the suffering of the Afghan women.<br><br>About trying to undermind the power in MiddleEast is a real threat. Then again, everything from now onwards is all propaganda..<br><br>Nothing is going to be really done for the good of the people..<br>Everybody is using everyone else for their benifit.<br><br>It seems to me things are out of control</div>
