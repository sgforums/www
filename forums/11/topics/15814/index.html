            <div class='col-md body'>I got my news from Zaobao oso. 93.3 remains 1st, but as buddy had mentioned, the listener ratings was down by 30%. The news did not mention what was 93.3 exact rating, but it did said that 95.8(which was 2nd) had abt 22%, &amp; class95(which was 3rd) had abt 20%. farnie dat it mentioned the ratings for 95.8 &amp; 95, but not for the no.1 station 93.3... wondering how bad it was? I myself had come up wif an unique viewpt of why the ratings had gone down, but I shan't say wat it is...no, i wun say... :p<br><br>was tinking hoh...if 95.8 catches up wif 93.3, den i guess i can only conclude dat S'pore population is ageing(???). btw, in terms of Chinese stations, 93.3 was 1st, followed by 95.8, then 100.3... surprisingly(at least to me), 88.3 was way way way behind...even losing out to the Indian &amp; 2 Malay stations...some consolation to 883 is dat its sister english station had even worse rating, &amp; was the last 2nd station, just in front of Passion99.5...<br><br>i guess it all boils down wif the intense competition...but all i can say dat is 93.3 has started to wane quite abit..not to mention SOME DJs...but oso its selection of songs are getting abit too predictable &amp; boring...(dat is why we need more DJs like Jieqi &amp; Baobao who play some not-so-hot songs for variety sake) Take today for instance, I heard 2 Ah-mei songs in less than 2 hrs!!! Not dat Ah-mei is not gd(in fact, she is one of my faves), but plsss...I dun hv Lao Ren Chi Dai Zheng...no need to remind me so often who she is lah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I agree with what most of you have said. Not only do they repeat certain songs too often, they also have too many advertisements. I dun know how some of you feel, but I find the interruption of advertisements very annoying. IN the past, they had advertisements at a particular time for about 5 minutes. But now, they play advertisement clips after every few songs. On top of that, the DJs have to talk and describe the songs. In the end, we end up hearing more talking than songs... I can understand that advertisements generate money, but there's a limit to everything.<br><br>I think 933 has really waned from their goals/objective of being a top pop music radio station (din jian liu xing yin yue dian tai). I guess when the result of survey comes out next year, we will be able to see if 933 can stand up to all that intense competition from other stations.<br><br>Something more to add...<br>Newcomers like Mary and Liyi have really improved a lot... give them a few years time and they can stand along side pple like Huishi and Desmond. Shihan also getting better... not forgetting Denny's creativity. His creativity is only second to Baobao...<br><br>Wonder if the DJs read this forum? I guess they need the feedback and encouragement  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wat makes up such a great station?? the djs?? the songs they play or wat? yes i do agree that 933 always play re men songs, some particular songs can be heard so many times in one day. maybe they shold play more leng men songs.yah shihan really improve a lot he sounds diff from last time when he still zhu chi ye mao ying yue zhan. maybe bcos he past yr n this yr got chiobu zhu chi wif him.hehe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I dun really blame them for playing remen songs... but they should maybe hard-play it for two weeks, then let the DJs decide whether to play them... But if they hard-sell certain singers, it is unfair to the other singers.<br><br>I didn't really notice Shihan before he started partnering with Liyi...maybe after he partner with Liyi, he become less shy, so got improvement  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, he pair up with any female DJs also have good chemistry...like last time Liyi and now Mary <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
