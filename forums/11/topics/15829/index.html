            <div class='col-md body'>Watched this show bcoz I quite liked the 1st instalment of MI. Anyway, this show most probably will not disappoint the MI fans. Tom Cruise looked so much more suave in this part 2 as compared to the 1st one. His cool shades (which self-destructed within 5 secs) was the most vivid image in my mind <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> But seriously, I really really LOVE that pair of shades! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, not much of a story plot for this show. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise!) was handed a new assignment of locating &amp; destroying a lethal virus - Caimara (think my spelling is a little off). However, he encountered a powerful opponent in Ambrose, a shrewd man who seemed to know the moves of Hunt. Love implications arose when Nadya, a professional thief &amp; ex-lover of Ambrose, fell in love with Ethan &amp; vice versa. However, Ambrose held the key to the virus strain &amp; thus Nadya went undercover for Hunt by returning to Ambrose, pretending to re-ignite the old flame with him, but is actually spying on Ambrose's dealings of the virus strain.<br><br>That's about the story. Predictable ending as well. However, the fighting scenes &amp; breathtaking stunts are where the real actions are. The starting cliff-hanging moments are rather spectacular. The motorbikes chase was a galore display of Hunt's amazing capabilities. Of coz, Tom Cruise's absolute suaveness adds on to the yum-yum factor ( esp for the gers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>Frankly, it wasn't too bad an effort, &amp; if you juz want to be entertained without having to work your brains too much, this is a pretty good show which manages to satisfy. The show is about 2 hours long, &amp; pop corn is a good addition as there aren't really many gory scenes which will make you puke. (except for a few scenes which show the gradual changes on the virus-infected people)<br><br>Rating: 4.25/5 (for Tom Cruise) ; 3.75/5 (for the show on the overall)</div>
