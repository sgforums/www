            <div class='col-md body'>agreedz! Junxin really very pian xin one leh. it is so obvious that he like Jim best and i dun think he like ric at all, for he dun even want to mention ric like that.<br><br>u know the part when junxin say that jim composed many songs in the album, he was like saying that ric is contributing nothing at all like that. When Jim offered that ric co-composed songs with him and that ric designed the album and everything, junxin was like eager to get back to Jim.<br><br>So bad one leh...<br><br>Then he oso like want Jim to sing 'nan ban qiu bei ban qiu', but din he realised that by inviting all three of them, it is not that okay to ignore the other two if jim really did sing 'nan ban qiu bei ban qiu'. I think Jim thought abt this point, otherwise he cud oso have sang 'bu zhi de' mah, rite?<br><br>[This message has been edited by liyan (edited 03 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yesh...it is beri obvious tat the jx is putting all his focus on Yixin.Well..i guess its becos he knows Yixin better and tend to have more topics to talk if he talks to Yixin ? But he is really beri unprofessional loh like tat..den he might as well onli invite Yixin to his program and he can say all he wans to Yixin alone rite ? Being a DJ,and a professional one..he should do his homework b4 he goes on air and starts his interview...but look!wat did jx do ? He onli keeps talking abt wat happen btw him and Yixin during their times at Ai Qin Hai...leaving Ric &amp; Cavin down there dunno wat to say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Sighz tat was a rather failure session in terms of the conversation part tat they had...jx keeps talkin n talkin as if he is the person in focus instead of Dreamz FM~<br>But,heng la,the trio's unplugged live performances is still as great as ever !!
