            <div class='col-md body'>Celest has not bad a voice, but I doubt her image can really create waves in Taiwan. Not really seen any "healthy-tanned girl" make it big there; Taiwanese seem to prefer sweetie-pies...<br><br>Kit? Didn't she start the waves a few years ago? There doesn't seem to be any sign of her making a comeback strong enough to challenge Stef Sun in Taiwan. Also, the signs are that Kit is concentrating more and more on the HK market, which allows her to converse in her familiar Cantonese rather than Mandarin.<br><br>Tanya may not have made immense waves like Stef Sun did, but she certainly craved a niche of her own, being a singer-songwriter-guitarist charmer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> However, she seemed to have lost a little angst and rock-feel after being attached to her Bupo. But her music is definitely still good  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Wonder how will Ah Du fare though, seems that he is starting to gain recognition. His image kinda reminds me of Niu Cheng Ze in Tu Si Nan Zhi Wen...(the big bro lor...there is not only Li Wei in the show, you know!)... "Lang Zi" image? Sounds like Wang Jie...<br><br>Yi Qi and Yong Bang's results were pretty decent too, but it seems that our local girls are getting better results than our guys, wonder why?... Dreamz FM :~((( sigh, what a waste...<br><br>Not to forget our own cutie - Stella Ng. Much as people criticize her to be an "act-cute", you can't deny she does have some popularity in Taiwan. It's a waste that another female singer Cai Chun Jia did not have a strong follow-up after initial good reception of her debut album. Recalled she was pitting against Fan Wei Qi when they were starting out. Now that FWQ is still trying hard to attain more exposure (she got quite abit of that from her rumoured romance with Hei Ren), CCJ is almost non-existent even in the local scene...where is she???<br><br>One singer of the newer generation whom I like is CCJ's brother - Cai Li Zhang, but sad to say, he doesn't seem to have any chance of releasing a solo album...<br><br>(P/S: Sorry for the long trash...)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come to think of it, Tanya seems to be the most under-rated Spore singer currently....Have to admit that she is the most talented local singer now. In terms of popularity, Stef Sun seems to be the undisputed No 1 at least for the coming year. Looks like Tanya will be facing some trouble to make it big with such a strong opponent around.<br><br>Have to give Stella some credit though....her cutie pie look seems to be her biggest obstacle....but she can write some good songs though.....guess we will have to see her 2nd album b4 we can furher evaulate her...</div>
