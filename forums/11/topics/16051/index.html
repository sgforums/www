            <div class='col-md body'>This qn has been raised by someone many weeks ago...and somehow one report has come to mind...<br><br>It was reported that Tension's album has broke through the 100,000 copies mark...does it mean Taiwan or the whole of Asia?  But from what I-weekly reported, only 5 albums passed the 100,000 thousand mark...for the first half of 2001, including harlem, rene, elva, gigi and sammi's.<br><br>Anyway another report recently got my interest in this topic aroused...read some report that Zhang Yu's newest album Ti Shen passed the 100,000 mark in just 4 days...this is like impossible...example...on the top 20 albums chart of TCR (A taiwanese record store), his album ranked a miserable 5, with sales percentage of 5.41%, fish has 6.21% and yanzi 26.45%...mayayd has 12.19% and only mayday just passed the 250,000 mark...<br><br>Okie...with the 5.41% of the market...zhang's album debuted at 5 at rose records...assuming he got the same percentage of the market...and with other record companies...how could his album hit the 100,000 mark...yanzi would then have sales of 500,000 units right?<br><br>So wat is the meaning of all this?  To hype the album or to prevent the singer from losing face?<br><br>An interesting though...Jolin's album did not seem to sell well this time round...highest percentage record was a paltry 11%</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if listen to carefully to the news rite, they were toking abt the stocks they released, the chu huo liang, not the sales really. What will happen is, i think they can forget abt releasing any more stock for zhang yu liaoz....bcos...dun tink can pass 100000. Actually, at this pt of time, do believe tension has more than 100000 copies. Perhaps is they forsee they will pass the 100000 mark, but cant really wait till then, so they have the celebration first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, since the competition is so fierce, i suppose with every wk over 25% market share for yanzi, i think this album would have a very good album sales and i think may have really break thru the 200000 pt in juz 3 wks. Yanzi bEST~~~hedhe, me her fan lah. Landy's sales is quite gd, i think at least 8 times better than her last album. Yucks, i dun like zhang yu's new song. Dun sell too well, pls.</div>
