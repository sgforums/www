            <div class='col-md body'>SIGH!!!! are we back to this debate AGAIN? Carista, i tink you really don't know what you've just got yourself into....and it's not as if i'm a fan you know.... i don't really like their music (aha!! never say i don't like them) but if others like them then so be it loh... i won't pretend to understand why they do but a heading like "F4 sucks" would only invite indignant replies from their fans.... i think we've just finished a round of "F4 vs Wewe" debate too and this whole "i love F4 NOT Wewe" arguments have also dominated this forum for a looonng time...i haven't posted anything this past month cos i had nothing to say about them and now you had to *haha* rake it all up again?<br><br>i love my peace and quiet very much thank you. take care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Dirtbag and Carista are seriously prejudiced against F4.  I think many guys are also irritated that F4 is so hot, and all the girls are going gaga over them.  U can dislike them, but not do immature stuff like cursing them.  If you want to say they are mediocre singers and stuff..fine with me, but don't make personal attacks at them!  Oh hey, u think they don't look cool but others do.  I seriously advise you to keep those negative comments down...you guys dunno what the f4 fans are capable of.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there's no need to insult people ugly or whatever just because they don't like F4!!!  I mean that's going too much.<br><br>And by calling F4 angels isn't it a bit too much?  This is a real insult to the real angels in the heavens...Don't compare them too celestial beings because they are just humans.<br><br>Yes, can't deny that most of the F4 look good...in their own way...but please so some restrain and don't insult others...besides wake up...there are also better looking guys out there just that they are not thrust into the limelight.  And you should know better...it's hard to marry someone so handsome...and probably it's those ugly girls who are drooling over handsome guys like them.  Get a life!  Idolise them to a certain extent...but don't overdo it.<br><br>And if they could really sing...have any critics lauded them with praise on their singing?  Why can't they even be nominated in the taiwan golden melody awards?</div>
