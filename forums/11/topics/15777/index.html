            <div class='col-md body'>Those who wanna join our channel outing.. pls think it over again. We have quite a number of major outings b4... and i asked for suggestions b4... but no one seemed to be interested... except for a few regulars who keep the forum alive by posting replies. Now that we are organising a BBQ/Chalet, it seems dat the response is quite good.. due to certain factor...<br>However... dat certain XX may not be able to attend it... he will only try his best to make it... no promises made... IF he cant make it... wld u join us? think it over again...<br>And also... we dun really welcome the idea of combined channel outings... i think we had one last year and it din turn out good? Maybe becos all too unfamiliar wif each other... din tok too much wif each other.<br>I have notin much to say oso... if u disagree wif me... u can always post replies. But make sure dat ur replies are of some 'substance' and not jux empty tok.  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At least you will confirm see him during his outdoor progs, but for this outing, nothing is confirmed at all. It is not very true tat you can't get close to him during these outdoor progs. U juz ask some of his die-hard fans.<br><br>Moreover, he did say no presents, no cakes, whatever. So you can't pass him any presents even if you wan to. If he really does come, there will only be plain food like roti &amp; gan1 dan1 for him.<br><br>Think even if ppl wan to org a bd party for him, given his busy schedule wif watever radio progs &amp; tv shows, he will not have time to make it, even though he may wan to go sometimes.<br><br>Juz to cut things short, it is a CHANNEL OUTING, not a bd outing. And given the responses, combined channel outings are definitely out. I have been to some combined outings, &amp; i can tell u, they are a total failure. Coz some ppl from one channel may noe some others from other channels, but wat abt the rest who dunno ppl from other channels? Not fair for them wat. So better stick to your own channel outings.<br><br>Sia lah, tok so much, think some ppl will still say dun understand rite? well, whether it is really u dun understand or other reasons, only u will noe lor. again, personal opinions. feel free to ignore.</div>
