They have been using<br>Sun Yan Zi's name to get business where in actual fact it<br>was Chen Peter who discovered and groomed her ( need i<br>say more ) If you are feeling rich you can pay 200 over bucks<br>for group lesson or 400 over bucks for individual and get<br>taught by STUDENTS!!!!<br><br>Seriously..think about it,it doesnt mean if you learn from wei song you will definitely be a star...weisong doesnt even teach,he doesnt even pick anyone to groom,he's only interested in sales...YES he will pick ONLY people he likes and promotes them..i repeat..PROMOTES..not GROOM...you get groomed by the students by paying so much...food for thought yah....</div>
