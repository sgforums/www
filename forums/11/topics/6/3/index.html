            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Peter Chen opened his own school called Music Clinic. It's cheaper than LWSSOM and I think the teaching is better too cos Peter actually teaches himself...at LWSSOM only the junior teachers teach new students.<br><br>http://www.themusicclinic.com.sg<br><br>Has anyone heard of a school called Guiding Stars?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx a lot mist.  but ive calculated, is only a bit cheaper than wei song's.  i found another music school called hark music which u all mentioned.  is $120/mth (they dun charge gst), peter chen $168/mth (dunno got gst a not), then wei song's $205.4 (include gst).  the hark music i can just walk there, so no need to spend extra on transport.  though is consider cheap among them, but i dunno is the school good a not.  anyone of you attending class there now?<br>i really cant decide.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i feel hark music is quite good, in the sense they're not commercialized and the teachers really have the passion for music, very helpful also..<br>the $50 is the registration fee, which is non-refundable.</div>
