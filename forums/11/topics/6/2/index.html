            <div class='col-md body'>Music Clinic is at 76 Neil Road in Chinatown near Ocean Butterflies office. Peter was the one who discovered Yanzi (will post an article about that below) and Anthony is teaching Lydia Sum's daughter. The teaching standard is very high and the prices are reasonable. $168 per month for group classes, $288 for individual, courses are for vocal, composing, keyboard and performing.Yanzi just opened a talent management company and she will be looking for talents from this school.<br><br><strong>Article:</strong><br><br>Most people thought that Yanzi's rise to stardom had been because of the Li brothers, Sisong and Weisong, who had recommended her to Warnermusic and hence resulted in her rise to fame in Taiwan. In actuality, the real mastermind behind it was actually Yanzi's teacher, Peter Tan. He said the song that propelled Yanzi to fame was actually not "Tian hei Hei" but a song titled "Again".<br><br>Peter Tan had been a music teacher to singers such as He Chaoyi, Wu Enqi, Celest Chong and Sun Jing, but the disciple which had made him most proud was Sun Yanzi. He recalled that 7 years ago, Yanzi had just joined the Li brothers' music school, and had been put into his class, where he had a total of 8 students in all. At that time, Yanzi was a freshed faced student, thin, quiet and innocent. She arrived punctually at school everyday, but was not very noticeable in class, although she was very serious during lessons.<br><br>Peter said, "At first, I didn't really notice Yanzi, but once when I heard her sing, I found that she had a certain quality, something very unique in her voice, and at that moment, realised that she had a very great potential." After being under Peter's tutelege for a year, where he coached her on different techniques on singing and performing, Yanzi had already reached a professional standard. Just then, Li Sisong had went to find Peter who was in his classroom, and immediately, Peter recommended Yanzi to him. "This girl is really not bad, I'll ask her to perform for you." Yanzi had been shocked at this sudden request, but had no choice, and so chose to sing Janet Jackson's "Again". Her voice impressed Sisong immensely, and Peter at once recommended Yanzi to him again. "She will have a very good chance... please help her try."<br><br>And so, it was the start of Yanzi's shot to fame. Even though she didn't really had time to keep in contact often with her teacher after she became famous, Yanzi still remembered him. Last year, during her rehearsal for her Singapore's "Start" concert, Peter had went to visit het. At that time, Yanzi was singing "Hai Pa" and upon seeing him, immediately went down the stage to hug him. She told him, "I have been working very hard, and made a lot of effort, did you know?" This hug made Peter very proud, and he cried.<br><br>Last Friday, Peter had opened a new music training school known as  with his friends. Yanzi bought flowers for him and specially went to attend the opening. She also secretly taped a video containing her blessings for him where she said, "I'm very happy that my teacher had opened this school, and hope that he'll have many many students." Last month, Yanzi herself has established an agent company, and she made a special request to Peter, "If there're any good students, do send them to me, ok?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I've got a favour to ask actually. I'm a freelance writer for Teens magazine and I'm urgently looking for music-lovers who joined music school such as the ones you've mentioned to do an informal interview for an article I'm doing.<br><br>I would like to ask about why you guys join these schools and other questions. Also, I need help compiling a list of schools I can contact to ask about the courses they have. So far, I have LWS School of Music, Music Clinic and Atticgrove, though if anyone has the number for Music Clinic, can you give it to me? If you know any other music school, can you let me know too?<br><br>I hope I'm not asking for too much. Pls email me at hoolahee@hotmail.com Really do need help rather desperately.
