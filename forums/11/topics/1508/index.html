            <div class='col-md body'>Well, never heard of this Yong Bang, but if he doesn't have enuf of looks to complement his singing-songwriting talent, maybe tough to make the cut. Just look at where Yanzi is now... she has the right balance of both talent and looks...including the all-important x-factor. Spore has a dearth of good-looking male singing talent... whatever happened to that lawyer-turned-singer who tried to make it in Taiwan sometime back? gosh, can't even recall his name now...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The name of that lawyer turned singer who lasped into obscurity is called Jimmy Lin (not too sure about the surname thought) Still remember his one and only hit.<br><br>As for yanzi, i think it is a combination of SAVVY MARKETING (remember that "oh-what-close call" shooting incident. The shooting iself may not be a delibrate ploy but it was sure milked for all its worht in terms of publicity) and good songs ( Tian Hei Hei)...<br><br>Before you are mistaken, me not anti-yanzi..in fact, quite a fan..love her style!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah, that's rite... Jimmy Ye! Our local artistes seem to have rather short shelf lives though. Kit Chan, Tanya and Mavis Hee are still around... but I think the best part of their singing careers are probably behind them now. Tanya is likely to have more staying power cuz of her songwriting talent. As for Yanzi, well... hard to tell. The Taiwanese fans are just so crazy about her. Btw, what's this "oh-what-close call" shooting incident all about?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I did not remember wrongly...<br><br>Stefanie Sun was having a promotion (?) session, when a guy with gun (?) barged in and threatened to harm her. In the end, she was towed away in safety and that guy was arrested.<br><br>But this incident made big news all over Taiwan and Singapore. Most Singaporeans did not know that there is actually a local singer attempting to make a break into the Taiwanese market then, and this news piece made everyone sit up and take notice of her. Eventually, her popularity just skyrocketed by leaps and bounds, and the rest is history.<br><br>Not saying that this made her "famous"...it is indeed a "weird" way to "introduce" a new singer in this manner. But many people believed that this incident was heavily peppered with many questions, most commonly asked being "is this all part of the promotion stint?"<br><br>Not that it matters anymore, coz she has already proven that she is capable enough to hold her own...</div>

I think he is still rather talented is one person that was under-rated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway he penned a very nice song for Jolin Cai Yi Ling titled Wo Zhi Dao Ni Hen Nan Guo. So I feel he is as good if not better than Yong Bang.<br>Next, Yong Bang. I cannot deny that he has a few nice songs like all newbies, and possesses the talent to penn good songs. Let's not get over the moon yet, remember that in this industry looks does sell and he is lacking in it. Anyone saw the New Year Countdown Concert in Taiwan shown on Channel U ? You should see that he did not have very good stage presence. Frankly, I was kinda put off by the way he held his mic, shielding his face, and the way he position his left hand while singing. But I suppose if he put in more hardwork in these area to better himself, he no doubt will be a shining star  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, let's really wait and see  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
