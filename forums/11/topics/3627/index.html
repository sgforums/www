            <div class='col-md body'>Except for Wang De Yuan who had won a tv singing competition (shao nian jin mu dan bei?), the rest I don't think have any singing credentials. The other 4 actually hail from the Star Search contests, but I don't think they were picked because they had fab singing voices or what anyway. They were just like F4 &amp; WeWe, formed for the sake of having a boygroup, most probably. This kind of "pin pin cou cou" where will have "seh"?<br><br>Interesting to note that this local group comprises of at least 2 non-Singaporeans, namely Jeff Wang (Taiwan) and Shi Bin (China). Not sure about the rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That was the TCS 5 Tigers (wu hu jiang). I only remember Thomas Ong and Andrew Seow also. I think also has Qin Wei (a short but cute guy), Jamie Wong's ex-hubby and...erm, you got me...<br><br>Andrew Seow was a total flop in Ch8, that's why he went over to Ch5, and flourished there, because of his good command in English. Thomas Ong would have been the most popular among the five guys, but for his controversy with MediaCorp on him "revealing too much details on his contract".<br><br>Anyway, a "local" group with only one local. How convincing can you get? But I shall reserve my comments until I have listened to them proper. I am not keeping my fingers crossed though...</div>

His song did appear in 933 chart few years back for 1-2 weeks. He also had a book out, which is like a travel journal. Not interested in him anyway, especially after meeting him before in person a few year ago. He was a little haughty back then, but perhaps he has grown up now? *Shrug*<br></div>
