            <div class='col-md body'>Ang Lee face was full of disappointment when he lost out the Best Director...close how close...<br><br>Stephen Daldry from Billy Elliot is eliminated because the film is not in running for best picture.<br><br>Ridley Scott did film an epic...but with Gladiator getting best picture...it is good enough...the show wasn't that great...juz like gore and violence only.<br><br>Steven Soderbergh was nominated for 2 Films, Erin Brockovich and Traffic...so they said that his votes would be split...leaving the door opened to Ang Lee...i guess SS was kinda surprised...but Ang Lee face was full of disappointment...i guess he really did wanted to win and expected himself to win.<br><br>Anyway, Crouching Tiger and Chocolat are the biggest losers tonight...chocolat though nominated for 5 awards, won none.  Crouching, picked up 4 out of 10, but none in the major categories...the biggest being Best Foreign Film...whereas 2 years ago, life is beautiful won best actor...which is a major award.<br><br>Erin scored on best actress<br>traffic for supporting actor and director.<br>gladiator got the big one (Picture and Actor)<br><br>As for 93.3fm hit awards...trust me it would be sun yanzi's year...she might bag the most popular female artiste...her points in the chart are quite high...plus her spva chart sales...quite good...the closest is maybe fann wong...but...fann wun win...if not the awards would be condemned...tis year is sun yanzi's year...she would take home 2 to 3 awards, probably missing out on the Best Female Singer...but who knows right?<br><br>Wat u all think?</div>
