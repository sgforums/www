            <div class='col-md body'>Our homegrown singer Stefanie Sun Yan Zi had juz release a new album titled "Start"...<br>it contains songs that she herself had chosen of which she feels that has some significance in her life...like the gan2 lan3 shu4 sung by her father when she was a child and etc...<br><br>Have all of you listen to it yet ???<br>Like to know wat you all feel 'bout it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Listened 2 her album and thot dat it was better dan her previous album kite, considering dat most of the songs are covers.<br><br>Personally, I prefer Stef singing English songs to Chinese ones, duno yÂ… juz feel dat the English numbers r nicerÂ… esp. Â“hey judeÂ”, Â“silent all these yrsÂ”, self-composed Â“someoneÂ” and Â“sumtimes love juz ainÂ’t enuffÂ”.<br><br>As 4 chinese songs, prefer the last 2 tracks, which are Â“jiu shi zhe yangÂ” and Â“up2uÂ” respectivelyÂ… nice nice. As for Â“gan lan shuÂ”, mi juz feel dat the song is juz not suitable for yanziÂ…then Â“yuan lai ni shen me dou bu yaoÂ”Â…ok lar, but still prefer ameiÂ’s version.  As for Â“tian kongÂ”, StefÂ’s version is more Â‘rockÂ’ compared to the original one. More band sound.<br><br>In addition to the cd, thereÂ’s still a pictorial bk which contained pictures of Stef taken when she was young. Her looks din change much, except for her specsÂ…<br><br>But one thing 4 sure, Stef can improve on her pronunciation of Chinese wordsÂ…<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe that's her way of singing?  Mispronouncing words????  Or maybe she too English...<br><br>Talking abt pronunciation...it reminds me of ZaiZai Vic Chou...hahaha...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most Singaporeans' Chinese pronounciation is lite dat one lah...noticed I used "lite dat", not "like that"? Coz that's the way we speak, and that's the way many local singers sing too. You can observe lor...Stef Sun has abit of Singaporean accent in her singing, so have Kit and Tanya though theirs are more angmo.<br><br>ZaiZai is because of his Ilan accent lor. Ilan is quite "rural" and the people speak "rural"/raw too. A lot of Taiwanese tease ZaiZai non-stop about his pronounciation, that I guess coz their Chinese pronounciation is really good. But as a Singaporean, I won't dare say his pronounciation lousy lor, coz I know mine is worse! If not, abit the "50step laugh at 100step"... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Finally got round to buying stef's album of covers...<br><br>Is it juz the paradox for all singers doing covers?? (i.e: you want to bring your own style to the song, yet you do not want to do injustice to the original singer??) Anyway, juz kept comparing her to the original singers and found her renditions kind of 'very karaoke-like'....<br><br>But love "sometimes love just ain't enough". It was originally duet..but her 'soloist' effort seems kind of heartfelt..This is the only song I had on repeat mode.<br><br>1 and haf cents worth.</div>

YouÂ�fre not the only one.<br>Steafnie Sun used to think so, too.<br>Such a claim sounds almost contradictory coming from a singer whose meteoric rise to regional stardom is making musical history.<br>The 24-year-oldÂ�fs good fortune is certainly the envy of countless aspiring singers.<br>In fact, her repid rise is threatening to dethrone several Chinese pop queens.<br>THe disillusions that Stefanie once laboured under are now a thing of the past.<br>Now, she has a new motto: Â�fWhen youÂ�fre young, you should grab the opportunity (of youth) and work hard.Â�f<br>Indeed, a quick flip through her track record shows four albums, more than 10 advertisements and countless television programmes and interviews, all within a two-year span.<br>Next on her list is a series of major concerts around the region.<br>But a break doesnÂ�ft seem to be in sight.<br>Currently, the busy bee is back home to promote her latest album Start - a collection consisting almost entierly of covers. As usual, she is swamped by media attention.<br>Â�fWhy do you want to do an album of covers? Why choose to sing this song?<br>Â�fHOw is the concert preparation getting along? What do you think of the Chu Mei Feng incident?Â�f<br>These were some of the questions faced in an hour-long press conference.<br>Despite her energy-sapping schedule, the young lady keeps a smile on her pixie face.<br>She reminds me of a happy child.<br>At the start of the press conference, Stefanie was presented with a large bowl of red olives. Her first response was: Â�fCan I eat?Â�f<br>It was the same when five fans presented a cake to wish her success for an upcoming concert.<br>Stefanie eyed the cake throughout the photo session, clearly delighted with the offering.<br>Eidently, it is the simple things in life that perk her up.<br>After all, sheÂ�fs only 24.<br><br></div>

ItÂ’s just something that IÂ’ve realised.Â’<br><br>For a moment, her usual sunny smile disappeared, and she lowered her head.<br><br>So I asked if she had had a bad experience.<br><br>After a moment of hesitation, she said: Â’Sometimes, friends act in a certain manner that disappoints you, but thatÂ’s because you have expectations.<br><br>Â’So now I stick with old pals. Sometimes, they touch you with little gestures that you never expect.Â’<br><br>Maybe Â’someoneÂ’ has hurt her before, but now she can seek solace in her newfound fame and fans.<br><br>In fact, her work schedule is packed all the way to 2004, she said.<br><br>Â’I used to wonder why human beings have to slog so hard, but now I think, we must work hard while weÂ’re still young</div>
