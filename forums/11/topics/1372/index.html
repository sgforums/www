            <div class='col-md body'>"Dang Ni Gu Dan Ni Hui Xiang Qi Shui" is sung by a Taiwan group called NBC (New Boys Club) / 'xin shao nian ju le bu'. Think the song is now about 8 years old? Gosh, that sounds like a long time ago!<br><br>Xiao Hu Dui sang many popular songs like "Qing Pin Guo Le Yuan", "Hu Die Fei Ah", "Hong Qing Ting", "Jiao Ni Yi Sheng My Love", "Fang Xin Qu Fei", "Yong Ren Zhi Rao"...<br><br>I think you may be able to listen to one of Xiao Hu Dui's earliest song on radio soon with the upcoming Chinese New Year. They sang a "Xin Nian Kuai Le" with You Huan Pai Dui ages ago, and this song is always played during Chinese New Year.<br><br>As for Alec Su, I feel he was cuter last time, though a little nerdy. Now he was like a little too flashy...like the black translucent shirt he once wore on a Andy Lau's event, my goodness! If not for "Huan Zhu Ge Ge", I guess he may not have gained back the same level of popularity - if not more - as last time when he was in Xiao Hu Dui. He was my most fave little Tiger last time anyway...<br><br>I still miss the old days, you know?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Su You Peng was formerly known as Tommy Su and Xiao Guai (coz he looked obedient) when he was in Xiao Hu Dui. He was known as the smart one, because he studied in the best university in Taiwan.<br><br>He also did launch a solo career like the other 2 Tigers, and he did enjoy quite abit of popularity then as well. Songs included : "Bei Bao", "Ca JIan Er Guo", "Deng Dao Na Yi Tian", "Wo Zhi Yao Ni Ai Wo", etc.<br><br>As pressures mounted from rumours that he did not do well in uni due to singing distractions, he eventually quitted school and disappeared...to act in Huan Zhu Ge Ge, which was the turning point in his career.<br><br>After Huan Zhu Ge Ge, he became really popular. By then, he realised he was too old for the name "Tommy", hence the name change to Alec. He also no longer wanted to be known as the "guai guai hu" anymore...<br><br>But like said, I still prefer Xiao Guai   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Hajime (edited 22 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i think that the old(xiao hu dui times) and new (after huan zhu ge ge) alec is VERY different... but i think that both sides of him has good and bad points... the old alec seems very 'guai' but he gets A LOT of stress from this image... he used to seem very happy... but if you had watched his performance during xiao hu dui's concert 7 years ago.. you will realize that he is very lonely inside... just that he does not show it... that's why he went overseas, to a place where nobody knows him... for a new start... when he came back as wu ar ge 5 years ago, he has gotten over all the unhappiness, to return as a new cheerful alec... su you peng DOES have many fans in Singapore and many other countries... not just ppl from fanclubs... i know quite a lot of ppl from other countries just for 1 reason.. we both like alec...<br>i believe that there is no way to say whether a singer or actor is famous or not... cos only the fans will actually know to what extent do ppl like their idol... i dun like 1 singer so it may give me the image that other ppl also dun like him... but is it true? not neccesarily... every singer and actor has their good and bad points and i think the most important thing is their attitude, not popularity or looks...<br>yining</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi smarter_april and Hua,<br>i also alec's fan and is in alecsfrens'... i think that you (smarter_april) should not quarrel with them abt alec's popularity cos so long as we think he is good, y should we care wat other ppl think? the only way for them to actually change that perception is by watching 1 of his shows and see for themselves alec's good performance...<br>yining</div>
