            <div class='col-md body'>Was shocked to hear the news, thought it was a April Fool's joke at first. When the news was confirmed, I was very saddened by the demise of such a great singer and actor. All the fame and fortune amounts to nothing when one is troubled to the extreme by matters of the heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I was listening to his Cantonese song "Zhe Xie Nian Lai" just yesterday, so it felt like dreaming when I heard the news today. I went to listen to it again (anyone knows what is the title of its Chinese cover???) just now as I started to reminisce the shows he acted and the songs he sang.<br><br>May you find the peace you are seeking for and finally be in where you hope to be. Your fans will miss you for what you have given them.<br><br>*RIP*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That show he acted with Jacqueline Ng is "Ye Ban Ge Shen". Yes, the show is based on Phantom of the Opera. Most of the younger people will remember him in "Jin Zhi Yu Ye" 1 and 2. For me, I think "Ba Wang Bie Ji" and "Qian Nu You Hun" were the most memorable.<br><br>I also thought that killing oneself for love is really stupid, but again, the matters of the heart is not what others can feel or comment on. It's his life, he chose it that way, we can only feel it's a pity.<br><br>It was reported that he was a vain person who is afraid of heights. So jumping down from 20+ floors and breaking his arms and legs in progress sounded like an improbable ending to people who know him. He left behind a note saying he was in a dilemma over who to choose from(he had a lover of 18 years, and was recently rumoured to be involved with another 20something guy), so he chose to die instead. With that, he also left behind his many fans who were broken-hearted and still disbelieving that he was gone.<br><br>I hope he finds peace now... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
