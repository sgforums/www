            <div class='col-md body'>huh. when did singaporeans began looking down on pple? So wad if he's used to being a construction worker? Does the music industry look at a singer with coloured lenses? No. As long as one can sing, it doesn't matter if he/she was once a constuction worker or a pastor. It doesn't matter at all.<br><br>Zil..yeap. noboy said A-do had surpassed Kit Chan or Sun YanZi. I specially admire Kit Chan myself, she's daring enough to release the 'sofa music' kind of album. Btw, u noe Kit too, think that A-do's construction worker image really made him stand out. And thanks for tellin me who Cheer Chen is. Yeap. I agree with u. Though quiet, but she's definitely a talented gal with lot of her own thinkings!<br>And A-do dropped out of RIAS chart already? Nvm. It's already quite great that he had done so well since he haven come S'pore for his promotion yet.<br><br>Mazo. Of coz normally pple say 'Seeing is Believing'. As u've wrote the '1978' on ur own profile..definitely pple's first idea was dat u're 24 years old. duh. okay okay. if u're not, then sorry!<br><br></div>
