It's already the 21th of Dec now..surely u can't expect the album sales to continue to rise after so long? Yup...i do agree with u dat some other artistes can hold onto the number one position for weeks...but who? Other than Jay Chou &amp; David Tao (probably some other artistes..i'm not too sure). Surely you can't compare Jay + David to A-do rite? Jay is like soooo popular. Anyways, i think A-do has shown a good results on his report card already. Afterall, he's a Singaporean too.

We are all singaporeans and should feel proud of a-do no matter what happens, even if the success is short-lived. So, Zilchster, who cares how long his album remain on top of the charts? As long as he has done his best, we should feel happy. Why do U have to talk about his album sales dropping? U seem to doubt his singing, if I am not wrong? Sorry for being so direct, but if U really dun like him, please tell us WHY? Even so, everyone will have his own weaknesses and strenghts.</div>

He's very friendly, not stucked up &amp; really treat his fans like his frens..(dat is if..he's off screen. coz he usually tense up quite a lot of in front of cameras. lol!). I really don't feel any gaps between A-do &amp; fans. He's really cool.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Overrated A-do? nay..i don think so. i dunno why u're against him....but probably you just dunno him well enough. A-do's voice is so unique that immediately caught everybody's attention. Sun YanZi's manager once said that A-do has a very rare voice &amp; dat all his songs are nice(after all dis comments, u still said dat A-do is overrated?). &amp; we can't deny that other singaporean singers such as Sun YanZi, had done better than A-do. But still he's the PEARL of singapore. Just STOP the arguments. kinda tired of it already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zilchster.... Wat do U mean that U think that a-do is only over-rated for mediocre work. How did U know that in the first place? From the way U are writing, I can see that so U like "hardworking singers", like F4 e.t.c, singers that do not even care for thier health. Anyway, their singing is not even good. Well, a-do is clever, he does not over-work himself that much like those singers. And because of this, U dun like him. Do anyone out there share the same view as me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't even think A do is trying to be so popular or what, he's just contented that fans appreciate his singing. As for is he over-rated or not, that's up to individual, but his voice is indeed unique. His music may be KTV friendly, but nothing wrong with that, or should it be? Eason Chan and William So craved their own niche with K-songs too, so why not A do?<br><br>Even if he is trounced by 5566 in terms of music sales, it's nothing to be ashamed about, seeing how F4 and S.H.E. dominate the charts with their albums. Shi Li pai may win music fans, but Ou Xiang pai will undeniably sell more albums with their crazy fans buying no less than a few albums, esp when the new editions come out.<br><br>8 Days is terrible in their reviews of Chinese albums. I notice they never give Chinese albums any decent ratings, unless the albums are alternative or critic-friendly, eg. Cheer Chen. That's the same for their English albums reviews. Are they trying to act high-class, I've no idea. But I think I would much trust a review from a Chinese medium rather than that of an English one.<br><br>Actually I am quite curious to know which are those local singers whom you say are far better than A do? I've no doubt one of them is Shaun, right? Talking about locals, Cai Li Lian is worth supporting, though she may not have a strong backing, so good luck to her, give her some cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you think A-do has over hyped, I think you'd better shake dat idea off your mind. As a artiste, you must &amp; need to do some promotions in order to sell better in the industry. I realised Yong Bang doesn't really like doing promotions(but more compared to his first album's ones), and that is why..his album ain't doing so well eventho' his 'Wei Ni Si De Lei' was pretty nice. I mean, you certainly want your album to do well after it has released in the public, right?<br><br>A-do ou xiang pai? Well..personally, i noticed A-do thru his vocal. At my first sight of him, he din leave with any impression on me. He caught my attention thru dat raspy voice of his instead of his good looks.<br><br>Pardon me for my ignorance, but who is Cheer Chen?</div>

I would not say that a-do is the best, but he is definely one of the best out there, dun U agree?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
