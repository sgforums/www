            <div class='col-md body'>It's sad people are dissing singers just because of their unglam background. True, a construction foreman is nothing compared to a pastor in terms of class, but to think this actually constitutes a basis for bias is so so sad. When the class mentality stretches to music, it's an insult to it. When music is concerned, background should not count. Of course, poor people like Ah Du have more to lose than the wealthy ones like He Yao Shan, since it's both his interest and livelihood, whereas He Yao Shan has a comfortable life to fall back on even if she doesn't sing.<br><br>I agree Ni Jiu Xiang Ge Xiao Hai is really cheesy, reminds one of Zhang Yu's songs. But I won't reject an album just because of one song. Whether he can last through so many albums or not, it's another question. I only know he has made a positive impact in Taiwan and is one of the celebrated singers Singapore produced. Singapore has not produced a decent male singer for long, so why reject one when he comes along? Ah Du will be known as the SNAG and YongBang the composing talent, each to his own.<br><br>I don't deny YongBang is more talented than Ah Du when it comes to music and composing, but each to his own positives. Sandy doesn't compose (though she is starting to do some production after more than a decade of singing), but she is still well-loved. Why should people stray to unfamiliar territory instead of doing what they do best? If singing is Ah Du's forte, let it be. We don't need more people who do things which they should not be doing at all.</div>
