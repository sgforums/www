            <div class='col-md body'>I think most martial arts (wu xia) movie fans are going to love this show. You get the usual stuff you often see in typical wu xia shows, but with a much higher touch of class.<br><br>Frankly, I went in with quite alot of expectations, not only because of the rave reviews by mass media movie critics, but also because I have been a big fan of Chow Yun Fatt since young. He was as eye-catching as usual in this show, being the righteous &amp; renowned swordsman Li Mu Bai. He &amp; Shu Lien (who was portrayed by Michelle Yeoh) were actually deeply in love, but due to some reason (you will know what it is when you watch the show), they were not able to express their love for each other openly. Michelle Yeoh was quite convincing in the role of "jiang1 hu2 er2 nu3", as she had often played the same role in other films, except that she also had quite a few scenes which did justice to her feminine, loving side. However, to appreciate all these, you must 1st tolerate her halting Mandarin in a<br>rather strong "angmo" accent. Don't worry, I believe you will hardly notice it as the show progresses, because you will be more captivated by the show than to let anything else distract your attention.<br><br>Zhan ZiYi, who was touted to be the successor of Gong Li, was the fresh nubile daughter of a powerful officier. However, her fragile-looking frame was just the cover for her irrepressible desires to be a free wandering pugilist. In fact, she possessed near-invincible skills &amp; immerse potential, despite her young age, although all these nearly opened a path of self-destruction for her. Her ex-lover, acted out by Zhang Zhen, was a rugged desert bandit who fell for her tough ways. I must say that Zhang Zhen is a rather attractive man, with his unshaven stub &amp; manly showings. However, I am still a little bewildered why the audience laughed the moment he shouted when Zhang ZiYi was<br>chasing after him in the desert...hmm, maybe his words came across in a funny tone or what, I don't know *Shrugz*<br><br>Overall, I really like this show alot. If you grow up amidst wu xia shows like "Chu3 Liu2 Xiang1", "Shu1 Jian4 En1 Chou2 Lu4", "She4 Diao1 Ying1 Xiong2 Zhuan4" (esp the original one by Huang Ri Hua &amp; Weng Mei Ling) , etc, you will find this show a real treat. The motions &amp; actions are all so graceful &amp; well-crafted out, you will think that they are doing ballt instead of martial<br>arts. Watching them float across the rooftops &amp; trees, I am really wishing I am like them, able to float here &amp; there, then I will save tons of $ travelling everywhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Really love this show! Got me another idol in Zhang Zhen though...so MAN!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Rating: 4.5/5</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I concur with Hajime...quite like the show too esp for their gracious fights and floating in air tricks!!<br><br>My only complain...apart from the lead actors' mandarin, is the slowness in pace.....somehow this tends to distract the audience...<br><br>The background music and the title song are really good too!<br><br>Kudos to Lee Ang and Martial Arts choreographer Yuen Wo Ping...and of course Yo Yo Ma!!<br><br></div>
