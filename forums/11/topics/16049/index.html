            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the list of the Singapore Hit Awards in the popularity category...i realised that our Singaporean tastes are different from Taiwan's...<br><br>Zhang Hui Mei has gone AWOL from the popular category...<br><br>In the popular stakes...most of the females have their popularity in Taiwan...but FANN...being no 3...wow...this is probably very funny...when her album did not even sell 20,000 copies in Taiwan...if she wins...wouldn't it be a big joke?<br><br>Guys wise...hahha...we have Jimmy, Tae and Alec Su who are not even that famous in Taiwan now.  Their fan base is like...really...do we have tastes sometimes?<br><br>Anyway, Jay and Stefanie has 5 personal nominations...the most...Sandy Lam has 2, Ah Mei has 2, Faye has 4 (one is a joint nomination), Lin Yixin (2), Stella (3), Tanya (2), Sammi (3), Harlem (3)<br><br>Anyway I think Stella was one of the biggest losers in this year nominations...can't even get into lyricist or composer?  Local act...aiyoh...Dreamz is better than her.  I think that Stella might be one of the biggest losers this year...<br><br>Would like Dreamz FM to win something...but alas...they have to compete with Mayday and Yanzi...honestly...they deserve to win the group u know.<br><br>Lin Yixin...i think he would lose out in composer...lyrics...i dunno...the other songs are better.<br><br>Happy China Dolls are out of the race.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, for one thing u noe, I am already veri happi to noe that elva managed to make it into the top 10 popular female artistes.<br>Yar, oso think that Dreamfm deserves an award this year cos they are really quite good. For the top 10 popular males, i really got nothing to say abt them cos there isn't much fierce competition among them , unlike among the female artistes.</div>

As fot the best song it is Stef's My desired happiness and the best local seller is Stef's My desired happiness too!!!<br><br>Juz 2 add on, the best newcomer section may have 1st prize to 3rd prize. The second best newcomer is Jay followed by Stella. Others are ranked Tension, Fan Wei Qi and then Freya.<br><br>As for the best band,  Tension may be the black horse. Sad 2 say that Sticky Rice is out of the race this year (Ruo Mi Tuan), probably they are too new and LENG MEN, but 2 sad for China Dolls as their results are not as competitive as all the male bands...how come now more male bands than females... I hope 2 have some more females next yr. such as Zip and Sunday Girls.<br><br>As for the best male singer, the blackhorse may be Andy Lau or Jay. Then for the females, the blackhorse could be either Sammi or Fann.<br><br>Strictly saying, here are my predictions for the top 5 male and female singers this year:-<br>Daniel, Andy, Jay, Alec, Aaron<br>Stef, Sammi, Fann, Rene, Sandy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...being a fan of Dreamz fm, i also hope they will win smthg loh..but i guess their biggest bet wld b "buzhide" for the best lyrics...best grp...i tink will lose out to Mayday, n best song, i tink sure some sunyanzi song, most prob "tian hei hei"...<br><br>i really hope dat she wins the most popular female singer though, cos its either Sammi or Fann who will get it...n "fei shui bu liu wai ren tian" mah, n somemore Fann can't really sing, so hope steph will get dat...<br>as for the male side, i tink i rooting for Jay loh...he's the most promising amongst all...mayb Harlem too?</div>

In fact I Do Believe sort of pales besides all 3 of the others.  Yixin Bu Zhi De is nice...but compared to the Li brothers...hmmz...Nah...So the race is between the Sisong and Weisong...Sisong having won a Best Composer at the Taiwan awards has the highest chance of emerging winner...and this song propelled Stefanie to fame, bringing in the song mothers sing to their kids...nostalgic...simple yet touching.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: LI SI SONG<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: LI SI SONG<br><br>2) BEST LOCAL LYRICIST<br><br>Liang Wenfu (Mei You Ren)--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Jim Lin Yixin (Bu Zhi De)--&gt;WINNER<br>Xin Wei (You Yi Tian)<br>Yi Qi (Ru Guo You Yi Tian)<br><br>COMMENTS:  Spoke to Xin Wei...b4...she's a nice person...but I think we could strike her off...her lyrics are meaningful...but...well...they r simple...and not packed wif the punch...if they wanna give her something...she might get.  Yi Qi's Ru Guo You Yi Tian is kinda commercialised...so i don't think he would get it.  Between Jim and Wenfu, I would pick Wenfu...his lyrics are really much better and they really mean something over than BU ZHI DE.  But if they wanna give Dreamz FM a consolation prize...I guess Wenfu would have to forego this honour.  However, I am very upset that Xiao Han had been overlooked for the song WHY...featured in Tanya's I do believe album.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: Jin Lin Yi Xin<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: Liang Wenfu<br>WHO SHOULD BE NOMINATED: Xiao Han<br><br>3) BEST LOCAL SINGER<br><br>Kit Chan--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Tanya Chua<br>Dreamz FM<br>Sun Yanzi--&gt;WINNER<br><br>COMMENTS:  Sad to say, Tanya had never won this award.  Glad to say a few names which I don't like are missing.  Clearly the winner is Yanzi...come on...she is local...and we should all be nationally proud of this 'national treasure'...however, with kit and her concert staged this year...she might have a chance of bouncing back...reminding us not to forget her.  But her venture into TV, not having any new albums for a long time might make us forget her...and yah...i dun think she will win 3rd time round.  So Yanzi...this prize is safely yours.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: Sun Yanzi<br>WHO SHOULD WIN:  Sun Yanzi<br><br>4) BEST NEWCOMER<br><br>Jay Chou--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Fan Weiqi<br>Freya Lin Fan<br>Stella Ng<br>Sun Yanzi--&gt;WINNER<br>Tension<br><br>COMMENTS: This batch of newcomers are kinda pretty strong...but if they wanna give a GOLD SILVER BRONZE awards...would be YANZI, JAY, STELLA...<br><br>Sad to say JOI CAI CHUNJIA has been overlooked...i think her album production was bad or her sales...But actually...to be dreadfully honest, if the gold, silver, bronze award comes out...Stella would win the bronze award becoz she is Singaporean...but the broze should be given to Freya or Tension...Fan Weiqi's voice still not good enuff yet...besides there are professional judges...so...but if there's only one, the race is between Yanzi and Jay...no doubt...Yanzi might just pull another stunt of this one.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: SUN YANZI<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: SUN YANZI<br><br>[This message has been edited by Zilchster (edited 08 August 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for the best local composer, I would still think that Tanya will win cos if the tough competition is bet. Si Song and Wei Song, then it's meaningless and hard 2 decide who will win and makes it more confusing. So I think Tanya will easily TUO YIN ER CHU. My desired happiness may be the dark horse cos it's Stef's Cheng Ming Qu.<br><br>For the best local lyrist, I win Liang Wen Fu will surely win cos his compositions are v.pop. in S'pore and full of experience and SHUI ZHUN. BU ZHI DE may be the dark horse and sad 2 say XIN WEI's song also not bad but I think she may be left out cos the competition is 2 intense.<br><br>For the best local artiste, I think Tanya is the dark horse rather than Kit cos she performed in NDP this yr. and likely 2 gain a lot of appreciation from S'poreans. Therefore from my conclusions, I think even Dreamz fm may outwin Kit over this yr. although she juz held her concert not long ago and she only got one song, wish whereas Dreamz fm got two, BU ZHI DE and Everyday gd. mood. maybe another, Deng Zhe Ni Huai Lai<br><br>Well, for the new artistes, I know it's too sad that Joi was not nominated this year due 2 intense competition. I also didn't expect Tension 2 be in this yr. as new artistes but that's no choice. H/w, I still think that Fan Wei Qi's results are better than Lin Fan in 933 and comparing her album agst'. Lin Fan, I would still think Fan Wei Qi's album is much pleasant 2 listen 2 and Freya has 2 many cover version songs, although her voice is extremely gd.<br><br>That's all 4 my comments and opinions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Below are my predictions on who will win:<br><br>1) BEST LOCAL COMPOSER: Li Si Song (Tian Hei Hei)<br>Reason: Tiz song propelled yanzi to fame and is well-received. Tune is soothing yet touching<br><br>2) BEST LOCAL LYRICIST: Liang Wen Fu (Mei You Ren)<br>Reason: An established songwriter with much experience<br><br>3) BEST LOCAL SINGER + BEST NEWCOMER + BEST FEMALE SINGER + MOST HONOURED FEMALE SINGER IN ASIA PACIFIC + MOST POPULAR FEMALE SINGER<br>+ Best SONG OF THE YEAR + BEST SELLING ALBUM: Sun YanZi<br>Reason: Singapore's singing sensation who has garnered lotsa awards in the region. Powerful lungs despite her being so skinny. Stefanie created history when she was the first local singer to win an award at the Taiwan "Jin Qu Jiang" this year. Her concert at Ngee Ann City proved that she was no mean feat and the fact that some of her fans even went to the extent of camping overnight juz to get the best view of her goes to show juz how popular she is! So I think the above awards goes to her<br><br>4) BEST GROUP: Mayday<br>Reason: Impressive record sales both in Taiwan and Singapore<br><br>5) CHUAN MEI TUI JIAN (RECOMMENDED BY MEDIA): Tanya Chua<br>Reason: Sang this yr's national day song "Where I Belong" and got recognition from Singaporeans<br><br>6) BEST ALBUM PRODUCTION: Jay Chou (Jielun)<br>Reason: Jay might emerge winner coz he got the award @ Taiwan tiz yr. Close fght btw him and the Li brothers (My Desired Happiness) though<br><br>7) ZUI JU YOU WU TAI MEI LI (BEST STAGE PERFORMER): Aaron Kwok<br>Reason: No reason, juz think dat he will win<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> BEST MALE SINGER: Harlem Yu (Tidal Waves)<br>Reason: Harlem's new album song lots of copies in Taiwan as well as locally, but his efforts have never been resognised<br><br>9)ZUI SHOU YA TAI TUI CHONG NA GE SHOU (MOST HONOURED MALE SINGER IN ASIA PACIFIC): Andy Lau<br>Reason: Being in the music sence for many yrs, he should get the award<br><br>10) MOST POPULAR MALE SINGER: Daniel Chan<br>Reason: He's popular, that's why!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5) BEST GROUP<br><br>Dreamz FM--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Mayday--&gt;WINNER<br>Power Station<br>Tension<br><br>COMMENTS:  Much as I would like Dreamz FM to win, I don't think they could...firstly, being a local group...and well...they are up against some heavyweights.  Mayday has the highest chance in this category...good album sales...they write and produce their own music.  They would be taking a sabbathical of two years...this award should reward them nicely...but their two years absence might mean this award going to someone...and since the crux of their music lie in their hokkien songs...they might be at a disadvantage to government don't allow dialect songs...Dreamz have the shi li...but not the international claim.  Power Station is still good but pailing.  Tension is still new...give them a year or two then.  And they might emerge winners.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: MAYDAY<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: MAYDAY<br>6) CHUAN MEI TUI JIAN (RECOMMENDED BY MEDIA)<br><br>Tanya Chua--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Li Si Song<br>Li Wei Song--&gt;WINNER<br>Stella Ng<br><br>COMMENTS: This award is for composer/people in the line of music who help contribute to the music industry...mainly composers/arragers etc.  We can take Stella Ng out of the race.  Li brothers are again fighting one another...and might cancel out, leaving us with Tanya, who just did the national day song.  But since it's Yanzi's year, and owing to Wei Song and Si Song, one of them might actually win the award.  If Si Song picks up best composer, Wei Song might pick the award for this one.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: Li Wei Song<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: Li Wei Song<br><br>7) BEST ALBUM PRODUCTION<br><br>Jay Chou (Jielun)--&gt;WINNER<br>Faye Wong, Alvin Leong, Zhang Ya Dong (Fable)<br>Li Sisong, Li Weisong (My Desired Happiness)<br>Harlem Yu (Tidal Waves)--&gt;DARK HORSE<br><br>COMMENTS:  Faye won't win this one.  Too different.  Too un-commercial.  Jay won this award in Taiwan, and they would have to give Jay something, somehow.  And this award is a fair award, proves his status and a producer/composer.  Harlem Yu...well...his album is unlike Jay's...Jay's style is more uniformed throughout...Li Wei Song and Si Song...probably not...<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: JAY CHOU<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: JAY CHOU<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ZUI JU YOU WU TAI MEI LI (BEST STAGE PERFORMER)<br><br>Sammi Cheng<br>Aaron Kwok--&gt;WINNER<br>Coco Lee--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Zhang Huimei(IS SHE STILL IN???)<br><br>COMMENTS:  I never watched an Aaron Kwok concert...but I am sure it is good...since dancing and pyrotechnics is his forte.  Did watch Sammi's...found is alrite...I wun say it's hot, at least not hotter's than Miss Lee's...but plagued by the cancellation of some of her concerts, Ms Lee might lose the award.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: AARON KWOK<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: AARON KWOK<br></div>

The race is left between Harlem and Jay.  I won't know which one to vote for, but if Jay's gets best production, Harlem would probably score with this...and it's high time Harlem should be rewarded for his efforts.  Tidal Waves is an earnest effort.  Harlem is still at his best with his jia yin and all that.  Jay is still young...and some might not like his style of singing.  One Qn...why wasn't Lee Hom nominated and yet Alex To got in?<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: HARLEM YU<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: JAY CHOU<br><br>10) BEST FEMALE SINGER<br><br>Sandy Lam (2001 Lian)<br>Na Ying (Xin Suan De Lan Man)--&gt;WINNER<br>Sun Yanzi (My Desired Happiness)<br>Faye Wong (Fable)--&gt;DARK HORSE<br><br>COMMENTS:  I really have problems picking the winner for this one.  Seriously, all of them are good.  Sandy is still as good as ever, but I guess the material does not let her shine very well here.  Sun Yanzi is still NEW.  Yes, to all Yanzi fans, she sings well...but it is a bit early to give her a singing award.  Next year would be better though...don't be biased just because she is Singaporean.  The race is left with two good friends and mahjong pals, Faye and Na Ying.  I still have not quite forgiven two things, for Karen Mok not being nominated, and Na Ying winning best female singer in the Taiwan awards...she sings well...does well in those soppy love songs...so she has a high chance of winning this...since she won in Taiwan.  Faye, well, you can't let her go home empty handed right?  And Faye's material is so Faye...but no doubt, Faye shines more than Na.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: NA YING<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: FAYE WONG<br>WHO SHOULD WIN IF SHE WAS NOMINATED: KAREN MOK<br><br>11) ZUI SHOU YA TAI TUI CHONG NA GE SHOU (MOST HONOURED MALE SINGER IN ASIA PACIFIC)<br><br>Jacky Cheung--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Jay Chou<br>Andy Lau--&gt;WINNER<br>Harlem Yu<br><br>C0MMENTS:  Being Asia-Pac, it stretches quite far and wide...no doubt, the two heavenly kings Andy Lau and Jacky Cheung would stand a high chance in this category.  Jay Chou...I would want him to win, with this good album sales and all, but I think he is more popular as a composer...so he would probably be out.  Harlem, probably if this award is for HOSTING...and although his album sold very well.  Andy and Jacky...Andy well...made movies...got Jap stars to act with him (NOTE TIS IS MOVIES)...he's been here for a long time same as Jacky, but Jacky seems semi-retired, with a nose problem, and not a full chinese album release might hurt his chances.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN: SAD TO SAY ANDY LAU<br>WHO SHOULD WIN: JACKY CHEUNG<br><br>12) ZUI SHOU YA TAI TUI CHONG NU GE SHOU (MOST HONOURED FEMALE SINGER IN ASIA PACIFIC)<br><br>Sammi Cheng<br>Sun Yanzi--&gt;DARK HORSE<br>Faye Wong--&gt;WINNER<br>Zhang Huimei(IS SHE IN???)<br><br>COMMENTS:  Sun Yanzi's albums have sold well all over Asia Pac...good chance...Sammi Cheng is known as Asia's Queen.  However, the real gem is Faye.  With two Japanese EPs, a big China market, a HK market, undying fans everywhere, and no matter what schizophrenic music she presents, hoards of fans would buy her music.  Without doubt, she is the queen of asia, over Sammi.<br><br>WHO WILL WIN--&gt;FAYE WONG<br>WHO SHOULD WIN--&gt;FAYE WONG<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But i do hope that Dreamz FM will win this year, cos they really deserve it as we can see, they are really working hard this year, what's more, they were invited to UN, and it is doing Singapore proud, as singaporeans, we should support them, by buying their third album which is coming up.. show your support to local talents... and all the best to dreamz fm and other nominees.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Dreamz 4ever best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...I am very neutral to Sun Yanzi...but she has been like a tidal wave sweeping across asia...and yah...elva's local sales is not as good as yanzi...but hopefully she would do well in japan...hmmz...but it seems elva is hotter in HK than yanzi...<br><br>However...93.3fm is biased...a bit lar...but as we r singaporeans we muz support singaporean singers...hmmz...so more or less they r biased in that sense.

Ah Mei wun...she has not been doing much....Sammi...she has not conquered the whole of Asia...prob...FAYE...FAYE is the indisputed queen of Asia...from China, to HK to Taiwan and to Japan etc...so i tink giving faye tis award is fair enuff...wat u all think?</div>

He's also a hardworking producer and also takes important care and consideration for tension. Forget abt. Andy lau and Li Si song who worked so hard these yrs.
