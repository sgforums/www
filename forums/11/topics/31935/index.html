Fyi, I prefer Jay Chou's songs to Ah Du's, I only said what I thought I heard. Just based on that, you call people sore loser? Or are you more sore YongBang is not on the top10 list?<br><br>I like YongBang's songs, but it's sad his fans put another singer down just because that person happens to be his closest local rival (both being local male singers, though appealing to different audiences). Even if you don't like him, there's no need to make fun of him or his songs.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never disagree Ni Jiu Xiang Ge Xiao Hai is not nice, I would even say it's almost crap. Only Phil Chang will sing that. In fact, I don't even like Jian Chi Dao Di, the lyrics were supposed to be encouraging, but I think the whole thing was not well-thought out, more like inserting a few words here and there to force the meaning out.<br><br>His 1st outing was certainly much better, esp his other non-zhu da tracks. The production of his 2nd album lacks sincerity, I wonder how much is Xu Huan Liang involved. Most probably not much, because it is really much weaker than the previous one which XHL oversaw the whole production. Hope the next album will be much more better, XHL will need the money to clear debts! He still owes local banks a lot of money because of the big loans he took to groom and promote AhDu. That's the difference when you don't have a huge backing like Sun YanZi. I wonder if the Li brothers didn't have Warner to support SYZ, would they also risk bankruptcy like Xu Huan Liang to promote SYZ? They themselves admitted they believed SYZ will not be as big as she is now if they were to promote her themselves.<br><br>I know AhDu is not the best, but I understand how difficult it is for XHL to take such a big gamble on AhDu. The efforts by him and XHL already won me over. Too bad no one did the same for Dreamz FM, Hype Records rather promote "singers" like Phyllis Quek. What a shame.</div>

What a shame.</div></blockquote>yes.. totally agreed... i guess no matter what they say about talent being the brutal litmus test for whether you can make it big... monetary backing (ie. publicity and promotions) is still the crunch factor.... i once heard an interview with XHL who said that he had never heard anyone singing the way ah du does.. as in using his heart and not his head to sing.. and that's what made him want to really help ah du make it big. and the dj was shocked that XHL actually went "door-to-door" to promote ah du to the recording companies... but well, i didn't know it was until the extent of getting into debts!!<br><br>i guess.. at the end of the day, sincerity really does win people over. i must admit while i'm not really an avid fan of ah du  (his voice does takes some time to get used to)... i think his sincerity does shine through in his songs... i particularly like tian hei...<br><br>about dreamz fm.. yeah.. i really think it's just a big waste.. they are really the best example of how sometimes even pure talent is not enough to make it big if nobody actually "groom" them.. but i heard that their contract with hype is almost over?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  but then again, i also heard that they would start preparing for their 4th album this year so.... really waiting for that!!</div>
