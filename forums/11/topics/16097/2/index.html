            <div class='col-md body'>I am not insulting dreamz fm supporters...in the first place 93.3fm have songs like Boom(China Dolls) go up...in fact tian tian hao xin qing is not one of the best works...in fact other songs are nice...but dun put 16 tracks...becoz by the time it gets to the 10th or 12th track...it gets tedious...their music not bad (though their singing style a bit...not so original??!!??)  But dreamz fm 2...the tunes are almost the SAME...so by the time i reach the track halfway...i cannot tell the difference...<br><br>On the whole they r okie...they r not the best in Singapore or the best band out there...but definitely still better than some...<br><br>But Jay and Lee Hom's album are more reflective of the music industry...</div>

LIPS... i recalled buying my 1st rock t-shirt there (yes, its skid row) :-)<br><br>glad dat u agreed w me about nuno :-&gt; he's oso a good songwriter, i think... extreme simply disappeared, along w other bands... jimi hendrix... heard so much about him, but i never bought his stuff b4... any others?? both guitarist n bassist of mr. big is really good too... too bad i kan't play the guitar<br><br>i quite like blink182... 'all the small things' is one of my faves, but they r really rowdy... the superman song from 3 doors down is really cool too. heard by buckcherry?? just heavy metal like GNR... but they got really catchy tunes like 'check your head'... err, i might as well confessed i like the creed album alot :-) last year i went to yahoo! music chat a few times... got alot of stick everytime i mentioned dat i liked creed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>guess wat?? just heard a new chinese band called 'shi san (thirteen)'... on 'super live' SCV ch54... they r really young n their sound is quite brit-inspired... one of the songs they performed, 'blue ceiling'... is like a toned-down 'creep' w/o the noise... i like the positive tone they generate... happy chirpy, something like blink182<br><br>another weekend over... slothing again in 7 hours!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kalla_boo: if you are in the same sec sch as Tanya, we are in the same alumni. My mention of the "English roots" pertained more to my batch, which is a few years after hers (and probably yours too, if you hail from about the same batch as her). As the years go on, the sch has become more and more "angmo". In fact, alot of them even showed apparent contempt to having to attend Chinese classes. I think with the departure of our beloved "xiao zhang", the situation would probably have "worsened", so I rather not find out what it is like now. But do update us on our beloved sch if you happen to chance on any news about it.<br><br>(ps: apologies to other users for the digression)</div>

(theres hope afterall... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) i just got myself the jay chou debut album. donno leh, some pieces really sound like run-of-the-mill R &amp; B to me (actually a couple of them sound like rip-offs), though his voice harmony manage to rescue them from mediocrity. but the music arrangement for Yin4 Di4 An1 Lao3 Ban1 Jo1 is very very good, especially the bluesy piano in the background. wonder where the arranger is from...but all in all, it's still an impressive effort for a debut, i suppose. do u have a fav song in the album?<br><br>RE: hajime<br><br>heya, xue2 mei4!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> which batch r u from? i'm in the batch just after tanya's. i remember her coz she won the school's singing competition. i even recall she sang Desperado; she did it VERY well. but she's quite an aloof character, likes to walk around not smiling..hahaha.....<br><br>oh do u still remember the school song? i recall that i had to learn it phonetically coz my chinese was so hopeless.<br><br>btw, i'm waiting for ur reply to Sng Jun Song's latest post in his album review corner. or maybe theres really no need for a reply.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm... juz some personal comments. I'm neutral towards Dreamz FM, but felt that their "Shou Hu Xin" was good. Actually, it took them lots of courage to continue producing albums (considering their album sales), so why have negative feelings towards them? Well, at least I prefer them to F4, though I admit that the latter are better- looking.<br><br>Btw, Stef's album were great. Highly recommended.</div>
