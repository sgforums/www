            <div class='col-md body'>heya all, i'm quite new to chinese music. i did use to listen to it when i was in secondary school. i remember people like liangwenfu, panying and tianjing.(!!) somewhere in between then and now, I got lost in red hot chilli peppers and radiohead. IÂ’m trying to get back into listening chinese music again, so I need some help. Can anyone recommend me five good albums to listen to? They donÂ’t have to be recent stuff. Releases of the past two years is fine. my musical tastes tend towards rock. I also like ballads, but not the syrupy kind. An example of a ballad I like is Ling3 Wu4 written by Li Zong Sheng, partly coz of the lyrics.<br><br>thankee thankee!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi... here's some little suggestions:<br><br>- mayday's 2nd album, ai qing wan sui (rock,hokkien)<br><br>- jay's debut album (r&amp;b)<br><br>- sun yan zi's 2nd album (pop)<br><br>- zhou hui's debut album, jing xuan (pop)<br><br>- tanya's debut album, hu xi (pop/rock)<br><br>- faith yang's 2nd album, silence (rock)<br><br>- elva hsiao's debut album (r&amp;b)<br><br>- eason tan's latest album, it's me (pop/rock)<br><br>for rock bands, i only have heard mayday, tolaku n wubai's music before. since wubai had not released anything new for a long time n tolaku is abit immature... i can only recommend mayday. even if u don't like hokkien songs, give it a try... trust me :-)<br><br>i guess, nowadays chinese songs r better as there r more variety... not just sentimental love songs only... even jackie's new album got a nice slow rock number... n people like david tao n jay breaking new ground w r&amp;b... i thought i dont like r&amp;b at all... til i take a chance n buy jay's cd.<br><br>hey... i quite like rhcp too... i still have the under the bridge single somewhere in my collection :-&gt; plus pearl jam, nirvana, bush, blur, garbage, supergrass... those r the good years of alternative rock... then less n less good bands came out... too bad.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you ask me, I will definitely recommend Dreamz FM albums. If you really need to choose, you can start listening to the 1st album, it's a good introduction of to DFM's music. The 2nd album was the maturing phase, and that is the one with the very popular BuZhiDe (best song!). For the 3rd, you can just let your mind flow with the notes they are hitting really high. It is mainly comprising of ballads which are not overly sickly sweet, but rather warm and tingling. Highly recommended are "Shou Hu Xing" and "7-11 De Ai Lian".<br><br>I also highly recommend Huang Da Wei's albums, especially his double CD compilation. His recent one (actually it is 1+ year old already) "Qiu Tian 1944" is a critically acclaimed album, which unfortunately did not do well in the sales charts.<br><br>Tao Zhe's 1st album had made a pretty big impact too. I bought mine during the days when he did not even have a distributor for his album here, and I had to buy the imported copy. Needless to say, mine did not include bonus tracks...but IMHO, it is still one of the best Chinese albums.<br><br>English wise, the albums I often spin even till now are John Lennon "Lennon Legends", Oasis "What's the Story? (Morning Glory)", Blur "The Great Escape", Pulp "Different Class", all albums by Beatles, Jamiroquai and David Bowie, etc...Yupz, my tastes are pretty Brit-influenced...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wun advise to begin with Dreamz FM...it's not an ideal measurement of the whole pop scene.  It is good to start with Jay Chou and Lee Hom...they are critically reknowned...so start with their albums...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so! there are beatles, oasis, rhcp, nirvana and garbage fans here! looks like my kind of bulletin board afterall! ;D<br><br>thankee all for your recommendations! they will be taken into solemn consideration upon my next trip to chua joo huat cd store.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>well, juz to let u all know how pathetic my knowledge is, i have absolutely no idea who faith yang, zhou hui, grace chou, dreamz FM and huang da wei are. heh heh...pai seh pai seh. but will certainly give them a listen when i get the chance.<br><br>i think right now i have a GRAND TOTAL of..taratada....EIGHT chinese albums! heh. they include 4 faye wong albums (sorry, i'm a glam-worshipper), sun yan zi (2+3), harlem yu ("Hai Xiao") and also Tanya Chua ("I Do Believe"). the last four r partly why i decided to start listening to chinese music again. i agree with roy29, the variety of chinese music has certainly widened considerably. and the calibre too! i'm quite impressed by tanya's compositions, somehow her tunes manage to capture that area between being too catchy and being too odd. though i wish she would put in more effort into music arrangement. i think one single acoustic and a voice is poignant, but not really very interesting. Stephanie's compositions are not bad too, and at least she breaks out of the usual 'chinese song'G-D-Em-Bm-C-Bm-C-D-G chord progression. As for Stella Koh (is it Koh?), i think she really sucks. her compositions are like, u know, airport music. and since i'm female, i dont give a hoot what she looks like. though it would be interesting to bump into her in arts one day and be able to see how she usually behaves... :O<br><br>Ooops...sorry i ramble...i just like to analyse compositions. it helps me when i write my own nonsense, u see. it's interesting to find out just what makes a song tick. sometimes it can be the lyrics or just a nice riff or bassline, or even just a strange chord sticking out of nowhere! well, thats just my odd opinion. donno if u guys have any opinions on this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, listening to music does not have a restriction or according to popularity of a singer, as long as it is good music, it is worth our support. Why must we chose singers who are popular in the industry?<br>I strongly recommend you guys, Dreamz FM 3, although they are not supported by our fellow Singaporeans, but i strongly feel that they have put in enough effort in this album.<br><br>I just cannot understand why pple listen to music according to popularity.. then good music is not appreciate at all. How can u judge Dreamz FM music without giving them a chance? Just by the Media, saying they are like Bee Gees? Just like that u have to judge them in negative way?<br><br>I can tell you if they release their album just to be popularise, then there won't be any Dreamz FM 3. But they do it for their love of music and hoping that we can appreciate their music as fellow Singaporeans, is that wrong too?????<br><br>Is not becos i support them then 'fight' for them.. but believe me, they do it for the love of music, appreciate it.<br></div>

'fish' for prosperity and abundance is it? hahahaha.......oops...hope no fish fans here....;P<br><br>donno about chinese songs lasting too long...never really had that impression. but one thing that can make a song SOUND long are REPEATED VERSES. taht really gets on my nerves sometimes, especialy if the lyrics were not particularly good in the first place. it's like having to hear the same bull s**t twice! and i think repeating verses reflects really poorly on the lyricist's creative ability.<br><br>finally know who dreamz FM are...so they're singaporeans. saw a poster of them today, they r really not picture perfect, r they? heh...no offense intended, fei chuan. but one question, would u be as avid a supporter if they were not singaporeans?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, many people have a very "high-class" way of listening to music, ie. listening to music which music critics say are good blah blah. Perhaps that will make them look high-class too *shrugs* Of course, that is purely my own opinions.<br><br>Dreamz FM is not bland definitely. I understand the comment of them being one-hit wonder, but that is seriously undermining their abilities. BuZhiDe is the song which makes people take notice of who they really are, but that does not mean they have only that one good song. They had lots of good songs in their 1st/2nd album as well, but since these songs were not played on air or given special mention by critics, hence no one knew much more about them or their songs besides "BuZhiDe". At least BZD made people really took notice of them, which is not such a bad thing, I guess?<br><br>Btw, I came into contact with their music since their days in Aegeam, or now known as the MusicDreamer. I am definitely not those so called fans who jumped on their bandwagon of supporters after BZD.<br><br>Frankly, since after those days of Xi Ban and Sheng Ming Guo Ke (the old SBC serials), I can't really think of any serial songs which are of good standards. Most local serials just leech popular songs off some singers and just put them as the theme songs of the shows. Power Station and Mavis Hee "contributed" alot of that sense. "Tian Tian Hao Xin Qing" may not be DFM's best work, but I feel it is at least tailored for and appropriate for the show, which is supposed to be lighthearted.<br><br>I realise when alot of people mention about supporting local music, they will mention Mavis Hee, Kit Chan, Tanya, and of course Stefanie Sun. Seriously, if they have not made it good in Taiwan, would people still give any hoot about them? Where are our Zheng Zhan Luns, Hong Shao Xuans, Tian Jings and Pan Yings then? Oh, they did not get the chance to step out of Singapore and into TW...(but their songs did. Eg. Lin Zhi Xuan and Yu Guan Hua sang some of ZZL's songs)<br><br>Kit did not sell that well for her 1st album, so she re-packaged and re-released it in TW, which made a big splash. Suddenly, she became the the pride of Singaporeans.<br><br>Same thing for Mavis Hee, people only knew about her Ming Zhi Dao, but most people gave her scant notice until she became known in TW for her "Yi Han" album.<br><br>Tanya was only known in the English music circuit and pub scene here before she started singing Chinese songs. Hu Xi introduced her proper into the Chinese scene, but I think she expresses herself much much better in English, thanks to her "English roots" when she studied in a certain girls' sch (nono, not RGS).<br><br>Stefanie Sun started out in TW even before she was introduced to the home audience. I think it does not take a genius to understand the logic. Yes, most local fans hanker after certain fads only after they have taken TW/HK by storm. Many locals only knew about her after that very famous gun scare incident. When she made it good in TW, her popularity spread like wildfire and hit the Singapore scene. She is no doubt a good singer, but I think no one will bet against the possibility that she may not have made it so big if she had not started in TW initially.<br><br>I am not that sure about Xin Wei's popularity overseas, but my gut feel is that she will be more well-received and better accepted in TW than in here. I guess TW fans know how to appreciate good music better than us?<br><br>Oh, in case you are still in doubt, one very good example of local fans following in the shadows of the TW fans -- F4. Need I say more?<br><br>(PS: Apologies for the long mail, but can't help that I wrote so long. Oh, can't bother if anyone cares about what I wrote too)<br></div>

And saying their cover not appealing? is the cover so important? or the vocals? Did you listen to the whole album???? how can u just judge a book by the cover?<br><br>Ya, mayb u pple think with looks, can produce album, then can sell well? then what's the pt? Music is for us to relax, not for us to see how handsome is the guys... or pretty.. when come, AHHHH... shouting.. that is a way of supporting music, or the person?<br><br>I am not a fan of Dreamz FM, but well, look, they have put in a lot of effort and just becos of some of the negative comments, does that means all their hard work are gone???? Just a few neg comments, we have to forget how many months and efforts they put in????????<br><br>Then why did they represent Singapore to UN if their songs are so lousy????????

            <div class='col-md body'>RE: Roy29<br><br>yah, i remember when kurt killed himself...i was quite shocked, coz the band were sorta at their prime and he just got married. but then there seemed to be something philosophical about his suicide which i cant quite describe..... oh do u recall that after that LIPS and 77th Street (at far east) started selling copies of his death cert? man, that was really creepy.<br><br>brit bands are okay, but i just dont like their sound as much as US bands. they use too many synthesizer effects which distract from the main band sound. i prefer blink182, wheatus and 3 doors down. their sound more raw and and the tunes are more alternative. PLUS their drummers play like maniacs (all copy green day one... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">), so tehy r very fun to listen to.<br><br>oh definitely i remember nuno, he of the black painted fingernails. "more than words" was the first song i learnt how to play on the guitar. nuno is a damn good guitarist. do u remember this song in their first album, "Flight of the Bumblebee"? fwaaah!!!donno what happened to extreme now. well, for guitar licks, mostly i listen to the grandfather jimi hendrix  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> donno how he does it, he can sing a song while playing the counter-melody on his guit at the same time!! he's my guitar god. oh, i think wubai is also quite solid. i like especially his solo in Nuo2 Wei1 Sen1 Lin2.<br><br>ahh...i know who is sandee chan now. heard that afternoon 3.30 song before on TV. very nice song. MTV oso very funny.<br><br>RE: Zilchster<br><br>just to let u know, zilchster, my comments about repeated lyrics and music arrangement are generic considerations about what makes a good song. therefor they apply to all songs, english or chinese (or malay or tamil... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">). i'm not using english songs to compare to chinese songs. of course english songs oso have repeated lyrics and unintersting arrangement. but it just so happens taht this is true more often than not of chinese songs. dats why i bring it up.<br><br>RE: hajime<br><br>hey, i think that when zilchster suggested that one should not start by listening to dreamz fm but to more renowned singers instead, his (or her) only intention was to enable that person (in this case, me) to have a better idea of what the current chinese pop scene is like. it is a matter of fact that jay chou and lee hom are critically acclaimed and hence can serve as a more accurate reflection of what the current chinese pop scene is like. in fact, i think zilschter clarified his/her intention when he/she said that "dreamz fm is not an ideal measurement of the whole pop scene." (hahaha...sorry zilch...i make u sound like some hermaphrodite with all the he/shes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> cant be too careful in these forums.)<br><br>hajime, u say that the only reason why singaporeans do not appreciate dreamz fm is bec they have not made it big in taiwan like steph, mavis, kit and so on. that may be true. i think we dont always appreciate our local artistes and need external validation. so taiwan is like our testing ground...if make it big there then worthy of support. (sigh...what to do? singaporeans always so insecure one what...)<br><br>oh btw, i came from same school as tanya, and let me tell u, our school very "cheena" one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> so no england roots to speak of. it is tanya herself who has always been anglo. (nope, i dont know her personally, though i remember what she was like at the time)<br><br>RE: nameless<br><br>i think zilchster said that he listened to all 16 songs of dreamz fm until xian...so cannot say he never listen to their songs.<br><br>so erm...r u saying that we should appreciate singers based on how much work and effort they put in, what radio station plays their songs and on how many fans they have? these r bad arguments, nameless. if u truly think that dreamz fm is good, u must talk about their music and what u find good about it. to clarify, i am not taking sides here. (hell, i cant even take sides, since i've never heard dreamz fm...hahaha.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)no, i'm just showing u how to make a better argument here, nameless.</div>
