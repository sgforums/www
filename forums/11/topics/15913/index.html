But is her album really that bad?  Pls reply, I haven't bought it yet.<br><br>Not that I bother abt these things, but hey, it might affect her reputation...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean...I do like Coco up till a certain extent...but then...coco does have a stronger voice than elva's...but point aside...<br><br>Coco started out not singing r&amp;b actually...but anyway...coco's album is not as 'bad' as elva's album...in her true lover u and me...i found the songs so so...i thought how american could it get man...i feel tat elva is more american than coco in this way...at least from her third album...more to authentic american kinda pop album.<br><br>Isn't it unfair to compare elva with coco?  juz tat coco was away to do her english album...than elva popped up?  their voices are diff...their images are diff...maybe songs a bit the same...but let's not compare elva wif coco...and even so...coco could break out of taiwan...and if elva is little coco...wat the heck?  she might one day go international...and where would jolin be then?  Nevertheless dun compare...<br><br>Jolin doesn't suck...juz tat her songs are not as nice as elva's...her songs are more cutesy M2M tat kinda...and the lyrics really very wu liao...in fact elva's album has very good lyrics and more meaningful...Jolin's songs also so immature lor...i tink yao qian saved the best for her and sandy lam...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all...this is an album review of Elva's album from The Straits Times Friday 27 April 2001.  The reviewer gave her album a four star rating out of five...very rare for this column.<br><br>Here's the review extract...<br><br>The Cappucino Girl is back.<br><br>This time Elva Hsiao returns as a shampoo girl with lustrous black hair - and a brand new album that is as exciting as her new publicity shots for her third release.<br><br>The title track MING TIAN which opens the album Mrs Guy Ritchie's Music with its droning electronic backbeat and Hsiao's sometimes distorted vocals.  But she offers more variation in terms of melodic progression than Maddy's track.<br><br>Tomorrow, the album - whihc comes with a bonus VCD of footage of her concert last year also sees her working with a slew of interesting names.  Take for instance Sky Wu who wrote the music for the funky yet sultry after burner Secret on which she also raps in english.  The album also features Stanley Huang rapping on Let It Go.<br><br>Also be on the lookout for the track Next Time I Fall In Love which features the return of Japanese R&amp;B diva Sakura whom Hsiao worked with on the latter's album HONG QIANG WEI.<br><br>These two tracks as well as a Angel's Temporary Departure and Keep your Speech Short remind u of the music of J-pop R&amp;B goddess Misia and of the fact Hsiao's forte lies in R&amp;B.<br><br>Beyond R&amp;B, tomorrow also embraces the 2step/UK Garage movement in tracks like Love's beautifuk and Third-time in love.<br><br>Like Misia Hsiao's music teases u with juz a little bit of soul while retaining sufficient pop sensibilites to attract a mainstream audience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of couse i,ve listened 2 Elva's album liao and find her fast songs not as good as her slow songs because very LUAN. Her slow songs are more R&amp;B just like CoCo except that Elva is prettier than CoCo. But her fast songs are pretty  much better in her first two albums than in the second album. Hey there, this is juz my individual comment. All lot of others have their own viewpoints so stay out of my biz.</div>
