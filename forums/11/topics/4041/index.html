            <div class='col-md body'>I don't agree about the part that WeWe was born because of their singing. WeWe was born more because of the "ou xiang group" fad caused by F4. Both Li Wei and Lin You Wei were already in the entertainment circle long before WeWe's times, but they were only put together when the "ou xiang group" fad came out. That explains the birth of PEACE and ZIP as well.<br><br>Never watched WeWe's serials before, but saw their performances on TV. They seemed more seasoned than F4 in their performances, but I just can't bring myself to like them. Somehow I feel they are quite proud? *shrug*<br><br>Anyway, F4 was born because of Meteor Garden, so they were not as prepared when they were formed into a group, so their way of interacting with the media was really awkward and stiff. But it is in the rawness which we saw their honest selves. Better treasure their more true selves before they get tainted by all the dirt and nastiness of the entertainment industry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WeWe is proud???  Their humble attitude is one of the most well known in the circle.  Both You Wei and Li Wei are very humble...and that has earned them quite a lot of praise.  I would say that they are both very sincere.  Especially since Li Wei says that he has no zi ge to teach anybody how to yan xi.  That's being very courteous!<br><br>I wouldn't say WeWe was put together because of the ou xiang fad.  They've known each other for 3 years already.  And the band has been formed for some time already and their single was released in 2000...but they were unable to make it big then.<br><br>I have a feeling that a salivia war between F4 and WeWe fans is going to start.  Like in Taiwan...<br><br>I've heard ppl say WeWe is more real than F4...here, ppl say it the other way round.<br><br>Anyway, my point is, everybody has preferences, just that F4 is more popular here, so it's not really fair to WeWe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree F4 is more popular in sg compared to WeWe. But if Li Wei's tu shi nan zhi wen VCD and Ma La Xian Shi VCD (provided got you wei's performance), things might be different. Singapore only can see one hour of the Wan Quan Yu Le hosted by both Li Wei and You Wei.<br>But one point i disagree with some of you here. WeWe is proud??? Excuse me they are well known for being humble.( Not tat F4 is not. No offense. i really dun wan a F4 WeWe war in singapore like wat happened in Taiwan. Hope F4 fans can also like WeWe and WeWe fans can also like F4)<br>Actually WeWe this group has being formed for quite a while before the ou xiang group thing. Their "Happy Day" album has been prepared for 2 years. So 2 years ago, there already got a group call WeWe but not offically introduced. I thought they were born becoz of their participation in ads. I'm not very sure myself.<br>Whether WeWe is more popular than F4 or the other way round doesn't matter. As long as we stand by the idols we like, does it matter whether they are popular? Will WeWe fans abandon WeWe in future if they are not popular anymore? I hope most of your answers are no. I think F4 fans will not abandon F4 too if they are not popular anymore right?<br>WeWe is coming to sg soon. Hope all fans can go support their activites. F4 concert is going to be held soon. Hope it will be a big success. Both of our idols are coming. Hope an F4 vs WeWe war will not happen here. Dun wan them to feel unhappy and think tat sg fans are like some tw fans (a little unreasonable). Nevertheless, good luck to both F4 and WeWe.<br><br>[This message has been edited by weweluv4eva (edited 22 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's not said who is more popular n who is not so popular. It depends on the fans, coz now they maybe WEWE fans next maybe F4 fans or F4 fans change to WEWE fans WHO KNOWS? Anyway WEWE is a group n F4 is not a group. As long as we support the one or group we like, does it matter who is more popular?<br><br>DON'T BECOZ THEIR R POPULAR THAN LIKE THEM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just received the first 14 episodes of Ju Zi Jiang Nan Hai today from my friend in TW.  Regarding the rumoured very high viewership, I'm not very sure about that.  My friend told me that they've stopped airing it in Taiwan for 1 week already because the 8 o' clock show has been extended by 1/2 hr and has cut into the 9pm, Ju Zi Jiang NAn Hai time slot.  If the show really had very high ratings, they would not just stop airing like that.</div>
