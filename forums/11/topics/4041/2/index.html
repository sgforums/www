            <div class='col-md body'>I've watched until Episode 7.  Each episode is about 1/2 hr.  ken is called You in the show.  Supposed to be a very da shuai ge...dozens of girls going gaga over him.  The story starts with Stella(guangxi)'s parents telling her that they r getting divorced and re-marrying two other people, who are a couple(You's parents).  So they end up switching partners...crazy...and the 6 of them end up living under one roof.  Guangxi fell for YOu at first sight....but later changed her mind, cos he had a terrible character...he said it was wu suo wei that his parents were re-marrying.  Yup, so he ends up going to Guangxi's school and being in the same class as her.  Yu Chun from Pin Qiong is starring as Ying Tai, Guangxi's admirer in Ju ZI Jiang.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Wewe may still remain popular here in Singapore cos we are able to catch You-wei's Wan Quan Yu Le almost everyday!! While it is more difficult to see F4 all the time. Also, fans of the other F3 (other than Zai Zai) may be waiting for far too long for their respective idols to appear. For me personally, I have been waiting for Jerry to come to Singapore to promote his new album for a long time! But the album is not even out...so that is the difference. A bit sad for F4, unless it is true that they come out with something special NOW.</div>

Too bad, people might say f4's fame is cos by the drama  "meteor garden", i agree too.
