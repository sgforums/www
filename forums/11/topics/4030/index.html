            <div class='col-md body'>Only saw his MTV, "Ni Shi Wo Chui Sheng Ai De Nu Ren" or something like that..if my memory serves me correctly..<br><br>Find the lyrics abit cringe inducing leh. Esplly the chorus that goes " You are the woman I love most and I am the guy you love most.." It's a love song, I geddit..but still !!!!???!!<br><br>But the melody quite nice lah...<br>(that's an afterthought. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>Maybe the rest of the album is more promising?? Ballads are always promoted as zu da ge as they have greater appeal...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...the melody is nice...really nice...in this album 10 songs are written by Yongbang...another song is a cover of Li Shuquan's song...<br><br>The one which u keep on hearing is Ni Shi Wo Zui Shen Ai De Ren.<br><br>The lyrics are a little standard...does make u cringe a bit...but on the whole melody is nice...8 songs are those sentimental songs.<br><br>Do get his album...support him...<br><br>And as I mentioned...I kinda know him...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not much incentive to buy the album.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Find that for homegrown composers/lyricists, their melodies are great but lyrics always kind of lao diao ya. ie: hackneyed. (Even my fave DreamzFM's songs lyrics aren't that "inspiring"... ) Guess Singaporeans aren't much men/women of letters...? (With the exception of Cheng Jia Ming)<br><br>Just 1 and half cents worth from this armchair critic.<br><br>P/S: Anyway, Yong Bang doesn't have to worry too much about his album sales, does he? It seems that his song is on MTVAsia Feng Sheng Ban. Sales should be too not bad right.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This elusive (his face, I mean) Yong Bang performed at a New Year concert in Taipei last night (telecast on TVBS)and he reminds me of a better looking version of Wu Bai...! He's quite an energetic performer, prancing around the stage. I think he's better at singing ballads than fast numbers.<br><br>Any more info about this Xiaohan? Is she a full-time lyricist and what other singers has she written lyrics for? I thought her lyrics for Sandy's songs are simple yet quite meaningful.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't dare say he is very popular in Taiwan...but still okie...his album sold remarkably quite well...in fact...amongst the current batch of newcomers (Wu Enqi, Zhao Zhibi, Kong Ling Qi etc)...yong bang's album has had modest sales.  One of the better performers...strangely...Wu Enqi turned out to be quite a flop...i would say the same would go for Celeste I cannot sing Chong if her album reaches taiwan.  But most local singers pale in comparison to Steffy.  Not bad...do support yong bang.<br><br>He has a music school in chinatown...dunno if he is still in it...Attitude Music...he has another production house...he did perform in Min Ge Restaurants b4 and all that...did not see the concert...so cannot comment on his performance whether he is energetic...but he can sing lar...juz tat the lyrics can make me cringe a little.<br><br>The CD is available in HMV...and selected CD Rama outlets.<br><br>Xiaohan is a female...20 something to 30 something...i think lyrics is not her full time profession.  She has been nominated for the Singapore Hit Music Awards for best local lyricist.<br><br>Some of her works include:<br><br>Mavis Hee (Ni Chou De Yan)<br>Tanya's (Why)<br>One of Daniel Chan's in the Bi Wo Xing Fu album...<br>Freya's Dou Shi Ta album...she co-wrote the lyrics...for the title track.<br>Kit Chan's Bie Rang Wo Zai Jian Dao Ni in Xuan Yao album</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the info on Xiaohan... hope Spore musicians can continue to make a bigger impact on the Chinese pop scene.<br><br>It's definitely easier to find Celest than Yong Bang in local music stores. It's all in the marketing and packaging.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i like Celest, especially her performance tcs 8 tv serials as a social worker. very convincing &amp; nice theme song.<br><br>Sigh...<br>Pity she join Channel U. Her market value will definately b limited by Channel U resources. So her album is only released locally. Not a sucess i suppose....<br><br>Nv see Yong Bang nor hear his songs b4 but my fren who is a tough critic told mi d melodies of his songs not bad so i assume it should b alright.<br><br>Now tat u all say he look like a better verison of Wu Bai then i think no hope liao cos ultimately the pop music industry depend too much on market value ot the artiste so....<br><br>------------------<br>Would i be Happier if i let it All out?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though Celeste Chong is in MediaWorks, her album was not released under the MediaWorks label. In fact, I think 93.3fm was actually the station which "quan dao shou bo" her song, not UFM.<br><br>As for whether she can sing or not, I think I much prefer her voice to Fann's.</div>
