            <div class='col-md body'>"..his compositions are better than his singing..." -&gt; sounds like Jonathan Lee and Li Ya Ming  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Haha, actually for many composers, their compositions are usually better than their singing. Not everyone is like Xiong Tian Ping, Sky Wu, Huang Da Wei, etc who can sing as well as they compose. Ocean Butterflies is also where Kit Chan struck out, but I don't see much problems with her case. For a debut album, I feel it is of at least above-average standards, but perhaps some listeners may have higher expectations than others. But I agree that Zilchster seems to have some comments on Ocean Butterflies' management. I think it will be good for you to feedback to them, because I find your comments quite valid on some points. OB deserves to go further given their contribution to the local music scene, so being a local music supporter like you, I'm sure you would want to see OB go further with improvements, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>JJ's singing technique is a bit similar to AhDu, but I will attribute it to the training they got under the same vocal school. Ronald Cheng used to sing so much like Jacky Cheung too (his voice is really similar as well), because he underwent the same training, but after more releases, he started to develop his own singing style, so hopefully it will be the same case for JJ. Dancing is not his forte, just like people will not comment on Sun Yanzi's "dancing" (refer to Lu Guang), so the same reasoning, it will not be fair to comment on JJ's.<br><br>Hope my comments didn't offend anyone. Support local music!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even HK awards which used to be criticised as one big political game by record companies had become far more objective recently due to the pressure by fans and music critics. Taiwan Golden Melody Awards used to be perceived as the most objective among the Asian awards, but the recent few years were a big farce. David Tao not winning anything this year summed up everything. Reason given by the judges was that "he should know what he had done", widely believed to be referring to David's criticisms over the objectiveness and transparency of nominee selection. If next year continues to be like this, I think the awards will lose all credibility altogether.<br><br>I would love Hu Yan Bin to win Best Newcomer since I quite like his songs. At least he got one award, but frankly who knows the other China singers besides HYB and Yu Quan? One case of "pork distribution" on play here.<br><br>Perhaps the distinction between Best Newcomer and Most Popular Newcomer should be better differentiated. Best to me means of certain level of ability esp in singing. In that aspect, I do not feel Ah-Du is any inferior to S.H.E. for last year's award. S.H.E didn't win Best Newcomer in Taiwan either, it was taken by Kong Ling Qi. If comparing on the same pedestal, Ah-Du will be better than KLQ anyway, so Taiwan Golden Melody Awards showed its subjectiveness again (KLQ's mentor XiaoChong was one of the judges). So I'm quite surprised you even mentioned TW awards as a better judge.<br><br>However, I was quite taken by surprise too that JJ won gold. JJ is not bad and can compose, but I thought he will get at most a silver. My choice for gold was actually Van Fan, I personally felt he was better overall. Ability to compose is one matter, good in singing is another. JJ's composing abilities can be judged for the awards of Best Song or Best Producer, etc. I knew 5566 will not win it given the boycott, so the way was clear for Energy to take bronze. Was a little disappointed Z Chen was not in the top 3, but it was rather expected as he had much lower profile in S'pore.<br><br>Erm, I think all of them were singing live ba? Who was not singing live? It was actually quite obvious who can sing live and who can't. Ho Yeow Sun was off-key several times in one song and it was not even a dance track. Maybe she is better a studio singer...no offence meant, just my honest opinions.<br><br>It's actually a compliment to put JJ the same line as Vanness, because Vanness was known for his dancing. A rip-off meant at least he had some decent moves? Again, I do not feel JJ's dancing should be singled out. Sun YanZi had some ballet dancing training when she was young, but I don't find her dancing any good either.<br><br>Take award results with a pinch of salt. It's just a game to distribute pork. What matters more should be the fans' support and album sales. No need to put too much feelings and emotions into it, not worth it lah~</div>
