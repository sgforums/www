So can't be the face factor lor...<br><br>His compositions are quite good, "Ji De" and "Yi Ge Ren Zhu" are my faves among those I have listened so far. He is just only 22yo now and still has a long way to go, but glad to see that he seems to be heading towards the right direction. His debut album "Yue Xing Zhe" was released in TW on 4 April, and received rave reviews, so it should be worth a look-out in S'pore. Hopefully soon, because I am lacking of good albums to listen lately!!!<br><br>Btw, I may give SEVEN a try (and you should too! If you support local). I like the positivity in their "Tai Tou Wang" featured in the ZaoBao ad on TV. It's time local composers get some due recognition, considering the less-than-conducive environment they are in...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went to his promotion at J8 last Sun, his voice was really great, he dance the jiu shi wo and sing it at the same time, he is really talented, can also composed songs...<br>We must really support local, soem of them can't get recognition from singaporeans and 'die' off eg.. Dreamz FM  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  so we must support jun jie!<br>But the promo suppose to start at 530 in the end starts at 630 cos his juniors performing his songs, kinda pissed at the beginning but his juniors esp they named themselves J4.. also not bad.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents worth about JJ...probably would offend some ppl here.<br><br>Well...I would say his compositions are not bad...but somehow or rather...i find the songs he write for other artistes much much better than those in his own album...(is it becoz of the arrangement?  or becoz there's a different producer)...anyway some of the lyrics written by Zhang Si-er is really no big deal...dun tink they r great...hui you na me yi tian is like a chi version of Love Me...<br><br>Hui Du Shu is another stupid icky song...juz a weird funny song...tat strives to be hip hop...<br><br>His voice...sounds so a-du...gee...my friends from sajc told me...his voice not like tat one...gee...the way he sings really irritates me...blame it on ocean butterflies i guess...<br><br>Dance...his dancing like very woody...<br><br>Honestly, ocean butterflies need to brush up on its quality of albums.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is in reply to the msg posted by zilchster...<br>well, all i can say is that one's man's meat is another's poison...a-du's voice is much more husky..JJ's voice is lighter and i think his jia3 ying1 is much better (sorrie if ani a-du fans r pissed wiv this statement..) So no problem if u think JJ's singing is bad..i personally dun like the voice of many much more accomplished singers than JJ, the fault does not lie with the producers or record companies...the problem is wiv you..but in fact, i do not think it's a problem at all...no one guaranteed tt EVERYONE would like JJ's vocals or songs.."hui you na me yi tian" is inspired by JJ's grandparents..it's an original,true story,and although it does seem to be like "Love Me",it is still veri touching..there are mani other songs out there by other singers translated frm an eng,jap or korean song too..i dun see wad's wrong wiv it..And about wad others say of JJ's voice and tt he is faking it out or it does not sound like his normal self..i dun think it realli matters..i guess no one will sing in the way they normally TALK..it'll come out sounding veri bad, as if they were doing a lousy rap instead of singing a song..yupz...tt's juz wad i think...pls do not take offence.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Zilchster, if u r so capable, go and produce a album by yourself! i think we'll all be waiting to see how good ur dance is, how great ur composition is.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Just feeling strange why are you always so prejudice against local singers, i guess u r not local, well, can't blame you for that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>BTW, for your information, have you heard "Love Me" before? well, the storyline is totally different<br>and thanks for adding your so-called 2 cents worth, we be waiting for ur album!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
