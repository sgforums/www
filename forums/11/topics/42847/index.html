            <div class='col-md body'>Personal opinions on Seven's debut album:<br><br>Pretty uplifting album, though some of the songs suspiciously smack of Christianity because of their hymn-like melody. The very catchy and optimistic-sounding "Tai Tou Wang" is very appropriate for the present depressing climate...everybody, lift your head! I also have a personal favourite in "Swallow", very surreal. The voice floats amidst the peaceful ambience brought about by the song.<br><br>Support LOCAL!~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not mistaken, the lady in Seven sang "Little Sarah" or "huo zai zui mei li de mei yi tian" back in 1994. I thought that was such a beautiful song... Perhaps this song can be included in their next album. I think she was known as Zann or something like that back in those days. Correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>As for the guy, I quite like his voice and generally have nothing against him, EXCEPT THE HAIR!!!<br><br>Fei1 yan4 sounds good... but which yan4 is it? Is it the swallow yan4 or is it the yan4 in "chen2 yu2 luo4 yan4"?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know why people can be so judgmental even before listening to it. It's a pity people are ashamed about local music without even giving it a try. It's this kind of people which makes local music falter without even being given a chance to make its mark. Given the kind of totally unconducive environment we are in, local music people (and those in other entertainment medium) should be encouraged rather than put down.<br><br>yan4 is the swallow yan. Yes, Alexandra was the girl we used to know as Zann, with chubby cheeks and short hair. I think Chris' hair is naturally white (some people have that kind of hair), but I guess it also lends some bohemian look to him? Anyway, they are not meant to be lookers, so... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Also, they are NOT a idol group, so don't compare them with 5566 or F4. Seven is the number which connects them, it is in their birthdate, in the date when they first met, etc, and holds significance to their existence. The duo is just a common couple which shares similar love for music and comes together as a music duo with the encouragement of Billy Koh. They have their own jobs, but this album marks the fulfilment of their music dreams. Nothing fancy in their album, just plain articulation of their thoughts about positiveness and putting life in perspective through simple instruments.<br><br>Listening to their music is like when you are conversing with your friends in a lazy weekend afternoon over a cup of tea and sharing your dreams and future. When your ears are tired of the banging and booming of the noisy environment you are in, their music will be like a cleansing spring which just flows on and rejuvenate your heart...like spa!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>They will definitely not sell with their kind of music, but it will be a welcoming bonus to those who appreciate their music since there are not many music makers out there who will cater to them (well, Dreamz FM did try, but again...).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>think ppl are more open to local music nowadays than before already... but its like always the chinese act that get accepted more easily... there are some really nice local english singers last time.. eg.KICK, Saigon Kick, Art Faizul... never really hit off... wonder where they are now..? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually local English acts did get some good exposure some couple years ago, eg. KICK!, X'Ho, Humpback Oak, etc. I personally like X'Ho (more because of his voice, esp when he DJs), and my favourite local song is Naked's "Don't Cry", about children suffering in war-torn places.<br><br>But now it seems that local stations are more interested in cracking silly jokes instead of giving some air-time to good local acts. Urban Xchange got some publicity from their nomination in Asian MTV Awards, but I feel more could be done to promote them. Is there any more program which devotes an hour or two for local acts nowadays? There used to be one on P10.</div>
