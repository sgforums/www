            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I agree that all 4 have their own good qualities, though singing wise, I think Elva has the best vocals followed by Stefanie.<br><br>Actually, this thread is supposed to comment on the singers, right? Singers = People who sing, so why are we talking about looks and not their singing prowess? I guess if you are talking about looks, don't bother to use the tag "singers", just call them "pop stars" will do, so as not to tarnish the word "singers".<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, judging from reports, Stefanie's album should be the best-selling among the 3.  It is said that her album hit the 200 000 mark within a very short time.  Second, would be Elva.  Her sales have been not bad, according to i-weekly, she sold 195 000.  As for Jolin, her sales have been dipping drastically, and she's been having problems, don't think she can last long.</div>

Maybe our one and only stella fan here may protest, but i dun blame him/her. You must be blinded by her act cuteness.<br>She can't sing. So what if she can compose?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm For me, I think that among the four, Stef Sun definitely have the most unique voice but her looks are just average. As for Elva, she has the looks and vocal which really helped her on her singing career. As for Jolin, her songs are quite soothing but her singing skills are still not as good as Elva's and Stef's. For Stella, I dun really have a good impression of hers, I trust that the media said that her vocal is born to be that, so let it be. But the songs she compose are not really that impressive. It might be easy to listen but still lack the potential to be popular among listeners. As for pple saying that Stef wins Sammi in her records, I dun deny.. but Sammi does have her own potential.. if not, she would not last for more than 10 years in singing. Stef Sun live singing skills are not able to compare to hers... but I am still proud that Sg music has been more recognised partially because of Stef and we are all proud of her. =)</div>
