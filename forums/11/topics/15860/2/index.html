Anyway, I hate ITE students cos they are really a nuisance and i look down on them. I like pp. who are very clever in their studies and will always look up on them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course i look down on those ITE students and Stella has the rite to choose the course that she is interested in and it's none of ur biz choosing a law course for her. Law may be boring for her if she studies it every year, I think u never use ur brain and think! God gave u a brain for what? Abt. my punctuation mis, I don't know why U are worse than a teacher or lecturer. This is juz only a forum for chatting and u are not writing a composition or essay.

(say look's not important is bull s**t!)<br>@Stella: Suitable fans who like candy gal and her voice's simply so "eee"...goosebumps! Stop acting cute BITCH <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">... END^_^                    </div></blockquote>Hmmm... i like Elva and Stefanie.  I like to listen more to good vocals.  As for Stella and Jolin, they appeals to the younger crowd who likes cute looking singers/composers (probably army guys, students).<br><br>Reminds me of the times when the guys in army go crazy over singers like Tarcy Su, Fann Wong, Ann Kok, and other "act cute" singers.  But have not heard anything from them since.<br><br>So what happen to Sandy Lam and Faye Wong?  Also Ms "Bie wen wo shi shwei" Wang XinPing.  She also disappear liao.  In the words of Utada "Time will tell" but my vote goes to Stefanie   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Klactovak (edited 05 June 2001).]</div>
