            <div class='col-md body'>I think the three of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. We cannot define who is the best or prettiest, as this will be really unfair to the three of them. The three of them have their own fans who can appreciate and like their type of music.As for myself,I prefer Elva's songs but that does not definately mean that she is the best.In other words, they are equally good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think all three are pretty "guy killers". Jolin is the number one guy killer, Stefanie is our local guy killer and Elva's a Western guy killer. I love all the three beauties and I think they can take over Coco Lee, Gigi Leung, Sammi Cheng etc... It is now the new millenium. Our most proud singer Stefanie is the best singer all over the Asian countries. Now forget about Kit Chan, Mavis Hee, Tanya Chua. Let us welcome our most popular newcomer, Stefanie!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stella is a Singaporean. We must feel proud of her! I know got composers like Penny and Cheer. But although Cheer has a good and pleasnt singing voice, but her song doesn't suit the culture of S'pore. OK? Yes Penny and Stella I like very much. But Penny's fiercer than Stella who's at least FRIENDLIER than Penny, OK?! I tell you, Cheer can only be popular for about three years and Penny for four years down the road, but Stella can be ten years or so, understand how important is a singer's reputation? Not only songs, but also PERSONALITY! Behavior changes ALL THE TIME, do u get it?! I hope I'm not conducting an OB class rite here, this is just a forum!!!</div>

As for elva, her third album is not as good as her first two cos too many fast songs. As for stella, dun worry, I heard Hype records is going to train her 2 sing more beautiful peaceful slow songs in her second album, which will be soothing and worthwhile 2 listen. Slow songs such as The first winter, divorce the seventh day and I deserve are very good slow songs in her first album, OK?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man, I'm sure stella will outwin over Jay cos Jay's song is hard 2 adapt and if u listen 2 his songs a few times, u'll then find it interesting. But for stella's it's different. It's easy listening. So what if stella lives in a neighbourhood? She has worked very hard to enter the NUS and is already considered a hardworking student and the entire neighbourhood is proud of her. I have already known which district is stella staying and u've gotta know that she has made S'pore proud. Additionally, Tanya's going 2 perform in our National Day parade. We have to show our support 2 her cos she may win one of the awards in this year--the best composer. So we must feel proud of S'porean singers. But I hope i'm not conducting a national education forum here. It's true that our Singaporeans have performed extremely well in their singing talent juz like stella whose album has sold quite well in Taiwan and S'pore recently.</div>
