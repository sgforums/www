            <div class='col-md body'>Was very very pissed with the organisers. We bought the central row of $121, but when we reached there we realised that we had NO SEATS!

I asked the girl seated in the last row in Section 107 just in front of the equipment, and she told me she was in Row L. The front row was Row A, and the last row was Row L. Which left us who were supposedly in Row M with...NO SEATS.<br><br>Does anyone know where we can lodge a complaint against such a foul-up? We did not pay $121 to get switched to some other lousier seats, especially when we were not even offered an explanation or a simple sorry.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the ushers were not very helpful anyway. After pushing through the crowd, when we finally reached blk 107, we asked where our rows were, the fellow standing there juz pointed to the blk, and said, "ur seats are here" but row M was never in existence so of coz we were unable to sit down!<br>we had to approach him again, he referred us to another guy, asked us to follow...but anyway tat guy disappeared among the crowd.we approached another usher who showed us where blk 107 were again...<br>frankly, i dun remember how many times we were pushed and referred ard, until finally we got someone helpful enuff to go and check whether our seats were there anot.<br>and we had to tell them a few times, blk 107 doesnt have row M, b4 some1 actually caught the meaning of this sentence.<br><br>we were already displeased with the switching of seats. And these incidents juz add on to it.<br>Even if there is some shifting of seats, at least the person in charge of the blk shd have been aware.<br><br>------------------<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>"Life is not about what you've gained, but what you've done"<br>---- Wong Kakui (1962-1993)</div>
