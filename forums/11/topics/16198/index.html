            <div class='col-md body'>heya... sorry lah, i know this is a very tired topic already but i need your opinions on this issue cos i'm doing this topic for my project work..<br><br>basically, we are investigating the phenomena of why most singaporeans have the misconception that local singers cannot match up to their foreign counterparts even though, talent-wise, they are just as good, if not better than them?<br><br>and why is there a weird trend that local singers have to establish themselves overseas and succeed, heralded before they can come back and be accepted by their fellow singaporeans?<br><br>and for those who do succeed, what were the reasons? luck? timing? both? as in case of stef sun?<br><br>honestly, judging from the steady influx of new singaporean singers, i disagree with the argument that there just isn't enough local talent... i believe that there are many many talented people out there who are just not given the chance to succeed locally... we all know they're good, we all know they're local.. but admit it, when it comes to fishing out money for their album, many would rather spend their money on an overseas singer.<br><br>why is there this xian xiang?<br>pls help me by giving your take on this issue...<br><br>haha.. i very happy that my group doing this topic for project work so now can look as if i'm doing serious school work when actually having fun talking about this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

"wai guo de yue liang bi jiao yuan"<br><br>singers have to hong hui lai i tink is bcuz eh.. maybe ppl here see so many ppl from other country support this local singer then they will start to zhu yi lor..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps locally there is no proper system to promote their talents to overseas companies? The local network is definitely not as extensive as those overseas. Maybe that's also why Li brothers had to let Warner promote Yanzi on behalf of them, coz they believed Warner can do a better job in making her big with their network.<br><br>Moreover, Singaporeans usually follow the tastes of fans overseas, due to lack of confidence in their own choice? Must confirm other people like it first mah...ahbo later ownself like but no one like, then very "lak-seh"...?<br><br>*shrug* my personal opinions.<br><br></div>

NinGNinG, i'm from arts course, but that's besides the point, cos all jc1 (and 2) have to do this project work thingy... pilot project only starts officially next year...counted for entry into university... so technically, my batch is what you call the guinea pigs!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yes, really agree with the points both of you brought up. do you think singaporean teens go for more of pop idol type of singers?<br><br>and regarding the point about how we don't trust our own taste, is there something of a herd mentality here?<br><br>basically, i feel that it is a vicious cycle. we complain that there isn't enough talent in singapore willing to walk this path. but when there is, we don't support them, cos we think they're not good enough... no support, no success. lesser talents willing to step out... creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>anyway, thanks a lot for your ideas... keep 'em coming yah?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> i started this thread quite some time ago when i was doing my project... quite surprised to see it revived....<br>well... since then, i've had had some new perspectives on this issue... i used to think that talent was all it took... like if a band or a singer had shi li then they should and would make it big.. but i realise now the fame game is more than just about talent, it's about timing, about luck, about opportunites and publicity... an analogy is this: warner music recently had this recruitment drive thingy right? and there was this stefanie sun look-a-like who didn't make it right? and i was just thinking, no matter how talented this person is, the record company wouldn't want her because what would we want to do with another stefanie sun? similarly, it doesn't matter at all if you're an F4 look-a-like who can (god forbid!) sing better or something because for one thing you're not F4 right? so it's all about having the perfect timing, isn't it?<br><br>and look at local band dreamz fm, they are the perfect example of how pure talent is not enough... it is really really a pity that they are not recognised enough, be it in taiwan or at home... but on a brighter side, the local mandarin-pop industry seems to have more and more male singers coming up now: with ah du, yong bang, and new all-male groups chou pi jiang and pink punk! -- filling up the void that has been left vacant by the sole jimmy ye all those years ago...<br><br>ps: yeah, corrinne may's album is really good... in fact, i started a thread on her album too... with very lukewarm response... maybe you can backtrack a bit and find the thread... those who are interested, i think corrinne may's back in singapore for some publicity promotions and will be on ufm1003 for some interview this week.. so watch out for that...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is too late for your report, but juz my two cents worth..basically i think it's because if the differences in the people xin1 tai4. Why do Singaporean singers go to Taiwan instead of Hong Kong?? In Taiwan, they try all sorts of antics to boost the singers' popularity, mostly through commercials. In the case of Yanzi, the taiwanese got to see her face for quite some time before she actually released her album. another thing is the market in Taiwan is big..at least bigger than the one in Singapore lor..and it is not so diversed..as in Singaporeans ahve two choices..English or Chinese pop, but English pop is not dat popular as compared in Taiwan (note: as compared)..so the singers usually target Taiwan rather than Singapore..</div>
