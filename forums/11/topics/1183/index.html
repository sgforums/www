            <div class='col-md body'>F4-&gt;Frankly Speaking, F4 is the most popular regardless whether in Music or TV series.For ppl or Fans who know dem better will notice that dey oways tried their best in everything dey do.Needless to say, dey r extremely busy n dun have much time for other things so pls stop pressurise dem to go for dance n other skills.If dey have the time to do it, dey'll surely do so coz who doesnt wan to show ppl their best especially artistes...<br><br>WEWE-&gt;As for WEWE,i dun have much positive things to say abt dem coz watever i heard anything abt dem its all negative.I read frm a mag LiWei n YouWei kips trying to condemn F4.I know F4 is too popular n maybe gif dem too much pressure but its not F4's fault when dey get so famous.As an artistes,dey must learn 1 very impt things,tat's dey must b humble no matter how pop dey r.N dey kips saying its gd to being compare to F4,actually i dun tink dey've anything to compare wif F4 coz dey dun hav the X-factor tat F4 possessed.Compare wif Meteor Garden dey surely lose.As for their album,jus take ZaiZai to compare...1 of F4 is enough for WEWE to compare...or maybe...challenge...Since dey like to challenge F4 so much den lets tok abt facts.Dey din even tok abt facts b4 coz dey know the truth n watever...pls know where u r standing...<br><br>S.H.E-&gt;Dey r 3 young gals who r veri active(coz not every gal band dances).Dey can sing high beat R&amp;B tunes n especially Remember is a veri catchy song. for hosting,i find tat dey r too quiet to being a host...Dey need improvement...<br><br>4 in Love-&gt;These 4 gals r veri cute gals indeed.At 1st i saw their pics in a mag i find tat dey r onli young pretty gals.But after i heard their songs,i tot i heard Angels!Their voices r veri gd but unfortunately not too many nice songs to match their vocals.<br><br>Mayday-&gt;Normal Vocals To Me<br><br>KiKi-&gt;She's a veri sweet gal n she knows how to co-write songs for herself n she's onli 17!Oh...She's too young n talented...<br><br>Stella Ng-&gt;She knows how to write songs but to me, she's veri "act".She oways pretend to b cute n nice, pretty etc...Compare to KiKi,i dun tink she've the stand to act cute coz dere r others young, pretty, talented gals out dere.For example, KiKi...As far as i know,she onli know how to write song similar to her cover version song, "DENG"...<br><br>PS-&gt;its all my personal view...

I see...F4 fans are a bunch of no-brainers who like to pick fault with other groups.<br><br>Hey, and why drag Mayday into the picture.  If they have so so vocals?  F4?  Can't sing for nuts.  At least Mayday writes their own songs, have better album sales and all that.  At least they've won awards, are competent singers.  Please, you can say how good F4 is, but not at the expense of others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, most of the mentioned groups are different on their own, so there almost no ground for comparison.<br><br>There are sensible F4 fans, but some of them just simply refuse to hear of anything bad about F4, regardless of whether the comments are justified. That's nothing surprising. It's the same for fans of other groups, there are bound to be black sheep. Fans of one group should not be nitpicking on another rival group. Likewise, fans of rival group should not drag the other innocent fans of the other group by "categorizing" them as some bums.<br><br>If your idol is good, he is good on his own without having to be compared against another. Putting down other people's idols will only bring bad reputation to your own idols. So be more considerate when giving comments, if you don't want your idol being criticized of not disciplining his own fans.<br><br>By the way, MayDay is really good, even though I am not a fan of theirs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well since there is so much talk about F4 and WeWe, I would suggest those who saw F4 in Concert also go to the WeWe Live Concert on 22 June 2002.  This way, you can really compare and see which concert is better.<br><br>At least there is some basis of comparison then.  I am sure those who enjoyed the F4 concert will also enjoy the WeWe concert lah.<br><br>So see you there at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on 22 June 2002.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that both F4 AND WeWe are good in their own ways. F4 are better in acting, while WeWe are better at singing. So there.<br>Btw, WeWe do NOT condemn F4. In fact, they are rather flattered to be compared with F4.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Toe (edited 06 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ppl, y r u guys fighting over F4 and WEWE???.....anyway, mi myself is olso an F4 fan and i realli cannot stand anyone saeing F4's bad words but the fact is tat if F4 isnt tat welcome as compared 2 WEWE or some other band.....then juz b it....as long as u noe tat F4 in u is alwiz a perfect, handsome boyband.....same 4 the rest.....if other ppl wanna sae ur favourite band bad word, let it b, b'coz, its their mouth tat is toking n wat can u do 2 them? Right? So long as u dun go n sae other ppl's favourite band, they will also not sae ur favourite band.Even if they sae it, there is also nth u can do  b'coz after all, its their opinion....and moreover, i believe, after a few months later, when there is another new band or watsoever, all these F4 fans, WEWE fans will soon b decreasing coz we will all b losing interest in them....Frankly speaking, there isnt anybody tat can like 1 particular band or group 4 so long.....cya</div>

But if you really can't get it anywhere else, you can try drop a note to Hype Records email @ be_our_friend@hyperecords.com to enquire. It's really a good CD, so remember to get it! Perhaps after you have got the CD, we can even start a topic on it and discuss about their music  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>hey hajime! i FINALLY bought dreamz fm's first cd yesterday!! i bought it at HMV for $23... quite ex.. dunno whether got ripped off or not but haiyah... waited so long for right time to buy no point wasting some more time going around to source for the cheapest one rignt?  (i bought this corrinne may cd at hmv in may for $20 yesterday i went to see, they were selling in for $27!! why the difference?)<br><br>but nevermind lah, the album is quite worth it!! they were selling two different covers for the first album... the one i bought was the same one they released in taiwan i think, the blue one with the three of them standing in front, quite appealing cover, but there was another one with the 3 of them in white.. i think that one was quite ugly...<br><br>anyway, moving on to the music... well, now i finally understand what you meant when you first told me that dfm's strongest album is their first one... the songs are all so nice!! and i think this album's focus is more in showcasing each of their individual voices yah? a lot of the songs is a "solo" with pei yin.<br><br>hmm.. i wanted to tell you which is my favourite song.. but i honestly can't choose... i remember you said that your favourite song was ao ye right? i dunno... one thing about the album is that i don't really like to hear repeats... and i got the second album first.. so i kind of heard baby come back and ao ye (priceless) before.. (well, albeit in different forms).. i guess that was the only thing about the album that i felt uncomfortable with... haha and it isn't even the album's fault since it was the FIRST album.. oh well, i always seem to be doing things in the wrong order... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
