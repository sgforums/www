            <div class='col-md body'>For the best album, they will choose Jay Chow cos he is more of David Tao(II) and Stef. will be the dark horse.<br>For the best MTV, they will choose Cheer Chen Qi Zhen cos her MTV has got meaning as it relates a real life story which she is composing"Still lonely" and Liang jing Ru is the dark horse for "Courage".<br>For the best composer, it's gonna be Jay Chow cos he is a popular David Tao II and the dark horse will be Stef's Cloudy sky composed by Li Si Song.<br>For the best lyrist, it will be Li Zhong shen's 12 storey cos it is more of daily life song and Karen Mok's voice is beautiful and the dark horse is Lin Xi's to Faye Wong's song"Xiao Wang Shu".<br>For the best BIAN QU, it will be martin Tang's my desired happiness by stef. The melody of this tune is very powerful and is stef's CHENG MING QU and the dark horse is Mac Chew's 12th storey.<br>The best producer would be Li Zhong Shen's 12th storey. He has worked very hard for this album and should earn a credit. I believe Karen's album is SO SOOTHING and the darkhorse is Jay's album.<br>For the best male singer, I think it's gonna be Wang Lee hom cos he can compose VERY WELL and his songs are always SO pop. in Taiwan and the dark horse is William Soh.<br>For the best female singer,it's gonna be Stef cos her albums sold very well in Taiwan and her songs are so Pop. and the dark horse is Karen Mok.<br>For the best band, it's gonna be May day cos the rest of the teams very strange and the dark horse gonna Ruo Mi Tuan. I somehow hate XIN BAO DAO KANG LE DUI cos I think the main singer is Zhu Tou Pi with his band members. I wander now how come stupid ZHU TOU PI has got a mad team band to perform and sing stupid songs during the QI YUE GE TAI and even such a band also got in the Taiwan awards?! I watched this band's MTV before and they sounded like SHIT. Not fit to sing.<br>As for the best team, I think it's gonna be China Dolls since their songs are so pop. and have conducted so many concerts? well, I think the darkhorse is SBDW.<br>The best newcomer is Stef cos she really deserves more than Jay who is the darkhorse. As a newcomer, I feel that he muz have "SHI LI".<br>ANY COMMENTS TO ADD ON TO MY CHOICES???????!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a good singer, her albums nuz top the chart for many months and her songs muz stay in the music chart for long. I believe Stef is too pop. among taiwan and gained lots of support than other singers. And now what is the trend or fashion of youngsters listening to music nowadays? They sure go for supporting young pretty singer like Stef rather than Faye or na Ying. So Stef muz win!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best MYV goes to Ruo Mi Tuan and I don't think they sort of deserve it cos their MTV not as sweet as Chen Qi Zhen. I wander how come Na Ying won't two prizes. One should be enuf for her! She don't deserve the best female singer--too old for that. Should give to Stef, if not, to A mei cos she got power. The best female singer should be given to one whose got "Mei Li" and "Shi Li". Na Ying's songs are so slow?! As for the best male singer, why they give it to A Di Zai-he's only new and should be in the newcomer section. He doesn't deserve the award. The stupid team "Bei Yuan Shan Mao" don't know what kind of beasts are they-looks like they are pandas or dogs?! They don't deserve the award! Should give 2 china Dolls. They are more popular. Overall, I am satisfied with the rest of the awards. Better than last yr!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, Jay's album would get it becoz the album feng ge is uniformed...unlike na ying and faye wong and the rest...but i tink jay really wanted to win...u can see his black face when he lost...gee...he is not sporting at all...should not let him take best album...wat a sucky attitude man!  I believe party due to Jacky Wu tatz why he can get best album one...dunno why jay brings in the winning and losing factor so badly...as if muz win something like tat...tat attitude sucks as if winning is everything...wat to do...he is still a KID!<br><br>As for Stefanie...she does deserve the newcomer..but i tink penny also not bad..i felt penny's live performance was better than yanzi...<br><br>As for lyrics...Na Ying should not get it man...totally undeserving...the other results are good...<br><br>Female singer...well...she does not deserve the award for singing all those over dramatic ballads...makes me cringe...i dun tink ah mei would have gotten it...or stefanie...it's not fair to give yanzi and give her the pressure...she does not deserve the award...karen mok should win...<br><br>Male singer...Ah Di Zai is juz a newcomer...and he cannot sing well...gee...Yuan Wei Ren should get it man!</div>

However, Jay MUST deserve the last award cos he has never won any of the awards in the first place. But that idiotic WU BAI pushed him into the water and made him almost slip down. I know this is a form of celebrating victory but he is too much to push him into the water and accident might occur. THINK!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah yah.. i dun see any similarities b/w jay n david tao except that they are both r&amp;b singers.. think that u all are being unfair to compare him.. at least jay has talents to write so many songs for so many different singers.. n where is david taO??? hiding somewhere dun dare come out cos his rival is too strong!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The comments on Jay a bit sad losing out those categories was a point made by my friend and i sort of noticed it...he really wanted the big prize badly...more than then newcomer u know...<br><br>David Tao...is in the background now...his own album probably tis year would come out...he will have one album in 2 years one...right now he is training up this boy group of 5 members called Tension...they performed at the jin qu jiang lor with David...<br><br>Anyway...back to jay...i find it totally ridiculous tat AH DI ZAI won best male singer...since he is only a newcomer...they should have registered jay for best male singer..hmm...</div>
