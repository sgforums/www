The singer, who is popular amongst the local homosexual community, was found dead by a Mr Javin Singh, who was on his way home from work.<br><br>Said Mr Singh: "I just came out of the brothel, when i stepped on something soft. I looked down, and saw this ah quah (homosexual) lying on the floor."<br><br>Police have arrested 19 suspects, three identified as Mohammed Abdul Ghani Scumbag Wong Muddy $$^% Son of Hamid, 19, Dick Red Wong Reggie Neow Neow, 20, and Sivalingam Suresh, 21. The rest were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.<br><br>The singer's autopsy revealed large traces of semen in the anal cavity.<br><br>Said Dr Robert Tan: "The abrasions found on the wall of the anus showed that a-do died from the rape. He was, as you say, rogered to death."<br><br>A poll by 8days from its readers shows that out of all those surveyed, 57% did not know who he was, 42.56% did not care, and only 0.44% actually gave a flying #^@!. (It is to be noted that those that cared were interviewed along Changi Village and Desker Road.)<br><br>We can only hope that a-do will be seen warmly to hell, as he deserves, that bastard.<br></strong><br><br>this news is fake?no duh...</div>
