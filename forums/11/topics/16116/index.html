            <div class='col-md body'>There's this new singing duo from Taiwan called WeWe.  WeWe comprises of two members, Li Wei and Lin You Wei.  Maybe some of u can remember Li Wei, he ranked number 2 in a poll for Dian Yan Nan Sheng(Guys who can "electrocute" girls with their eyes).  He beat Zaizai to the number 2 spot and almost surpassed Jerry Yen.  I suppose he is very popular because he starred in this serial called Tu Si Nan Zhi Wen which is very hot in Taiwan also.  As for singing, WeWe can sing ok...just average.  Saw this MTV of theirs.  They were having an outdoor session and there were thousands of Taiwanese girls screaming and waving Tu Si Nan Zhi Wen posters.  They may come to SIngapore in January to promote their album.  What do u guys think of them?</div>

Kinda pity You Wei.  WeWe sang a song called Ting Bu Dao Ni for Tu SI Nan Zhi Wen.  They kind of remind me of F4....so-called pretty boy band types.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, that is correct.  They released a single last Christmas.  But because at that time nobody knew them, the single did not do well.  But currently, Li Wei has attained fame by starring in Tu Si Nan Zhi Wen, so they released this album.  You Wei was a supermodel.  He starred in both Ma La Xian Shi and Pin Qiong Gui Gong Zi.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Even if they were singers before, that does not make them better singers after foraying into acting. It is just that they can now leverage on the popularity as actors to help kickstart their music career again.<br><br>Tao Zi is a classic example for this case. Starting out as a singer more than a decade ago, she did not get much success with her "whiny" voice singing 'wanting to chase after good boys'. Only after she had made a name from being a host did she get the 2nd shot at singing. With her popularity now, it brought recognition and eventually brisk sales of her albums. This would be highly unlikely to be the case 10 years ago when she was a nobody. Of course, she had improved much since her maiden effort, but without her popularity, she will be just another singer out there in the scene.</div>

Li Wei likes to say"wo zhao ren kan ni"(I'll get someone to kill u). And the actors use Hokkien to scold each other....but other than that, it seems quite all right. The show is very interesting.<br><br>I suppose if we can find it here, Li Wei fans will definitely increase.  Maybe even beat F4.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, Niu Cheng Ze also happens to be the director of the show.  When I started watching, I thought the show was quite like Meteor Garden, the female lead, like Shancai, likes to argue with Li Wei. Later I realized it isn't the same.  For one, in Tu Si Nan ZHi Wen, the plot is better and they are more realistic.  The story is about the underworld, and Li Wei is the young master of the triad.<br><br>Hmm...I would say in Taiwan, Li Wei has already beaten Zaizai.  he's close to beating Jerry also.
