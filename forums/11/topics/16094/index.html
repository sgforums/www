            <div class='col-md body'>Album: Dreamz FM 3 -- Hear it, Like it, Play it...<br>Singer: Dreamz and Flying Machine (Dreamz FM)<br>Company: Hype Records<br>Released Date: 301001<br><br>Comments: After one year of "secret training", Dreamz FM finally released their third album. You may be wondering wat to expect from it, but believe me, this time, they are sure to give you something very different.<br><br>Recommended song #1: Shou Hu Xin<br>This is a song with simple lyrics and yet it touches your heart. The light melody with great lyrics is similar to what Bu Zhi De has, that is, it leaves deep impression.<br><br>Recommended song #2: Love at Seven- Eleven<br>The song title sound so odd but the way of starting the song and ending the song is sure to make u like it. Want to koe how special it is?<br><br>Recommended song #3: Stay with you<br>Especially for those who wish to propose to their counterpart. One of the song that you cannot miss listening.<br><br>Recommended song #4: Bad Habit and Tactics Expert<br>Dun reali koe how to translate the song correctly from chinese to english, but guess the meaning is there. In this two songs, Dreamz FM use a different way of singing style, more "rock" and more 'jia yin'. A new Dreamz with different style. You can expect a different Dreamz.<br><br>Other than that, there is 3 english songs. "Should I stay?" shows the difficulty of giving up an relationship. Well, they do really well singing this. This shows that they can oso launch an english album. Reali so good? Well, hear it and you will know. Bonus track like "The V in You" and "Live it Up" are songs that most of us have heard it. Now included in this album as bonus track, we should haf a good time enjoying it.<br><br>And sumthing more special. The album include three track that not mani album will haf and that is a demo- kind track and two 'personal talk'. From the former, u will hear the "raw" demo of how some of the songs are recorded and hoe Dreamz finally decide on the style of singing. This is certainly new. The later two is about their personal feeling on the album and how it is made possible. Hmm.. i can sae.. it is reali true from their heart and touching.<br><br>In conclusion, tis album is reali worth to listen. All their own production and effort..... If you haf sum money to spare, why not take a walk to the nearest CD shop and buy it? U will not regret it... They touched u... tis time..<br><br>From this album, i haf found the song that represent me. how abt u?<br><br>Rating: Wat do u all think?<br><br>------------------<br>Dreamz 4ever best!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fei_Chuan (edited 31 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno if it is worth forking out the money for the album...since i have many albums i wanna get...e.g. jolin's jing xuan, ah mei, eason, s.h.e, chen yuxin etc...<br><br>Okie...put it this way...without bu zhi de...dreamz would probably not have succeeded at all...so honestly...they r not really one of more hot and in things in SG...and honestly...people would give tis album a miss.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this album is pretty experimental by local standards - experimental as in they were actually trying out new formulas...a la Jacky Cheung in Xue You Re. But it is a very different kind of experiment from that of Jacky, of course.<br><br>To be frank, I never regret forking out money for Dreamz FM music, all 3 albums are good in their own way, and I know for sure that Dreamz FM = quality music, so my money is well worth it. Just a few spins had already justified my words.<br><br>Bu Zhi De may be the song that made them better known to listeners, but for sure this is not the only song which will endear to you. In this 3rd album, I like Shou Hu Xing and Ai Yao Zen Me Jie best. But these are only the current faves. I realise that everytime I listen to Dreamz FM albums, I never fail to like increasingly like some songs which I previously thought were a little plain, eg. Ao Ye in the 1st album, and Ni Zou Ye Hao in the 2nd. Some of their songs need a little warming up, but what is for sure is that all Dreamz FM songs are sincere works which have the word QUALITY GOOD MUSIC written all over. Moreover, if more listens make you like a song more, it definitely means the song is of lasting quality, not like certain songs which will just fade out of your memory within minutes.<br><br>We don't have to buy certain albums just because every other person in the streets is buying it. I just buy albums which are worth buying, and support music which deserves long-due credit, and all these translate to...<br><br>"DREAMZ FM 3 - Hear It, Like It, Play It"<br><br>Rating: 4/5 stars ( Shou Hu Xing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Gan Jue" incidentally did remind me abit of BeeGees' song..."Emotions" rings any bells? But of course, that is only the 1st 2 notes. The song itself is actually quite original and I really like it lots, though it is not a zhu da ge material.<br><br>Track 5 is "Ai Yao Zen Me Jie". Another good song (albeit the falsettos) which can be promoted as a zhu da ge as well...<br><br>"7-11 De Ai Lian" reminds me of Taiwan alot, coz TW has many many convenience shops - "bian li shang dian". Alot of real-life stories actually evolve around these bian li shang dian, coz many Taiwanese usually hang around these shops, but strangely, people seldom spin stories or songs, not even the Taiwanese themselves. Funny that it actually takes the Singapore artistes to bring it to attention instead. I hope this song will hit it big in TW, if not "Shou Hu Xing". These songs should be able to hit a note with the TW listeners.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why is everybody going buzhidebuzhidebuzhide?<br>i mean it's a really nice song and i really like it but it's beginning to seem as if dfm is being defined by that song....eg. "dfm? oh, u mean bu zhi de?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>anyway, back to the 3rd album, i dunno why but i tend to lean towards the songs that are not as publicised like (7.11 de ai lian, hui mao bing, ai yao ze me jie, should i stay, you xiao re qi and my favourite, wei zhuang) ok *sheesh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">* that seems like almost the whole album....<br><br>in the second album...i liked the light-hearted ni zou ye hao and chen mo and a whole lot more! (sigh, yes! including bu zhi de) and i didn't really liked priceless cos it sounded too.. i don't know...national-dayish?...that's why i like the should i stay in the 3rd album better....<br><br>but i guess unlike otterised, i like the part about being patriotic in the 3rd album... it gives the album a uniquely s'porean touch...which is very nice...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Priceless" is actually the English version of "Ao Ye" from the 1st album, if you notice. It is one of my most fave songs, partly because it is sung by my fave DreamzFM-er, Cavin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Although I think I prefer the Chinese version...<br><br>I think the final part of live recording is pretty nice, more impromptu and lively. And with Dreamz FM, there's laughter and fun as well. The part on "Metro lights up your X'mas" is cute hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Btw, the new MediaCorp mega production "Big Hotel" (Da Jiu Dian) theme song is sung "Fen Xiang" by Dreamz FM together with Zoe Tay, Fann Wong and Jacelyn Tay (If I didn't remember wrongly).<br><br>The ending theme is by Dreamz FM too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Happened to hear it last night. It's one of my fave track in the 3rd album, the one which I said was a little BeeGee-ish -- "Gan Jue"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So if you haven't got their 3rd album yet, you can test-listen the song by tuning in at 9.45-10pm on weekdays to catch it hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was also one person who think that support no one, and buy only albums that are worthy of my money. And Dreamz Fm 3rd Album... IS very much WORTH of the money i spent. I fell in love with Shou Hu xing, just i like did for Bu Zhi De.<br>And somehow or another, there'll definitely be a song in their songs that represents you... 7.11 de lian ai will be the one...<br>Well, i'm pretty proud of them coz it's really cool to have really such good composers and song writers and singers in Singapore.<br>i definitely dun think they are copying anybody... or watever... everyone has their own unique set of qualities... and as long as their songs make u feel comfortable... and make u smile... they'll be the one. And Dreamz FM never fails to make me smile to myself in MRT when i set their CD spinning in my Discman.<br>And o ya... I've officially declared myself as Dreamz FM Fan... after going for their concert... which had brought me really great joy and surprises...<br>I believe there'll be more comming up...

            <div class='col-md body'>Read the I-weekly today.<br><br>Kinda upset that under the music section they did not mention anything about dreamz fm (i am not a dreamz fm fan) but i feel they should be honoured!  Any case they weren't chose for top 15 albums of the year...DISAPPOINTED...<br><br>Even Valen, Ah Mei failed to make it there...tanya did though...yayyy!!!<br><br>Even Xin Wei was listed under those gems that have been overlooked...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was just wondering.... read somewhere that dreamz fm's 2nd album had sales of over<br>10 000.... anybody knows what about their 3rd album? are their 3rd album sales performing well?<br><br>anyway, after concert that day, i wanted to read a sort of a follow-up to it... but i think the media didn't really cover it right?<br>i mean, straits times didn't, don't know if newpaper did... i guess only i-yu le did the day before yesterday and it barely 5 minutes...</div>
