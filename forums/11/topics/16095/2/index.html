U may say highlights o' the concert, yes, but already got two of her songs, "REN XING" and "FENG ZHENG". So it's quite worth it to be bought... The concert VCD for KITE... Taiwan hasn't released it... so I dun know when it will be released or have to wait for her fourth album in late Feb. or early Mar.......</div>

I don't seem to comprehend what he is trying to type.  His grammar is really atrocious...and this is a cruel hard fact not criticism.  A vulgar person is someone which is full of sick thoughts...not someone who opposes people...geez.</div>

I muz said that I really muz give a pat on the shoulder for my hard work and effort that I've put in although I was eliminated, but that was a v. gd. attempt which some S'poreans dare not take the challenge and I heard the response that 933 listeners dare not 2 call in for the rap?! Ridiculous! Anyway, Lingzhi has done a v.gd. job in hosting the prog. and giving such overwhelming encouragement 2 us... I really luv. her... she is so caring... ai yoh, a slip o' my tongue... I juz. like her... she's too sweet and sexy, and she hosts her HALA HALA SHOW very well!!! But I juz. can't compare her agst'. Coco like that... Coco is more sexy but Lingzhi's sexy too! Well, I should suggest on that day that they should dance together on stage... 2 sexy women, ha ha! Well, the rap is wonderful; the rest of the band did a wonderful job, ha ha, now I think I not only in love with Coco's rap, I think I'm also too fanatic with Coco &amp; 933!!!</div>
