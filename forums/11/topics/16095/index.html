H/w, their singing vocals are not so strong and needs time to improve. One advantage is that their singing voice resembles a bit like Stella, so if u listen 2 Stella's songs; U will be easily adaptable to their songs. This album contains Power Station's compositions and Tanya's compositions, which they perform better. H?w, their vocals not as strong as PS<br><br>Rating: B<br><br>Recommended songs: LREN WEI MAN, Fridge, Too much, NI HAI HAO BU HAO, TI WUO AI NI<br><br>4) Dragon 5 - GONG FU<br>H/w, I think that this boy band's pronunciation tends to be a bit better than China Dolls or Tae. This team tends to be more powerful in their singing vocals and even seems to be very muscular; Tension v.s. Dragon 5; 5 v.s. 5 or even mayday; now the competition is tough. Dragon 5's songs tends to be more rock, R&amp;B and techno. Not bad!!!!!<br><br>Rating: B+<br><br>Recommended songs: Gong Fu, melody, Money is nothing<br><br>5) Faye Wong<br>Initially, the first few and the last few tracks of the album were wonderful. H/w, somewhere at the middle of the album, starting from track 6-8 onwards, tends to be a bit boring ; but however, U need to listen to a few times more and u'll find it very classical. But I like WU BAI's compositions in Faye Wong's album more than Na Ying's album which is a greater advantage. And also Tanya's unplugged songs. Quite interesting!!!<br><br>Rating: B+<br><br>Recommended songs: Liu Lian, Da Chuo Le, Dan Xing Dao, Liang ge ren de shen jing<br><br>6) Emil Chau - WANG YOU CHAO<br>It's really a long long time I've been waiting... and finally his album is released. after listening, U'll find his music soothing and comfortable, juz like his previous albums that kind of feeling; so unplugged melodies that U'll never forget listening to it over and over again; a worthwhile album; even Peach Tao's compositions is so great and meaningful lyrists make the song more lively! Great!!!!!<br><br>Rating: A-<br><br>Recommended songs; YOU MEI YOU YI SHOU GE HUI RANG NI XIANG QI WUO, WANG YOU CHAO, NI SHUO DE DUI, QING HONG ZAO BAI, now then say U love me, ZHEN ME LE (XIAO GANG : Composer), NI MEN, SHEN HU XI<br><br>7) Eason Chan Yi Xun<br>A "can sing very well" HK singer produces his third chinese album; this time the KTV champ. said to be increasing his popularity. Songs are very interesting, great conmposers like Jay Chow and Lin Xi are gd. examples. This album is full of rock, hip hop, rap, R&amp;B and powerful soothing music. Worthwhile!!<br><br>Rating: B+<br><br>Recommended songs : BU RU ZHE YANG, K GE ZHI WANG, QUAN SHI JIE SHI MIAN, AI SHI HUAI YI, DI DEN DONG WU, YUAN JIA, COS U'RE GD. 2 me<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> SHINO - SHINO 4<br>Wow! Impressed by her powerful singing vocals that she joined Avex track for a gd. start to meet Ayumi and made her dreams come true with her singing career. I think this is a gd. start to make her popularity increase again ever since she joined her new co. and all her commercials in trying to promote her album. Hope she will not forget the days when she won Taiwan JIN QU JIANG and S'pore's JIN QU JIANG best newcomer 2 encourage her to perform and sing better!!!!!<br><br>Rating: B+<br><br>Recommended songs: Music all nite, dun cry, FANG SHOU YI BO, ZHI NAN ER TUI, HUAN MAN, QUE XIAN MEI<br><br>Additional remarks: Finds composers to make this album as rock as possible like DAI, beyond and even herself in composing a few songs!!!<br><br>9) Chris Yu - Subway<br>This album has somehow completely changed Chris YOU HONG MING in his style of singing, not so sad anymore, but a bit relaxed. Suitable to sing in KTV and his album looks more macho now and exposed. A Gd. start!!!!!!<br><br>Rating: B+<br><br>Recommended songs: Subway, BU NENG PIN FAN, stray dog, CHA SHEN ER GUO, ZHI LI MING YAN<br><br>10) Stefanie Sun - JIU SHI ZHE YANG singles<br>The single only exclusively released in Taiwan, not S'pore or even HK cos it is a motorola T191 theme song in Taiwan. This song resembles a bit like Shui Tang Che Yan, very the personality type. This singles, when converted into SGD, is $24. Why so expensive cos it contains FENG ZHENG TAIPEI CONCERT VCD plus one new song; but they take this new song more into consideration and that's why they released and call it a single<br><br>Rating: A*<br><br>Recommended songs: JIU SHI ZHE YANG, Kite (LIVE: sings with powerful vocals), REN XING (LIVE: ZHI TAN ZHI CHANG)<br></div>

H/w, "one" and "remember" tends to be not as nice as the chinese version except that she slangs very well in her Eng. Overall, the rest of the Eng. songs are quite gd. although translated from chinese but to target into the Jap. mkt. is quite tough cos there r competitors who released their Eng. singles like faye wong or utada!!!<br><br>Rating: B<br><br>Recommended songs: Gotta let it go, show me ur love, what's next, nobody<br><br>2) Daniel Chan - I only want love<br>This album is amazing!

            <div class='col-md body'>Daniel Chan's music has now changed almost completely into Zhang Ya Dong's compositions and even his compositions, that's why his singing is so special apart from his previous albums which are too sad. New music, new compositions made this album brand new fresh, causing me to rate his album an A, which is quite fair as compared to Jay chow, also rated him an A, juz cos the music is so special, nothing much... sometimes not only u listen to the singers' vocals, U also need to listen to the music or tune, see whether this singer has changed his direction of music, rather than the same type of music all the time, very boring!!!!!!<br>Talking abt. Fish Leong, her vocals are so warming and with the addition of soothing music makes the song very pleasant and peaceful. Of course not only such slow songs, a bit fast rock songs like IS THIS U and KAN HAI JI HUA are gd. examples rather than romantic songs. And a bit R&amp;B WEI XIAO DE YU GAN is also quite fresh and enjoyable, juz. like AI NI BU SHI LIANG SAN TIAN, so many types of music plus her singing vocals, makes this album I wanna give an A-! Fair what?! At least better than her first or second album, this Fish Leong's third album is the best so far, has improved her singing!<br>Regarding Sun Yan Zi's latest singles, not an album, it is released in Taiwan only and not in S'pore at all. It contains one song JIU SHI ZHE YANG plus her Taipei Kite concert VCD and I hope i have explained clearly that U can't buy it in S'pore at all! Only her latest VCD is released in S'pore. P/s. check it out for commercials!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My gradings are B and above... O' course... These days the albums bought are worthwhile, well, I'm also a full-time music critic; if not I wouldn't listen to so many albums and graded them and judged them already fair, U know! Everytime, the music cos. or even the stores would pay me some bonus a yr. to listen to so many albums and grade them. I also have very gd. relations with the 933 regarding new hit songs and albums and even music cos. in discussion and "PULLING" singers into S'pore. All these great efforts r done by me but not only that, o' course U fans. Without u fans supporting the singers, they won't come 2 S'pore to do promos. I can't remember which r the singers I've tried to attract and called up the music cos. 2 persuade them 2 lead these singers 2 come 2 S'pore. These days, I have successfully pulled and persuaded EMI to bring Jiang Mei Chi over 2 S'pore in Dec. I have already persuaded them in early Oct. and finally they made a decision in Nov. Moreover, she's coming in Hari Raya Puasa. I actually tried 2 persuade EMI 2 bring Valen Hsu over... but dun know when whether the final confirmation will be made... A Mei coming in Jan... Pls. refer 2 i-weekly for more details! If U want any singers 2 come to S'pore can mention here and see whether I can persuade them to come 2 S'pore. But not successful always cos esp. the TIAN WANG and TIAN HOU, not easy 2 get, only XIN REN probably much easier. Well, I rated albums fairly and I sometimes strongly disagree i-weekly with their gradings in that they give too low gradings. H/w, i like U-weekly gradings much better than i-weekly cos they rated their albums fairly. For instance, these days i was very frustrated to see i-weekly rating Chen Yu Xin's album as C+. This is atrocious. I discussed with some of the radio DJs with this grading and they also said she's such a powerful singer and therefore should be rated higher since her songs are so shiok! At least a B+ what, what a gd. singer go and give C+, so what if she's new?! I was also not satisfied with Landy's grading b4 on i-weekly as they give her a B-?! Such a marvellous album with so much R &amp; B and dance songs that is so enjoyable and at least her album should be rated a B+ what! Even I remember Huishi said b4 that this album she also like very much and was shocked to see the i-weekly rating this album so low and saying that it's NOT SO R&amp;B?! This is ridiculous! i even heard that sometimes i-weekly is too strict in rating these albums! Actually, that's not the way. I am neither too strict nor kind too rate albums. I am already very fair enuf. If gd. 2 listen, I will rate high. If avg. I will rate a B, implying this album is worthwhile to listen juz. 4 a while only and needs a bit o' time to improve. For B- and below, I will say that this singer has very poor singing vocals or style and requires more training, probably this singer dun know what he or she is singing or even most of the songs in this album are poorly sung, some even complain o' where is the chorus or no chorus at all. Some songs do that too. Therefore in making a singers' album look gd. and even worthwhile in listening, the [producers and composers do have to play a big part in making tha album a successful one. HARD WORK and EFFORT are two impt.words.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey U vulgar man, if u wanna write in 2 933 and sue me go ahead; the DJs know me better than U. But regarding guessing the singer... the co. has no authority to disclose any private infon. to any body except the DJs or managers o' the radiostation. Even the music cos. do not know who the singer is also cos they r not allowed to disclose 2 their employees too. Well, this singer to me is already so old liao and what a surprise that she could even come out with a new album... well, this is juz a game and is so enjoyable... H/w, do remember that ONLY WHEN I RECEIVED the albums, maybe I will consider either to buy after listening or not buy... is up to my choice... then I will grade them... U know music critics do not receive every album too... is up to the music co. whether they wanna send them or not... but the music station have to receive the albums from music cos. if they r newly released. We even have to buy the albums and listen 2 a few times b4 rating the albums at ur own pace. H/w, buying the albums is at a great advantage then juz only listening to the album once and give a bad rating. After buying, i can still take my own sweet time listening to the albums and rate them fairly.</div>
