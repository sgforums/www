            <div class='col-md body'>Watched this show mainly bcoz I like Jet Li  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, the show was hip hop all the way. To me, it seems more like a "blacks" show with a couple of Chinese thrown in, but the overall effect was actually not bad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In fact, I think I enjoyed watching a show with a blend of Chinese &amp; Blacks rather than Whites &amp; Blacks (no discrimination meant here). Some reviewers commented that they were not used to seeing Jet Li &amp; Aaliyah pairing up, but I find them quite oks looking together. Moreover, there is subtle minimal flirting between them &amp; nothing more than that, so it was quite oks.<br><br>Anyway, the reason of the name Romeo shd be bcoz the feud between their 2 families resembled that of the Shakespearean version. *Shrugz*<br><br>Jet Li looked remarkably cute in this sho. In fact, I felt that he looked pretty young for a 37-year-old  :p He did a little flirting here &amp; there which was quite amusing &amp; rarely seen, but it could still be readily accepted by most, I guess. The most "hilarious" part was when he tried to dance...*piangz* The fact is he CAN'T dance at all! Stiff &amp; everything... Stick to your Kungfu manzzz  :p<br><br>Anyway, I didn't have high hopes when I went into the theatre, so the show was oks to me. Not much gory in the show, coz the killing scenes were mostly muted by use of X-rays...you'll know what I mean when you watch it..<br><br>On the whole, not a bad show...esp when you have ample time on hand &amp; need some form of entertainment to while away 2 hours...<br><br>Rating: 3/5</div>
