            <div class='col-md body'>hey have any of you all heard of a local rock band chou pi jiang?<br><br>i was listening to UFM that day and junwei was interviewing them. and i was wondering how come i never really heard of them before.<br><br>i must admit i'm really not a rock band person. personally, i prefer mainstream pop, but during the interview they addressed some common misconceptions about rock bands and they also played some of their songs on air...and well, some of them were really not bad... one was a rap about the singaporean admin being so strict and stifling and all that. and i was thinking, hey, if such music can be a medium for such serious issues, then it is really worth listening to right?<br><br>too bad most of their songs are in dialect... that's why the radio couldn't really play a lot of their songs that day only the selected mandarin ones... but what i really mean to say is, too bad they're in dialect cos i can't understand dialect!!</div>
