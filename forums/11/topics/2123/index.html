            <div class='col-md body'>yeah...my favourite topic...local singers!!<br>i feel that contrary to what people say about how our local artists cannot match up to the standard of their counterparts in say, other countries....it is precisely because we have<br>such a small market that all those who can<br>carve a niche out for themselves are really all those with zhen cai shi liao one rite?<br><br>i like stef sun, kit chan and dreamz fm... (hmm.. don't want to comment about stella...never really listen to her songs and besides my new year's resolution is to be nice to everyone..haha)<br><br>no time to really listen to radio nowadays so never get to hear yong bang and all the other slew of new singers... haven't heard kit chan sing in a long time too but managed to catch her song, the theme song of channel u's cash is king... quite nice.<br><br>oh...and what about the pop duo "liang ke nu sheng" -- they were also quite good with hits like da sao and zuo mu niao... and lin yu ting -- with her one hit xiang xing -- theme song for jia ren you yue starring huang biren and xie shaoguang... remember them?<br><br>dreamz fm is not bad what.. too bad they don't get enough recognition...but i guess they shouldn't use so much jia ying in their next album... and maybe add more eng songs? then can appeal to both markets... after all, singaporeans are supposed to be effectively billingual, yah?<br><br>[This message has been edited by lindgal (edited 02 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes "Liang Ke Nu Sheng" is good. Then surely can hold their forte against Dreamz FM in the best group. At least in terms of impact overseas tat is. But Dreamz FM is slowly picking up at least in the local music scene being accepted by Singaporeans... even w/o an overseas promotion.<br><br>What abt Jimmy Ye? Why no mention of him for significant male singer... at least he make a ripple in Taiwan market.<br><br>------------------<br>Would i be Happier if i let it All out?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find Dreamz FM not bad.. i mean, it is difficult to sing false voice.... for male..  u think that hot grp in TW can do it? go and listen to Dremaz FM song, pls listen carefully... they are much 'rounder' than those 'moons' out there.<br>And it seems that a lot of pple here anti Dreamz fM...

            <div class='col-md body'>I always wondered why most of Singapore's more famous singers are female. As for the male side, Yong Bang isn't too bad, butI think Dreamz Fm can definitely be said to be the best locally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think you guys miss out Cai ChunJia also. She might not have made big waves, but she is certainly good.<br><br>Actually I quite look forward to the day when her brother Cai LiZhang can release an solo album too. His "Feng Le" is still one song which will stir my emotions. But again, when it comes to looks... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Dreamz FM is of course my personal fave. I agree that they use too much falsetto in their 3rd album, but with the popularity of "BuZhiDe", I'm sure the company will want them to go "all the way" in that sense. Anyway, I like their voices alot, falsetto or just plain singing voices, they sound great - just try their 1st album where they use more "down-to-earth" voices, but still very good. And yes, their 1st album is still selling in stores, just that you may need to find harder.<br><br>Frankly, if you say Dreamz FM are overdoing the falsetto, then look at Mariah Carey... *shudder* Well, she is now out of contract, so... LoL.<br><br>Think there is another new male singer out soon, from what I read in local mags. Can't remember his name, but he was supposedly involved in some local stage play productions. He seems to have some looks, so well, we finally may have a male SunYanZi now.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think celest's voice kind of grows on you loh...at first i thought it was quite irritating also (esp. when she sang the theme song of last year's YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE (the one with ix shen) but by the second time i heard shu yu zhi ji, i thought it was not bad loh... i mean, it isn't fantastic, but at least it's not cringe-worthy... but then again, i don't really consider her a real singer... same goes for PEACE also... and all the other mediacorp artists who tried their hand at singing also like fann, ann and all that... don't really see them as serious singers loh...<br><br>hmm... nobody talk about mavis hee? well, didn't really like her singing but still she has been around for a long time with kit also...dun have gong lao also got ku lao what rite? plus her one time hit, cheng li de yue guang.<br><br>and the last word on dreamz fm... whether you like them or loathe them, you've got to admit they're good...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yap... still remember the 'cheng li de yue guang' by Mavis Hee... but i think that's the only song that reminds me of Mavis!<br><br>As for Yong Pang I think he need more fans to support him... if not he won't last long... cos I like his song... but if no one buy his album, then his company sure don't want him again, right?!<br><br>As for Fann, Ann, Kym, etc.... hmm i think they all cut a ablum for fun only loh... I think they got better things to do than singing!!!<br><br>Dreamz FM had performed in my school(Tp) before... I think their first ablum was good... but not the latest one... maybe didn't hear the whole album... maybe there was good one but didn't promote through media...<br><br>So how do u think of Sun Yan Zi latest album leh??? I think it's more for singaporean... hmm no offence again hee hee cos more english english... as for the gan lan su... Fei Xiang aso singing the same song no surprise surprise... makes not much difference... But like some of her songs in the album... maybe she chose the right song...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dreamz Fm's music certainly does grow on me. I remember thinking Zhan Lue Gao Shou from their third album was quite 'ah gua', but after spinning their CD about 4 times everyday, I find it good?<br><br>Celeste's voice is good too, forgot about her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can find Cai Li Zhang's "Feng Le" in the local compilation album "Replugged". He covered Andy Lau's "Mei Ci Xing Lai" in the same album, but the song is more light-beat as compared to Andy's sorrowful rendition.<br><br>Heard that he also sang some commercial songs, including the now very famous "Shen Me Shi Guang?"...yes, the Tiger Beer "What time is it?" ad! He sang the Chinese version.<br>But it's hearsay lah...<br>Don't think he will release any solo albums though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> No looks lor...but his voice is really really good, especially when he sings live, super got feelings! Wonder when will we get to hear him sing again...maybe for some Mediacorp production??</div>
