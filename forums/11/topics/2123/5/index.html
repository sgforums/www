            <div class='col-md body'>want to download also very hard.. Maybe Eric can teach us where to buy your CDs?[/B]<br><br>Lesson 1 : How to buy CDs<br><br>1. Take your most convienient transport(e.g Bus, MRT or car) to your nearest civilised town. e.g. Ang Moh Kio, Orchard Road, anywhere with shops that sells Compact Discs.<br><br>2. Choose CD of preference<br><br>3. Slap your money on the counter and say "I'll take it"<br><br>thank u...till the next lesson.....<br><br>hahha no lah...err...wat u mean how to buy my CD? i don't have my own CD, but i got some songs in some ppl's album lah...just buy lor..they are in every CD shop wat...it's not difficult to find...the latest karen mok CD got a song frm me, and the Sun He Yao Shan's CD has 8 songs music produced by me(|released in may i think now on import, so it's costly) and i wrote 2 songs inside...wat else? hmm...the Ah Mei album has got some songs...<br><br>Penny's new album i did some arrangement and guitar recording inside(1st and 2nd song), and liang jing ru too, the 1st song...both these albums are quite cool, both commercial but interesting too...</div>

Ah Du's - Du Cheng Yi, i think he is going to be famous in Taiwan... knowing that before becoming a singer, he seems to be a supervisor of those construction workers at site. Well, I really hope that there will be more singers becoming famous not only females, males too... yong pang, then ah du... hoping there are more to come...<br>Well, see his performance in passion concert... hmm quite nice... quite shy, gentleman, good-lookin, macho type...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">P<br>but wondering when he will then come back to promote?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Both are singers with raw and unpolished voices, which seem to be the flavour of the fans at the moment. Moreover, Ah Du is rugged and manly, which again is the fave kind of look for the Taiwanese fans...<br><br>He also revealed his sensitive side by saying he will sayang his gf to the extent of spoiling her...Think a lot of girls don't mind that!!! But he has just broken up with his girlfriend of 7 years...pity eh? So "sayang"...<br></div>
