            <div class='col-md body'>What makes you think that Musset is difficult to get in? we are all friendly pple what, hor, Eric? talk to both companies before you sign.<br>Kid, it is upslope all the way..<br>anyway, I have written for many years .. starting with lotsa competition, and then writing for TCS serial!.. The first lyrics I sold to the taiwan market was "Yi Wu Fan Gu" (no regrets) by Denise Ruan Dan Qing. Me and some frens were doing some demo, trying to get some attention, and Ruan's producer just happened to see the lyrics and picked it up and wrote a melody to it.. and then I signed to Musset, thatz when I see abit of sunlight.. and know great frens like Eric, David, Yiqi etc..<br>only abt one year or so, then managed to sell to Daniel Chan, Ronald Cheng, Valen Hsu, Freya, Panda, Makiyo, 4-in-love, Wen Zhang (!), Tanya, Kit, Mavis, Yiqi, He Yaoshan, and a few China singers (and of course Sandy Lam la)..in between, are lots of rewriting, amendments and rejections..<br>you see, a lot of taiwanese producers do not want to use Singapore lyricist's work, coz they have some preference for taiwanese lyrics (with slangs that we are not familar with) and they definitely do not want to make long distance call to you.. thatz where your publisher will be able to help you ... see?<br>anyway, my advice is: get a full-time job and write lyrics for leisure. It keeps you going, coz writing lyrics will not be able to feed your stomach. and writing lyrics after work becomes a fun thing..Unless of course if you are some A and R eg YaoQian, Xu ShiZhen, Li ZhuoXiong or Yi JiaYang, when you decide who shall write lyrics for your artiste, or you are as good as Lin Xi.<br>dun be too ambitious or impatient or hot-headed. Decide what you want in life, and make the right choice. if you decide to do music full-time, know wat you are in for. and be ready, it is a bed of roses with thorns, fragant and tempting, but not exactly nice to lie in.<br><br>[This message has been edited by xiaohan (edited 21 May 2002).]</div>
