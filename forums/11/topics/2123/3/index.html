            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! for your questions, tis is my advice...though it's not asking for autograph, but well...many ppl ask me these type of questions...my answer is always the same...<br><br>Every fulltime/parttime songwriter who wants to try get into tw or watever scene, usually does that under a publisher who will push their songs/lyrics for them, and that includes me...there are some ambitious ones who try to push direct to record companies...i used to be one of them long time ago...well tat's history and it's not fun. let's just say, we don't wanna try TOO hard, coz u usually get burnt...<br><br>So if u or your fren wants someone to push or needs a professional opinion of his/her stuff, or in your case, feel that your lyrics is of professional content...then he/she shld bring it to a publisher for tis kinda advice and the publisher will usually tell them the next step. If whoever passes songs to me, i'll usually direct it to my publisher too...becoz these ppl are more experienced then me, i can't do much with it.<br><br>The publisher i working with is called Musset publications, other writers in tis company are xiaohan, yiqi, chen da wei, chen huan ren, chen wen hua, lin li zhen, me, and there are many up and coming ones.<br><br>Btw this is not a promo, coz their biz has nothing to do with me, i just work on my part. tis is to educate whoever's interested in this field...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey? are u same age grp as Dreamz? becoz your music listening grp seems kinda deep...anyway Brit music is cool, though i like american music a lot too...but usually the brits will come up with something really great..like Led Zepplin or Beatles or Police or watever and the americans will take it, glamorise it, in some ways make it better and sell it back to the public and make it huge...but in other ways, nothing beats the real thing...<br><br>As for Dreamz...maybe i feel like a boy becoz everytime i enter a studio or meet ppl in my area...I'm usually(almost all the time) the youngest guy...and the ppl i work with are all 10-20 yrs older then me...so i usually feel really small(in age, in music prowess and in experience too) compared to them! But when the work starts i usually have to forget all of that. and I'm usually either at studio, or at home.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dreamz is 2yr younger than me, so considered same age group? Music wise, I listen to quite a variety and mix, as long as I feel good listening to it.<br><br>Beatles is my perennial fave, and I also like other gd Britpop acts such as Pulp, Blur, Take That (hey, they've got some nice songs!), Gozilla, etc. Recently was spinning alot of Jamiroquai after attending his concert.<br><br>Was into bossanova somewhile ago as well, coz running out of music genre to interest myself. Now I just take in whatever comes my way...music nowadays are too mix to completely belong to any genre. (eg. country music getting commercialised via Shania Twain &amp; Diana Krall...)<br><br>Should discuss more music with you someday...am sure you must be totally tied up with work now that you are advancing the ranks towards being a "golden music writer" (jin pai chuang zuo ren).

            <div class='col-md body'>That's what a contract is for. They pay you, of course you gotta work for them. A contract is not supposed to bind you actually. It is supposed to be something which benefit the interests of both parties.<br><br>They get the stuff they want and pay you. You do the work for them and get paid by them. Logical, rite? Who will pay someone to write something and after that the person sells it elsewhere? Put it in crude sense, it's "chi li pa wai", but don't think you'll be like that, rite?<br><br>If you want to enjoy the fruits without having to be bound by it, not so easy lor... There is no free lunch in this world, as many people have painfully learnt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>music...but the prob is once u r on contract u cannot go beyond borders with other companies.<br><br>wah lau eh..shit...i wrote a long reply to u and accidentally erased all tat...but ok then...basically i also blur like the rest about ' beyond borders' thing...coz if u are working well in with publisher and have ppl u work with well(e.g. lets say brenda works with u and u like it) why u wanna go beyond borders? i work with musset and i am perfectly fine inside coz they believe in me and inside i have fun ppl to write or work or just talk cock with like Xiaohan, Yiqi, Chen Da wei and others...so y i wanna look for other company? a publisher is ext one...so u can choose to write for any recording company, and artiste u want...tat's all u shld be thinking about mah...not other publisher...music publishing biz is best kept invisible to writers like me who rather do music and screw all that biz shit...<br><br>Brenda did put two tunes for 2 lyrics though.[/B][/QUOTE]<br><br>actually i typed a lot about some publishing things just now...but well if u work well with brenda, then that's fine...n u closer to her then me(i only barely know u for like few days only) so why not u ask her in depth bout this? for me i'll always tell the truth to aspiring writers..there's a lot of things involved and singapore is not exactly the most supportive place in the world to do music so u need to ask true frens who are in the biz who know it as it is...so u can ask brenda or yong bang about song writing and stuff..they surely can tell u a lot..much more then i can type here...<br><br>in tis biz, if u really can find true ppl around u, things will be a 1000 times better and u'll be much happier...knowing one true person is better then knowing many fake ppl who will forget u the moment they turn around...I'm not a very socialble person(To some, i'm prob the most anti social person they met) but i know i have few but true solid ppl around me and tat's cool with me, tis applies not just in music, but in life...<br><br>Hmmm maybe i shld get xiaohan to get into tis forum becoz she's like the lyrics queen of musset! hahah...she'll be able to tell u more then me..i can't even read more then 70% of chinese lyrics. hahha<br><br>PS I'm leaving for HK tomoro so I'll be too busy there to be in tis forum...take care...ask your frens for advice...if they are real frens...they will tell u everything...<br><br></div>
