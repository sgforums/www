            <div class='col-md body'>i personally feel that you are being very harsh with the kind of comments you choose to describe him and his singing...give him a break and give me a break...i dun like elva...for one, i hate her singing, but i never ren shen gong ji.<br><br>i dowan to take sides, on one hand though i laugh at some of SJS comments (sorry~ SJS), i feel that the kind of things you say abt SJS is really unfair...<br><br>let me recall,<br><br>~~who was the one who suggest to boycott SJS's threads?<br><br>~~who was the one who say he is perverted and superficial? and he probably wanks off at stella's picture? (This especially caused disgust in me, how can you ever say that?)<br><br>So what if everyone else is going to take your side in this forum? i am still going to say my piece<br><br>you are too much</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well like it or not liyan.  I am just stating facts...whoever states that stella is tasty (what a word to use on her)...undermining her...blah blah...and tat wanking off at stella's picture...i am not potraying stella as a sex symbol...if someone can say stella is tasty...doesn't it make him decadent or perverted?  Doesn't it say much abt his character...i am hypothesising the rest...whether he does it or not...i'm not too sure...as u all know his infatuation with stella is so great...tat u never know...besides some people view their idols as objects of sexual desire...<br><br>Boycott his threads...tatz not being too much...it's just sort of politics...so yah...i dun tink i am too much...i dun hit back at anyone unless they piss me off...<br><br>And hey...i never passed comments on his singing...I only doubt (notice my tense...i still doubt) his English and his critical thinking skills.  So don't mix up facts...<br><br>If you want me personally to tell you off liyan...if he cares about good looking singers...I think it is so unfair to all the girls out there who are ordinary...or who do not look that good...like grace chow...julia peng and freya...does it mean that they r not pretty...we should admonish their music...and if all guys think that they wanna marry a pretty...good looking...what's gonna happen to all the plain janes out there?  If u heard Shunza' song...MEI YOU CHOU NU REN...<br><br>Well...unless u r like him...swooning over handsome guys...then...got nothing to say lor...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Zilchster (edited 10 May 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how inconvinient can it can? all the latest threads are at the first page...if it caused any trouble at all, it was only the initial few minutes to click the second page to retrieve the thread.<br><br>i believe in the singing capability, not the looks. although SJS does comment that christine fan is pretty, it is only his views, i dun think she is pretty, i think she can sing. it is just a matter of viewpoints.<br><br>he might be supporting them as well, meaning zhou hui, etc, just that he did not voice it out. but even if he doesn't, it is still his preferences...there are bound to be people like that, but y put him down?</div>
