            <div class='col-md body'>ya... precisely... i'm not those egoistic type who hates/despise boybands but this particular group really pisses me off and i can't really provide an explanation why. i get turn off everytime their song is aired over the radio. it is not just me but people also say they can't really sing so why bother advertising their song. it is really bad how people are being judged nowadays. people can sing but no looks get thumbs down and people cannot sing but looks more presentable get thumbs up. this is really too superficial.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let me repeat myself i am NOT jealous of F4... maybe i am just too naive of my intentions to let people see my point of view that they should not be wasting both time and money on celebrities or the so called "idols" who do not actually possess any talents. in simple terms, they are not worth it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think if the fans find it worth to spend the money on F4, let them.  But I think it isn't wise to go anti-f4.  The fault doesn't lie with the f4 guys.  And it's not like they want ppl to keep reporting on them and pay so much attention to them.  it's the fans.  If the fans did not like them so much, why would anyone bother reporting on them?  Yeah, the f4 craze is at its peak now...just let the fans do what they want.  It'll blow over and settle down later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i feel that things do not look too good for the F4 guys.  They have almost disbanded, and are working on their separate careers.  The ratings for Lie Ai Shang hen and Mi Tao Nu Hai were also very disappointing.  Their popularity also seems to be fading, fast.  many have speculated that in the year 2002, WeWe may rise higher, and F4, fall from the top spot and lose out to WeWe.<br><br>*Will the fans please take note that I am merely reporting what I read.</div>
