            <div class='col-md body'>Well, as for the newcomers, I hope stella Ng, Jay Chow, Freya Lin Fan, Fan Fan Fan Wei Qi, Joi Cai Choon Jia and maybe maybe Ruo Mi Tuan. As for the team, I think China Dolls, Dreamz fm, Power station and Ruo Mi Tuan will be nominated. As for the best 2001 song, I think it's going to be Stefanie Sun Yan Zi's my desired happiness. As for teh Singaporean singers, I think Fann Wong, Stefanie Sun, Tanya, Kit Chan, Celest Cheong, Phyllis Quek, Joi Cai Choon Jia and Stella Ng may be nominated. As for the top 10 best male singers, I think Daniel Chan, Andy Lau, Jay Chow, jacky Chueng, Sky Wu, Alex To, Pin Guan, Jimmy Lim, Alec Su Yong Peng and maybe Aaron Kwok. As for the top 10 female singers, maybe the nominees are Stefanie Sun, Jolin Tsai, Zhou hui, Sammi Cheng, Sandy Lam, Fann Wong, Stella Ng, Rene Liu, Zhang Hui Mei and maybe Elva Hsiao. I predict that stella Ng will be the winner for the most popular newcomer. She will have a tough competition with jay Chow. But however, maybe Stella will be the first prize, followed by Jay and then Freya Lin Fan. As for the teams, I think China Dolls are the winners but I think they are going to have a tough competition against Dreamz fm. And next, the most popular singaporean singer is our stefanie Sun, but she's going to have a tough competition with fann Wong. As for the most popular male singer, confirmed is daniel Chan and garantee the top five are Jay Chow, Andy lau, Su Yong Peng, Pin Guan and Jimmy Lim. As for the most popular female singer, gonna be stefanie. Top five are Sammi Cheng (Very competitive), Jolin Tsai, Zhou Hui and Stella Ng. this year I predict a lot of singaporean singers will win and especially the newcomers. Wish them good luck and make singapore proud. Well, do u have any other opinions about the Singapore award this year regarding the winners? Feel free 2 chat in this forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great work. Looks like Tae's gonna be in the section of newcomer, not singer. He's just produced his second album. As 4 Yan Zi, she's already won the most pop S'porean newcomer this year and I think should give the chance 2 others this year. Stella will sure win. Look at 933! Stella's song "wait" No.1 Jay "cute girl" only No.5. Looks like we must feel proud of Stella. Mayday this year haven't produecd album yet so dun know but last year already nominated. So give the chanec to the new team, Ruo Mi Tuan. As for stella, she will get inside the top ten female singer as her results are already very good in 933! She's got #10 for the first 933 2001 female winning award. As for Elva, she may be in cos of her song Wuo Ai Ni Na Me Duo may reveal outstanding results in the 933 top 20! As for Jeff's he may not be in this year in top 10 cos haven't produced any new albums. But his songs getting more and more boring. I only like Bu Zhuo Ni De Ai Ren, this song is full of his own personality.Thanx for the feedback!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You'll don't understand what the bloody hell I'm talking. Don't u know English? I said that Since Stef has won one of the awards last yr, she should give the chance 2 other singers to win the newcomer award such as STELLA. By the way, so what if U write lyrists? Who the hell singer are U and want 2 produce ur albums? Which singer have u written lyrists b4? Nobody thinks he's an expert like u writing lyrists. Yao Qian's the best. Jeff-he is the winner last year, so should give others a chance- so what if he has 400 plus points last year? That period of time is already over for his Jing Qu Jiang and has no new albums yet? May be U should consider this. Do U get it??????????!!</div>

Haha...The qualifying period is from June to June if I am not wrong...if it is so...Jeff has 400 over points.<br><br>Stella won't get it...I think Jay deserves the newcomer award more than anyone else...Stefanie should get another newcomer award...after all she has juz been nominated in Taiwan.  Seriously...Stella doesn't deserve the award...i think chunjia does...even fan fan or lin fan deserves it over stella..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't care jeff is nominated in this year or not but if he is nominated, he won't produec as good results as Jay. Hey there, I can be sure that Stella will outwin over Jay this year for the newcomer award. Many people sure support Singaporeans but if Yan Zi is in, she'll be #1. But U muz see that Stella is newer than Yan Zi who juz produced ONLY one album. Think about it again carefully. This may take u time 2 understand.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>But to me, let's juz consider that Stella's better than Jay. Jay's music at first listen to it not so good. But the more U listen, u'll find it intersting. But for stella, it's easy listening. If u think Jay will outwin Stella, then u muz think twice abt. being a S'porean and be p;oud of s'pore. And don't forget, Tanya will be singing on National Day and let us give our support 2 her and I think she will win one of the awards this year---the best composer again. I hope I'm not conducting a national education forum here. It's juz that U have 2 feel proud of our s'porean singers. Thanx!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great. Show ur support for singaporean singers. Well, I would still think that Stella's music is easier to appreciate rather than Jay. Although jay has got lots of songs that are difficult to listen to what's he's singing, u've have to listen to a few times compared to Stella whose songs are easier to listen to for the first time than Jay. I think I need to listen to Jay's songs five times before i get used to it. Stella Max. 3 times. What do u think? Reply.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I still think Penny and Cheer are very good singers juz that Penny's too firece for her loud voice and Cheer's too soft. But Stella is the average of the two. Not too loud and not too soft. Juz nice. But I still don't care what U say cos since she is S'porean singer and we muz feel proud of her!</div>
