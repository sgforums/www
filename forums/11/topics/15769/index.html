            <div class='col-md body'>Heya,<br><br>Okay I have been hearing complaints from chatters in #93.3fm saying that they get kick anyhow, this and that do that to me and they also mention that our channel has very strict rules which restrict their freedom of speech etc. I think we ought to have our own website up together with the channel rules/regulations so that the chatters will know about them. Kicking and banning them is not a permanent solution to this problem.<br>From my point of view, since #93.3fm is a chat channel, why don't we allow chatters to use colours. There was a time when someone was sort of singing in the channel or rather saying parts of lyrics of the songs out and he got warn by an op not to do that?? Well.. I don't see why we really need to have that strict rules, after all, we came to irc and enjoy and NO fights or arguements. I can see that chatters are just parking in the channel not chatting in the main channel. #93.3fm is not going to be another #singapore. I am sure neither of you want it to be like that. Almost once everyday I can see users getting kickban from the channel. Quarreling with ops etc. This doesn't reflect a good image of #93.3fm. Chatters may think that oh so and so is abusing power anyhow kickban me. Or saying the ops are not understanding and impolite. I can still see pban with vulgarity on it. We are telling chatters not to use vulgarity, whereas in the other hand the ops themselves may be using them and even in pban. I am not going to point fingers at anyone. Who never make mistakes? I do make mistakes. Yes we learn from mistakes and don't repeat it. That's all for now.. Its 1.34am here I can't really think of what to say...<br>Anyway thanks everyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wish all of u a happy new year  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Understand what you trying to say. Actually, I think the main reason for having these rules are because of a certain someone who happens to attract alot of interest in alot of uers in the channel. You should be aware that sometimes there are sessions called Lian Shou Chu Ji where questions are posted by users to celebs who are online. Usually, during that time, many users will try means &amp; ways to grab attention from the celebs. Colors, caps, repeat, u name it. It would make the channel so messy that it is almost impossible for anyone to even see what is asked. Hence the rules will come in here.<br><br>As for the kickbans, perhaps those whom you mentioned who abuse their access shd take note of themselves. Actually, it is the same case for the users as to the ops. Most are innocent parties, but there are bound to be some black baa-baa sheep. We have relentlessly repeat &amp; repeat the rules to users, so even slightly frequent users would have known the rules. But apparently, our advices fall on deaf ears, so what can we do? We warn, they say so what, offend, then we kickban, then they come back scold vulgarities. You think we like that? We don't get paid at all for doing all these, &amp; yet we have to tolerate these nonsense. Believe me, this is not the only channel suffering from the same problems.<br><br>It is a two-way thing. If neither Ops nor Users do their part, there would bound to be cases like this to happen again. Go figure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway I feel hor there is a high possibility  that people will 'de cun jing chi' one lor..u loosen abit they will sure ask 4 more one lor...it is really hard to please everyone and channel also big big ah hard to control if give them 'wu fa wu tian'.<br><br>Also got ppl says that our rules are too strict and ops are unfriendly blah blah lor..<br>but ask themselves y they cant juz chat like normal people does neh..ai repeat ai caps ai flood ai colours...all becos they wanna people's attention dio bo,then if alot of ppl also ai attention then beri luanz liao lor..<br><br>Use colours ah see liao bad to the eye leh..image if Lian Shou Chu Ji then everyone because they want their questions to be seen more obvious everyone pia mia use colours,repeats,caps...woooooooo like tt ah can image how messy can the situation be right.<br><br>I dun think hor there is a rule saying that cannot sing in the channel leh..think i also sing in the channel sometimes leh..but if use colours to sing also irritating leh,wan to show ppl u sing beri well meh..no la i mean har u can sing lor but people not necessary wan to listen ma so hor u sing normal normal people wont think wat also ma dio bo..dio lor!kekeke... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And then hor i think most ops before they kick they will warn that offender of what they did should  not to be done lor but sometimes people just turn a deaf ear to what u are saying leh like that hor beri angry ma u say liao that person still treat u transparent means u talking to cow la..then after that they got kicked or banned liao then they come in and ask:why u kick/ban me har ? Like that means wat ah can onli see kick and ban cannot see the warning ??<br><br>Actually I also think kick and ban cannot solve all problems lor...who mai talk nicely and comfortably in a channel rite..but then ah if there are bo liaoz people always do what they like in the channel and ops just stone there doing nothing...then what 4 put the @ in front of their nick leh..might as well all dun @ lor like tt good leh...all same pattern rite then u flood i flood back lor see who win lor,so in the end ? see two or three people flood in the channel enuff liao lor..others also wont have a chance to talk and even if they did..think the chances of other chatters seeing what they say is beri mild also..all can onli see floods n colours liao...<br><br>As 4 ops scolding vulgarity themselves,that i  got nothing to say lor if the ops ai scold also nothing i can do 4 me is ah u dun scold me i dun scold u lor..u scold me and i dun scold u then i can be saint lor...that's it!<br><br>------------------<br>Dreamz FM -- Meng Fei Chuan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As all of u can see... there are many negative reponse regarding the channel rules. However, i think i already posted the rules in another message... we still stick to our rule of kicking ppl who uses excessive caps or colours... but we give warning first... maybe dat would be better. But for flooding.. i think the rule is same for every channel... i dun think anyone dunno its rude to repeat or flood in a channel.. but they still wanna do it so we kickban immediately... Asking for access or DJ nick will be up to the discretion of the op himself to decide if the person deserves to be kicked... I have ppl asking me too..but i replied them nicely. I think dats all... feel free to post comments... oh...one last thing...ice^gal... we do this not to make u like us...u think u super chio bu ah...as though we wan u to like us veri much... posting such messages will only get u stupid replies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I would like to state that the following are purely personal opinions. Feel free to disagree if you believe that your counter opinions are strong.<br><br>Well, all I can say is that the channel now is no longer what it was a few years ago, bcos of some prominent figures in the channel, so rules in the past are no longer applicable now. It is not that we want to control people here &amp; there (asif we are THAT free), but the problem is that without any rules, the channel will be very havoc in certain times, esp when THAT so-&amp;-so happens to be online. If you don't even know this so-&amp;-so is who, then I guess you won't understand why we have the rules for. It is fine if we are any other channel, but happens that this is NOT any other channel, coz of this so-&amp;-so. If you are a regular user during the time which so-&amp;-so is on air, you would have known how crowded the channel can get. It gets worse when celebs are supposed to be online.<br><br>In the 1st place, it is not asif we don't let them ask questions or what. If they ask normally (in most cases, they will) without flooding whatsoever, it is fine with everyone. The problem is some people will have the tendency to flood &amp; repeat &amp; do goodness whatever they can to get attention. If no one cares about this situation, how chaotic it will be? It is not asif you don't know. All we will see is colors, CAPS, flooding, repeat &amp; whatever. How in the normal sense are we supposed to chat properly, like what you say? It is also unfair to those who ask questions only once without using all those fanciful stuff, &amp; their questions don't get answered just bcoz their questions don't stand out at all.<br><br>Well, obviously no one likes to be kickbanned, right? But if you don't break the rules, who will have so much time to bodai boji kick you? If people break rules, most ops will give warnings in the 1st place. It is when they don't heed the warnings that they will get kick or banned. You asked them how they felt about being kickbanned, but I guess you didn't ask them how come they got kickbanned in the 1st place. E.g. if they get kicked for using vulgarities, are we supposed to let them go on doing it even after warning? You hear them complain about getting kickbanned, but did you know the real reasons why? However, sometimes, it is not the ops who kick them, but the scripts. That you will have to get the owner of the scripts to amend them. If not, it is unfair for humans to take the blame for these non-negotiable scripts.<br><br>You think ops like to kickban alot meh? Waste time &amp; efforts one oks. Then will kanna blamed by these people. We rather use the time to talk or surf net. If you don't want people to do certain things to you, then you yourself shd be aware what you shd &amp; shd not do also. When people are talking rude things into your face despite you being frenly, you think we are still supposed to smile &amp; say: "Ohyeah, you are right, I am sorry. Please scold me more to make you feel better"? I am not paid to do all these. I am not a saint.<br><br>As for asking for access, I will tell that person that you are not supposed to ask for it. But since you mentioned about access registration or sthg like tat, I will tell those people to check out this website instead then. As for asking for DJ, sometimes even if you really don't know who the DJ is, the people will pester you for ages, &amp; even call you names, say you bad, know liao don't say this kind of rubbish. And it is definitely not a one-off case. Some people ask liao, then we say no asking for it, they will be polite &amp; say oks nvm, then in turn, we also polite &amp; say welcome, but you think everyone like that meh? If everyone so nice like that, then we no need head so big liao hoh.<br><br>hai...zhen de shi shang nao jin ohhhhhhh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there's no need to change rules bcoz i think all chatter muz abide the rules n be adapted to it instead of complaining... personally myself can't adapt too until i try to do it n luckily u guys told mi abt the rules n abt now i can remember liao, LoL but its up to u guys to decide as mi outsiders can't be do anything! So thank fer listening to my 5-cents worth of words! If u changed rules when 1 person complain then u have no stand on the rules!<br>U can't be borthered by sum pple who bo liao until asked u to change rules!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that in #93.3fm the oldest ops around are still Risk, Calis, Salvato and me, Anonymous. To me these rules are crap. IRC is meant to be fun. By restricting the ways in which chatters wanna speak is restricting the fun. I don't mean to put the ops at fault here. Spammers of caps and colors should be kicked. However, what's the problem with just a sentence with colors and caps. Damn your sensitive scripts. #93.3fm wasn't a channel set up to be dictated.<br>Step in the shoes of the chatters who just wanna have fun for once.</div>
