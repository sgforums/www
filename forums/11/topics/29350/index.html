            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>I thought it's time to start another thread... this time, it is specially for Mary. Yerp... I think I like her style, her voice, her programmes etc. I had wanted to start this thread after her 'Moonlight Lady' was off due to the restructuring. Hey... I really like the 'Moonlight Lady' era. It's a shame it was short-lived but well, luckily I can secretly tune in to her 'xiao3 P' series in the office.<br><br>Nope... this does'nt mean that Jieqi's forum will be shut down. I will just post on both. Join me if you wish.<br><br>For Mary, I think I'll start by paraphrasing whatever that touches me on her daily 'P hua4 lian2 pian1". But then, there are times when I can't tune it... meeting lah. Feel free to post any other anecdotes that you think might be encouraging to the other readers.<br><br>And nope, I don't need her email address. Just wanted to use the same format for the title so that people know what it is for. I can always drop her a mail via the 933 website.<br><br>Welcome and hope you'll enjoy your stay...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For starters, I'll like to recapture a P hua4 lian2 pian1 episode that I like...<br><br>We all know Pavarotti and his powerful voice. But we know little about his encounter with a crying baby. The story goes that once, a baby in a neighbouring room was crying in the middle of the night and irritating everybody within earshot. Despite crying for a long time, the baby's voice nor did the volume of the crying changed a bit. This made Pavarotti curious about how a baby can cry for so long. Then, Pavarotti realised that whenever the baby is almost out of breath or the voice is giving way, it will instinctively stop crying, catch its breath, take a deep breath before blasting away again. This taught Pavarotti an important lesson. And guess what, Pavarotti will go down in history as one of the best opera singers who has ever lived.<br><br>So... the moral of the story is... sometimes when unpleasant things befall us, if we could keep our cool and try to learn from the experience, we might just learn an important lesson in life.<br><br>Rather than complain or feel angry at the baby, Pavarotti sought to learn from the baby. That made the diffence.</div>

We've heard that one before so I don't think  I would want to regurgitate it here.<br><br>Anyway, there are some trivias on Mary that I would like to know about and they are:<br><br>1) How come her surname is so special? Wu and Xu.  Any explanation(s)?<br><br>2) How old is she this year?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>3) Was she from NTU Mass Comms?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.Surname special?<br>It's actually a combination of two surnames - 'Bu' and 'Koh'. I think there're a few other families but the only ones I know are her family. Even her uncle chooses to drop 'Bu' and keeps only 'Koh'. It was said that long, long time ago, there were two families. One had a lot of kids but the other had none. So the one with a lot of kids gave one kid to the other, on the condition that they keep their original surname.<br><br>does not  know how old is she,think aroun 27-28.<br>she e only daugher in e family,4 elder bro<br>birthday coming soon:15 dec<br>height is 1.65m<br>weight:50kg<br>Lucky no :3<br>Dislike :hate ppl disturb her sleep,make her unhappy<br><br>i know her through fren<br><br>3.She graduated in 1995 from NTU's Accountancy.Then She spent two years doing audit work............<br><br>Hope this will help u<br><br></div>

I love 'P hua lian pian' as well...but too bad there's hasn't been p hua these few days.<br><br>I dun tink she has been acting cute...in fact i like her qin que ness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yerp... it is sad that P Hua Lian Pian (PHLP) has been sidelined because some of these Unbeatables need media coverage. Anyway, it's not an easy job to have to find a PHLP for each day. I think we can help her by sending her meaningful anecdotes as and when we come across them. Do you send emails to her via the 933 website or do you have her private email?<br><br>For starters, I'll recommend that Mary read this book entitled "Tuesdays with Morrie". I think she can find a year's worth of PHLP from that book although she might need to do a little homework and editing.<br><br>Well, I guess the point about her 'acting cute' or being too sao2 are basically observations of people. Whether these observations are true will only be known by Mary. Maybe she's just being herself. Perhaps she is acting cute. We can only speculate but we will never know for sure. I'll not be too upset or overly concerned about observations and comments. I hope she isn't too concerned about these things too.<br><br>One man's meat is another's poison. Others may not take to what we like. So... we just tune in to Mary and support her in whatever way we can. The fact is, I like her voice, her program, her show etc. and that is all that matters.<br><br>&gt;One thing that surprises me (pleasantly) is that she'll always reply to your mail...<br><br>Hey! I am doubly impressed. Even among friends, not everyone replies to my mail. A 'half-celebrity' who does that must be damn sincere about her work and her fans. (I see radio dj's as half celebs.)<br><br>Well, Sky Wu is by far one of the most talented artistes of his time. I simply love his "qing niao" and "qie xing qie zhen xi". *hint hint* His rendition of "qie xing qie zhen xi" is the ultimate song when you want to send off a friend. Even Jeff Chang lags by a mile.<br><br>My only gripe against Sky is his attaining of fatherhood before getting married. Yah... I am on the conservative side and am proud of it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span class="small">And... for those who have tried to send my emails, I am sorry I didn't get a chance to read them simply because all mails gets filtered out unless I specify otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  So... perhaps you could put up a post here telling me your email address so that I can set my mailbox such that it accepts your mails.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At last! I get a chance to tune in during the P Hua Lian Pian. Okay... the story today goes...<br><br>During a lecture, the instructor held aloft a glass of water and asked the class to guess the weight of the water. Many answers were offered. The lecturer explained that the weight of the water is actually dependent on how long one has held the glass of water. If one has held it for a minute, it should be almost effortless. If one has held it for one hour, it becomes pretty heavy. If one has held it for a day, an ambulance might be necessary.<br><br>So... if we were to liken the glass of water to stress, we can conclude that regardless of the magnitude of the stress, it is the duration of shouldering the stress that gets to us. The moral of the story is to put down the glass of water (stress) when we feel tired (stressed) and get some rest. After some rest, you can pick up the glass of water (stress) and carry on. In this way, one will be able to shoulder stress for a longer period of time.<br><br><span class="small">------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A rather unwieldy transcript but it should get the point across.</span><br></div>

So... don't even let it bother you. After a while, i get used to the notion that my limited 'bandwidth' should be used on meaningful emails to or from sensible people.<br><br>I hope the flame is not due to the recent activities on this thread.

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if this is all a conincidence or is it Jieqi's doing...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It should be a conincidence lah... the i-weekly crew probably planned who and what to feature in each edition way way ahead of time.<br><br>What might happen next? Mary interviewing Jieqi on air... *hint hint* But I really don't know if DJs and editors can get into trouble for doing things like that.<br><br>Thanks for the tip... my sis is usually the one who buys all these i-weekly stuff. I'll get it from her when she is done with it. In the mean time, perhaps someone could give a summary of what she said in the interview.<br><br>To Mary: I am a little tied up and haven't really got the chance to process and send you the PHLP material.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's PHLP?<br><br>Anyway, in the i-weekly interview, Mary talks about how tired she is from having to juggle both radio and TV assignments. Other than hosting TGIF and the recent Star Awards pre-and-post shows, she's also busy with a new programme, Shang Chang Da Ying Jia, that is tentatively scheduled for February 2003.<br><br>Mary also "gripes" about her busy filming schedule for Jiu Cheng Gao and how "no life" it was while filming the drama. She did share an interesting tidbit in the interview: there was likely a kissing scene with Allan Wu but she protested with the director, bringing what her mum said into the protest, that she wouldn't be able to find a man to marry!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PHLP = P Hua Lian Pian<br><br>Thanks for the summary on Mary...<br><br>I think most people can see that Mary is getting more and more high profile, be it on or off air. Well, we're happy for her. But then again, with a higher profile, we can expect her to be busier and busier... more and more 'no life'. Seriously, nowadays, all my friends in whatever line are getting more and more 'no life'.<br><br>What are the odds of Mary following Zhenrong's footsteps to become full time TV and no time radio?<br><br>Wah... Mary's time slot begins from noon to 4 pm nowadays. This is probably a  short term arrangement. Hehehe... quite fun to hear her voice while typing about her in the thread for her.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>It's good to hear Mary from 12 to 4pm 'cos she can talk more...find that the current arrangement from 2 to 5pm doesn't really leave much leeway for her to talk. But I also miss her hosting the 4 to 5pm programme. No offence to other DJs but I find that they usually play very popular songs during that time-slot, which defeats the original purpose of the programme.<br><br>I remember Mary saying before in an interview in Zaobao that she hopes to follow Zhenrong's footsteps i.e. sign on with the TV station when her contract with Mediacorp Radio ends this year. But she did say that her greatest love is still radio. For me, I hope Mary can take on a greater profile in TV and still continuing DJing on 933.<br><br>It's time of the year for the DJs to change shift again. Which time-slot do you hope to see Mary in?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* Mary is going to follow Zhenrong's footstep. Well, maybe Mary can take on a Jieqi role as well. Part time deejay every Sunday afternoon. That will be the day... Saturday Jieqi, Sunday Mary. But then again, she might need her weekends to unwind and more importantly, to meet up with cute guys.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>If you asked me, I think Mary is better suited for radio- a 9/10. As for hosting, she's a 8/10. And, for acting, I think she is 7.75/10. It's kinda waste if she goes into acting which may not be her forte. But then again, who am I to judge? anyway, i only saw her act in jiu3 ceng2 gao1 and that's something like her debut. I'm sure she will improve with time. she might end up being the most popular actress if she continue to improve. Whatever, I will miss her voice if she leaves radio behind.<br><br>Personally, I like her to be Moonlight Lady once again. For two reasons: 1) I don't have to surreptitiously tune in during office hours<br>and 2) her last stint for the night shift was really good! BUT, people say ladies taking night shift not good for health and will age faster. So... maybe not lah. Morning also not too bad 'cos I can listen to her while on the way to work.<br><br>As for the part about kissing scenes, I can understand the reservations. I mean, even for a guy like me, I won't go around smooching 'cos a kiss is something special. This is especially so for those who are still waiting for that special someone to give their first kiss. That's my situation too! And guess what? The first kiss is invaluable. And... there are some of this male actors who go around telling the press that a certain actriess tastes like strawberry while the other one is a lousy kisser etc. etc. Jerks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  I heard if the actress protests hard enough, they can use some special angle and camera trick to pull off a kissing scene without them actually doing so. Anyway, enough of this topic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi...<br><br>I haven't been very faithful in posting the daily PHLP from Mary's program to this site. Well, yes is an attempt to make it up: from some of the PHLPs I heard and in summary:<br><br>- Honesty is the best policy<br>- Never give up<br>- Material benefit isn't something everybody wants... sometimes, people just need a little challenge to be motivated.<br><br>Honestly, there are many times which I cannot tune in to the PHLP because of work. But well, it's always nice when I can do so because the room that has a radio actually faces Changi Airport. And somehow, at 3+ pm to the evening, activity shoots up at Changi Airport. Lot's of planes taking off and landing...<br><br>It's a nice feeling to see planes take off while listening to "Chicken Soup for the Soul"-type, inspirational stories.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haven't been replying for some time...hmmm...the tread seems to have died. Tinker, u still there?<br><br>Anyway, Mary has started doing the night shift...she sounds happier doing the night shift. Maybe it's just me but there seems to be a certain bounce to her voice that you dun hear in the daytime. And she and Cavin are really quite funni though there's not much chemistry between them. Hoping they'll strike a good partnership together!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
