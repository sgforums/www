I've no idea why she was nominated in the first place...<br>Same goes 4 our (sickening) sweetiepie STELLA!!<br>HELLO, her live performance yesterday was an embarrassment! (If U know U ain't gonna be able to hit those notes when singing live, then PLEASE dun write yourself such challenging songs. Beri paiseh one, U know)<br>They even created an award specially 4 her... How lame...<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>7) BEST ALBUM PRODUCTION<br><br>Harlem Yu (Tidal Waves)<br><br>Kinda upset Jay missed out on this one....really such a pity...maybe no one likes his style?<br></strong></blockquote>huh?!

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...quite disappointing, cos I was really hoping that Dreamz fm will get the award~but i guess the competitors r really too strong dis yr..<br><br>n as much as i like sunyanzi, i tot yesterday nite was really an overdose of the Sun...I mean, it's machiam her mini concert loh...after a while, it got boring...<br>n I tot Jay was quite a regretful case...I was hoping he will get the Asia Pacific thing instead of Harlem...though i like Harlem too..<br>but i think it's unfair to say dat A-mei is not deserving for the award...cos it's clear dat the moment she sang, dat kind of richness n posh delivery ~ it's juz different loh...*not like Stella...I was really holding my breath for her in fear she wld sing off-key...*<br>same for Sandy...she deserves the award too..having been in the music scene for so long...yet can keep up the changing tastes wif her variation of vocal performance...<br><br>[This message has been edited by otterised (edited 09 September 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some thoughts abt Dreamz FM lar.<br><br>Their first album was not much of a hit...their 2nd album wasn't much of a hit though...and seriously, if they do not have the song BU ZHI DE, they would have faded into semi-obscurity...I am not saying that they r no good...but they need a string of hits (more BU ZHE DE) in order to propel them into the big league...Power Station has lost its touch...Mayday is going off...but dun forget Tension is still much better than Dreamz...and now with F4 coming up...Dreamz clearly going to be overshadowed...if only they are able to sell their album very well...well...if they hit 1/2 the sales of yanzi in SG and a modest sale amount in taiwan...they would probably win...it's sad...becoz it looks tat it might take Dreamz a long time to even win the best local singer (this year mavis had no album so she was out)...or even best group...</div>
