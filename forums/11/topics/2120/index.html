            <div class='col-md body'>So I have a topic on Singapore singers... how about Taiwan? Too much solo singers so I concentrate only on groups<br><br>F4 - Like their acting in meteor garden, but for their singing, need room for improvement loh, but like their lyrics<br><br>WeWe - Didn't have the chance to see their tv series yet, but like their song "Can't hear you", more prefer You Wei (maybe due to his hosting in entertainment news)<br><br>Mayday - Although split at the moment, but like their songs (prefer their chinese songs like Wen Rou,etc)<br><br>ZIP - Can't really figure out what they singing... hmmm<br><br>Wu Bai and China Blue - Got character, like their songs too...<br><br>4 in Love - Hmm didn't hear their song, so anyone can comment???<br><br>S.H.E - Beautiful ladies but also hear one song so cannot comment much...<br><br>So anymore to add???

            <div class='col-md body'>Well u guys miss out A.S.O.S. also. They have a new album though i think tat it would be well accepted by the normal pop listerners cos the new selection of songs belong to the morbid type... argh.... But give it a listern juz for the fun o it guys... its hard to find such a rare album in chinese pop culture....<br><br>S.H.E got a new album already. New "Zhu Da Ge" is called "Remember". A bit of the hip hop i think the last time i heard it. Alas its also a cover song....<br><br>------------------<br>Would i be Happier if i let it All out?!<br><br>[This message has been edited by MoodyBluz (edited 07 February 2002).]</div>

She's one sweet girl and the song "Bie" is listenable too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'd like to comment on these Taiwan Groups esp. on F4, my most fave.<br><br>F4 : Personally I loved them to focus on acting instead. Their actings are sincere and real I think that's the most important to capture viewers hearts, even before MG .. Jerry &amp; Ken appeared on Ma La Xian Shi  and I can say they're not just the pretty boys ...they have so many things to offer entertainment viewers like us, the other reason why F4 is popular beside fame after Meteor Garden are also because their "real" appearances and great personalities .. their efforts to work their way up and great management, on singing I think the albums are just popular demands, but their songs are listenable, that's the most important and the boys improved a lot and their efforts are worth our support !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Wewe : They're ok, I just prefer Li Wei to focus on acting after watching Tu Shi Nan Zhi Wen (great show btw) ... or maybe hosting as they;re hosting Wan Quan Yu Le ..<br><br>Mayday : Their songs are great and their friendship bond ... two thumbs up ! Will miss them a lot these years .. really enjoyed listening to their music and experience their friendship on OK L'a Wu Yue Tian, they're all talented Taiwan young generation, I love all their songs ..<br><br>4 in love : I love Rainie the most, she had the sweetest voice, the other one who's been lead vocal is Windy .. I think their songs are cheerful &amp; listenable. Not bad<br><br>Jing Xiu : I always find their singing voices soothing &amp; enjoyable, and they can host well too I think ..<br><br>so many talented groups .. hehe .. like novellem, I love the different characters on these Taiwan groups, I'm the super greedy, I think every groups have their own lovable style ... there's so many great ones in Taiwan !!!<br><br>on SHE, I somehow found REMEMBER like a Japanese pop song ... just din remember the title ... or maybe I'm wrong or sth ... I know they're hot in Taiwan now, din know a lot about them though ...<br><br>PS : Sorry I blabbed too much here, enjoying my first visit on the forum ... nice place to visit for a foreigner fan like me hehe<br><br>have a great day !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>S.H.E.'s Remember is indeed a cover version, but I can't remember the original title.<br><br>Their very popular Lian Ren Wei Man is also a cover version of Destiny's Child "Brown Eyes".<br><br>Incidentally, me and my friends who had heard the song found that both songs are almost exactly similar down to the last bit, including the music arrangement, except for their voices of course. Destiny's Child's original version is much better, S.H.E.'s voices are too whiny (except for Ella).<br><br>But S.H.E. is pretty big in Taiwan now, I must say.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, read that "Remember" was covered from a Korean boyband ShinHwa's song. So there for you...<br><br>As for WeWe, I read in the papers that while they were in Singapore, Li Wei fell sick and had to be rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night. Many fans chased him till the hospital and stayed in the emergency room. They were asked to leave but they refused to, creating a scene in the hospital itself until the record company nearly called the police.<br><br>Please, Singapore fans, you wanna support idols can, but don't do it in such a sia suay way, can or not? Whatever will the stars think of Singapore fans??? You are not being considerate to your idols ok? When they are sick, they want rest and peace, not that kind of chaos from so-called fans like those mentioned above.</div>
