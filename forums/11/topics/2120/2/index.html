            <div class='col-md body'>F4:I used to think that F4 suxs, but after   watching Meteor Garden, I have became a fan of F4. bUT, SERIOUSLY, i think that F4 cannot sing solo, they haf to sing as a group or the songs would be rubbish.<br>WeWe: Are the BEST! Not only do they look gd, they can sing well too(Though not everyone agrees). Who cares what others thinks. As long as i think WEWE rulz, they will always rule, isn't it?<br>S.H.E.: They can sing very well. But, their voices are a bit too sweet. Gifs you a feeling that you haf eaten too much sugar after listening to their songs.<br>Tension: They may not look good, but they sure can sing, But I heard that they are breaking up soon.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yap Toe! at first i didn't realise wat's these F4 abt... i thought it's jus another good looking male group... that's all! but after lookin into the meteor garden... i begin to like them... maybe it's the story that I like which link onto liking them... however, as for their singing.... i think it still need to be recognise... way to go!<br><br>As for Wewe... i began to know them from the ufm... thanks for the 'yuan chuan yu le', if not... i don't think i will know them... but too bad cannot see youwei hosting recently... i like them due to they sometimes really able to memorise their fans' names... and not many idol are able to do that... however as for their concert, err my personal comment... no offence! i felt that they need maybe to produce one or two more album before setting up a concert... in order to provide more good stuff for listeners...<br><br>Well, I admit that i didn't really notice S.H.E in their first ablum... however for their second.... I really like their music... very special very nice...<br><br></div>
