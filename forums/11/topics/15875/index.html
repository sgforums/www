            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think Jieqi was on air last Saturday right? Was he? I heard something around lunchtime that he hurt his neck or something... Any news, anybody?<br><br>Sherv:<br>If the the transcript is in hard copy, forget it lah. I think you got better things to do. BUT, if you feel that I should see it, maybe you can drop me an email then I tell you my address than you can post it to me. Personally, I feel there really isn't a need to.<br><br>You are beginning to sound like a loner... which I am and am proud to be one. I have really good friends but by and large, I ENJOY being alone. I just like to plug in to my receiver and work on my own... something like hiding in my own little universe, oblivious to whatever that is around me. Yerp.. sometimes, some things are just not meant to be. You just can't click with certain people and there really isnt' a cerebral reason for that. Hindus and Buddhists would call it karma. Psychologist will probably call it personality or type mismatch. The Chinese have a saying "you yuan qian li lai xiang hui, wu yuan dui mian bu xiang shi", which sums it up very well.<br><br>As for 98.7, I did listen to it since its birth and it was good. I remember tirelessly trying to tune my radio to 98.7MHz back in Dec 89 just to catch the opening of 98.7 English pop was at its height from 90-92 I think. There was Escape Club's "I'll be there", Surface's "Shower me with your love", Marx with "Right Here Waiting", "Angelia"... almost every song in his Repeat Offender was good. Say it with Music was in direct competition with Xiang Ge Ji Yi and my radio dial oscillated between 987 and 933.<br><br>Then, all hell broke loose with the raps coming in... MC Hammer, and all the messengers from hell... with that, I stuck to 933 until this day while others tune to 95. Oh yes, my sis likes 90.5 and it has rubbed onto me...<br><br>*wow* this is a pretty long reply eh?<br></div>
