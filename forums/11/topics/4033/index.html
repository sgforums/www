            <div class='col-md body'>I'm delighted with A*mei's and Harlem's long-overdue win.... at long last! A*mei's high-kicking energetic performance left me breathless.... literally!!! And the effervescent Harlem was definitely the crowd favourite. The night belonged to both of them.<br><br>Good to see Jay walking away with the awards that matter more to him .... he's more talented as a musician than a singer.<br><br>A bit disappointed that the Newcomer award went to Jeffrey Kung....<br><br>Singapore artistes went home empty handed this year, but hopefully they'll do better next year.</div>

Quite a pity Tanya didnt get the best composer award though ...<br><br>On the whole, this year's awards show was much better than last year... the pace was brisk, host Tao Zi was a riot (as usual), and the entertainment provided by A*Mei, Lee Hom and Eason Chan/William So/Andy Hui was great.<br><br>Now for Spore's Jin Qu Jiang....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many Taiwanese critics gave their predictions for the various awards before the day, and when it came to Best Group, almost all of them said they heard nothing about Jiao Gong Yue Dui before they were nominated. But I guess more people will take notice of them now.<br><br>The most upsetting part should be the Best Newcomer. Abit cannot believe Kong Ling Qi got the award. There were some whispers of "zao ma", coz his mentor Xiao Chong was one of the panel judges. He did not make a big splash in Taiwan, mind you, neither was he that superb. Come on lah, even L.A. Boyz were much better than him when it comes to rap!<br><br>Ping chang xin, ping chang xin...kan le jiu suan...<br></div>

Ah Mei is my favourite artist and I trust her * shi li *<br>Anyway Jay Chou I believe as many fansy have predicted did very well at the reward.<br><br>I didn't watch thorought the show but I did manage to catch the important moment@ glance start from the best newcomer- Kong LIng Qi.<br>This recipent, for me  quite unpredictable ,what I suppose is SHE or Xu Zhe Pei.<br><br>However, thanks you Zilchster for your updating results of the early part. I did appreaciate it. Hai Zilchster and everbody.
