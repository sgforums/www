            <div class='col-md body'>Noticed a lot of singers nowadays also tout themselves to be composers. Some of them started out just singing, and after a couple of years, foray into the composing arena. However, are all of them competent composers? Or are they just pretenders who write a couple of mediocre pieces so as to pass themselves off as "multi-talented stars"?<br><br>For one, I was quite impressed by Gigi's composing talent. I have always thought of her to be just a pretty thing, nothing else. But after listening to "Hua Huo" and "Shen Shuo", I was utterly dumbfounded by her song-writing skills. This girl can really write!<br><br>However, I can't say the same for many others, eg. Andy Lau. I quite like him as an artiste, but his song-writing (esp. Ma Tong, I really can't stomach that)...DUH...To me, his song-writing was "born" more because he was a willing learner of many things, hence he gave a try at song-writing too. But his attempts make me wish that he will just stick to what he does best, which definitely does not include song-writing.<br><br>Just a word to all wannabes out there: Just do what you do best, and don't undermine your ability or success by foraying into areas which you don't have any clue about.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha... i agree.<br>i guess it's really hard to cut it out as<br>an artist/singer these days... if you're not<br>versatile, you're not as marketable...it's<br>almost like a pre-requisite that you must<br>have some 'extra' talents...if you're a singer, it's not enough for you to be able to just sing.. you must know how to play your own instruments or compose your own songs before you're considered a shi li pai singer... quite tough lah...just look at our own mediacorp artists... sometimes i just wish they could stick to their day job of acting.. but no loh, they have to sing, host, dance, etc....<br><br>but you've got to admit a person who can really pull it off wins the admiration of the rest of us..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
