It is written by Julia herself.  This song suits her the best, and I would say it's one of the best songs in the album.<br><br>Track 6 LIAN AI DONG WU...is an interesting song.  This is also one of the more outstanding songs in the album.  Helps bring out Julia's vocals.  Track 7 YOU ARE THE ONE is very karaoke friendly.

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGER: ELVA HSIAO (XIAO YA XUAN)<br><br>WHO IS SHE: One of the four small heavenly queens of Taiwan with really good record sales.<br><br>TITLE OF ALBUM: MING TIAN (TOMORROW)<br><br>RELEASED BY: VIRGIN MUSIC/EMI<br><br>Firstly, I must admit I am an Elva fan.  But I shall try my best to give a fair review of the album.<br><br>Let's talk about her image...well...her image has definitely improved in this one.  No doubt one of my friends remarked that she looks a little like Coco...actually she does minus the glam factor.  But in this album, they up the glam factor a little more than her first and second albums.  She doesn't look cute or so...in fact i find her more mature looking than elva...even her songs too...Elva isn't that pretty...but well...her image has improved since the first album...<br><br>Now here's the producing factor and the people involved in this task...For this album...3 great producers are assembled...Jae Chong...Jim Lee and Chen Wei.  In fact...Elva did have a part in the production...as in she dugged out her collections of CDs, and shared with the producers the kinda music (R&amp;B...soul) she likes...Chen Wei contributed 2 compositions...Sky Wu with 1...Sakura again...Jae Chong...I think she has assembled quite a big band of reknowned lyricists for her album...with Yao Qian penning the lyrics to 6 songs...Lin Xi 2 songs...and Yao Ruo Long and Yu Guan Zhong having one each...in fact...they said there was no coaching to be done on the harmonising or so like tat...IN track 3 Let It Go...Stanley Huang raps with her...COOL.<br><br>Music wise...well...to those who are expecting a lot of saccharine filled ballads...or those songs mourning over heart-break and those love ballads...i am sorry...but u wun probably find these in the album.  Although there are quite a few sentimental songs...but they are done R&amp;B style.  In this album, Elva has tried out several different styles, Latin, Gospel, Soul and R&amp;B.  If you are a fan of Mariah...Whitney...Toni...Brandy and Monica...All Saints...TLC...these kinda...well...this album is sure to be the in thing for you.  I personally like these kinda songs...so yah...i find this album a really good refreshing change from all the mainstream love ballads (although her first song is a r&amp;b ballad)...The only complain is that most of the songs are covers of other songs...like her first album...but then...still good...so it really depends on taste...this is an album u need to listen to slowly...probably on a relaxing evening...late at nite...quite alrite...juz put ur heart to listen...I muz admit...Elva has a flaw...i cannot find her feelings when she sings...hmm...hope she can improve on this point...most importantly...all the songs bring out the uniqueness of her voice...her zhong di yin...well...all the songs actually suit her voice...and brings out the quality of her voice...kudos to the team...<br><br>Her album in no 1 on TCR Records and Rose Records...on the former...her album sold 42.52% of the whole record store sales...the next is only 6% or so...so yah...as for the song to song breakdown...i would update it with time...<br><br>Do support Elva...refreshing album and change in this low-season of albums.<br><br>RATING: A- (if you love American Pop)<br>RATING: B+ (if u were expecting love ballads)<br><br>BEST LYRICS:  In fact all of them are good...might not outdo Faye's FABLE...but they are all good.  But do pay attention to Track No 5 CHANG HUA DUAN SHUO...Lin Xi is such a zany lyricist.<br><br>RECOMMENDED SONGS: Track 1-&gt;MING TIAN, Track 2-&gt;MI MI, Track 3-&gt;Let It Go (Really cute and entertaining), Track 4--&gt;Tian Shi Zan Shi Li Kai, Track 6-&gt;WO AI NI NA ME DUO, Track 7--&gt;XIA YI CI LIAN AI, Track 8--&gt;AI QING MEI, Track 9-&gt;DA YING WO<br><br>Any comments?<br><br>BEST LYRICS: CHANG HUA DUAN SHUO, TIAN SHI ZAN SHI LI KAI, MING TIAN, AI QING MEI, LET IT GO<br><br>[This message has been edited by Zilchster (edited 08 June 2001).]</div>

Nevertheless dun compare...<br><br>Jolin doesn't suck...juz tat her songs are not as nice as elva's...her songs are more cutesy M2M tat kinda...and the lyrics really very wu liao...in fact elva's album has very good lyrics and more meaningful...Jolin's songs also so immature lor...i tink yao qian saved the best for her and sandy lam...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know i am repeating myself...but the review should fit snugly here too.<br><br>Hello all...this is an album review of Elva's album from The Straits Times Friday 27 April 2001.  The reviewer gave her album a four star rating out of five...very rare for this column.<br><br>Here's the review extract...<br><br>The Cappucino Girl is back.<br><br>This time Elva Hsiao returns as a shampoo girl with lustrous black hair - and a brand new album that is as exciting as her new publicity shots for her third release.<br><br>The title track MING TIAN which opens the album Mrs Guy Ritchie's Music with its droning electronic backbeat and Hsiao's sometimes distorted vocals.  But she offers more variation in terms of melodic progression than Maddy's track.<br><br>Tomorrow, the album - whihc comes with a bonus VCD of footage of her concert last year also sees her working with a slew of interesting names.  Take for instance Sky Wu who wrote the music for the funky yet sultry after burner Secret on which she also raps in english.  The album also features Stanley Huang rapping on Let It Go.<br><br>Also be on the lookout for the track Next Time I Fall In Love which features the return of Japanese R&amp;B diva Sakura whom Hsiao worked with on the latter's album HONG QIANG WEI.<br><br>These two tracks as well as a Angel's Temporary Departure and Keep your Speech Short remind u of the music of J-pop R&amp;B goddess Misia and of the fact Hsiao's forte lies in R&amp;B.<br><br>Beyond R&amp;B, tomorrow also embraces the 2step/UK Garage movement in tracks like Love's beautifuk and Third-time in love.<br><br>Like Misia Hsiao's music teases u with juz a little bit of soul while retaining sufficient pop sensibilites to attract a mainstream audience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chen San Ni?! Her songs are very nice but look at her personality! She's 2 proud as she said that Jolin is the No.9 worst singer. What the f**king hell is she speaking?! I know she's a great composer but her songs sure won't enter the Top 20 933 songs one. Not even No. 20. Yang Nai Wen is better. I like her, she's so cool. i really like her attitude! She's the singer where one day I can join her gang. Looks like she's a gang leader and I love it!!! Ha Ha!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately...u cannot spell her name so correctly...Sandee Chan aka Chen Shanni...her music dun need to enter the top 10 charts...but i tink she is a great composer and singer...much better than jolin mah!  Anyway Jolin is not the no 9 worse singer...becoz...they r not in the order or 'merit'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>To those avid fans of this particular corner, sorry for disappointing you all by not posting any reviews here...did not buy many new albums recently.  Just got a copy of Karen Mok's SHI ER LOU DE MO WEN WEI...dunno if i should review or not...since it is an old album...but I picked up Yang Naiwen's new album YING GAI today with the review going to be up in a day or 2.  Look out hopefully for reviews of Sammi, Yuki and Guang Liang's albums.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGER: FAITH YANG (YANG NAIWEN)<br><br>WHO IS SHE: THIS IS HER NEW ALBUM AFTER WINNING THE 2000 GOLDEN MELODY AWARDS FOR BEST FEMALE VOCALIST.<br><br>TITLE OF ALBUM: YING GAI (SHOULD HAVE)<br><br>RELEASED BY: MAGICSTONE<br><br>I am sure a lot of people remember Yang Naiwen for her acting cool while presenting this year's Golden Melody Awards and in 2000 when she just uttered thanks after accepting the award and left the stage promptly.<br><br>About this album.  This album is produced by her boyfriend Lin Weizhe.  Faith has always insisted on having one album every two years instead of the usual 1 year plus.  For this album, she cut her hair short, revealed a little flesh, and adorned a more sophisticated elegant look, which I could say quite a success.<br><br>Now onto the music.  She managed to grab one song from Chen Xiaoxia (who wrote TA BU AI WO, HUI LAI, PENG YOU, CHENG QUAN etc).  There were a few singers eyeing this song ZHU WO XING FU (track no 2)... e.g. Annie Yi Nengjing and Huang Yingying.<br><br>The tune is kinda like the circa 1980s. Hmm...something like Huang Yingying would sing.  It is very hard to imagine that Faith would sing such a song, but I do relish her efforts and she did ample justice to the song.  The lyrics is very touching, but I guess you need some time adjusting to.<br><br>The title of the album Ying Gai, is derived from the song of the same name, on track no 1.  Written totally by Chen Shanni, this song reminds me of Wo Gei De Ai...it's quite long and it tends to repeat here and there....very reminiscent of Chen Shanni.  Hearing Yang Naiwen singing this song, reminds me of Chen Shanni...<br><br>Queen is the song you currently hear over the airwaves.  The music is very Brit-rock like Oasis...slightly toned down...the lyrics are pretty interesting.<br><br>Surrender on track no 8 is the longest song at 6.28mins.  It is an English song and the lyrics and melody is written by none other than Faith herself.  I would say this is one of the best tracks of the album.  It sounds totally professional Western Pop Rock.<br><br>In this album...you could fine tunes and lyrics written by Chen Qizhen, though most of the bulk is by Lin Weizhe.  This album is a good pop rock album...but somehow the music tends not to leave a lasting impression because the arrangement is pretty much the same.  Her voice may sound monotonous and lazy...but that's the way it is meant to be.<br><br>OVERALL RATING: B+<br><br>BEST LYRICS: YING GAI</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGER: SAMMI CHENG (ZHENG XIUWEN)<br><br>WHO IS SHE: HEAVENLY QUEEN OF HONG KONG<br><br>TITLE OF ALBUM: WAN ZHENG (COMPLETE)<br><br>RELEASED BY: WARNER MUSIC<br><br>No matter how Sammi is advanced in her music in her Cantonese albums, she still has to yield to the tastes of the Taiwanese market.<br><br>Due to the success of Mei Fei Se Wu, in this album, Sammi included a fast track with Yuki (this newcomer who is a guy...quite boyish) rapping.  This song is DU YI WU ER...meant for a coffee commercial.  It is from her Cantonese album...and in turn from a Korean pop song.<br><br>The other song is Mei Li Ran Shao (Firing Glamour-as given by the CD)...This song is reminiscent of Madonna's Ray of Light...with the nice ambient mix to it...So far these 2 are the songs that stand out from the whole album.<br><br>The rest of the other songs are pretty normal Sammi stuff...it is very different from her previous album QU AI BA...where there was a visible change in her style...(due to Chen Shanni)...but most of the ballads are those common normal commercialised ballads...like Que Xi...Chu Jie that kinda...great for listening though...<br><br>She assembled Yuan Weiren (contributed 2 songs to this album), Kay Huang (Huang Yunling), Bao Xiaobo and Li Si Song as producers for her album.<br><br>I can't say which one of the songs deserve to be awarded the best lyrics...because they are all quite so so...none really stands out.<br><br>OVERALL RATING: B<br></div>
