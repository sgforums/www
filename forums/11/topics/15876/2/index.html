Ya, old.<br><br>Comments : Urm, shuo zhen de, sometimes i wish Sandee can try to sing the songs she wrote for others, like jiang mei qi and sammi and the new singer wu pei wen. I find those songs easier to accept. Is not that i dun wanna accept Sandee, afterall i've bought<br>2 of her albums liao, but....this 1, the songs r harder to digest. (though sales is the best out of all her albums) A lot of dian zi music, till the last few tracks, will get a bit bored. However, the lyrics r not bad and the packaging is good too. Of course, there r still some digestable yet still filled with excitement in music elements tracks.<br><br>REcommended tracks :<br>ni tai hao kan<br>wan mei &lt;--- really good, not difficult to digest and nice<br>shen ying<br>6 yue 29 ri<br><br>Album rate : **** (if comapred to her past works, it may worth ***1/2* )<br><br>Should-u-buy rate: *** (normal listeners may not like this 1 to be played at home, may end up dozing off.)<br><br></div>

First, i must praise that this album is really a small breakthrough for them, bcos is no longer abt band sound, but their ability to do other things. Zuo jian is a very, UN-mayday song, bcos is very soft and is,.....<br>different, sounds fresh. Track by Rene is oso bery nice, bcos it really can give the feeling of hou niao. However, the other pure music tracks are....quite mayday lah, den...<br>though not bad, but....somehow, cant give me the feeling of the movie.<br><br>Since it is a soundtrack, i would really wanna comment on the track which can hear the actors words and their own background guitar n humming n singing. IT is, the BEST track in the album, bcos, i suddenly can feel the movie and feel the music they wanna give. It is called, hua huo yi ban, by Michael Teigen.<br><br>Album rate : ***1/2*<br>Should-u-buy rate: ***1/2* ( easy to digest, esp for a chi movie soundtrack)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGER: FREYA LIN(LIN FAN)<br><br>WHO IS SHE: THIS IS HER SOPHOMORE EFFORT...A VERY VERY GOOD SINGER.<br><br>TITLE OF ALBUM: DOU SHI TA (ALL ABOUT HIM)<br><br>RELEASED BY: SHANG HUA (WHAT'S MUSIC)<br><br>Just bought Freya's sophomore effort on Saturday, and I am pleasantly surprised by her good voice.<br><br>Let's talk about Freya.  Li Zongsheng wanted to sign her on, only to realise he was too late.  She had signed with What's.  She made a name for herself by doing a rendition of Sandy Lam's YE TAI HEI.  Freya is currently having her examinations in Seattle and for this album, they put a photo of a guy instead of Freya on the cover.  So don't think you bought the wrong album.  On the album, the company put that Freya songs have a power of soothing your wounded soul.<br><br>Let's talk about the music...she is collaborating with mainly two producers Ling Weiwen (wrote her YI GE REN SHENG HUO) and Lin Mingyang...<br><br>Let's talk abt the flaws...she is doing so so many covers of songs...She is singing the chinese version of the theme song Shrek...she sounds a little odd...can give this song a miss...And she did a cover of Sarah Mclachlan's Angel...for those of you who love this song...u might be a little aghast at freya for doing a cover of it again...but honestly, she does a good job with this song...and her pronunciation is perfect...as with the other english song Make Believe (Also a cover)(did a chinese version called SAN GE XIN YUAN).  People who adore the song Angel, Freya's version is good too.  She also did a cover of Sammi Cheng's SHE BU DE NI...so so alrite...and she did a cover of a Japanese song(ZEN ME LI KAI NI CAI NENG GOU BI SHANG XIN).<br><br>That leaves us with 5 original songs...U probably heard the first song DOU SHI TA.  It's a light R&amp;B number...need some time getting used to.  My preference is however for track 2, NAN DAO.  Composed by Liu Qing (of BU ZHI BU JUE, XIN SHI JIE), it is a very slow moving song...coupled with kinda sad lyrics by Li Zhuoxiong...a slow moving song u would like after a while...excellent arrangement from Tu Yin.  Freya's voice is excellent in this number...but i think ah mei could sing this voice just as well too...if only ah mei got this song.<br><br>Wo De Gan Jing Tai Fen Fu is composed by Ling Weiwen (of YI Ge Ren Sheng Huo)...lyrics by Lin Xi...a nice ballad...WO XIANG YAO and Now I See are also more of pop in nature.<br><br>In fact if you can ignore the fact that Freya is doing too many direct covers...this is an excellent album for those who like vocals.<br><br>OVERALL RATING: B+<br><br>BEST LYRICS: DOU SHI TA<br></div>

And by the time of my review, everyone would probably have heard his title track TENG NI DE ZE REN...the song is a very nice with the saccharine factor...is very strong...really a hit with the girls...and I guess the creative heads have found a good way in marketing Victor...as a goodie two shoes guy...and yah...he is really that kinda person...<br><br>Unlike Michael's album, which is produced by Michael and most of the songs written by Michael himself, Victor has only 3 songs in this album, and producing given to the hands of Li Zongsheng and Xiao Chong (who also wrote the songs DU JUAN and PEI NI YI QI LAO)...I prefer the former...over Pei Ni Yi Qi Lao...i find Xiao Chong's songs very Hokkienish like...<br><br>Other than the slow moving sentimental songs...check out the slightly uptempto ZUI JIA PIN PAI and LIU DE HUA...I think these songs are delivered in a fresh manner and stands out amongst the album of forgettable songs.  Anyway this is a really nice album of soothing and pleasant songs...<br><br>OVERALL RATING: B<br><br>BEST LYRICS: ZUI JIA PIN PAI</div>

She assembled Paula Ma Yufen, Jonathan Li and Guo Wenxian as producers for her 3rd effort...in terms of songs...I would say, there's no breakthrough...tunes are pretty much forgettable unless u keep on repeating one song at a time...well...this is to play safe...u get tunes like yong qi and ai ni bu shi liang san tian those kind.<br><br>However, I much say her singing has much improved...especially in WU TIAO JIAN WEI NI (originally a KOREAN SONG--&gt;UURGH ANOTHER COVER), whereby the bridge is the climax...and she scales the high keys effortlessly...on the whole her singing is good.<br><br>OVERALL RATING: B<br><br>BEST LYRICS: ZUI XIANG HUAN YOU DE SHI JIE<br><br>Personal comments:  I would rather buy Freya's album...find the tunes in Freya more captivating.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ARTISTE: MAYDAY/WU YUE TIAN<br><br>NAME OF ALBUM: REN SHENG HAI HAI (PEOPLE LIFE OCEAN WILD)<br><br>WHO ARE THEY: CONSISTING OF 5 BOYS, ONE OF THE BIGGEST RECORD SELLERS OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS.<br><br>Actually, I liked Mayday since their first album, from the song Zhi Ming Yu Chun Jiao a Hokkien song...which is the best of their songs to date...unfortunately, u can't hear it under airplay.  They shot to fame because their tunes are very simple, very taiwanese, and the lyrics are well, revolves around day to day things and realistic.<br><br>As usual this album still does not fail to deliver catchy tunes and lyrics that touches us on our day to day lives.  However, they are not so rock as before...toned down slightly.<br><br>As usual there are the usual 5 hokkien songs in the album...i persoanlly like the song HAO BU HAO...the kinda sentimental hokkien ballad tat is kinda touching...the rest are quite fast...<br><br>As for the Mandarin songs...Neng Bu Neng Bu Yao Shuo is an uptempo fast song...tat could make u wanna dance...and ren sheng hai hai is like the answer to WEN ROU.<br><br>Personal favs include HOU NIAO (they took back the song to sing too...juz as good as rene's version) as well as CAI HONG (a song for Liang Jingru in her first album), with the band sound, the 2 songs seem fabulous.  In Track 10 CHUN ZHEN (Innocence), you find that their music can be slow, touching, without much band music, and Ah Xin the lead can be gentle too in his singing.<br><br>Anyway this is their final album until the guys come back together again after their Military Service.  So if u like them, do get tis album.  Would be sure to miss their music.  Interesting, they r pitting themselves against some big names in trying to capture sales like Jolin and Yanzi.<br><br>All the best to Mayday<br><br>OVERALL RATING: B+</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ARTISTE: STEFANIE SUN YANZI<br><br>NAME OF ALBUM: FENG ZHENG (KITE)<br><br>WHO IS SHE: SINGAPORE'S PRIDE AND ONE OF THE FOUR SMALL HEAVENLY QUEENS WITH IMPRESSIVE RESULTS...BOTH CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED AND SALES RESULTS.<br><br>Firstly, I am not a huge fan of Stefanie.  But nevertheless, I was anticipating her third outing, and the fact is, she never stops to impress, and this third album is quite well, impressive.<br><br>With the great sale record of her first two albums, Stefanie must be under immensed pressure for this album to sell.  And I'm sure it does.<br><br>She kept the producers Bao Xiaobo, Si Song, Wei Song and added Chen Wei and Chen Zihong to the list of producers.  As for music wise, 8 out of 10 songs are by local Singaporeans. Hurrah!<br><br>Her title track FENG ZHENG starts off with her just singing without any music, and it brings out the quality of her voice.  She sounds a little like Alanis when she is doing this song.  20 lyricists were asked to fill in the lyrics to this song, but Calvin Yi Jiayang emerged as the winner.  This song is really touching, and somehow I could feel that Yanzi is crying at the same time.  Touching song, but needs more time to appreciate.<br><br>Her first song LU GUANG (Green Light) is a fast number...sounds pretty enya like, and yanzi does a rap in it (she wrote the rap) herself.  On the whole, the music sounds pretty enya like, but i enjoyed this song, a difference from Ling Que Dian and Chao Kuai Gan...<br><br>Her two compositions REN XING (Track 3) is the best song in the album.  It's also very touching and easy on the ears especially when she gets to the Bridge...wow...her technique is really good.  Her other song ZHEN DE (Track 6) is the demo ON THE ROAD (from Album 2)...this is yet another nice song and easy with well written lyrics by Xu Shi Zhen.  A bit slow, but u need time to catch on it.<br><br>There are some uptempo/fast numbers like TAO WANG, LIAN XI, SUI TANG CE YAN and WO SHI WO. WO SHI WO is a duet with Sun Jing...has this kinda band sound and Sun Yanzi really let herself go...my preference is SUI TANG CE YAN...with cute/creative lyrics written by Li Zhuo Xiong.  However a small part of the tune sounds like Sammi's MEI LI RAN SHAO.<br><br>Other karaoke friendly numbers include BU SHI ZHEN DE AI WO...and AI QING ZI DIAN...these songs cater to the market needs, but then they dun fail to please the listener as they r easy on the listeners and yet touching.<br><br>I hope Yanzi would be able to do more slow numbers though.  This album is a really decent and good effort.  So do support Yanzi.<br><br>OVERALL RATING: A-<br><br>BEST LYRICS: FENG ZHENG, SUI TANG CE YAN, REN XING.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGER: HARLEM YU (HA LIN) (YU CHENG QING)<br><br>WHO IS HE: SUPER HOST OF THE VARIETY PROGRAMME SUPER SUNDAY/ HUBBY TO ANNIE YI/ LOSER AT TAIWAN'S GOLDEN MELODY AWARDS<br><br>TITLE OF ALBUM: HAI XIAO (TIDAL WAVES)<br><br>RELEASED BY: SONY MUSIC<br><br>At this time when I am writing my review, according to reports, Harlem's album has passed 250,000 and is the saviour of the bad record sales market.<br><br>Frankly, I never wanted to get this album.  It was not really on my list of must get albums...and it was not becoz of the 250,000 that I decided to get this album...it was partly due to the concert.<br><br>It is no doubt Harlem is a capable host...he needs no host to create that kinda atmosphere...but i dislike him for doing covers...<br><br>Back to this album, I find that it is one of the best for the first half of the year...in terms of of lyrics, music, and singing style...yah...it's really good...a wide variety...it's as good as Elva's if not better...Harlem produced this album, and wrote 8 out of 10 tracks...the other 2 (HAI XIAO and QING FEI DE YI) is by a local composer Tang Xiao Kang (no idea who he is)...anyway, lyrics maestro Adam Hsu/Xu Chang De wrote 9 out of 10 songs in this album.  Reportedly, Xu Changde had some differences with Harlem at first, but it worked out nicely in the end.  Although, I still like Lin Xi and Yao Qian, Xu Changde did a good job with the lyrics thanks to Harlem's constant haranguing until Xu Changde got so scared...Harlem made calls to Xu and even made Xu convince him that the lyrics to Hai Xiao is touching.  Xu took abt 9 months to a year for this album, normal cases 2 to 3 months.  So u should be able to see the quality of the lyrics...2nd to elva's Ming Tian album.<br><br>Was kinda upset over HAI XIAO...it's a nice song...but Harlem's singing sounds so bitter and sad...very sa gou xue...that kinda feeling...okie...but still a nice song...can show off some vocal prowess...<br><br>As the album progresses, you can realise that Harlem's forte is in his zhuan yin.  Track 2 is very R&amp;B and Harlem laps it up with confidence.  Track 3, and Track 7 (QING FEI DE YI, my favourite, happens to be the theme song of the tv serial LIU XING HUA YUAN) is very folksy, very Harlem like, and this is the two tracks which he really excels in.<br><br>There are other ballads and my of my favourites is Track 4, YING HUA L.A. TOKYO...beautiful music...as well as TRACK 8 GOODBYE PETER PAN'S WORLD.  No matter whether it's ballads or folksy or even Fast numbers, personal favourite is HUAN YING GUANG LIN DISCO...with a disco kinda arrangement...COOL!!!  GROOVY!  REMINDS ME OF ABBA.<br><br>Don't miss out on Track 6 AI DAO DI...kinda touching...is this track meant for Annie Yi?<br><br>Harlem has been losing for the last few years at the Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards...certainly...I hope with this album, he would be able to get the crown for best male vocalist.  This is a totally fresh album, and without strong competition...i would wanna him to win.<br><br>OVERALL RATING: A-<br><br>BEST LYRICS:  ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many thanks to Zilchter's music review. It is truly helpful. I wonder if you actually buy all the CD albums before you review them. There is a music site that allows you to listen (w/o downloading) all the newest chinese CDs using RA player (www.xuxule.com/home.html).</div>

Firstly, maybe is bcos xian ru wei zhu, din really like the cover version of the 2 songs they wrote. Afterall, what make us excited abt mayday is not the vocals but the music itself.<br><br>One of the outstanding tracks would be all 5 of them singing together, jie wen zhong shen ming, taiwanese song, but one of the best. Light, easy, comfortable and great. Din understand the lyrics afterall i aint hokkien lah, but, is really the best.<br><br>First track, yi ke ping guo, is not bad for a start. ren sheng hai hai, the lyrics is ok only, tot would give some better lyrics though. As for the rest, all i could say is, not as outstanding as the previous album but, nai ting. This album din really make sales as good as the past, and dun really believe they've crossed the 250000 mark, if not, yanzi would be reaching 300000. I've learnt to take 1/2 of those figures.<br><br>Anyway, this album dun haf...those kind of HIT song to really remember. If i really were to choose, perhaps it would be neng bu neng bu yao shuo loh.....<br><br>Grades: 7.5/10<br>Worth buying rate: 7/10</div>
