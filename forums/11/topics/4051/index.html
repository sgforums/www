            <div class='col-md body'>Well , first of all I want to say ..if you is a great fan of F4 you have to support all of them and don't to insult VAness.Everybody has different way , some may like VAness , some may like Jerry.Of course , my fav is as same as yours , Jerry but I think it's definetely wrong to say Vaness is ugly and proud.I've seen Vaness and I tell you he;s the most friendly among all.He's the only one who say thank you to each of their fans and d.j.So why you say he's proud.What if someone who like VAness but hate Jerry say something bad about him? How u feel?I hope you respect each of their members if you really love F4.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(quote) AND I DO NOT LIKE VANNESS AND I THINK HE IS SO PROUD<br>(quote) pls do not mistaken that l do not like vaness and l did not say he is very proud guy ok??<br><br>The 2 sentences above came from the same person, I believe? *shrugs*<br><br>Anyway, I feel a lot of Singapore guys have the tendency to "show off" their "so-called" girlfriends, eg. wear low-cut, pile on makeup, etc. They also only know how to sayang girls by buying them a lot of material gifts...but I guess many girls sort of "requested" for that themselves. A kind of "I show off my girl very pretty, you show off your guy very rich" mentality...<br><br>But again, these are only MY personal opinions...</div>
