            <div class='col-md body'>Was wondering how Dick Lee managed to get the COMPASS award for Composer of the Year? Anyone know the criteria for this award? I thought the Lee twin brothers have done well too, but maybe more so this year rather than 2000, the year where the judging is based on.<br><br>Tanya Chua is snapping up a string of awards for songwriting too... good for her. Thank god Stella Ng has no part in this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> There doesn't seem to be many local female composers of Chinese pop music.... ok maybe Yanzi can be considered as one too but she's not a prolific songwriter. I have to say her two compositions in Kite are rather good, so she may well turn out to be a good songwriter in the future.<br><br>Who are the good local lyricists? I think even the Lee brother don't write the lyrics for their songs. Perhaps someone can share their views on the works of our Spore songwriters and lyricists?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I personally know quite a few composers (including Yong Bang and Xin Wei)...i know of others as well...someone called jason...etc...Strangely...xin wei was also absent from this compass thingie...yah yah...i know of a few composers but becoz of the tight market...so not many of them made it overseas.<br><br>Lyricist...i am sort one myself...but it's really hard to push lyrics into the taiwanese market.  Did collaborate with Yong Bang b4...but sometimes maybe my lyrics don't suit the taiwan market or it lacks something...but am still trying...just need time and luck.<br><br>As for the real pros...Liang Wenfu/Li Feihui (actually he is not a full time)...those few people from mediacorp/hype records...also Xiaohan(a female) and Wu Qing Kang lor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're a lyricist yourself? Cool  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I heard this Yong Bang for the very first time over 933 this morning. The song was wo ai de qiu shi ni or sth like that... his vocals are quite good actually. Good luck with his foray to the Taiwanese market. It's about time that the local guys take a bit of the limelight dominated by the gals!<br><br>What's happened to Eric Moo? Seems to be keeping a low profile of late. I like his compositions but sorry to say he's not a great singer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Just out of curiosity, who gets a bigger share of the song's royalties - the one who contributes the lyrics or the melody?<br></div>
