            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, Jerry's dad passed away since he was young, that's why he had been doing lots of errands/jobs to help out the family. This also cultivated his thrifty habit.<br><br>As for ZaiZai, he came from a divorced family. Ken's family was already in some mess when he was brought to Singapore, that's why he was so rebellious in his teenage years. As for Vanness, his family was quite well-to-do when he was young, but heard that his family had started to face some financial problems of late as well.<br><br>Everyone has a sad story, just that it was never been known to all until they became big.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jerry really quite poor thing...and everyone thinks the f4 guys earn a lot.  I don't think so.  If they really earned 1 billion Taiwan yuan, why would Jerry still be riding a 50cc motorcycle around?  heard that the fridge in his house is 25 years old...older than him.  And his sister even got electrocuted once because the fridge was faulty and the family had no money to replace it.  There's this big hole in his bedroom caused by the earthquake in his old house too...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think some people think he is the least cute in the group, and that he is too act seh.

But like said, his popularity is not exactly the highest among the 4, so it is more difficult for him to really stand out.<br><br>Btw, I did not watch Peach Girl, coz I simply dislike Wu Chen Jun. Feel she damn act innocent, and can't really act at all (well, except for acting innocent of course lah). But I guess people need to give Jackie Chan's taste some face eh? Afterall, she was discovered by Jackie Chan and was in one of his movies, which I can't remember. After that, her career did not take off, and she ended up acting in some B or even C-grade movies, and of course not forgetting her stripping in certain shows. But still, she still did not manage to strike big like others who had stripped, eg. Shu Qi.<br><br>*Shrugs*</div>
