            <div class='col-md body'>If any A*Mei fans among you missed her performance at Junction 8 on Sat, do make sure you dun miss her again at the Heeren today at 2.30pm. She was at her scintillating best... teasing the audience with her endearing sense of humour and even flirted mercilessly with a member of the audience whom she invited onstage when she sang Nu Ren Shuo... lucky fellow! She performed six songs in all.... not a  single note was out of place.<br><br>With new "tian hou"s coming into the scene, some may think she's already passe.... but in my book, she's still reigns supreme  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Ah Mei was nearing the dead-end point in the career with her previous few albums at Forward Music.  The reports about her and Brian certainly did not help.<br><br>The album Truth...well...u can't find the same old Ah Mei in Yuan Li Ni She Me Dou Bu Xiang Yao...Ting Hai...with her raspiness...but certainly the ballads in this album touches me...even the fast songs...not bad...ah mei even tried her hand at band sound and folk pop...This album may not be her best (if u compare to earlier ones)...but the ah mei we know is finally back!!!  Maybe becoz of her relationship with bryan...tatz why...all the songs seem quite relevant to her...esp the ballads...<br><br>Nevertheless...all the other tian hou like faye or coco stage presence can't be compared to Ah Mei...yah...ah mei might have been overtaken by a certain Sun...but she still reigns supreme...she has more stage presence than Sun anywhere anytime.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, she did lose it for a while, and that ban in China also hurt her career somewhat.<br><br>I agree that Truth is not her best work, but it marked a successful comeback from a rejuvenated A*Mei. She poured her heart and soul into the ballads in Truth (no doubt from nursing a broken heart...sigh) and it really showed.<br><br>Every tian hou has her moment of glory, so even though she may have been surpassed by other tian hou, they in turn will be surpassed by someone else.... But I'm certain that 20, 30 years from now, my  A*Mei cds will still occupy a place in my collection of all-time favourites  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Btw, she will be interviewed by Huishi from 93.3fm in the program Tonight in Person on Channel News Asia. The interview was recorded today and should be telecast over CNA pretty soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, Stef and f4 cannot hold a candle to A*Mei lah! Even the more seasoned artistes like Sammi and Coco cannot match her in terms of dynamism and audience rapport.<br><br>There're very few singers whom I'm willing to pay top dollar to see perform... A*Mei is definitely in that "elite" group!<br><br>Would you mind giving a more detailed account of that gig at MediaCorp?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The concert started off with Liao Bu Qi and Ji De...the fans were wild...screaming and shouting ah mei...<br><br>It was not very hot yet...until the 3rd segment...when she did an unplugged segment...belting out familiar hits like Ku Bu Chu Lai, Jie Tuo, Yuan Lai Ni She Me Dou Bu Xiang Yao...but the whole scene started getting high when she started singing jie mei and qian shou...the whole audience came alive!!!<br><br>Cool eh!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just heard A*Mei on 93.3.... how her nickname Katsu, the lyricist of Gan Ying, came about. The nickname was given by her parents when she was very young... Katsu means shengli (success) and she was given this name becos even as a young child, she wanted to do well in everything.... admirable!<br><br>A*mei will also be Lee Hom's special guest at his HK concert next minth... what a treat!<br><br>Zhen Shi finally made it to no. 1 on the 933 long hu bang... after nine weeks. Quite a slow climb. Did Ji De ever enter the 933 top 20 at all??<br><br>Get ready for SYZ's domination of the charts in the coming weeks. Gan Lan Shu already made it to no. 15 and 5 respectively on the 933 and regional (Taiwan, HK, China, Sg, Msia combined)charts .... this gerl is hot!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ji De never entered the charts at all...anyway she has 4 songs which entered the charts...but the first 2 did not do too well...but zhen shi would out-perform Gan Ying...actually zhen shi was dropping but when news of ah mei coming...fwah...<br><br>Jeff Chang song is dropping at an alarming rate...hasn't even raked it 100 points yet.<br><br>Btw Gan Lan Shu is no 16 not 15 on 93.3fm charts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unbelievable! I thought Ji De was the audience favorite at her performances... it's undoubtedly the standout track from the album. Well at least it's no. 6 in the regional charts, one spot behind Gan Lan Shu (which really pales in comparison to this wonderful ballad). As a lyricist yourself, Zilchster, how do you rate her maiden effort as a lyricist on Gan Ying?<br><br>I think Jeff Chang is lucky to have any songs from his latest album in the charts at all.... not that impressive compared to his previous ones. Then again he does have a lot of faithful fans here in Sg.<br><br>thanks for pointing out the error on Gan Lan Shu.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I was a bit puzzled how A*Mei ended up as Lee Hom's guest as they're not from the same record label. Then recall she had recorded a song written by him.... so maybe she's returning him the "favor" ? Have they collaborated in other ways before?<br><br>Sandy's upcoming visit to Sg should bolster the sales of Truly, like what it did to Truth. I think Zhi Fei Ji is not the album's best track... there're other better tracks.<br><br>Back to the 933 charts... nice to see Chiang Mei Chi's song inching its way into the top 10. Hopefully can make it to top 5? Btw, what has happened to Lin Fan? She seems to have disappeared from the radar screen... has she resumed her studies? These two young ladies have very solid vocals, but sadly under-appreciated.</div>
