            <div class='col-md body'>1. Yes, I think the 1st album is worth buying. Packaging may not be as 'glam', but if you really like their songs, these all won't matter abit  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This debut album is Dreamz FM at their "rawest". From that album, you can have a glimpse of what they were like during their ming ge can ting days. There are quite a few gems in the album, eg. Chu Le Ai Qing, Baby Come Back.<br><br>Some have commented that their 2nd album is the "weakest", so if you think it is good, then what more the 1st? Actually, their "weak" works are still far better than some artiste's supposedly "credible" albums.<br><br>2. I also sent my form last week. From previous Hype events, they always send you the tix last minute, so I guess you have to be patient? I think all their fans should be able to get tix to watch them perform...they almost never disappoint their fans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> AND! You gotta to see them live to know how GOOD they are!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheerios<br>fellow Dreamz FM fan</div>

But dun have to feel bad lah about not liking Stella's music. Support not for support's sake, but becos the quality of the music is worth supporting.

            <div class='col-md body'>Baby Come Back in the 1st album is the guitar version, which is much more simple and down to earth. The one in the 2nd album is the "rock" version.

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree wif hajime...if u love the 2nd album..den its highly recommended tat u get the 1st one too...and if i dun rem wrongly..this is e onli album where u can find the individual solo from each of the 3 of them...other den after which the lead vocal tend to be yixin most of the time...<br>guess e 1st album is more of taiwanese style as wat they have in mind at tt time is to go into the tw market b4 comin bk to sg...and becos of the bonding wif the rec co. over there..they nid to cater to the producer nids too...<br><br>guess dfm are slowly trying to figure out wat songs suit their style and this can be heard in e 2nd and 3rd album...a more mature kinda dfm ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>in all..i feel they are realli a great group worth our support..shldnt let great music go to lost eh ?<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŽÃ’Â½Â«Ã”ÃšÃƒÂ£ÃƒÂ£ÃˆÃ‹ÂºÂ£Ã–Ã�Ã‘Â°Â·ÃƒÃŽÃ’Ã‰ÃºÃƒÃ¼ÃŽÂ¨Ã’Â»Ã–Â®Ã�Ã©Â»ÃªÂ°Ã©Ã‚Ã‚Â¡Â£Â¡Â£ÂµÃƒÃ–Â®Â£Â¬ÃŽÃ’Ã�Ã’Â£Â»Â²Â»ÂµÃƒÂ£Â¬ÃŽÃ’ÃƒÃ¼Â¡Â£Â¡Â£Â¡Â£</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>relative to???<br><br>Actually, Singaporeans are best at following fads -- "I listen to what other people are listening to" that kinda pattern. But, even if singaporeans are that tone-deaf, that does not mean that good music should stop  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dreamz FM may not have alot of followers, but as long as can REALISE (shou hu xing hehe) their music dreamz and do something they like, why not?<br><br>Generally, most people will prefer mainstream and popular stuff than obscure or alternative stuff. Just that the population of Singapore is very small, which makes this even more obvious. I personally like Huang Da Wei  alot, but how many Singaporeans, or even Taiwanese like his music? Even most Taiwanese themselves also prefer mainstream pop too, just that they have more options to choose from other than mainstream pop, eg. tribal-influenced compositions.<br><br>Back to Dreamz FM. DFM kind of music is not only refreshing to Singaporeans, but most probably to Taiwanese as well. Their voices are clean, but not in Wu Ying Liang Pin's way. 3 choir-kind, clear-crystal voices blending well together to produce a single sound which is more rich and "multi-layered". However, if you listen closely, you can also recognise the individual voice. To me, that is part of the uniqueness of their collaboration. They sound so harmonious together, but yet each voice can still be distinctive on its own.<br><br>I know some people have said that there is no way Dreamz FM can make it. But I guess that they will put in their best efforts to continue churning out good music as long as there are still some appreciative ears.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree...at first when i first started listening to their music, i couldn't really differentiate who was singing which part but then you'll soon realise (haha-no pun intended-again) that they have very different voices... cavin has the lowest voice and even though jim and ric's voices are high there is this quality that differentiates them... (you all know what i mean right?)<br><br>i won't speak for all singaporean teens but my surrounding friends, they don't really listen to dfm at all... i bet the only thing they know about dfm is buzhide... which is sad...but i've been like telling all my friends to just listen to their album... just listen.. so i lent my dfm 2nd album to my friend... and guess what? i just found out that day that she had bought the cd after the listen.... i was really glad after that..... i guess the problem with the rest of them is that they just do not keep an open mind... i mean to them, perhaps foreign artists are more popular so why not stick to them?... the way i say it, if your mind is already closed to the option of listening to a certain kind of music, then no matter how good it is, you'll still not be moved...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah.. it's cool to see ppl so appreciating good and quality works...<br>I too, love Dreamz Fm's songs... if i can turn back the clock, i'd love to recognize them since their min ge can ting time... where i can see how they start off and advance till now...<br>I've read alot from this forum regarding teens' taste on supporting those that are popular... I think you all are pretty correct, it's more of a reason becoz they haven't really found their own music... their own kind of music that they'll love... so that's y that follow...<br>Somehow, i've been searching for mine, till i heard their 3rd album... (planned to get the 1st two... den saw wat u all say... Confirm going to buy tomolo) and went for their concert, den i realise that THEY are the one...<br>Yes.. their popularity aren't very high... but all of us can actually witness how their support grows after producing one album after another? More and more ppl will recognize them in time... appreciating and showing support for them. As time changes, ppl's mentality will change... ppl will mature... so i have faith in Dreamz FM coz they'll definitely be able to touch more and more ppl with their works...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, the concert was really great right? as i was telling my frens, i can't even say the concert was worth my $$ cos i didn't even pay and $$. i feel that the effort and material they sang far surpassed that of a free concert... hope they have another one soon... i don't mind paying for it..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Would u pay $120 to watch Dreamz FM in concert, supposingly for the same concert at Downtown East?  Remember no dancing, no special guest (cai lilian doesn't count), no costume changes, no throwing of posters...hmmz...<br><br>Do u tink they could feel the whole Singapore indoor stadium?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Paying for a concert does not mean it has to be a big scale affair a la the megastar style in Indoor Stadium with tix priced at $100+. It can be a smaller showcase/concert in places like...Suntec? Singapore Hit Awards was held there anyway, and so is the upcoming F4 concert (though I think given the small venue, $120 for a F4 concert seat is pretty ex).<br><br>Also, I realise they usually perform better outdoor than indoor, probably because of their stage presence is more bubbly and outdoorsy rather than glam.<br><br>Anyway, for Dreamz FM's appeal and market, the Downtown East concert was already considered a pretty big event. I don't even remember Tanya having the same kind of concert? And the response, to be frank, was far better than most of us had expected.<br><br>I guess with such good response, there is always a possibility that another concert of a similar scale can be staged again?<br><br>Let's cross our fingers...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hrmm, i won't pay 120 bucks for any concert man... half of it will still be reasonable. I think everyone of us can judge which concert to pay and go is worth our money. in fact for the Dreamz Fm's first concert at downtown east, i won't mind paying a fifty bucks for it... even if it's an outdoor, i was prepared to go and listen and appreciate some really solid 'live' music by them... so why not? Somehow, i believe Dreamz FM will do better in an outdoor area, than a rules-restricted Indoor Stadium. We can run about, stand and scream... which IS dun allow.. In fact for this time round, everybody's seat, can get a good view of the stage. Not like in IS... ppl pay slightly lesser... gets the back back back seat... the singer on stage, will be no bigger than our thumb nail... yeah? Cheerz!</div>
