              <p>hi everybody~ </p>
              <p>honestly, i haven been tuning in on sat nights ever since jieqi stopped hosting..</p>
              <p>Jun Song, u always call in 933 de hor.. find chances to feedback to Hui Shi lo.. otherwise, let's write in our petition. </p>
              <p>FYI, jieqi is not hosting at any other radio station now.  Think he's busy with the &lt;i-weekly&gt; promotions..</p>
              <p>do support the new &lt;i-weekly&gt; ya.. it's more interesting and informative now.. I'm going to send in my subscription for 1 year issues today.. hee..</p>

              <p>Hi all .....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wow~!..... a blink of eyes..... a lot of things have happen..... i didn't know about no sat nite programme until today.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is really sad to know that we can't get to listen to Jieqi hosting radio programme anymore now .....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are so many thoughts and feeling that rush to my brain now .....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. wonder how i manage to find this thread from the beginning. i only recall i like Jieqi hosting radio programme all along.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and while i was away studying overseas, i tune to the internet radio one day i found that Jieqi will as regular as possible, host the sat last night slot.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since then i try to tune often ..... and trying to email Jieqi to share that how his voice, thoughts and choice of songs help to relief my homesickness .....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>while searching online, i come across this thread and found u all nice ppl who share a common interest - to tune into Jieqi programme....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>2. remembering that Jieqi predicted that I will not be tuning into his programme as frequent when i return to sg, I was confident to tell him that it would not be the case.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, Jieqi was right..... only when i try to tune into 933 tonight as 3 years since i am back, i came to realise Jieqi has stopped hosting about 6 months ago......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. i guess this issue just reassure my believe of life is unpredictable..... you never know when life, in this case is programme, will end. (Jieqi, pardon me, i do not meant to make this post to sound like you just die or something. it is just a stop of programme but i just want to relate to all, pls treasure the ppl and things you love becoz you will never know when the ppl or things will be taken away from you)</p>

              <p>4. actually, i am very depress tonight and thought of seeking refugee in Jieqi and his programme...... but too bad ..... just like to blah / whin a bit about my life......</p>

              <p>3 years after stepping into the working society..... i am still so lost of about my direction and make a mess of my life..... trying to be positive and etc ..... but to find that this is me ..... introvent, soft spoken and a thinker by nature..... yet mistaken by the world that i am soft or incompetent......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>life is so different in school and work (aka society)..... society is so much complicated with mix signals and full of ppl with private agendas...... easily solved issues becomes complicated - straight forward solution cannot be used due to politics.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>useful and practical things learn in school becomes theory and impractical when it comes to society..... it really dishearten me ......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dreams and hopes that i once carried when i just graduated slowly distant and vanished...... tried to be positve and set short term goals but my face cannot hide my disappointment and lost</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>gradually..... i lost hopes..... life becomes monotonous..... and i feel i like a zoombie..... using loud rock music and alcohol to numb my pain..... one thing for sure - i won't give up my life becoz i will disappoint my family members and i don't think i have courage yet</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why am i so sure ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>recently, there was a young girl (about 24 years old) commited suicide at the block where i am staying..... i feel sad for her but at the same time respect the courage she had..... i can't help but to think why she chose to commit suicide..... if you have commited mistakes in your life, why not use the courage you have to kill yourself to live up to the mistake you have done and try to make the best out of your life ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>althought she might live a perfect, wonderful or beautiful life if she had chosen to live on, but she might be able to correct certain mistake she made. if you feel your life is at its worst, nothing else will go wrong. live on, face it, correct it, life might be better after that.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after reflecting why the girl should live on..... i really wonder ??? what is the really reason that i keep on living ??? is it i:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a. really do not want to disappoint my family members?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b. still carry some hope that things might turn for the better even i feel hopeless?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c. or simply i have no courage to end my life ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>d. what else ???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alright ...... i guess i have whin enough..... hope i will feel better after whinning and a good night sleep..... usually that is the case. hope i would end up like the girl.... ultimately, she killed herself in the morning.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>good luck to all you guys ...... don't be like me ...... lost and a loser</p>

              <p>dreams and hopes that i once carried when i just graduated
                  slowly distant and vanished...... tried to be positve and set short
                  term goals but my face cannot hide my disappointment and lost</p>
              <p>gradually..... i lost hopes..... life becomes monotonous.....
                  and i feel i like a zoombie..... using loud rock music and alcohol
                  to numb my pain..... one thing for sure - i won't give up my life
                  becoz i will disappoint my family members and i don't think i have
                  courage yet</p>
              <p>why am i so sure ???</p>
              <p>recently, there was a young girl (about 24 years old) commited
                  suicide at the block where i am staying..... i feel sad for her but
                  at the same time respect the courage she had..... i can't help but
                  to think why she chose to commit suicide..... if you have commited
                  mistakes in your life, why not use the courage you have to kill
                  yourself to live up to the mistake you have done and try to make
                  the best out of your life ???</p>
              <p>althought she might live a perfect, wonderful or beautiful life
                  if she had chosen to live on, but she might be able to correct
                  certain mistake she made. if you feel your life is at its worst,
                  nothing else will go wrong. live on, face it, correct it, life
                  might be better after that.......</p>
              <p>after reflecting why the girl should live on..... i really
                  wonder ??? what is the really reason that i keep on living ??? is
                  it i:</p>
              <p>a. really do not want to disappoint my family members?</p>
              <p>b. still carry some hope that things might turn for the better
                  even i feel hopeless?</p>
              <p>c. or simply i have no courage to end my life ???</p>
              <p>d. what else ???</p>
              <p>alright ...... i guess i have whin enough..... hope i will feel
                  better after whinning and a good night sleep..... usually that is
                  the case. hope i would end up like the girl.... ultimately, she
                  killed herself in the morning.....</p>
              <p>good luck to all you guys ...... don't be like me ...... lost
                  and a loser</p>

              <p>Hey MilkTooth, fellow Jieqi supporter,</p>
              <p>I happen to think of Jieqi and therefore visit this thread, not sure when you'll visit this thread again. I share the some of the sentiments that you have. I have been working for the past 4 years plus and has totally no direction as well. So for one, you're not alone, and not a lone loser for that. :P</p>
              <p>Both committing suicide and living on with all the shit need courage, just a different kind. Many years back, I considered jumping off a building as an option for committing suicide but after I tried canyon swinging (something akin to bungee jumping), I concluded that I do not have the courage to jump off a building. Or maybe because things are still bearable. Who knows what will happen when the wrong neuron is fired? If you are close to your family, you won't want to make their hearts ache by ending your life either.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, I am not feeling the best either. I contribute to the dreadful PMS so I hope the depression will pass in time and stay away for a month at least.</p>
              <p>Anyhow, let's cheer up somehow, seriously no one can help us if we decide to just wallow in misery. The most others can do is to hear us whine and maybe offer some words of é£Žå‡‰è¯� (see above)ã€‚If you need some more é£Žå‡‰è¯�ï¼Œemail me (my nick + @gmail.com)</p>

              <p>This may sound crazy... but maybe we can get Jieqi to use Twitter or some public chat place to do a program?</p>
              <p>He just twitter or type the songs he want to play and we look for it ourselves...</p>
              <p>I wonder if there is a free online "run your own Internet radio station website" where people can sign up, sign in, select songs and subscribers can "tune" in. I think there might be a viable business model to it... call it "yousong" or "youradiostation" if you like..</p>
              <p>It's probably too much to ask of him... I think he's been great doing it all these years.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I googled it and it seems it is quite possible:</p>

              <p>and there's more...</p>
              <p>Jieqi will be doing us a big favour if he actually pull this one off... I'm sure Milktooth will agree.</p>

              <p>Surprise to see Part 3 of this thread. I'm from long long time ago.</p>
              <p>Haven't been tuning to JQ's programme for the longest time... for various reasons. Finally, due to some changes in my life, I'm at home, mom happening to be tuning in to 933... heard a voice, don't think it's JQ...(that was before midnight)... but when midnight came, I heard the song “æˆ‘åˆ°åº•ç–�å¿½äº†ä½ ï¼Ÿä¹ˆ”and I thought JQ was on air... then all the nice songs...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so sad to read here that they have stop having hosts for Sat nite... so sad it's not JQ.</p>

              <p>It's sad that it may be a while before we get to hear JQ on air on Saturday nights, if ever at all. I seek solace in the fact that I've always cherished every session I have with him on air. And some times that is all that matters...</p>

              <p>goodness. Time flies.</p>
              <p>I was recalling those days when I would faithfully tune in to JQ's programme wherever I was between 4-6pm, desperately trying to call through the hotline, succeeding for a few times. I even remember calling through while I was on a bus...</p>
              <p>Time flies... when JQ switched to Saturday nights, I would still faithfully listen in, and try not to fall asleep before the programme is over... The last song will be Eason's å…¨ä¸–ç•Œå¤±çœ  ...</p>
              <p>Then my life changed... some other priorities took over... despite BBB's sms, didn't tune in...</p>
              <p>And my life changed again... last Saturday, that farmiliar feeling came back... thought can go back to those day... even had the impulse to get a iPod Nano... to listen to radio...</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I forgot about this thread until I was listening to å¼ å­¦å�‹'s ã€Šä»–æ�¥å�¬æˆ‘çš„æ¼”å”±ä¼šã€‹ï¼Œ so I decided to pop in to say hi (not that I do this frequently though).</p>
              <p>Shervon &gt; yes, I was always mesmerized by the songs played during his evening slots, although I never had the stamina to fully listen to his night programme.</p>
              <p>It's sad to see that there isn't any radio programmes that would play the type of songs that JQ plays. For me, I've resigned to that, and have relied on my own (limited) collection of songs to get past the weekends.ã€€On a serious note, would anyone have audio streams of his past programmes? If it doesn't violate any piracy laws, would love to get my hands on these copies.</p>
              <p>Nothing stays the same, but there's still a part of me that hopes to listen to JQ's voice on air again, someday...</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I've stopped checking this forum since JQ stopped hosting. guess its almost a year already. Tiime realli flies.</p>
              <p>I was searching this forum for the youtube videos on Pastor Rony Tan's ridicule on Buddhism, and decided to pop by this forum. And to my surprise, there are so many new posts!</p>
              <p>For me, like is as per normal. In london studying. In my second year, and in my second last year. Im sort of looking forward to going back singapore, back to the land of familiarity. But yet, like what Milktooth, that complications arise when u step out into the society. Right now, im onlyy trying my best to enjoy every single bit of my remaining youth and student life left before i officially start work.</p>
              <p>I guess life is tough, because this is life.</p>
              <p>Prob we can organise a karaok outing! it seems strange that on this forum we seem too know a bit about everyone, but we dont exactly how they look like. But it was, is, and will still be, a common interest and tuning in to JQ's programme which keeps us together.</p>
              <p>All the best in whatever we do, and rber to seize the day :)</p>
