            <div class='col-md body'>Yah, not much news about elva recently, except for some bad rumours. Elva also seldom take part in any music awards last year and just won a few awards ( compare to Yanzi who got many awards last year ). So hopefully this new album will have a better result than her previous one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, what type of new image and songs do you all hope to be in this new album?<br><br>For me,<br><br>Image: Still prefer elva's new image to be like her first or second album rather than her third one. I think elva looks better without 'that much of make up'.<br><br>Songs: Really hope that the new zhu2 da3 ge1 and most songs in the new album will be like zhui4 sou2 xi4 de mo4 sheng1 ren2, chuang1 wai4 de tian1 qi4 or qiang2 wei1. Like these songs very much!  [So overall I would say that her third album is a bit disappointed to me ( perhaps some elva's fans may like it very much ) and to be frank, I actually watched her concert vcd (come together with the album) more frequent than listen to the actual new songs in the album. :p]<br><br>Anyway, 10 months to release a new album is indeed slow. However I think the preparation for her English album also took her some time ( Qiang Wei to Ming Tian is a bit faster, took about 8 months).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How many awards did Elva win...i think less than about 5 right?<br><br>She's been dogged by some bad publicity...even her english album did not seem to make a big splash or whatever...<br><br>Ming Tian's sales figure seem to be a bit lower.<br><br>Hope 2002 would be a better year for her.<br><br>To confess, i am beginning to forget about her...totally no news...hope she can do a whirlwind promotion of asia...let everyone know that elva is comparable to yanzi...and i hope she would be able to start her world-concert soon...that would defnitely boost her REN QI.<br><br>Well...let's hope that she would stop screaming so much (did that a lot in her ming tian album)...be able to do some good numbers like MI MI, MING TIAN, LET IT GO...that kinda numbers...and of course ktv friendly hits like zui shu xi de mo sheng ren...etc...<br><br>And yah...hope jay would finish writing the song for elva...<br><br>And to all elva fans...remember to vote for Elva song in the charts in 93.3, 88.3 and 100.3...and let us all try to persuade emi to bring elva to SINGAPORE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Have you all ever wondered why Elva won so few awards despite her popularity? That's because she is under Virgin. Same goes for Hou Xiang Ting and Jiang Mei Qi...<br><br>Yao Qian stresses that he does not want his artistes to be unduly affected emotionally by the pressures of chasing after awards, hence he has made it a point not to nominate his artistes for many awards contests.<br><br>But I guess in the realistic world where everything calls for marketing and promotion, awards is one way to prove that you are a highly marketable commodity and that you can bring in money for your company. Wonder when will Yao Qian finally relent...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...surprise surprise...Yao Qian has finally relented...he has signed up his Virgin and EMI singers for the Taiwan Golden Melody awards.<br><br>But the chances of them getting nominated is really slim...I am an Elva fan...but sad to say...i can't find any really memorable pieces in her ming tian album that will make her stand out!<br><br>I can expect a nominations from best female vocalist category...Sun Yanzi, Ah Mei and Faye Wong...other shoo-ins might include na ying, shunza, yang naiwen...<br><br>Anyone has any others in mind?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about Sandy Lam? Her album Truly is certainly much better than Na Ying's Angel. But this will be Stef Sun's year... after winning the best newcomer award last year, she's likely to grab the female vocalist award. With  330,000 copies of Kite sold last year, it's hard for the judges to ignore that, even though album sales is not a judging criterion. But personally, I feel her vocals are not in the same class as Faye, A*Mei and Sandy.<br><br>Best male vocalist award is likely to go to Jay Chou. But I feel Eason Chan has a better set of vocals than him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure about world tour concert. But I heard that elva will be having an Asia tour concert this year. Anyway there is still no confirmation from EMI. Besides that , there are also news saying that Elva will be acting in Hong Kong movies this year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yah, seldom hear about elva's news recently.<br>For Elva's fans who keen to know more news about Elva, I think it's better to visit some of her Taiwanese fans' discussion board to be more updated on news about Elva. This one is quite good but you must have Chinese Wordstar first( is this the name for the programme which enable us to read Chinese word on computer?) . Everything is in Mandarin.<br>ELVA GLOBAL FANS CLUB DISCUSSION BOARD  <a href="http://tw.club.yahoo.com/msg/msgr?cid=elvanet&amp;rand=97306087396135417" rel="nofollow">http://tw.club.yahoo.com/msg/msgr?cid=elvanet&amp;rand=97306087396135417</a><br>Elva also has a Singapore fan's club and its website is all written in English. Quite good too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyone here bought Shunza's new album? Elva and Shunza sang a duet in this album and the song's name is AND I KNOW, if I'm not mistaken. Anyone has listened to it? Is it nice?<br><br>Jay is writting songs for Elva?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Wow, I seem to be asking too many questions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>SORRY!!!<br><br>About the signing up for awards,<br>Besides avoiding  too much pressure on the singers, also heard someone saying that the company is trying to avoid its singers' album from too much of piracy. (perhaps the award winning songs may be more targetted by those syndicates.) Anyway, happy to know that EMI has finally changed its mind.It's ok if fail to win award this time. At least it's a good starting for all the singers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay...let me write some additional info...<br><br>Eason Chan's album is a critical hit in 2001...so i can say he is quite a shoo-in for best make vocalist...Jay would be in too...but dun forget about I've been nominated so many times but lose out every year, and this year i have a hit with Qing Fei De Yi...Harlem Yu...Maybe other contenders...Jacky Cheung, William So...really dun really tink too much of them lar.<br><br>Group category...Jin Xiu...Tension...i tink they have a separate category for bands and groups...do u tink we can see WeWe and F4...if F4 is not nominated...do u tink their fans would be disappointed?  My eyes would drop if they get in!!!<br><br>Females...shouldn't it be time to give Faye and Ah Mei their dues...yanzi is on a roll...Sandy Lam...the taiwanese dun seem to warm up to her...her album have mixed reviews...but she is one of the better ones i heard...mainstream pop...<br><br>Read some article...jay has sort of debts...song debts...for elva and for jordan chan...<br><br>Have not bought shunza's album...hope to get it soon...generally the ballads on the album are nice...Elva's duet with Shunza is great...btw...Elva's newest album will feature a Shunza's composition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Harry:</div><div class="quote_body">Yah, not much news about elva recently, except for some bad rumours. Elva also seldom take part in any music awards last year and just won a few awards ( compare to Yanzi who got many awards last year ). So hopefully this new album will have a better result than her previous one.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, what type of new image and songs do you all hope to be in this new album?<br><br>For me,<br><br>Image: Still prefer elva's new image to be like her first or second album rather than her third one. I think elva looks better without 'that much of make up'.<br><br>Songs: Really hope that the new zhu2 da3 ge1 and most songs in the new album will be like zhui4 sou2 xi4 de mo4 sheng1 ren2, chuang1 wai4 de tian1 qi4 or qiang2 wei1. Like these songs very much!  [So overall I would say that her third album is a bit disappointed to me ( perhaps some elva's fans may like it very much ) and to be frank, I actually watched her concert vcd (come together with the album) more frequent than listen to the actual new songs in the album.  :p]<br><br>Anyway, 10 months to release a new album is indeed slow. However I think the preparation for her English album also took her some time ( Qiang Wei to Ming Tian is a bit faster, took about 8 months). </div></blockquote>You might wanna take a lot at <a href="http://elva.yes520.net/board/2/index.asp?page=1&amp;ADMIN=1" rel="nofollow">http://elva.yes520.net/board/2/index.asp?page=1&amp;ADMIN=1</a>  .. a lot of news can be found at the forum there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
