            <div class='col-md body'>The McDonald's incident happened because Elva's record company cashed in on the collaboration in an unappropriate manner. It announced the deal and released the song before McDonald's did, which incurred the wrath of the American fast-food giant.<br><br>Since McDonald's was paying the money, they would naturally want to release the news on their front first before anyone else, and Elva's record company spoilt it totally. According to McDonald's, they had to replace Elva because they could not have people "start breaking rules" and after that evolving into a norm of "xian zhan hou zou". Due to principles and image problem, they had to "regretfully" replace Elva with Yanzi.<br><br>The record company did not dare to complain, as they were the ones who breached the trust in them, but Elva was reportedly very upset over it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Review of Elva's album<br><br>ELVA HSIAO'S 4U<br><br>After a long 10 months, Elva is finally back with her long awaited 4th album.<br><br>Four You + For You + 4 You = 4 U.<br><br>This album strives to give us 4 sides of Elva...white, red, blue...hehe...forgot about the last...<br><br>Anyway...image wise, yes, she decides to return to a simple image.<br><br>Yes, she has been dropped by Mcdonalds from singing the advertisement song...and yanzi is taking over...but heck...let's ignore that to focus more on Elva's music.<br><br>In this album, Elva has sort of dropped quite a bit of R&amp;B for some refreshing change of songs.  In fact, she is able to find her own voice and walk out of Coco Lee's shadow...<br><br>She has taken vocal lessons and yes, her techniques and voice have improve tremendously.<br><br>Keeping Jim Lee, Jae Chong and Chen Wei and adding Chen Zihong as producers in addition to the wonderful lyrics by Lin Xi and Yao Qian, this is definitely a good buy album.<br><br>Now let me recommend some songs from this album.<br><br>Track No 3 WO XI HUAN NI KUAI LE<br><br>Lyrics by Yao Qian and composed by Chen Wei.  This song's MTV is way cool, music wise, it's very refreshing, and unique...this is a feel good song in this kinda turbulent days...find that Elva's singing is improving, seen from this song.<br><br>Track 4 Kuai Ge<br><br>Lyrics by lyrics maestro Lin Xi...he compares love to a fast song...very good intelligent lyrics...this song is rather short, and is a cover, it has a spanish-latin arrangement and it would make you wanna dance...Elva keeps her voice a little down to attempt this song...yet another song to prove her vocal prowess.<br><br>Track 6 Zi Ji Ren<br><br>Another lyrics masterpiece by Lin Xi...this song is rather a rock song...although it is not one of the zhu da this is a great song with the lyrics together.<br><br>Track 9 Yin Wei Ni<br><br>This track is composed by Elva herself.  It has the sunny feel of California...it's a medium beat track and it is kinda like cappucino...when it comes to this song, Elva is at her best<br><br>Track 8 Xiao Zhe Ai Ni<br><br>Another piece of work by lyrics maestro Lin Xi...the music is more to zhong ban...in fact this is quite a sad song...that's what i feel...the lyrics can be quite sad...and yes...elva is once again at her best.<br><br>Track 7 Wo Men De Ji Mo<br><br>A slow song combining the finest qualities of Yao Qian and Chen Wei.<br><br>Track 10 Cha Qu.<br><br>A touching song...which uses orchestra music...a slow movin ballad...listen out to the chorus...lyrics by Yao Qian<br><br>Track 2 Wen Zi Ji<br><br>I've seen the MTV.  It's great...composed by Shunza and lyrics by Yao Qian, this is one of the best songs in the album...feel very touched by the song and elva's delivery...a slow ballad...it would easily be one of the best songs in the year.<br><br>Don't miss out on this great album.  Support Elva.<br><br>RATING: B+</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hihi,me first time here. Dun quite understand why Elva is always compared to Stef Sun here. Stef sun's popularity is no big deal. Isn't this always the case where someone always top charts and gain mass popularity and after 5 years , nowwhere to be seen. Common lah. I think ELVA has a unique style of her own. SHe has a good , undisputed style and her vocal have improved remarkably.The most important fact is that she can dance and she can handle different kind of songs. She's great and may all of you keep supporting her.<br><br>------------------<br></div>
