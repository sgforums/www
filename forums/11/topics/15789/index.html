            <div class='col-md body'>I think some people will think this is a boring topic to discuss on, but I am a believer of good music. I personally recommend a few albums which I believe are really good lor. You want to listen or not, up to you.<br><br>1stly, I want to recommend Dreamz FM self-titled album. It is a great local album which I think those who support good music should give it a listen. Jim, Cavin &amp; Ric are not only great singers, their compositions are just as awesome. Besides the radio-friendly "Ni Ai Ta, Wo Ai Ta", other gems on the album such as "Qing Di", "Nan Ban Qiu, Bei Ban Qiu", "Ao Ye", "Cheng Nuo", etc. are really good songs as well.<br><br>2ndly, Panda Xiong's debut album "Ai Qing Duo Nao He". Although this might be an old album, it still remains as one of my personal faves. There are many gems in there which the radio didn't pick up, which was actually a pity. Like "Bai Tou", "Bo Li Wa Wa" &amp; "Ye Ye Ye Ye".<br><br>3rdly, Jeff Chang's "Kuan Rong" album. Almost all the songs were highly recommended. "Bu Hui Shou" is one of the best. It was actually an old song by Su Rui, but later Jeff covered it. Both old &amp; new versions have their own charms.<br><br>Er..well, that is all I can think of at the moment. All the above are purely personal opinions. Perhaps you all can add your fave albums to the list. I would like to know if there are any good albums which have slipped my ears  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Music Rules!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, pple who know me well would know wat i going to intro...keke....<br>for rock fans, i'd highly recommend one of Beyond's old canto album, Â¼Ã–Â»PÂ«Ã£. released in 1993. might be abit difficult to find now. but it's really a rock album. and buy it not only bcoz it's the last album Kakui did before he passed away, but coz of the great songs found in thise album.<br>the fast numbers would appeal mostly to pple who can take rock. some of the songs r kinda alternative. well there is one very cute one, like a rap, tat the last song, ÂµLÂµLÂ¿Ã—<br>i like Paul's Â¦kÂ·Q sounds santanic tho.  :p<br>of coz there is the all time fave Â®Ã¼Ã�Ã¯Â¤Ã‘ÂªÃ…,which is a song Kakui wrote for their band's 10th anniversary.<br>yupz there are other great songs in the album!<br>put simply, i LOVE this WHOLE album.<br><br>Beyond!

My faves Beatles, Pet Shop Boys, Pulp, Blur, Oasis, etc... I recommend PSB "Discography" &amp; "Bilingual". Pulp I recommend "Different Class". Beatles I recommend ALL albums! But their compilations are good enough for an average fan.<br><br>tsk tsk..I wonder if pple noe who I am tokking abt or not <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
