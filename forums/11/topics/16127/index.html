            <div class='col-md body'>Here are snippets of three songs from the album:<br><br>1. Gan Lan Shu <a href="http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/warner/self/yanzi/tree.rm" rel="nofollow">http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/warner/self/yanzi/tree.rm</a><br>I don't have much impression of the original version, so am treating this almost like new. Sounds pleasing enough, even tho I don't particularly like this song.<br><br>2. A*Mei's Yuan Lai Ni She Me Dou Bu Yao <a href="http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/warner/self/yanzi/nothing.rm" rel="nofollow">http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/warner/self/yanzi/nothing.rm</a><br>Still prefer A*mei's version, but hers is not too bad actually.<br><br>3. Tori Amos's Silent All These Years <a href="http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/warner/self/yanzi/silent.rm" rel="nofollow">http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/warner/self/yanzi/silent.rm</a><br>Frankly, I was not hopeful that Yanzi could competently handle this technically demanding song, but her commendable effort took me by surprise. Her version has more orchestral music compared to the piano-based original.<br><br>Appetising enuf to wanna check out the rest of the album, out in stores from 7 Jan.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yanzi is bilingual, but not effectively bilingual. mi was in China holidaying last wk when i saw Stef on tv promoting the Up2U cosmetics &amp; the jiu shi zhe yang mtv...nice nice. Buthen the reporter oso asked her bout her thots on her new album. She replied in chinese...but stammered a few times.<br><br>But i guess her chinese has improved compared to last yr when she was still a newcomer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess being based in Taiwan has certainly helped her to improve on her spoken Mandarin. She's a lot more fluent and articulate in English, so expressing some of her more "complicated" thoughts may still be a bit of a problem.<br><br>Heard her on a phone interview on today's 933FM where she was informed by djs Huishi and Liyi that she was the most popular female artiste on 933 this year (her staggering 900 points broke the record formerly held by Wang Fei!) and two of her songs were placed second and fourth in the Top 10 Songs.... no surprises here<br><br>I thought she spoke quite well, but then again they were the std questions which she has been asked many times before. She was about to talk more about her new album of covers when they brought the interview to an abrupt end... maybe ran out of time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the New Year concert in Taipei telecast live on TVBS last night, she sang five songs from the album. First time I heard the full version but can't say I was particularly impressed. She sang ok in the English numbers but diction-wise, could be better. The only fast number she performed was Venus (sung by 80's girl group Bananarama) and I half expected her to launch into a disco dance.... but her dance movements were rather restrained. Surprisingly for someone so lightweight, her legs seem to be made of lead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .... she's not exactly a natural performer lah. But she only need to smile and the audience simply went wild!<br><br>Die-hard fans will definitely still snap up this album, but unlikely to win new fans with this one.</div>

Sporean artistes are not as cringe-worthy when attempting english songs. But our academic environment puts emphasis on biligualism after all. English and Mandarin (or rather, our mother tongue)  are used often interchangably, and sometimes not in the best of taste.<br>HK and Taiwanese artistes speak predominantly in cantonese/hokkien and mandarin. English probably counts as their third language of sort. Can we really blame them for their 'hopeless' sounding English then? If anything, give them bonus points for trying lah.<br><br>Besides, from the interviews and write-ups, Stefanie and Tanya's lingistic proficiency probably leans towards English.
