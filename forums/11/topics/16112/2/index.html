            <div class='col-md body'>Yanzi has won so many awards already so I think she can afford to lose to this, but of course she won't lose. It's not really a matter of who deserves to win more. Just that it would be a bigger boost to Dreamz if the margin was much closer. Too bad they're not hearthrob material, otherwise they would have a broader fan base.<br><br>You can catch the hour-long Yanzi interview at <a href="http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/MTVChinese/smil/010111.smi" rel="nofollow">http://real2.aboutmedia.com.tw/ramgen/MTVChinese/smil/010111.smi</a><br>Tell me what you think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, all the more she can't lose this awards...would be total losing of face...<br><br>She is no 1 on the rias chart...or at least within the top 5 with album sales...dreamz...sadly to say...so how can sun lose out...<br><br>Yah...i agree abt them not being dashing and swooning enuff...somehow is is quite fair isn't it????  they have good voices...etc etc...<br><br>Anyway a margin of 10% is considered quite good...they should be thankful enuff...considering STELLA should be more pop than dreamz...as well as tanya or kit?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If Mayday wins, will they be able to perform? I thought they have already disbanded for the time  being? And I agree that Jay may just pull of a surprise.<br><br>Yanzi's Kite sales is tops in second half of year? Maybe it's becos it was released earlier than the rest in the list. I'm glad she's doing so well (from a 'nationalistic' point of view) but I'm still a little surprised at how well she's been received in Taiwan. Her vocals are quite unique, but surely not quite up there in the A-list. I think her main selling point is her charm and broad appeal. Her new album "Start" will reportedly have 5 Mandarin songs and 5 English songs sung by other singers. Among them are the evergreen ganlanshu (Fei Xiang has also included this song in his latest album) and songs by Tori Amos and Alanis Morisette. Jacky Cheung's album of English songs was a big flop, but it's unlikely to be the case for her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently they rushed out this album in preparation for her regional concerts next March. So that fans can snap up the new album, learn the songs, and sing along with her at the concert. What I think is that Warner is just cashing in on her red-hot popularity. Even if the album is of mediocre standard, it will probably still see like hot cakes. Not that I'm pre-judging the album.... just that she's on a roll at the moment. Her "real" album comprising original compositions is due only next April.<br><br>I think it's kinda expected that she will do an album of covers at some point, but didn't think it would be this soon in her career.</div>

If they are to compete with Sun Yanzi, definitely they'll be on the losing side.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno abt the competition in SG...but i think Yanzi would probably take the award.<br><br>Actually...it's an honour to be nominated especially for those in Taiwan and Hong Kong...whereby they have many many singers...names like Jolin, Faye, Sandy Lam, Coco Lee are all missing...in fact Elva, Wu Bai, Mayday, Ah Mei and Jay should be congratulated liao...<br><br>Well...has jay caught with ah mei?  Whatever happened to Mayday...Mayday was winning Ah mei...gonna be a tough fight man...but Jay is the IT and GOLDEN boy...hmmmz...Ah Mei is a national treasure...hmmz...tough fight...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha...i've been very actively "promoting"<br>dreamz fm's music to my friends cos i think the problem is they don't get much exposure to it and even if they did the only thing they know is bu zhi de... i must say, although it's an uphill task.. sometimes it works... after i lent my dfm2 cd to my fren she went out to buy it... and when my other fren expressed even the slightest interest, and b4 he could even say "dfm",  i had already dumped the 2nd and 3rd album in his hands... he told later that he went to download almost the whole 1st, 2nd album onto his mp3 player when he first got his mp3 player... and today, am having a family gathering, going to bring along my 2nd and 3rd album for my cousin (who listens only to eng songs).. talked to her about them the other day and she was quite interested... so here i go again... haha.</div>
