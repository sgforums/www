            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone been keeping a watch on the "fight" between the two to represent Spore in the MTVasia awards next Feb?<br>Well,,. there's three other contenders (Stella, Kit and Tanya) but they've fallen way behind. On paper, golden girl Yanzi should come out the runaway winner, but fans of Dreamz are putting up a good "fight". As of now, Dreamz is only about 6 percentage points behind Yanzi.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually no matter who wins oso nvm. Coz I feel that both are equally gd. Dreamz FM have great voices, while Stefanie is popular and she has a unique voice, no doubt she still has room 4 improvement. So long as Stella doesn't win, It's fine with me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Spore fans of Yanzi have summoned the help of her Taiwan fans and this has helped to widen the margin between them now. But I'm still rather surprised that Dreamz came so close at one stage. It's a pity that only one rep is chosen from each country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. there're awards that recognize artistes for their popularity and those that recognize their music. I agree with Zilchster that Dreamz dun care much for any popularity award, but they need to have a fair bit of mass appeal first before any awards come their way.... unless they're sooo super-talented that their music speaks for them.<br><br>I read this interesting quote in Life! today - "Certain bands get far too much attention and get treated as god-like figures. It's just music, pple shld lighten up." (Stereophonics' Kelly Jones on Radiohead). In the fan-driven world of Chinese pop, young and precocious music fans notice the artistes' looks or personalities first before their music... hence the Chinese music industry today is more about style than substance. While veterans like Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng and rookies like F4 and Yanzi are not quite regarded god-like by their fans, they come pretty close to being treated like demi-gods and demi-goddesses  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> With rare exceptions, the popularity awards go to the good-lookers with average vocals while the best artiste awards go to the average-lookers with good vocals. The exception in this case is probably Faye Wong, who has garnered a long string of both types of awards, despite her icy-cold personality, average looks and forthright disdain to "shake hands with strangers" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>Kool...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah, Warner Music certainly has a strong foothold in the Chinese pop market. Was at HMV Heeren today and noticed the demo listening cds of the 3 queens were stacked together - A*mei on top and Sammi at bottom with Yanzi in between.<br><br>I think our Yanzi is more musically talented than her 2 a-jie but she's not so solid performing live.

But now the media is heaping all sorts of "titles" on Yanzi including "guo bao". Dun think Yanzi's likely to disappear that quickly... the Taiwanese are so enamoured with her, well that includes sporeans too. Being based in Taiwan kinda stregthen their claim on her I guess.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think only one vote is allowed from each PC... same like other such questionnaire-related sites where voting from individual PCs can be tracked.<br><br>The Yanzi-Dreamz race would have been a lot closer if they allow only fans from Spore to vote only. I won't be surprised if many of Yanzi's fans from Taiwan voted for her too. Her "win" is a foregone conclusion right from the start.<br><br>Not that I have anything against Yanzi. She's probably a nice person, but after watching her recent hour-long interview on mtvchinese.com, I think success has gone to her head a bit. Or maybe she's just plain tired...<br><br>[This message has been edited by ocean11 (edited 16 December 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What was the interview about?  I am kinda curious to know...<br><br>Well...since the voting is on the website...so i guess it's open to all to vote...they also can't check if u r from sg or from elsewhere...besides we r allowed to vote in taiwan etc...<br><br>But do u tink dreamz fm are more deserving of this award?  Not really lar...and would it be a big embarrassment to Sun if she did not win this one...i dun have anything against dreamz...but popularity stakes?  Still far...if u r talking abt...compositions...and shi li...dreamz fm...definitely is slightly better off...at least sun is improving???<br><br>A sad thing is...HOW COME DREAMZ FM song cannot move into top 10 of yes933...very sad...even if it stays there 2 weeks also good mah...feel upset.</div>
