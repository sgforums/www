            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i'm posting this message just to remind all others out there to remember we still own a homegrown singbird Kit Chan... Please remember her for what she had given out for the Singapore's Entertainment Industry... After 8 long years in this circle, she doesn't have the strength to doll up and the energy to run from places to places to continue her promotions and etc... Don't forget her just because YanZi is hotter in Taiwan. I believe if Kit has the energy like she once had and go all out in promoting her albums and etc... She'll be just as hot as YanZi is. Presently she's just concentrating more on screen in hongkong and Singapore... but still, every song from albums from her are always fresh and pleasent... For the last 933 fm music awards she recieved little cheer and also the same for MTV Asia awards... Even though you may not like her or her songs, please do support her for all her strength and youth she had given to for Singapore in the past... Without her break through, noone would had focus on Singapore for singers...<br><br>------------------<br>fire-boy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmz...I fully agree with what the previous person said.<br><br>Kit may not be as hot and popular as before...her songs are not like Yanzi...but let's not forget her...she was one of the pioneers to bring our music into Taiwan...she also won a Taiwan Golden Melody Award...became the first local singer to stage a full length concert (No, Fann does not count...the backing vocals sing better than Fann)<br><br>Actually...Kit is seemingly more focus in acting now...and probably her business.  After all...how long can u been in the music biz?<br><br>Let's still support her...and yah...mavis hee too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always have high regard for Kit as a singer. She may not have a high profile now, but hey, her new song just made it to the 933 Top 20 today. At least her fans have not forgotten abt her. Go, Kit!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yap... I'm not asking anyone to put in money to vote for her in all the Awards ceremony but just some cheer from everyone will make her happy that she has not been forgotten by us Singaporean. Furthermore, no matter how big she made it outside, she never forgets that she's still a Singapore.<br><br>------------------<br>fire-boy</div>
