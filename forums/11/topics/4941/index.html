Neither does it mean that one does not listen to other music as well. Please do not be so "close- minded". For my case, I do listen to X-japan and Chemistry, though my fave Jap act is Gackt. I also listen to Nirvana and Pink Floyd,  though my faves are Beatles, Pet Shop Boys, Pulp,etc.<br><br>Anyway, what I feel is that people have their own rights to listen to whatever kind of music which befits them, you don't have to condemn people just because they listen to something which you don't like. Of course, I find that those fans who book cabs, cry buckets over idols are damn dumb, but they are not real music fans anyway, so why bother? Not all Chinese music is decent, but I am a Chinese and I grow up with it, so I can relate to Chinese music better, which I feel is the same case for most Chinese music listeners too. And if you are not an avid Chinese music fan, you are not in the position to say that all Chinese music sucks, because you don't know enough of it to condemn it.</div></blockquote>y gakuto? i do agree tht the gakuto period of malice mizer was the best but lately his songs have become more and more ballady.</div>

U must know that play acting is part of the soccer culture....it adds controvesy and favour to the game....
