But what matters the most is that we should all appreciate  all kinds of music. There is no such thing such as lousy music. The most important thing is whether we like it or not. If we do, then good. If we dun, then dun listen to it. It's as simple as that. There is no need for any form of criticism. Look, I think most of us here dun listen to Hide or Mana or all the so called "infamous yet talented" musicians. But do we criticise them or make fun of them, we dun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You fail to realize tht pop music is MANUFACTURED for absorbant brainless fools like you who just take in their boring and cliche formulas over and over again. Too bad for you. you can't even spell jay chou... hahaha. What are you, some geeky kid behind a keyboard? piss off eh... you just look stupid.</div>

Do you know y? They play their instruments well. Unlike david tao, who cannot play his guitar well. f4 and 5566 dun even play instruments. they're just 5 gays thrown together to make MONEY for the record company. Rock is different. Guitarists, drummers, people who actually make music, instead of just doing exactly what the record company wants, thats real music.</div>
