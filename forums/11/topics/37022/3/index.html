LOSER<br>So what if 50,000 fans attend hide's funeral ....  when jay / david tao holds concert , there's more than 50,000 people and they had to pay .... what's the big deal of 50,000<br><br>And let me tell u .... i did try listening to ur so called style of music ... by hide or mana whatever , and the moment i listened to it , i deleted it off my com .... So does that means they sucks ???<br>Music is universal , regardless of language as long as people love and like it , its considered good music ... as for u , i think u are still living in ur own world of music which is like a frog inside a well .... that goes the same for ur friend Rivaldo ...<br>Lastly , let me tell u .... I did not spell jay chow's name wrongly , cause that's his han yu pin yin (chinese) name ... if u dun believe , u can try asking around , i believe a lot of people will know it rather than knowing whu's Hide or Mana ..... SO the next time if u dun noe anything .... just keep ur mouth shut  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>ps: need to run , time to feed my dog ~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahh...talking bout classical music....Zlichster....I agree with U that Mozart, Bach, Chopin are really genius....especially Bach.... Bach is famous for his achievement in his synthesis and advanced development of the primary contrapuntal idiom of the late Baroque, and in the basic tunefulness of his thematic material...and wat can I say bout Beethovan....he was the inventer of mordern music, composing from a "seed" or "germ" idea rather than a full melody and treating rhythm in new ways....but my fav classical musicians are from Russia, Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky....their music are pure gem....I admire Andres Segovia too....he is the god of classical guitar.....the list goes on.....(juz walking down the memory lane.....Classical music.....I really love them when I was a kid.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Now back to rocking!! If U like Classical music, U should like X Japan and Malice Mizer too....Yoshiki, Gackt and Mana.....all of them can easily be exellent classical musicians if they never choose to walk the path of a rocker....Malize mizer is a great classical band!! Darm power! Yoshiki too....he is also a classical musician....listen to Amenthyst and leaving....and he remake the KISS's song Black Diamond into a wonder piece of classical music in KISS tribute album.....not to mention his songs were perform by the London Symphonic Ochestral....and he play with the new york Symphonic Ochestral(SIMPLY the best Ochestral in the world) in X JAPAN last album Dahlia.<br><br>David Tao and Jay can't be compared to any of the above!! They are not great musicians at all....Fernandes produced a line of customized hide guitar in order to commemorate this great guitar player.....I dun think there is any company wanting to produced a line of watever products to commemorate David or Jay....maybe a T shirt to sell to their naive fans. Lastly, if U are a guitar player....try to play David Tao's song and hide's song...U will find that David Tao's music is like kindergarden music compared to hide.<br><br>ps: X Japan's jelousy album sold 1 million++ copies within a few days.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
