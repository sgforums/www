            <div class='col-md body'>I don't care what U say that Sandy is better or whatsoever. I think ur Eng. needs improvement as the word piracy is used for software like CD or CD roms and VCDs but not for personality. Understand the term now? I hope I'm not conducting an English lesson in this forum! Listen up, I have already mentioned so many times what is the trend of youngsters now? they sure go for young singers rather than--- you know what i'm saying as relating to this topic which u are trying 2 make comparisons against--- THINK!!!</div>

I respect the law and U better be careful with ur words cos I think u have failed ur listening skills cos Frankie's song is also so well liked by many pp. in 933. Since so many pp like, she is considered to be a singer who can sing well, I think u are too old fashioned. not like me who is still young!!!</div>

Come on, go get yourself a life.  Don't embarrass yourself with your English.  Gee...you might even fail your English paper.<br><br>In short, the minority like Wang Pei Rong not the majority...so it does not really count.  And yah...can you please type proper English?

The first is enjoyable and the second is soothing and h/w, the second album has shown great improvement! Not only I think U need 2 improve in ur thinking skills, U need 2 improve in ur listening skills juz like me who is so gd. in listening 2 music and I think not only u've ruined the reputation of s'porean singers, u've ruined the reputation of other gd. singers too.
