Wow~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> They're really good~!<br>It all started when I watch their MTV "Shou Hu Xing". Then I began downloading their songs through mIRC. I espacially like "Bu Zhi De".<br>I searched all over the internet to find webpages of dreamzFM, and that's why I found this forum.<br>Can anyone tell me more about them? *How they started *Their biography *etc<br>Hmmmz... I heard(from Yes!93.3) that they are having a free admission concert in December?(as long as you buy their album) Do anyone of you have more information of it?<br>**I wanted to buy their albums(all 3) but after buying "Jolin - Jin Xuan" and other CDs, I've no $ already~!

            <div class='col-md body'>Dreamz FM is a far underrated group in this looks-dominated entertainment circle. Their music also does not follow the trends, eg. they do not sing R&amp;B songs just because it is the "in" thing now. It's more of a "their own feel" thing, ie. "I do what I feel can bring out the best in myself."<br><br>I think the charms in Dreamz FM is that they - being credible song composers and singers - prefer to take you in with their quality compositions and immaculate rendition. They let their music speak on their behalf.<br><br>Do not forget their "live" performances as well. These are definitely not to be missed!!! They have great humour, no pretenses, and also good chemistry amongst themselves. Their on-stage performances and impromptu antics simply bowl you over, and it is a waste that no TV station has yet spotted their potential in hosting programmes, eg. light entertainment or music segments.<br><br>They also have many strings in their bows. Ric is currently co-hosting a morning programme once a week with LiYi on 933. Cavin is involved in the new series of "Gan Gan Zuo Ge Kai Xin Ren". Jim is the most low-key, as he is more involved in producing albums for other artistes. Listen closely to some songs of Fann and Stella, you can hear Jim's voice in the background.<br><br>As for their albums:<br><br>1st album: Has contributions from many local composers, as well as some from overseas eg.<br>Huang Shu Jun, Zheng Hua Juan. Pretty good way to "get to know Dreamz FM".<br>Recommended songs : "Baby Come Back", "Chu Le Ai Qing", "Ao Ye", "Nan Ban Qiu Bei Ban Qiu", "Cheng Nuo".<br><br>2nd album: More experimental than the 1st, include serial tunes, eg. "Ni Zou Ye Hao". May not appeal as much if you are not really into less poppy stuff. Jim's sister Lin Yu Ting made her guest appearance on this album.<br>Recommended songs: "Bu Zhi De", "Deng Zhe Ni Hui Lai", "Ni Zou Ye Hao", "Priceless"<br><br>3rd album: Best of the lot, though the style of their 1st album would be closer to when they 1st started out. Most of the songs leverage on their strengths - their ability to scale the notes and hit the pitches effortlessly.<br>Recommended songs: "7-11 De Ai Lian", "Shou Hu Xing", "Ai Yao Zen Me Jie", "Gan Jue", Stay With U"<br><br>FYI, they also duet with other singers as well. They sang with Tao Zi on "Ai Yo", with A-Mei-Mei "Dong Tian", with Evelyn Tan "Xin Lian Xin", etc.<br><br>Hmm, guess that is about all for now? Quite a bit for you to digest...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dreamz FM music  =  Satisfaction Guaranteed!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(PS: All above comments/recommendations are purely personal opinions)<br><br>[This message has been edited by Hajime (edited 24 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the reason why dreamz fm is not popular becos they are not recognise by the fellow singaporeans, in fact they are really popular in Taiwan. Singaporeans think that the moon outside is brighter.. then what abt local? Since Yanzi can make big in s'pore and singaporean gives her recognition, why not dreamz fm?<br><br>thier songs are much more better than other singers... or even more talented even though that they are normal looking.. although they are not real shuai, but at least they have normal features and look of a singaporean.<br><br>Singapore shld be proud that we have such talents, only that media and singaporeans din give them the support!!! They rep singapore to UN, in fact, more western countries know abt them, cos they were pick by the pple at UN! Why other countries can notice them but not we singaporeans?????<br><br>[This message has been edited by Nameless (edited 26 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess cos for one thing the market in sg is rather small...even if u are popular here,there might be high chance that people overseas dont really know u..thats y local singers will try to make it outside sg like goin taiwan walk one round den come bk..if u are popular over there,usually people here will know about u somehow...and that is oso the reason y quite a no. of singers are trying to 'invade' into the china market too,cos its really BIG!if u are famous there,dun have to do much advertisement man,juz words goin ard is enuff to flood u..<br><br>well,wont say that they are really unrecognized..unless if we are tokin abt award based den maybe...dreamz fm hasnt won any award yet so far..yar its kinda sad but wat to do ?<br>yar , maybe looks plays a part here..if they have features and appearances like F4..we might be able to see bees crowding around them...guess their supporters come mainly from the more mature category of people that wont juz go crazee chasing after idols...<br><br>wont say their kinda music dun suit local taste too..if not buzhide wont get the support of so mani people oredi..and considering tt dfm din really put up much promotions...its oredi a good start for them...yeah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Â§ÃšÂ±NÂ¦bÂ¯Ã­Â¯Ã­Â¤HÂ®Ã¼Â¤Â¤Â´MÂ³XÂ§ÃšÂ°ÃŸÂ¤@Â¤Â§Ã†FÂ»Ã®Â¦Ã±Â«QÂ¡CÂ±oÂ¤Â§Â¡AÂ§ÃšÂ©Â¯Â¡FÂ¤Â£Â±oÂ¡AÂ§ÃšÂ©R</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guang Mang is by William So, remember? William So is a K ge zhi wang, so no way they will let Dreamz FM win in front of him. Sorta "throw-face", if you know what I mean. Of course, being a Singaporean son-in-law does help a little too. You may think I am too extreme in thinking that the Star Awards is that biased, but ALL the artistes not thanking David Gan on stage can't be a coincidence, can it? Esp his name was mentioned almost every year.<br><br>If Singaporeans can't take their kind of music, then I guess many of Faye's or Jay's songs won't hit a chord as well. If "Fu Zao" or "Ren Zhe" were not sung or composed by them, do you think many people will even give a hoot about it? I am just being realistic. Many locals are too "lazy" or afraid to explore the music world out there, they just "play it safe" and support whatever is popular elsewhere, in case they support some other kind of music and get labelled as being weird or having no taste. Peer pressure, groupthink, whatever you wanna call it.<br><br>Don't mind me too much, I am just an extremist giving my one-cent worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a bit puzzled. I've heard all the three albums of Dreamz FM and discovered something. The pitch of their voice of each album is becoming higher and higher.I knew that they are using "xu ying" but....to me, i think that there's no need for all the songs to be like this except for one in the third album.Did u all notice that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello...<br><br>Hmmz, I've not post a message here for very quite a while. Anyway, I've read all your messages and I began to realised that dreamzFM do really have fans. Well, at least dFM has us, this "little" group of fans...<br><br>I really like their way of singing. They use "jia3 ying1" alot, but aren't they using it too often in their songs??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Falsetto sings for one song, ok...sing for 2 songs, still ok...but sing for almost whole album of songs? Not easy lah, even if you have a really good voice. Dreamz FM not Fei Yu Qing, Jeff Chang or Zhang Yu Sheng, they do not have natural high-pitch.<br><br>Hmm, do you all ever wonder why they sing so many "falsetto works" in this album? There were only some smacks of falsetto in their 1st 2 albums...perhaps the success of BuZhiDe triggered some commercial reason for a falsetto-happy album? Of course, the commercial reason can't be DFM...they only sing, they don't have much control in overall direction, especially when it involves music management who may not know music.<br><br>Haha, I wonder if you know what I am babbling about, coz I don't even understand what I am saying myself...</div>
