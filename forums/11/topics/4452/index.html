            <div class='col-md body'>i am not here to creat any trouble but i do feel that the DJs of 933 are "not good" enough. When they talk, they talk well with good mandrain and nice voice and they tend to sound "gan Xing" like the programm at 8 pm, however, i feel the substance is not enough do now give me a feeling " yi Zhen Jian Xue" as in talking round and round the bush without some real main point or give me a feeling to learn something and share with friends cause i don't know how many people feel the same cause if we watch taiwan varierty show, they can say good jokes and when they share a point or a story u feel u learn something and wanted to tell alog of people about it..but too bad the 933 djs don't have such substance when they talk ...maybe its our overall chineses education level in singapore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if the radio people are yi zhen jian xie enough, but your comments are certainly yi qi he cheng  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, it's not difficult to see that a lot of the radio presenters nowadays are going more for exposure &amp; popularity rather than the love for radio. They talk and talk and talk, but nothing fab really comes out. Ends up all the progs become more or less the same - accept call-ins from listeners, read letters from them to fill up the airtime, play games, play songs &amp; adverts...what else?<br><br>In fact, I realise most of them no longer do their homework. They can ask the stupidest questions during interviews with celebrities, and even remember the names of their shows or songs wrongly. This should not even happen if you are a true pro. I feel I am not being over-demanding, coz that is the basic requirement of radio personalities.<br><br>You keep up with times, but you should not forget the basics. Now they don't even read the news, they just get them off from 95.8...my goodness. That was once the basic requirement before you could go on air. I don't know how you can be an all-round radio presenter if you can even do the basics. Asif it is not bad enough to just rely on computer and forget how to operate a manual control panel...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, yeah for the no prargraph, anyway, i agree 101% that our 933 djs are not doing any homeowrk pior to the programm, i rember once when they are to announce the top ten best books seller and when ot come to this famous author, RObert Kiyosaki, the dj can't pronounce and just laugh its way through, its a 933 programm and its what Han guy...anyway, no respect for the author, the listener and not to memtion himself.<br>I remeber when i was young, i would sit by the rediffuison and listen to the programm even if it means that i got give up the sleep, cause i wanted to lsten to their story, their point of view so that i can talk to my friends in school..don't know whaat to gain from these "brain-less" dj nowadays...</div>

I like the music there better...<br><br>Anyway, the only 933 program I tune to is "Qing Chun Niao Wang", weekdays 5-8pm. I find the partnership between LiYi &amp; ZhiYong very vibrant, with some interesting segments like "Niao Wang Da Pian Zi". The other programs can be skipped, except for JieQi's but his is only once a week.<br><br>There is this slot which I can't stand frankly. I know I may get bombarded by her fans, but I can't stand HuiShi. She is already very very passe. Her ex-partner ZiGan has already crossed over to the more appropriate 972 ages ago, but she's still sticking around. Even Dasmond Koh who came in later is opting to leave. When you've stagnated, it's best that you depart gracefully when people remember you for your best, and not until you've long passed your sell-by date.<br><br>Try listen to her program, it's more 972/958 than 933 frankly. Talking about how to wash and iron clothes...huh? Her voice also sounds mechanical since a few years ago. I am still trying to figure our why she is still in 933, though I already have some ideas ...<br><br>And with incompetent DJs like this full-timer who can't even hold down a regular slot (you should know who I am talking about), how is 933 going to maintain its claim of being the most popular station in Singapore is still very much a question.<br><br>My very personal opinions...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well i used to tune in to yes933 too. But now I've switched to ufm1003. It's because i think the programmes there especially junwei's programmes are of more substance. Whenever a singer comes to Singapore to promote his/her album, he does a thorough interview about the whole album unlike other radio stations which just skim through with basic questions. But I like yes933 DJ junxin, at least he is more mature of the lot. chong qing can be funny at times, but he is childish at other times. I guess it's time for yes933 DJs to review their programmes and think of ways to come up with programmes that are of better quality and not just aimed at gaining more popularity. I believe in quality not quantity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sigh*... sounds like all of u r kinda sick of 933... but it doesnt matter. They will improve gradually... they juz need some time. But so far i only find Bukoh Mary is better among the DJs in 933. Hope they could reach the standards of the Taiwan Djs or host of variety progs such as Jacky Wu or harlem... they really hav standards u know??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
