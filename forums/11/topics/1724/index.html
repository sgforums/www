            <div class='col-md body'>There has been many discussion about many singers, they are all, well, nice to read about...<br><br>But, I've not seen discussion about Jolin Tsai. I thought she's quite famous too?Basically, I think that she's quite talented and I'm one of her fans!<br><br>Hmmm, well, I'm just here to start a discussion about her! Ok, remember to post your comments or anything else about her here!<br><br>******<br>Jolin's recent message post @ Jolin Fan Club(Taiwan)<br>*P.S.: Originally in Chinese, but translation NOT by her!<br><br>Dear cutest friends,<br>How have you guys been lately? I am quite occupied by my finalÂ… hope that you and I do can survive!!!<br><br>I had a really great time at mainland last timeÂ… the fans there are pretty passionate, and warm to me, thank them!! Gladly, I will spend more time in mainland during my winter vacation..So please wait for me those in MainlandÂ… and sorry, fans in taiwanÂ… I guess we'll have to wait for a whileÂ… since da-sound hasn't given up the S*IT problemÂ…heheÂ…ya know!!<br><br>if everything goes smoothly, I might have my new album lanched by summer Â… so get ready Â… I think it's time for Jolin's Fans to get crazy as we use to beÂ… don't ever let others look down on our POWERÂ… Here we go.. Jolin's Backup POWER &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>I have plenty of ideas on my new albumÂ… I guess it would be fun to have an album fill with my personal ideasÂ…<br><br>about the MTV christmas partyÂ… the dancing stuff seemd to be surprising or shock to some of my fansÂ…as a matter of fact, I was surprised at first when I learned that sexy moveÂ… yet, I do like to make some changes on my stage performanceÂ…thus, I took it happilyÂ… I would like to say that I just eagerly want the attitude, the eye contact of my stage performace change Â… change into a more mature and firm one, which to a stage--performing artist can't live without.. I guess no one, including myself doesn't enjoy the same old trick at all the time, ain't we?<br><br>I know some of my fans don't like the partÂ…, yet I enjoy seeing you guys discuss what I have done, and all of your opinionÂ… I wouldn't be that sexyÂ… since I am not that Wow Â….so don't worryÂ… sometimes looking sexy is just a kind of attitude no matter on the stage or on the pictureÂ…I am still meÂ…the clothing, the music, the makeup,the dancing sometimes helps a lot if I do want to look sexier or differentlyÂ…as what I have mentioned before, I do like to bring surprise to you all.. If you guys could take it as a surpriseÂ….anyhowÂ… jolin is changing all the time bit by bit, and I believe that you guys are chaging as I do , tooÂ… so celebrate for our growingÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Jolin<br>******</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought last time there is a topic on Jolin, Elva and Stefanie? Anyway her fourth album sales maybe is not as good as some singers, but I thought it has also surpassed the 100,000 copies in Taiwan. Still consider ok lah. Some of her songs are nice too. One of them is ni hai ai wo mah. Like it very much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The newcomer was now even involved in love rumours between Jay &amp; Jolin. Some marketing tactics eh.<br><br>Jolin was not able to promote alot her album for her Lucky Number in Taiwan. I was in Taiwan when she released the album. Initially, there were ads on TV, etc. But after that came the legal suit with Da-Sound.<br><br>In the end, she was banned from all promotions, and not even allowed to sing her own songs in public. She was severely warned after she sang some songs during the X'mas party in Taiwan, and apparently she broke down crying backstage.<br><br>Never really like her lots, but I do pity her for the law case. I feel it is really not her fault, and Da-Sound is a little too cruel to her. Afterall, she did earn lots of dough for them, there is absolutely no need to reach such an ugly situation where the reputation of the company is tarnished with bad press and the future of a popular singer hangs by a thread. I guess Da-Sound never hears of the phrase "Win-Win situation" before.<br><br>By the way some months ago, I heard that she was supposed to act as Teresa Teng in some musical or movie. She was even strongly supported by Teng's family, as they thought she had a pixie and pure look like Teresa, and her voice was not bad too. But with the legal tussle with Da-Sound, the whole matter seemed to be put to rest.<br><br>She had some dai biao zuos in Wo Zhi Dao Ni Hen Nan Guo, Don't Stop, etc...but her voice still leaves much room for improvement.<br><br>Anyway, do wish her all the luck...with her career and with someone too hehe...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How come got law suit???<br><br>Hmm....<br>N i thought the reason tat her album didnt sell as well is cos she cut her hair short, therefore losing some of her fans...<br><br>------------------<br>Would i be Happier if i let it All out?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought her Lucky Number passed the 100,000 mark...but compared to her other albums...this is really pale in comparison...<br><br>Aiyah...dunno how she got embroiled in this feud...Anyway she signed a contract with Chai Zhi Ping...the one behind 2 out of 4 F4...and Meteor Garden.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think it has got to do with her family wanting her out of Da-Sound and managing her on their own. But Da-Sound sued them for breach of contract or something like that. I am not too sure as well, coz I am not a Jolin fan so I seldom keep track of her news.<br><br>Anyway, I think Jolin had recently endorsed some product (think it's jewellery). Also, there is news that she may replace Ruby Lin to act in Huan Zhu Ge Ge III, coz Ruby was in a worse mess than she is (with all the rumours about her getting "bao1" by some rich men), so the production team was considering Jolin, who resembles Ruby (minus her dimples I guess). So thing are looking up for her for the new year...<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/cspb_copernicus/jolin.jpg"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Hajime (edited 23 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion..'Jolin' does draw my attention first i saw her in tv,but after saw her few times in tv again...just don't have that type of feelings to dig or chase for her information and news.<br>yea..i know that news about jay &amp; jolin..just think that is kinda rumors that to draw people's attention back to her--Jolin<br>For me..her voice too average(my suggestion for her is...try songs with fewer high tone voice,this typr'll more suit her).<br>jolin,evvonne,stephanie<br>i'll rate by voice:<br>1.stephanie<br>2.evvonne<br>3.jolin<br>if rate by my interest:<br>1.evvonne<br>2.stephanie<br>3.jolin<br>this is just my opinion...so jolin's fans,don't take it too serious.</div>
