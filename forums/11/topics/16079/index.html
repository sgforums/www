            <div class='col-md body'>this is not the first time i heard a DJ telling her listeners information lifted from local papers.<br><br>on the radio 15 minutes ago, she talked about how important it is to sleep before 3am because that is when our hormones repair our dead cells (or something like that). But the stupid thing is that, to be accurate, it is already the 13th, and this article was in Now (zao bao) on the 11th.<br><br>what is she thinking? none of us reads the paper? or none of us reads chinese papers? her intentions may only be she saw something interesting and she wants to share, but should she think about the many of us out here are listening to information we already knew?<br><br>What good does it do? I felt that no matter how busy and bo-eng she is, she should at least take the effort to do her own research before bringing it on air. at least by adding some information she found out herself, listener like myself can learn something more on top of what i already know.<br><br>If any of you thinks that i am taking this too seriously, there are people who has to learn a lot everyday and i takes every piece of information and fact given to me seriously.<br><br>Not only lifting from the papers? And the DJs who share contents found in email that ends up in my account once every few weeks? Some of the emails are so widely circulated yet the DJs brought it on air as though she was the genius behind the contents.<br><br>And agreeing with a reader of Now (zao bao) who made a comment that he or she was disappointed that during the WWTBAM, the DJs cannot answer simple questions on chinese history. He or she commented that DJs should be knowing more than music and songs (and more than oyasumi nasai and jya-ne).<br><br>Our DJs (jieqi excluded) seems to be acting cute all the time. True that 933 is supposed to be for young ppl like us, but young ppl like us wants to learn! stop talking crap on air.<br><br>...<br>...<br>...<br>and!!<br>..don't get me started on huishi!!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i really wonder what is the targetted age group of their listeners... and their slots really differs a lot, one from another, and does not have anything that ties all the programme together...<br><br>...DUN MENTION 'WAI WAI YU LE ZHAN'!! they think it's funny ar? act cute lor, then give comments that they think can make an impact...try harder lor, or get a life.<br><br>I dunno is it just me or what, but sometimes when i tune in to 933 at different time in the day, i end up switching over to someother channel which songs i like... dk's programme i think is standard long hu bang, play only the popular songs only.<br><br>Huishi ar? REALLY dunno what to say lor... especially on the name of her slot 'ci ruo shang zhen'...again, trying to create an impact on us issit? or trying to evoke a response? *goosebumps*<br><br>Her slot plays okay music, but whenever her voice comes on i will have to switch the frequency. Let me think (and very hard at that), when is the last time any of the DJ came up with a topic that makes me interested enough to stay tuned?<br><br>hmmmm... really cannot remember... *bleh~*<br><br></div>
