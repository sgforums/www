Even if he did release before, I think it is "extinct" liao. I am also a big fan of his  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>He sings once a month in Music Dreamer ( http://www.musicdreamer.com ). His slot this month will be on the 30 Aug, 1st slot of the evening. If not, you can always look out for the local concerts. He is usually invited to sing for most of them, eg. Xingpop, xinyao / oldies related concerts.</div>

Actually it's not difficult to find old CDs in sg..I saw one before, it's actually a package with few CDs..cost about $50 plus...<br>If you wana get old CDs, can go to chinatown stores (there are two) or FeiYing..which is somewhere at Marina Square if i'm not wrong..I bought my Zheng Zhan Lun CD there..<br>Good luck to you!</span></div>

Maybe quality not that superb, but for old times sake...Erm, not sure if it's legal though...<br><br>Never into Eric Moo, except for Xie Hou <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> But I'm very into Liang Wenfu esp his songs and novels hehehe. I love his novels, very "poetic" and beautiful "wen2 fa3". I couldn't think of anyone in Singapore who even comes close. His songs are memorable as well, esp those sung by Hong Shao Xuan (my most fave!!!) &amp; Xu Nan Sheng (my 2nd fave!). Jiang Hu was one hunk whom many girls swooned over hahaa...I do like a few of his songs, eg. "Lian Zhi Qi", "Rong Xu Wo Xiang Xing Wo", "Bian Yuan Shao Nian", "Ping Shui Xiang Feng"...<br><br>You can get some Liang Wen Fu compilations in some CD shops which sell older CDs (Outram has a few). He has a couple going for &lt;$20 and are really worth the $$$.</div>

All those stall owners looked so old (sorry to say that!) I doubt they know who Jiang Hu is. Hajime, is the album consists of Jiang HuÂ’s songs only or itÂ’s a compilation of many singers? I tried looking for Gun Shi recording also cannot find. But I tot Jiang Hu used to be under Polygram?<br><br>DidnÂ’t have a chance (or rather, I dare not) to ask HSX if he ever has an album to his own, but I do have the album Â“Liu Xing Ge QuÂ” which features Yan Liming and HSX. ThereÂ’s only one duet called Â“Jin Ye Shi  NiÂ”. ItÂ’s the 6-CD compilation by Ocean Butterflies, but sound quality not so good. Think itÂ’s recorded directly from cassette.<br><br>I like David TaoÂ’s music too, but never own any of his. Not working, so no $$$ to spare. Why the company like that make money one?!

            <div class='col-md body'>If you think Ai Qing Hai is loud, then MuChuan would be worse. The speakers are hooked up everywhere since the space is rather spread out so the sound can hit you from all directions. There are also TV screens showing the on-goings on the stage, as there are some seats which are rather far out from the stage so some people may not be able to see the stage. So can imagine the atmosphere is rather disengaging as compared to Ai Qing Hai. When it started more than a decade ago, it was only half the size so the ambience was so much cosier. What a pity...<br><br>I also had only heard about the JiangHu compilation but had not seen it for myself yet. May go look for it next week or the week after so tell you after I do get it.<br><br>Hmm, "Ni De Dao Ying" is by YLM and...HSX or Cai Jun Xiong? Haha I am bad at this...I also had the same compilation as you mentioned. Not all songs inside are great (recalled the English song sung by 3 guys, omg <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">), but they detailed the long way Xinyao had come through and progressed so it was interesting. I think Liang WenFu compilations will be better if you are into the more advanced era of Xinyao.<br><br>If you haven't owned any of David Tao's albums, then I guess you can get his compilation though I feel individually, each of his albums are generally well worth the money.</div>
