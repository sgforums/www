            <div class='col-md body'>The wild, woolly and refreshingly offbeat anime series Cowboy Bebop has been a Cartoon Network staple since 2001. But with only two seasons of episodes and a feature length movie (Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's Door) to chew on, fans have been left starving for new adventures with their favorite bounty hunters. In 1998 Bandai gave Japanese gamers and importers a 3D rail-shooter for the PSOne.<br><br>Unfortunately reviews of this early game were mixed. Now, six years later, there's a good chance that Cowboy Bebop fans will finally being treated to a more substantial virtual adventure in 2071.<br><br>Bandai's second video game pass at the Cowboy Bebop franchise turns the focus towards street, rather than aerial, combat in what is essentially a third-person actioner. The short demo level shown at E3 puts players in control of the lanky Jeet Kune Do expert Spike. When confronted with a narrow Japanese street-full of enemies, Jet has several options. Standard punches and kicks and shoulder button combos dispatch the thugs with Spike's patented calm, cool combat style. Items, such as a push broom, can be picked up and incorporated into the brawl. Punks at a distance can be dispatched by holding down the right shoulder button and drawing Spike's pistol.<br><br>The aiming reticle is controlled with the same, left control stick that handles the character's movement. Interactive parts of the environment, such as pallets or rooftop water towers are marked with icons. Firing a round at them causes an enemy thrashing explosion, or in the case of the tower, water and debris to rain down on the goons' heads. The level shown was very short. Guiding Spike through his gauntlet of enemies took mere minutes. Not surprising, considering the fact that this game is in an early alpha state. At this point combat and movement are fairly simple, with little outward evidence of gameplay depth apart from the now-standard hit and chain counters.<br><br>In the look and feel department, early comparisons to Sega's GunGrave are not totally unfounded, though Cowboy Bebop's Spike seems less nimble than the high-jumping, coffin toting Grave. The games more earth-bound to combat may be a disappointment to fans who appreciate the anime's stuttered, stylized approach in fight staging.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Among fans and critics Cowboy Bebop is widely regarded for its often cynical, science fiction-themed stories and thoughtful character development. Sadly, little is known regarding the subject matter of this title. According to Bandai, the game tells a brand new story. They also stated that the game, like the feature film, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door, takes place within the timeline of the anime series. But those who have watched the series already know that, right?<br><br>The game's cel-shaded visual style echoes the mostly hand-drawn look of the show. Original music from composer Yoko Kano and voice acting from the same talent used on the show are also promised. Toshiro Kawamoto, the character designer from the TV series, was brought on board to supervise the digital look of Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, Ein and the 50 outlaws they encounter during the course of their PS2 adventures. Game menus and load screens mimic, the stylistic and often tongue-in-cheek tone of the show's bumpers. The best example being the demo's exit/game over screen, which sends players off with the show's trademark final word, "See you next time, space cowboy."<br><br>Based on the scant amount of Cowboy Bebop shown at E3, it's difficult to judge how this game's going to turn out. There's a distinct possibility that the demos fairly shallow combat could, when stretched across the length of the game become a tad tiresome. Then, in the case of narrative, comes Bandai's biggest challenge. Can the game's story live up to the incredibly high standards of the show's fan? At this early date there's no telling. We'll just have to take a cue from Spike and kick back on our respective couches and wait.<br></div>
