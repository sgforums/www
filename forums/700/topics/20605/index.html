            <div class='col-md body'>I am proud of the REDS revelation under GH. However I still think that our team is not really world class compared to our rival like Arsenal or Chelsea. I personally think that Mr.Houllier really needs to bring in 2-3 real world class players if REDS is to challenge for the very top position next season. The current team is good actually, but I somehow feel that we really lack of the 'magical touch' as a team which we can identify with teams like Barcelona or even Manchester United. They always look like they are going to score. I think there are a few players that might help to transform the REDS to becom even more invincible. Top of my list is Pavel Nedved (Lazio), the Czech gifted left winger. With him in the team, Patrik Berger can roam freely behind the 2 strikers and Berger is most dangerous in that position (He scored a hat-tricks against Chelsea a few seasons ago). Back to Nedved, he possessed the skills to bring the ball to the box, also the accuracy and power to blast the ball into the goal from outside the box. Second in my list is Jari Litmanen of Barcelona. He is not a regular in the team last season and with the departure of Van Gaal he may just want to leave. His scoring ability has long been proven and he is definitely a better cover for Owen or Fowler than Meijer and Camara. His vision which helped Ajax to European success is really what we need. Lastly, we really ought to fight for the signature of Sol Campbell as he simply is the best English defender around now. He can provide the aerial threat during corners or freekicks which Henchoz can't. Campbell is definitely a more able partner for Hyypia. As for left back, I think D.Matteo really deserves a place in the team with his excellent performance for the 2nd half of last season. The right midfield role, I think Houllier may want to bring in Kieron Dyer (though he just signed for Newcastle). He is a really exciting prospect. To summarise, my dream team will be (4-4-2) Westerveld, Babbel(right back), Hyypia, S.Campbell(central defenders), Dominic Matteo(left back), Pavel Nedved(left winger), P.Berger(attacking midfielder), Redknapp/Gerrard(central midfielder), K.Dyer(right winger), Fowler, Owen(strikers) with Litmanen and Heskey as covers. What do you Reds faithful think?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This will first cover the defending roles:<br>The Liverpool defence has done itself proud by being one of the meanest in the EPL contrary to the leaky one they had last season. With the addition of Babbel, I would think that it would be even better than ever. However, I think Liverpool needs defenders who look just as deadly in front, like Roberto Carlos and Cafu, or Matthias Sammer (in his hey days). Christian Panucci is now available, hopefully Liverpool bids for him.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>In the midfield, with Hammann and Berger, there is also the likes of Murphy, THompson, Gerrard, Redknapp and Smicer. I would think someone to the likes of Roy Keane would be very much needed there to be the playmaker. I doubt GH would want to convert his midfield into a Czech one, with there already Berger and Smicer around. To cover the left, I would have actually very much wanted to see Pires there, but Arsenel snapped him up.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think in attack, Liverpool is more abundant than ever, with Fowler, Heskey, Owen, Meijer, Camara fighting for the two places already available. Litmanen would definitely be a good addition, but I doubt he would ever come to Liverpool, firstly due to the fact he might not be able to secure a first team place, secondly he has no Champions' League placing next year, thirdly, Liverpool is still not at the top of the table......<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The conclusion:<br>GH is proceeding to the right policy of nurturing his youth players. That was exactly the policy Manchester United embarked on seasons back, that's why you have the likes of the Neville brothers, Beckham and Butt. Next season, the big names would be Gerrard, Carragher, Murphy, Thompson.....an experienced midfield has been purchased in the form of McAllister, let's see whether GH would stop at that with his shopping list.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>3 cheers to GH for sure. Liverpool as a whole has really been a revo during the second season of GH sole charge and like what Tehkohpek says we really need a few player with the IMPT, Critcital, Magical touches.<br><br>Liverpool lack of creativity from the centre field is the Reds biggest prob this season. And I think a player who got great vision or the ability to dribble and pass should be our top prioriity for the off season.<br><br>If you ask me who, I will say..... ASK HOLLIER. hahaha<br><br>anyway me just think a playmaker is needed loh<br>who?<br>me don't have anyone in mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, someone to the likes of Roy Keane. Really think he is a very good midfielder. Another possible candidate would be Steve McManaman, who has grown from strength to strength in his spell in Real Madrid.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I just want to comment on the suggestions and opinions made by Revelations about RedsÂ�f squad.<br>I begin by talking about the midfield which I regard as having the most problems as they constantly lack of ideas and cannot produce precise and defence-splitting passes. I do agree that we need a playmaker but the likes of Roy Keane and McManamann are definitely out of question. How can Roy Keane, the captain of Man Utd, our arch-rival come and play for Liverpool ? Even I donÂ�ft think Liverpool can afford the transfer fee if Man Utd is willing to sell him.<br>Moreover, Roy Keane is not the typical playmaker of the modern game. He is a combative midfielder with the main role of holding the midfield and we already have similar personnel in our team in the likes of Redknapp and of course Steven Gerrard. As for McManamann, I believe many Reds fans would definitely like him to come back to play for the Reds, but again that move is highly unlikely since he claimed that he is very happy in Spain and Real Madrid has just won the ChampionÂ�fs League.<br>Actually, Liverpool can have a strong central midfield partnership in the form of Redknapp-Berger or in case Redknapp gets injured, Gerrard-Berger. Gerrard or Redknapp will be the holding midfielder, doing most of the tackling and spray the ball up for some long range passing during counter attack. While Berger, with his ferocious shot can back the two strikers from behind as he strikes best by arriving late in the box. Berger has also grown to be a more all-rounder as he now helps out the defence regularly. What more do we need ?<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the playmaker role, actually it is not a must to have one if the four midfielders can work together in exploring the space in opponentsÂ�f defence. My suggestion to recruit Pavel Nedved is based on the fact that none of LiverpoolÂ�fs midfielders is a natural left winger. If all the Reds faithful (and maybe Houllier) have seen NedvedÂ�fs superb performance in CzechÂ�fs opening match against Holland then you may understand why I would put Nedved on top of my shopping list. He is a gifted midfielder who can operate not just from the left but also from the middle and right. Is Hamann ( tipped to be future GermanyÂ�fs captain ), Thompson or Murphy capable of doing that? And by the way, whatÂ�fs wrong with having three Czech in the midfield? They can link up with each other better (better teamwork) and feel very much at home because they will be playing together both at club and international level. We desperately need a skillful, Â�eall-roundedÂ�f midfielder like Nedved. As for the possibility of a transfer, I am sure NedvedÂ�fs value would not be sky high compare to the value of Roy Keane or Figo. With Berger and Smicer already in the club, that will be a plus point in attracting Nedved to Liverpool ( it is always better to have fellow countrymen in a club, isnÂ�ft it? )</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Of course I know that Nedved is a non EU player. But when you are given a chance to choose between Henchoz and Nedved which one you will choose ? Henchoz is not a pacy defender nor does he possesses great physical strength. Reds does need a Â�ebigÂ�f defender who can man-marked even the tall striker like Tore Andre Flo and also has the pace to dispossess Thierry Henry. Can we think a better choice than Sol Campbell? I truly believe that Reds has the capacity to compete with Man Utd for his signature. Having conceded the least number of goals shouldnÂ�ft be an indicator that RedsÂ�f Hyypia and Henchoz partnership is the best in the premiership. We have to bear in mind that Reds midfield are often packed with more defensive players like Gerrard and Hamann ( who play together for most of the season ). However, the result is how many goals have both of them scored ? They did not provide many killer passes, did they ? (Otherwise there wouldnÂ�ft be any call for a creative playmaker). Even if we failed to get Campbell, there is still Markus Babbel who prefers a central defender role. Kieron Dyer then would be a great addition to the team to fill the right back position. His jinking runs from the right flank will spice up Liverpool game very much. DonÂ�ft expect any penetration from the right as long as Carragher is in that position. Dyer is also a highly versatile player and so when the injury prone Smicer injured, he can act as a cover besides Thompson.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To conclude, I think Houllier did make some worthwhile investments like Hyypia, Westerveld and maybe Heskey but the current Reds team that he is building really lacks of ideas, bites and goalscoring touch. There is just too many players who can only ram or shadow opponents and then pump the ball up without much accuracy not to mention creativity ( like Henchoz, Carragher, Hamann and Matteo ). We really need player with natural flair and who can run with ball. Those square passing sometimes is just not enough to open up a tight defence. If we still slowly wait for players like Hamann, Carragher, Murphy to learn how to play with more flair then it would need to take maybe another 2 to 3 years, by which time Owen, Fowler or even Berger might have left to pursue silverware with other clubs. So, it is important for Houllier to really bring in 2-3 established internationals (not the class of Diomede or the a-pek McAllister ) to challenge for trophy while allowing younger players like Gerrard, Thompson and Carragher to mature</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that now with the inclusion of Diomede, the Liverpool midfield will definitely be given that extra punch. With Diomede on the left, Hammann on the right, providing passes in to the centre with Heskey, Owen, Fowler in the centre, this will be a much improved midfield.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>
