            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm thank god that i was on time. We proceed to the hawker centre after all of them had arrived. We took the bus from sentosa after having our lunch. Large crowds of people are seen all around when we reached tanjong beach... I immediately plunged into the sea after changing my attire... Had some tanning too..<br><br>It was extremely scary when we visited the 'haunted house'. At first i felt nothing.. we took a couple of pictures and walk around the house... i told oreo that i cannot sense anything. Then oreo touch my shoulder and asked me whether i see anything or not. I told him i still did not see anything but i saw a girl when we are leaving...<br><br>I could not forget her depressed face... It really bother me much but thanks to oreo and sirius.<br><br>This trip is simply tired, fun and mystery....</div>
