            <div class='col-md body'>One fine day, an old couple about the age of 70,walked into a lawyer's office. Apparently, they were there to file a divorce. The lawyer was very puzzled, after having a chat<br>with them, he got their story....<br><br>This couple had been quarreling all their 40 over yrs of marriage, nothing ever seemed to go right. They hung on coz of their children, afraid that it might affect their up-bringing. Now, all their children had already grown up, they have their own family, so there's nothing else the old couple have to worry about, all they want was to lead their own life free from all these yrs of unhappiness from their marriage, so both agreed on a divorce....<br>The lawyer was having a hard time trying to get the papers done, coz he felt that after 40 yrs of marriage at the age of 70, he couldn't understand why the old couple would still want a divorce...while they were signing the papers, the wife told the husband.."I really love u, but I really can't carry on anymore, i'm sorry.." "It's ok, I understand.." said the husband. Looking at this, the lawyer suggested dinner together, just 3 of them, wife agreed, why not, since they are still gonna be friends.. At the dining table, there was a silence of awkwardness. The first dish was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick for the old lady ..."take this, it's your favourite.." looking at this, the lawyer thought maybe there's still a chance, but the wife was frowning when she answered.." this is always the problem, u always think so highly of yourself, never thought about how I feel, don't u know that I hate drumsticks?"<br><br>Little did she know that, over the yrs, her husband had been trying all ways to please her, she did not know that drumsticks were his favourite.<br><br>Little did he know that she hated drumsticks even though all he wanted was the best for her.<br><br>That nite, both of them couldn't sleep, tossing and turning ...after many hours, the old man couldn't take it anymore, he knew that he still loved her, and he couldn't carry on life without her, he wanted her back, he wanted to say he was sorry, he wanted to tell her "I love u"... He picked up the phone, started dialing her number.... the ringing did not stop..he did not stop dialing....<br><br>On the other side, she was sad, she couldn't understand how after all these yrs, he still didn't understand her at all, she loved him alot, but she just couldn't take it anymore....the phone was ringing,<br><br>she refused to answer, knowing that it was him..."what is the point of talking now that its over...I asked for it and now I will keep it this way, if not I will lose face.." she thought to herself...the phone was still ringing...she decided to pull out the cord... She had forgotten that he had a heart problem...<br><br>The next day, she received news that he had passed away...she rushed down to his apartment, saw his body lying on the couch still holding on to the phone...............he had suffered a heart attack whilst still trying to get thru her phone line....<br><br>As sad as she was feeling ... she was left with the task of clearing his belongings. When she was looking thru the drawers, she saw this insurance policy, dated the day they got married, beneficiary of course was her...together in that file, there was this note...<br>"to my dearest wife, by the time u read this, I would no longer be here, I bought this policy for u, though the amount is only $100k, I hope it will be able to help me continue my promise that I had made when we got married, I might not be here anymore but I want this amount of money to continue taking care of u, just like the way I would if I<br>could have lived longer ..I want u to know I will always be there by your side...I love u"<br><br>Tears flowed like the river...... When u love someone, let them know...u can never tell what will happen next....learn to build a life together..learn to love each other..for WHO we are and not WHAT we are..."<br><br>"Be patient in little things. Learn to bear the everyday trials and annoyances of life quietly and calmly, and then, when unforeseen trouble or calamity comes, your strength will not fail you."  ~ unknown.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
