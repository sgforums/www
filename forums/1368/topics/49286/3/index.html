            <div class='col-md body'>Do what you think is right, Sirius di....but do know that me and Acer support are on the neutral stands... we have no grievances with both sides...so we will stand by to whichever side when necessary...<br><br>as to not interfere, this will depend on situation...both of you are my dis, to ask me just to sit and watch if something happens is asking the impossible... I will see things objectively and give support to whichever side I see fit...there will be no favortism....<br><br>of all things, I would like to see this end peacefully, and we all still come out as a group...there is no need to make this world war 3...<br><br>I think we all have enough problems in our lives to fight among ourselves... for everyone involved, please go think hard about whatever I have said to each of you.... I love and cherish all of you, and it pains me...very much to see my brothers fighting like this. This is the first time I actually cried for someone other than my ex-boyfriends... please don't fight among yourselves anymore. If need be, let time heal your wounds.... but don't treat each other as enemies....take it as a request from your kor.<br><br></div>
