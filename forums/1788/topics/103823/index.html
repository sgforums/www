Now, Hollywood has come calling, with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl being her first, but certainly not last, blockbuster.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>When forced to choose a damsel in distress, Knightley would be our first choice. Young and fresh, she has that maiden-like innocence that is so damn attractive. Put her in a corset and give her long, curly hair, and she would induce more seizures among men than a Japanese cartoon.</div>

This is unfortunate because Ripa, with her amazing smile, bubbly attitude and sexy eyes, is by far the hottest talk-show host on television. Whether she's talking about the state of Eastern European economics or a night out with her family, we could listen attentively for hours.</div>

Long, dark and unmistakably unique, it's icing on the cake when we're dealing with a woman who can also add long legs and a shapely waist to her list of assets. When we saw her naked in Love in Paris (we thought it was a comedy), we could think of nothing else for days.</div>

Arrington embodies a killer one-two punch as a tall blonde whose knowledge of the gridiron game rivals that of any couch potato. How could any football-loving man pay attention to the game when a woman of her beauty and charm dominates the television?</div>

Crow is a musical force thanks to her catchy lyrics, contemporary beats and strong personal beliefs.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>The strong, outspoken type, Crow keeps most of her attractive features hidden. It is this sense of intrigue that makes us want to tear open her CD jackets upon release -- anything to get more than a glimpse of her amazing eyes, long wavy hair and, most of all, tight little body. She pulls off our "Sexy Rocker Chick" fantasy in every way.</div>

In a brief but very productive career, she has since shone in Bounce, The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shallow Hal.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>We are interested in Gwyneth not only for her blonde hair and sparkling eyes, but because she presents the ultimate challenge to men. Nothing would please us more than to woo this famous actress, whose body, angelic face and amazing sense of style more than make up for what the tabloids have printed about her.</div>

Tavares is Brazilian, has a perfectly toned 5' 10" body and is a professional model. If that's not enough for you, she looks incredible without being wafer-thin. Herein lies her genuine appeal: as a woman with a healthy body and a gaze so hot it could melt an igloo, Tavares is bona fide, old-school babe, not just a supermodel.</div>

She has even turned up the heat as a model for Calvin Klein and Clairol.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>There is no hiding Beauvais' beauty. Tall, leggy and full-bodied, she would look great wearing a potato sack. The real moneymaker, however, is her headlight-bright smile, which lights up any room and drives men insane.</div>

Her most memorable performance, however, was as Princess Isabelle in Braveheart, and men worldwide agree that she is royalty.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>The exotic and romantic type, Marceau has broken the mold to become our favorite French export (well, aside from Laetitia Casta). There is a sense of mystery about her, yet, as France's darling, she draws enough attention to cause whiplash among men wherever she goes.</div>

Who else can boast about being named "Most Downloaded Woman on the Internet"? Besides gracing computer desktops everywhere, Cindy has a successful record as a former Barker Beauty (on The Price Is Right), a fatally seductive Fembot in Austin Powers, and host of her own raucous, decadent program, The Cindy Margolis Show.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>There's a reason the "Queen of the Internet"'s bikini shots were once downloaded every 10 seconds. Blonde, buxom and beautiful, Cindy is the epitome of the mythical American beach bunny. And with brains to boot, she is also a successful entrepreneur who has been a regular panel member on the now-defunct Politically Incorrect.</div>

Television's spicy traveling series Wild OnÂ… during the height of its popularity. She was then spotted mingling with beautiful, scantily clad folks around the globe, which is why E! kept her around to host its interview show, Revealed. She's even made forays into Hollywood, such as in the male model spoof, Zoolander.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>The beautiful Jules was a great choice as the tour guide of the senses. The provocative brunette is not afraid to look sexy for the camera. We just hope she can look as sexy if we ask her to pose with us on the sands of Saint Tropez!</div>

Having starred in over 70 films, Sophia has evolved from being Europe's most desired woman to an award-winning actress, and still lives on as the personification of feminine strength and timeless elegance.<br><br>WHY SHE IS DESIRABLE:<br>Add Jennifer Lopez, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Monica Bellucci, multiply that by 10, and this is what Sophia represents to past generations. And it isn't hard to see why, even in her golden years. Her beauty and sophistication made her the first international sex symbol; an honor we are quick to recognize.</div>
