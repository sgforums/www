            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipodshuffle/images/indextopc20050111.jpg"><br><br>Time to mix things up. Meet iPod shuffle, the unpredictable new iPod. What will it play next? Can it read your mind? Can it read your moods? Load it up. Put it on. See where it takes you. Choose from pocket-size 512MB or 1G models starting at $99 and surprise yourself.<br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipodshuffle/images/indexwithgum20050111.jpg"><br><br>Random is the New Order<br>Welcome to a life less orderly. As official soundtrack to the random revolution, the iPod Shuffle Songs setting takes you on a unique journey through your music collection Â— you never know whatÂ’s around the next tune. Meet your new ride. More roadster than Rolls, iPod shuffle rejects routine by serving up your favorite songs in a different order every time. Just plug iPod shuffle into your computerÂ’s USB port, let iTunes Autofill it with up to 240 songs(1) and get a new experience with every connection. The trail you run every day looks different with an iPod shuffle. Daily gridlock feels less mundane when you donÂ’t know what song will play next. iPod shuffle adds musical spontaneity to your life. Lose control. Love it.<br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipodshuffle/images/indexswitch20050111.gif"><br><br>DJ Your Day<br>If you favor cycling to a hip-hop soundtrack and snowboarding to a little electronica, Autofill iPod shuffle from a specific iTunes Playlist and roll. Download an album from the iTunes Music Store and listen to it in order before you Shuffle it into your collection. Or just drag and drop individual songs from iTunes onto iPod shuffle. With Play in Order mode, you manage the music. If things take a turn for the predictable, never fear. Turn iPod shuffle over, flip the slider to Shuffle and mix on the go.<br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipodshuffle/images/indexneckd20050111.jpg"><br><br>Goes with Everything<br>iPod shuffle weighs as little as a car key and makes a tuneful fashion statement. Just throw the included lanyard around your neck and take a walk. Or run. Or ride. ThereÂ’s nowhere your skip-free iPod shuffle canÂ’t go, and with up to 12 hours(3) of continuous playback time, it keeps going as long as you do. A neat little cap protects the USB connector, and those signature white earbud headphones tell the world you love to listen in style. You can even make your iPod shuffle splash-proof, arm-hugging and longer-running with optional accessories. Ready for anything from a Transatlantic flight to a weekend at the beach, the iPod shuffle makes the perfect, low-maintenance pal<br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipodshuffle/images/indexclickwheel20050111.gif"><br><br>Touch of Genius<br>Good things really do come in small packages. The controls on the iPod shuffle feel as intuitive and easy to use as those on every iPod model. Play, pause, skip, repeat, shuffle and hold at the touch of a thumb: The circular, ergonomic controls and one-click slider make it simple to listen without looking.<br><br>The Music Store in Your House<br>Add to the iPod shuffle mix with songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store. Browse and preview more than one million songs, then buy what you want, 24-7, from the comfort of your Mac or PC. With the iTunes Music Store and iPod shuffle, youÂ’ll always have music at handÂ…literally.<br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipodshuffle/images/indexibook20050111.jpg"><br><br>Plug-and-Playlists<br>iPod shuffle makes syncing a piece of cake. Cupcake, even. Use the optional Dock to connect to your computer or just plug iPod shuffle directly into a USB port on any computer(4). Then drag and drop individual songs, Autofill your favorite playlists or Autofill your iPod shuffle with a random sampling from your music library. Since iPod shuffle automatically charges while syncing, it stays ready for your next adventure.</div>
