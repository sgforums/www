              <p><strong>W</strong>hen the fabled bank robber Willie Sutton (1901-1980) was asked why he robbed banks, his street-savvy answer was, "That's where the money is." When Hall-of-Fame baseball player Wee Willie Keeler (1872-1923) was asked to explain his batting prowess, he philosophized, "Keep a clear eye and hit 'em where they ain't." To paraphrase the wisdom of the Willies: When you are looking for a job, look where they ain't. Look for a job where no other job seeker looks. That's where the money is. Here are seven unorthodox places to look for a job:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Venture capitalists, leverage buyout firms, and equity investor firms</strong></p>
              <p>        These companies make financial investments in companies, hoping to sell the companies later for great profit. The people who work in these firms are financial experts. They are not operating managers. They usually know very little about manufacturing, marketing, or distribution. They do have a good eye for management, and are skilled people pickers. They are always on the lookout for seasoned managers, particularly for any of their portfolio companies in trouble. Some of these companies will put a proven executive on their payroll until a situation arises where the executive can move into an operating role.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Small companies</strong></p>
              <p>        Small companies (revenues less than $25,000,000) are often better places to work than large companies. People who have worked in big companies or who have strong educational backgrounds commonly overlook the world of small business. Small-company personnel are closer to customers and therefore better value the efforts that get and keep customers than do large companies. Small companies generally offer more job security, because hiring is done less frequently, with great care, and with an important need to fill. Small companies are competitive in compensation, up to a $175,000 to $200,000 ceiling. And if you are good enough to move a large company an inch, then you can move a small company a mile - for which the rewards are fair.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Go East Young Woman!</strong></p>
              <p>        China is the world's next economic superpower. The opportunities for workers and managers grow greater by the day. Good US companies, good Chinese companies, and good foreign companies are looking for people willing to invest in a China-based career, willing to learn Mandarin, and who see the planet as their marketplace.</p>
              <p><strong>4. ¡Aprende un poco de español!</strong></p>
              <p>        Cuba will become open to US businesses. Either Castro will relinquish power of Congress will repeal US sanctions, or both. Any new Cuban leader will understand the futility of Castro economics, and will move to a rapprochement with the United States. Cuba is becoming a more vibrant marketplace, full of current and future opportunities in tourism, banking, hotels, casinos, crops, ranching, restaurants, and sports. Foreign investment is moving into Cuba. Even the dimmest of US politicians now afraid of losing Cuba to foreign capitalism. If you would like to live in the Carribean, swim along the greatest beaches in the world, participate in the rebirth of a "cool" country, then Cuba should be on your list. Consider resort developers, international bankers - even McDonald's. They all will be in Cuba. Study <em>Español</em>!</p>
              <p><strong>5. Trust and estate bankers and lawyers</strong></p>
              <p>        A trust is a legal entity formed to look after and protect economic assets. Sometimes the economic asset is a family-owned business. The business can be in a trust for various reasons, but it still needs managers. Large banks with trust departments regularly have such businesses in their portfolio. Bankers in trust departments and lawyers who specialize in trusts and estates can be a good source of leads to companies needing better management.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Commercial loan officers</strong></p>
              <p>        Commercial loan officers are bankers who make loans to companies. If those companies get in trouble the loans are at risk. Commercial lenders don't want their loans in default, and they look to management to steer the company properly. Consequently, commercial bankers can be an excellent source of leads to companies needing better management.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Bankruptcy trustees and lawyers</strong></p>
              <p>        Certain of the bankruptcy laws are in place to protect failing companies, to give companies an opportunity to revive and eventually pay their creditors. Companies that have a chance to emerge from bankruptcy are stronger economically than they were previously. And almost always, the old management is gone. Bankruptcy trustees (judges) and lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy can be an excellent source of leads for companies needing new management.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking for a new job where no one else is looking increases your odds for success.</p>
