              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arjan Dech is one of the top sakyant masters in Thailand today who is highly talented in the spiritual art of tattoo. He is currently very popular and well known to many people in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. He has been very keen in Buddhism when he was just a boy. When he was fifteen years old, he became the student of the famous monk, Luang Pu Lui of Wat Lak Yo Tha. Luang Pu Lui taught young Arjan Dech the mysterious art of sacred tattoos and magical incantations. Following the traditional practice of the Thai, young Arjan Dech entered into a short term monk hood. The ordination ceremony was held at Wat Nak Pho Paseet Cher-laang and was conducted by his mentor Luang Pu Lui personally.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After when Arjan Dech returned from monk hood, he continued to stay in Wat Lak Yo Tha and learned from Luang Pu Lui. Having a strong determination and a positive learning attitude, Arjan Dech learned and practiced hard on what he was taught by his mentor. It was at this time that Arjan Dech received his first yant tattoo from his teacher Luang Pu Lui. Five years later when Arjan Dech turned twenty and being very sure that Arjan Dech has mastered what he was taught, Luang Pu Lui allowed Arjan Dech to start sakyant for people in Wat Lak Yo Tha. Since then, many people had been approaching Arjan Dech for yant tattoos.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Two years later Arjan Dech left Wat Lak Yo Tha and started to tattoo for people at his own place. Many people continue to come to him for sakyant.

Some would go for the practice of having blessed gold foils pasted on their faces and certain area of the body, hence increasing their level of popularity and improving their social relationship with people.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It was by chance that Arjan Dech met Luang Phor Ord of Wat UpsornSawan. Arjan Dech received teachings from Luang Phor Ord. Luang Phor Ord teaches him many magical incantations and chanting. Later Arjan Dech was invited to go Malaysia and Singapore. He was received and welcomed by many devotees. It was said that within a few days stay in Malaysia and Singapore, he has already attracted more than thousand people to come paying their respect to him.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Other than sakyant, Arjan Dech is also specialized in the magical practice of using the hermit mask (Khon in Thai) to get rid of all the negative energies and bad luck accumulating around a person.
