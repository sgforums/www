            <div class='col-md body'>Im new to this forum and i dont know if im the only one who faces this problem but would like to air my views.<br><br>i called the Mediacorp ppl to ask about a prize i had won last week on Wednesday.<br>The mediacorp person in charge of the radion station is so rude! Her name is Soo Wei or something...am not sure if she is the same Soo who deejays the dedication show.<br>Anyways i called them...and u know what this girl said?<br>"Why u so kiasu" . Lets just say the prize is for an event which will take place this coming Monday. And no one had called me up yet til i finally called them and managed to get thru after many, many tries.<br><br>She asked me to collect the prize on Sat but i said i cant make it coz im going out of town for the weekend<br>And they ask me to collect on Monday and i said but Monday is the concert day!! Then she said but your schedule like that HOW??? So i said ya la OKAY la i will collect on Monday.<br><br>And then i discovered that i might not be free to collect the tickets on Monday. So i tried calling the whole of Thursday and even emailed them twice but did not receive a reply.<br><br>Am not trying to be kiasu or anything...but this is the worse treatment i have received from a radio station! The reason why i want be sure whether im really getting the tickets or not is coz a friend will be flying down to attend the event with me, and lets face it. 1. Air tickets aren't cheap these days... 2. People have to apply for leave just to come over 3. Why bother coming if we cant attend the event anyway rite?<br><br>Until now, although the station administrator has promised someone will "call me back" as did the Deejays when i won the contest, no one has replied to my calls or my email. Its not that im so hard up for the prize, in fact i can afford to purchase the prize anytime. Its just that i feel a lot of injustice is done if this is their attitude towards their listeners.<br><br>Pls let me know if anyone has similar experiences.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't really experienced this before, but Soo Wei is the Soo at 987FM. What prize is it? Perhaps the prize made the situaton so difficult, like concert tickets. I heard that they are giving out Black Eyed Peas and The Click 5 concert tickets recently ... ...</div>
