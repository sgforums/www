            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wooden sword used to murder hacked-up girl'<br>The Yomiuri Shimbun </strong><br><br>Police have confiscated a wooden sword they believe was used in the murder of a 20-year-old junior college student, sources said Saturday.<br><br>The sword was taken from the Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, home of Yuki Muto, the murdered woman's brother who was arrested over damaging her body.<br><br>The police believe Muto, a 21-year-old cram school student, hid his sister's murder from their parents by cleaning the blood from the sword and using newspaper to cover the plastic bags in which the body parts were found.<br><br>Muto, the second son of dentist Mamoru Muto, 62, reportedly told the police he had used the sword to beat Azumi, who was washing her face in the bathroom, several times from behind. He also reportedly confessed to dismembering his sister.<br><br>Following the confession, the police found the wooden sword in his room at his family home, the sources said.<br><br>Because there was no trace of blood on the weapon, the police believe Muto cleaned it, just as he did the knife and saw he said he used to dismember his sister's body.<br><br>As no trace of blood was found in the bathroom, where he said he dismembered her body, he must have thoroughly cleaned the bathroom, the sources said.<br><br>The three plastic bags in which he allegedly put the body parts were covered with newspaper when his mother discovered them in a closet, the sources said.<br><br>Muto, who told the police he was going to dump the bags after returning from a school trip, was obviously trying to hide the plastic bags and their contents from his family, the sources said.<br><br>Muto allegedly assaulted his sister in the bathroom on the third floor of their house about 3 p.m. on Dec. 30, hours before their father returned home at about 11 p.m.<br><br>As their father said he had not noticed any bloodstains when he came home, the police believe Muto made significant efforts to cover up his actions, sources said.<br><br>(Jan. 7, 2007)<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br>A 20-year-old junior college student, who was found dismembered in her house in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, had suggested to friends there was "big trouble" in her family a few days before she was killed, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.<br><br>Yuki Muto, a 21-year-old cram school student, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of mutilating the body of his sister Azumi Muto, and the police suspect the trouble Azumi spoke of led Yuki to kill her after the rest of the family went out on Dec. 30.<br><br>Azumi lived with her father, mother and two brothers--Yuki and a 23-year-old university student.<br><br>Azumi allegedly told her friends a few days before the murder that there was a major problem in the family, and that she was going to ask her friends for advice.<br><br>The police suspect the problem was caused by something Azumi said, but they have not been able to confirm the details of the situation because her parents and the other brother have not answered police questions citing shock.<br><br>While Yuki was quoted by the police as saying he killed Azumi because she had accused him of "having no ambition," the police will ask the rest of the family about the general family situation leading up to the killing, believing the problem Azumi spoke of is tied to the motive for the murder.<br><br>Doctors who performed the judicial autopsy, meanwhile, are said to have been surprised at how efficiently Azumi's body was dismembered. Her body was severed at major joints, including those of the neck, shoulders and hips.<br><br>Yuki used technical terminology when explaining to the police how he cut up the body. The police, however, have not found any unusual books or videos in his room. They suspect Yuki cut Azumi's body into more than 10 parts to make it easier to dispose of.<br><br>(Jan. 8, 2007)<br><br></div>
