He's not going to be fit, I don't think, for Tuesday, but he's not too bad," said Redknapp.<br><br>"The specialists have seen it, he's had an epidural injection. Peter Crouch has had the same problem and he is fine - in fact, his back looked a lot worse on the scan.<br><br>"He shouldn't be too long, but Tuesday may be just a bit too soon for him. But Van der Vaart should be okay."<br><br>The potential loss of Bale is a major blow for Tottenham’s European ambitions and Redknapp believes his winger would have replicated his performances from the group stage.<br><br>"You saw what Gareth did against Inter Milan, when he terrorised them, and that would be in their minds an awful lot, I'm sure,” said Redknapp.<br><br>"Everybody in Italy talks about Bale - I went over and watched a game and everyone was asking me: 'Is Bale fit?' He would scare them to death."<br><br>Redknapp has praised Tottenham’s form ahead of the match at San Siro, although AC Milan will enter the encounter fresh off the back of Saturday’s 4-0 rout over Parma.<br><br>"It's great to go there on the back of three [Premier League] victories," he added.<br><br>"It's going to be a tough ask to make the top four again this year, there's six teams pushing for it. But I think we've got a good chance."<br><br>Tottenham’s latest victory came at the Stadium of Light on Saturday as they came from behind to secure three points over Sunderland.<br><br>Niko Kranjcar continued his match-winning trend from last Saturday against Bolton to net Tottenham’s second after the interval. <br><br>Harry Redknapp revealed the Croatian was the subject of a bid from Bundesliga side Werder Bremen in the January transfer window, but the Spurs boss was reluctant to let his midfielder move.<br><br>"He spends time practising his shooting after training, and it pays off for him - it's not luck,” said Redknapp.<br><br>"He works hard and he's got great technique. We had an offer of seven to eight million for him from Werder Bremen in the transfer window, but I didn't want him to leave."<br><br>Redknapp appeared angry with centre-back William Gallas after the Frenchman needed to change his boots early in the game and whilst on the sidelines, Asamoah Gyan put Sunderland ahead.<br><br>"Gallas had an injection in his ankle before the game and they bandaged his ankle. He was in pain and felt his boots were too tight," said Redknapp.<br><br>"I wasn't best pleased, and we were lucky we came back and won."</span><br><br></span></p>
