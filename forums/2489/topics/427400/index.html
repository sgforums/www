              <p><strong>Record win last summer led many to think the champions would be the   team to chase again, but a myriad of problems have brought the club to   the lowest point of the Abramovich era</strong></p>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><strong>1. Didier Drogba's malaria</strong><br><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/118900/118907_hp.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="144"></span></p>
              <p><span>The   towering Ivorian has been one of the Premier League's finest imports,   bullying defenders into submission and producing moments of genuine   quality since he joined back in 2004, but this season has seen an   alarming dip. In November, the 33-year-old complained of feeling unwell   before Chelsea's trip to Liverpool and sat out the first half before   coming on as a substitute in the 2-0 defeat. <br><br> Tests later   revealed that the forward had malaria, an energy sapping and potentially   fatal disease. Remarkably, and either a testament to the man's strength   or the stupidity of the club's medical staff, the player did not miss a   game, yet clearly was operating at nowhere near full power. The striker   has scored just five goals in the 24 games he has been involved in   since the diagnosis.<br><br> There is of course the possibility that the   illness is masking a natural decline towards the final seasons of his   career, but last year Drogba, a fine athlete, was immense, showing very   little sign that such a dramatic drop was to come. Malaria has at the   very least brought forward the expiry date on the striker's top-flight   performance levels, and at the worst has left him not even half the   player he was just 12 months before.<br><br><strong>2. Injuries</strong><br><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/108800/108868_hp.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="144"></span></p>
              <p><span>Last   year Chelsea was relatively lucky with their injury woes en route to a   domestic double, and had the added security of veteran stalwarts like   Deco, Ricardo Carvalho, Juliano Belletti and Michael Ballack to call   upon to ease the load in the event of a spate of knocks wiping out   starters. This season has been different.<br><br> Since pasting Wigan at   the DW in August, Yossi Benayoun has been hit by a serious injury which   had kept him out until only the past two weeks; John Terry missed a   chunk of November, coinciding with the beginning of the rot in form; the   dependable Alex has been absent since December with a knee complaint;   and even Frank Lampard, who has an appearance tally that usually only   goalkeepers can reach, has been afflicted with problems, missing   September through November.<br><br> Undoubtedly such key losses have   harmed Chelsea's hopes this season, particularly the two more senior   absentees. The England men have been the Blues' rocks of Roman   Abramovich's success and their calmness and influence were sorely missed   through the disastrous winter run, effectively leaving the side playing   catch up for the rest of the season.<br><br><strong>3. Fernando Torres changing the balance of the side and misfiring</strong><br><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/123400/123416_hp.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="144"></span></p>
              <p><span>By   December, most fans and pundits were in agreement that serious   investment needed to be made in January to avert the highly likely   disaster scenario of the club not even qualifying for next season's   Champions League. A quality forward was the most obvious area of   improvement, and when the Stamford Bridge outfit beamed their   Striker-SOS-Signal in the direction of Merseyside, Fernando Torres   looked up to the skies and knew he had to answer it.<br><br> But, despite   signing for a mammoth £50 million fee, he still hasn't answered the   distress call and has spent his nine games for the club wandering around   forlornly, scarcely showing a flicker of the quality that is hidden   beneath the depressed exterior. <br><br> The Spaniard's cause has not   been helped by being forced to play in unusual systems and unfamiliar   positions, lending credence to the theory that this was, like Andriy   Shevchenko before, the owner's signing foisted onto a manager who had   made no plans for an extra striker. The 27-year-old's presence should   add variety and danger to Chelsea's forward play, but the clear   confusion has muddied the team's passing moves as he has been unable to   forge a partnership with Lampard, Drogba or Anelka, leaving the Blues   blunter and more bundling than ever on the attack.<br><br><strong>4. Ray Wilkins' departure</strong><br><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/116500/116565_hp.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="144"></span></p>
              <p><span>Carlo   Ancelotti's right-hand man left in acrimonious and unclear   circumstances, with his exit immediately being followed by a stretch of   mediocre and downright dreadful performances.<br><br> The former AC Milan   and Manchester United player is a renowned coach whose technical   know-how and tactical understanding may not necessarily come through as a   co-commentator but would surely have resonated through Chelsea's Cobham   training ground and on match days.<br><br> Players would have looked up   to a man capped 84 times by his country and been instrumental in the   double-winning side of last season. His shock dismissal would have   raised eyebrows and disheartened spirits throughout coaching and playing   staff.<br><br><strong>5. Players not performing</strong><br><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/113900/113962_hp.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="144"></span></p>
              <p><span>At   times last year Chelsea produced breathtaking performances with a full   starring cast, but too many players have coasted through this campaign,   and they can have no-one but themselves to blame.<br><br> Michael Essien,   Florent Malouda and Ashley Cole were all at the top of their game last   season. This season has been dramatically different. <br><br> Essien's   wild tackles, which have always been a part of his game but have been   mostly overshadowed by formidable all-round play, have often been his   only noticeable aspect of his presence. <br><br> Malouda is only four   goals short of his haul of 15 last season but his overall game has been   nowhere near the high levels set last season, with the winger even being   replaced by Yuri Zhirkov in the starting line-up against Manchester   United on Wednesday – an unfathomable fall for a player who was   heinously underrated last season. <br><br> And Cole, perhaps like Drogba   and Lampard, appears to be slipping into his retirement slippers a bit   too early, with some timid attacking displays, not least in this week's   Champions League quarter-final, that are wildly uncharacteristic.<br><br><strong>6. Growing uncertainty around Carlo Ancelotti's future</strong><br><br><img src="http://u.goal.com/125300/125337_hp.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="144"></span></p>
              <p><span>It   may seem ridiculous that a man who won the double in his first year in a   foreign league, bringing the title back for the first time in four   years, should be facing questions about his job security, but the   Italian has this season.<br><br> As soon as the cracks began to emerge in   Chelsea's season in November, the 'Ancelotti out' rumors cranked up. At   the time they seemed malicious and not rooted in reality, but his   seeming acquiescence to Abramovich by playing the out-of-form Torres at   the expense of the team's balance, combined with his failure to keep his   players in check or performing to their best, and a gutlessness in the   big games has raised serious doubts about the former AC Milan manager's   suitability in the long term.<br><br> Rumors of a return to Serie A with   newly cash rich Roma have been whipped up even by the man himself, who   seems to have one eye on a summer exit with his reputation still intact.   The Italian has said that it would be a "dream" to manage the team that   he made nearly 200 appearances as a player for, and with a certain   Portuguese boss in Spain making noises of a return to the Premier   League, some Blues fans might not be too fussed about saying arrivederci   to Ancelotti.</span></p>
