              <p><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED are facing a battle to keep star winger <span style="color: #121212;">Nani</span>.<br>The Portuguese flier, surprisingly fit for tonight’s Champions League clash with Marseille, wants to discuss a new contract and wage rise on the back of his sparkling season.</strong></p>
              <p>But that has already been rejected and <span style="color: #121212;">Nani</span>, 24, has already told close friends he is considering a new challenge.</p>
              <p>He is just a year into a new four-year contract signed last March.</p>
              <p>That raised his wages to around £65,000 at a time when he was nowhere near as influential as he is now.</p>
              <p>The player’s representatives now believe he should be among the top-paid players at the club.They would not expect him to get the £250,000 a week Wayne Rooney earns, but nearer the £100,000 the likes of Dimitar Berbatov pick up.</p>
              <p>But the club have told Nani’s people there is no way they will be renegotiating with three years left on his current deal.</p>
              <p>SOURCE: <strong>The Sun</strong></p>
              <p>Coupled with news of contractual problems, Nani is also being targeted by <span style="color: #121212;">Inter<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Milan</span> boss Leonardo as he looks to bring in some more fresh attacking faces to his San Siro squad. The Serie A manager is reportedly willing to offer up to £35m for the 24 year old and if the Portuguese international does throw a strop about not getting a new deal then perhaps such a move is not beyond the realms of possibility.</p>
              <p>Some sources also claim that the winger was unhappy that Sir Alex Ferguson’s post Liverpool match media blackout prevented the boss from speaking out about the awful challenge Jamie Carragher inflicted on the Man United man.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is apparently ready to conduct something of a clear out this summer with the likes of Michael Owen and Owen Hargreaves unlikely to earn new deals and under performing players like Bebe, Gabriel Obertan and Jonny Evans are apparently also linked with possible Man United exits.</p>
              <p>Nani has had an excellent season this term but that doesn’t appear to hold much water as the tricky wide man looks to increase his wage packet and such news will greatly interest those sides reportedly interested in the Premier League’s assist leader with Real Madrid and Juventus also apparently keen on the player.</p>
