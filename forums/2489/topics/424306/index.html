              <p><strong>Arsenal target Sergio Canales is ready to end his <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/real-madrid"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #121212;">Real Madrid</span></span></a> misery – by signing for Spanish rivals Villarreal.</strong></p>
              <p>Canales, who’s been hailed as the next Cesc Fabregas, is so fed up with life under Jose Mourinho in Madrid that he plans to quit.</p>
              <p>The Gunners are on his trail, but now Villarreal are talking about making a £5million deal as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>The former Real Sociedad starlet, who picked Real ahead of many other suitors last summer, has now decided he wants to leave in search of first-team action.</p>
              <p>SOURCE: Daily Mirror</p>
              <p>Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing Real Madrid winger <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/pedro-leon"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #121212;">Pedro Leon</span></span></a> this summer</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old is one of a number of players seemingly set for the exit door at the Bernabeu, with reports in Spain suggesting as many as seven first-team players at Real could be sold this summer.</p>
              <p>Spain Under-21 international winger <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/pedro-leon"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #121212;">Pedro Leon</span></span></a> is one of those set to be sold at the end of the season after struggling to make an impression this season under Jose Mourinho, and the Gunners are reportedly keen on the £10million-rated player.</p>
              <p>Sport.co.uk report that Arsenal could face competition from the likes of Chelsea and AC Milan, who are both looking to strengthen their squads ahead of the start of next season.</p>
              <p>SOURCE: Crunch Sports</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger has of course more than enough young talent within his Arsenal squad but these sources believe the Frenchman is keen on bringing in this <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/real-madrid"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #121212;">Real Madrid</span></span></a> duo, but is there any possibility of this occurring?</p>
              <p>In reference to Spanish Under 21 attacking midfielder <a href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/tag/sergio-canales"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #121212;">Sergio Canales</span></span></a> it is worth noting that the player and indeed his father have repeatedly stated the youngster’s intention to fight for his place at the La Liga giants but a loan move to Villarreal may be a possible venture that could benefit the player but a move to the Premier League seems far less likely.</p>
              <p>Also the Daily Mirror’s assertion that Canales being hailed the ‘New Cesc Fabregas’ seems a little inaccurate as the 20 year old is a totally different player and when called upon by Jose Mourinho is usually playing out wide and has in recent cameo roles impressed enough to suggest he has a future at the club he only joined last February.</p>
              <p>The 24 year old winger Pedro Leon seems even less likely to make such a move as he was at least a Mourinho signing, as opposed to Canales and whilst the former Getafe man was reprimanded for his role in a training ground altercation with Fernando Gago, he still seemingly has a part to play at Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger would probably be looking for a keeper and a centre back before he targets any other potential additions and I don’t see a move to sign either of these young talents in the summer. The Gunners boss will look to bring in a new keeper with Manuel Almunia and Vito Mannone reportedly on their way out.</p>
              <p>An extra centre back may well be needed especially given the injury concerns over Thomas Vermaelen and the somewhat unpredictable displays from Sebastien Squillaci and to a lesser extent Laurent Koscielny.</p>
