              <p>Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has dismissed reports he has had another bust-up with manager Sir Alex Ferguson and said he is fully committed to the club.</p>
              <p>The newspapers reported the 25-year-old would be sold in the summer after questioning the ability of the squad.</p>
              <p>In October, Rooney said he wanted to leave Old Trafford as was fed up of carrying the team.</p>
              <p>Ferguson managed to change his mind, and the England international signed a new contract.</p>
              <p>But Rooney has denied the latest rumours claiming his relationship with his boss is as strong as ever, and looks to finish his career at United.</p>
              <p>“I saw that (the rumours), but I’ve never seen such rubbish in my life,” he said.</p>
              <p>“My relationship with Sir Alex has no problems whatsoever.</p>
              <p>“I’m enjoying my football here and if I was going to leave in the summer I wouldn’t have signed a new contract when I did.</p>
              <p>“I’ve signed it and I intend to see it through to the end.</p>
              <p>“You get angry when people question you. On Sunday I was on the way home from training. I stopped off at the garage to get petrol and a few people asked me if I was leaving in the summer.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t know where it had come from. I said, ‘Where did you hear that?’ and he said it was in the newspapers. But I’ll be here until I’m well into my 30s.</p>
              <p>“I signed a new contract to stay here and unless I’m ever not wanted then I’ll be staying here, that’s for sure.</p>
              <p>“I admit I made a mistake like I’ve said lots of times, by saying I wanted to leave, but I’ve committed my future to United and I’m happy and my family are happy so there’s no reason for me to move elsewhere.</p>
              <p>“I want to try and win more trophies and bring more success to this club.”</p>
