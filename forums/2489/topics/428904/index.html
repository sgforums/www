              <p><strong>1. Schalke No1 Neuer: I enjoy watching Man Utd</strong><br><br>Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer admits admiration for Manchester United. <br><br>Neuer, 25, has been touted as a possible replacement for the retiring Edwin van der Sar. <br><br>And the German added: "I was a big fan of Van der Sar when growing up and I have to say I really like the way they play." <br><br>Neuer faces United tonight in the Champions League.<br><br><br><br><strong>2.Man City boss Mancini: Now watch fantastic Dzeko go</strong><br><br>Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini was delighted seeing Edin Dzeko back on the scoresheet in victory over Blackburn Rovers. <br><br>The Bosnian smashed the ball home in the 75th minute following a misplaced clearance by Phil Jones to hand City a 1-0 victory which keeps them on course for Champions League qualification. <br><br>Mancini said: "I am sure it will help his confidence. Edin is a fantastic striker. <br><br>"He had problems with not playing some games and had difficulties not scoring. But tonight he scored an important goal for us. <br><br>"He deserved to score as he is a good guy. It was not easy for him and because of this I will enjoy tonight."<br><br><br><br><strong>3.Man Utd boss Ferguson: I am jealous of Real Madrid Euro record</strong><br><br>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson admits he wants his club to improve their record in Europe.<br><br>He admits he is jealous of clubs like AC Milan, Ajax and Real Madrid's record in the competition but is pleased to have so many players fit and available for the tough semi-final trip to Schalke. <br><br>"The present group have a lot of experience in Europe now. The semi-finals is where we should be, you get envious of other clubs with great records in Europe. <br><br>"We're trying to get parity with the likes of Real Madrid."<br><br><br><br><strong>4.Chelsea winger Malouda: Lampard, Drogba injuries hurt us</strong><br><br>Chelsea winger Florent Malouda says injuries to Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba earlier this season hurt their title hopes. <br><br>Malouda reckons the number of injuries could be down to a punishing international schedule that saw many of Chelsea's squad take part in last summer's World Cup. <br><br>"The Premier League is the toughest league in the world. It has been a long season for us because we have a lot of international players, which could explain why we dropped a little bit in the season," Malouda said. <br><br>"But everyone can see that we still have the ambition and desire to be the best. That's what we want to do until the end of the season."<br><br><br><br><strong>5.Man Utd boss Ferguson: Do no ask me about Real Madrid v Barcelona</strong><br><br>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson refuses to consider who they could face in the Champions League final. <br><br>Ahead of their clash with Schalke, Ferguson refused to discuss whether he would prefer to play Real Madrid or Barcelona at Wembley. <br><br>"I don't like jumping ahead," he asserted. <br><br>"If we can deal with Schalke, then we'll look at it but you don't care who you play in the final."<br><br><br><br><strong>6.Schalke keeper Neuer confident of edge on Man Utd striker Rooney</strong><br><br>Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer believes he has a hold on Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. <br><br>He was in goal for Germany when they beat Rooney and England 4-1 at last summer's World Cup. <br><br>And, as he prepared for tonight's clash, Neuer said: "I've already played against Rooney once and it ended positively for Germany. <br><br>"I hope it will be similar against Manchester United." <br><br><br><br><strong>7.Liverpool midfielder Lucas highlights Spearing impact this season</strong><br><br>Lucas Leiva has heaped praise on fellow Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing. <br><br>Spearing, in particular, has slotted into central midfield alongside Lucas and not looked out of place despite making just six first-team appearances prior to this season. <br><br>Lucas, for one, has been impressed by the 22-year-old former youth team captain. <br><br>"We know it is very difficult when it is your first season in the Premier League but he has come in and played really well," said the Brazilian, who at 24 has played 164 times for the Reds. <br><br>"Always we are under pressure to win because we still think we can get fifth place but he has done well and is developing very quickly - and the same goes for the other younger players. <br><br>"If you see the younger players I am already old but I am still learning. <br><br>"When I arrived in Liverpool a lot of people helped me to learn and that is what I am doing now, trying to give Jay some confidence on the pitch. <br><br>"The team looks good and we are happy because when fans see more young players coming in and playing well that means Liverpool have a bright future."</p>
