              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United winger Nani has hit out at Liverpool's Jamie Carragher after his challenge on the Portuguese winger left him with a gashed leg.</strong></p>
              <p>Carragher was booked for the challenge in Liverpool's 3-1 win at Anfield and Nani said it was "not football."</p>
              <p>"It is the second time he injured me. Before he put me out of the game for two months. He always tackles like that," he said.</p>
              <p>"I don't know what he was thinking but I know what he did was not football."</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called the tackle "disgraceful" and estimated a three-week absence for the Portuguese midfielder.</p>
              <p>Nani, whose Old Trafford career has been blighted by a string of injuries, reacted furiously to the incident, jumping off the ground to complain to referee Phil Dowd despite having an open wound in his leg.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old initially thought the challenge had ended his season.</p>
              <p>However, he recovered quickly enough to play for United in their Champions League win over Marseille this week.</p>

              <p>"When I saw my leg for the first time, I thought my season was finished, that is why I was crying," he said.</p>
              <p>"Afterwards, the doctor saw my leg and said I had been lucky because it just needed stitches and I would be out for two or three weeks."</p>
              <p>Carragher attempted to apologise to Nani after the incident, but the Portuguese player was not interested.</p>
              <p>He said he knew he was a player that opponents liked to target, but insisted he was not pleading for special treatment from officials.</p>
              <p>"I don't want protection. I just want the referees to be fair," he said.</p>
              <p>"If it is a red card, they have to give it. If they give the card, the next time the player doesn't make the tackle."</p>
              <p>He also said he thought it was wrong that officials could not take retrospective action over incidents if they had seen them and dealt with them during matches.</p>
