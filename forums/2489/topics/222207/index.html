It was United's 1,000th League draw in their history.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson's side have still won more top League games than any other club this season, and own the top flight's sharpest attack and tightest defence. They're on a nine-match unbeaten sequence and need a victory to maintain their three point cushion at the summit at the very least.<br><br>United have been beaten just once at home by Everton in the Premiership, but have only managed draws in their last two against them at the Theatre of Dreams.<br><br><strong>EVERTON</strong> may be seven places and 14 points inferior to their opponents, with six fewer victories, but they are still well placed to challenge for a Champions League place. They go to Old Trafford without a victory in five away League matches.<br><br>This is the 15th season of Premiership football, and this fixture pits the highest scoring club in the Premier League era against the one to have conceded the most. United have netted 1,087 goals, Everton have shipped 751 goals.<br><br>Peter Beardsley, Robert Warzycha and Mo Johnston scored without reply in Everton's very first Premiership visit to Old Trafford on 19 August 1992.

They're also hoping to increase the Premiership's second longest unbeaten home sequence to 24 games.<br><br>The Reds are unbeaten in five Premiership clashes with Portsmouth, winning the last three.<br><br><strong>PORTSMOUTH</strong> travel to the north west five places superior to their opponents, but knowing that defeat would see Liverpool leapfrogging them.<br><br>It's vital which side nets the opening goal. Portsmouth have opened the scoring in six Premiership matches this season and have gone on to win all six. Liverpool have done the same on five occasions.<br><br>Pompey's only Premier League victory over Liverpool was 1-0 at Fratton Park on 18 October 2003, when Patrik Berger's early goal separated the sides. It's 55 years since they last took away maximum points from Anfield, winning 0-2 in the top flight on 18 August 1951.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Ben_Ng69</span>: Liverpool will win this match with 1 goal under Peter crouch.
