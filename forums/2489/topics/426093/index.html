              <p>He also admitted to falling out with the Stadio Olympico faithful: ‘They (Roma fans) used to treat me as one of their own, they would tell me to throw in another elbow, but now the wind has changed.’<br>Representatives of the central midfielder are understood to have met officials at the club to make them aware of his availability next summer, indicating the World Cup winner’s desire to move to Manchester.<br>De Rossi still has over a year left to run on his £60,000-a-week contract in Rome, but the opinion of the Italian media is that he could in fact be the centre of a transfer battle in August, with a number of clubs tracking his situation.<br>Real Madrid have been linked with the £20 million-rated star and Roma have indicated they would not stand in the way of the 27-year-old if he wished to leave the club.<br>Roma are reported to be interested in signing Dimitar Berbatov, who has been used sparingly in recent weeks by Sir Alex Ferguson despite being United’s top scorer, and it is rumoured that de Rossi could be involved in a cash-plus-player deal in the summer.</p>
              <p>SOURCE: <strong>Metro</strong></p>
              <p>This move would be something of a surprise given that <span style="color: #121212;">Manchester United</span> are reportedly looking to offer Bulgarian international Dimitar Berbatov a brand new contract in reward for his successful efforts this season. However the former Tottenham man may consider his options given that of late he has been left on the bench whilst Javier Hernandez and Wayne Rooney have been forming a pretty useful partnership.</p>
              <p>Given that Berbatov is now 30 years of age, he won’t want to be wasting his best years on the Old Trafford bench and may be tempted by a new challenge but a lot would depend on whether caretaker boss Vincenzo Montella were to stay on as Stadio Olimpico boss beyond this season as it is unlikely a player would move to a club only to see the boss who bought him leave, and therefore potentially leave the purchased player hoping to be to the new boss’s liking.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is known to be a fan of <span style="color: #121212;">Daniele De Rossi</span> so perhaps the Man United boss would be open to some sort of swap deal, but only if Berbatov were to push for such a deal. One has to feel for the stylish striker, after two decent seasons where he was pilloried for lacking an end product and lacking the ability to be a 20-25 goal a season man, when he finally does start to become prolific, 20 goals in 22 Premier League starts, he then finds it hard to get a regular spot in the starting eleven.</p>
