              <p><strong>SIR ALEX FERGUSON is clearly extending his policy of buying  
                   young players to his goalkeeping department – with the ­£18million   
                  arrival of David De Gea this summer.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has decided that Atletico Madrid ace De
                   Gea, 20, is the keeper he wants to succeed Edwin van der Sar, 40, who 
                  is retiring at the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>De Gea follows Danish keeper Anders ­Lindegaard, 27, into the club.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lindegaard joined United last ­Nov -em­ber on a three-and-a-half-year deal from Danish club Aalesund.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The De Gea swoop will be completed in the summer, when Spain’s Under-21 star signs a five-year contract.</strong></p>
              <p>SOURCE: <strong>Daily Star</strong></p>
              <p>The   news that Bayern Munich have apparently taken a big step 
                  towards   signing Schalke keeper Manuel Neuer, another Ferguson keeper 
                  target, may   well mean that this source is actually perhaps nearer to 
                  the truth than   your might first think. It does seem likely that Anders
                   Lindegaard is a   back up alternative and not likely to be the keeper 
                  the Man United boss   looks to take the mantle of first choice keeper, 
                  not least because the   27 year old has zero top level experience.</p>
              <p>David De Gea has shown talent and maturity way beyond his years 
                  and in goalkeeping   terms the 20 year old is something of a phenomenon.
                   It is very rare of a   player of such tender years to be a first team 
                  regular and one who is   incredibly consistent.</p>
              <p>The Madrid born custodian doesn’t turn 21   until November and 74
                   senior appearances to his name and on the verge of   a call up to the 
                  senior Spanish team where he could well end up the   logical successor 
                  to Iker Casillas. De Gea won the Europa League and   reached the Copa 
                  Del Rey final in his first season and is a very capable   keeper with a 
                  very bright future.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is clearly   looking to the future when it 
                  comes to new additions, having brought in   Chris Smalling and Javier 
                  Hernandez to great effect last summer the Old   Trafford boss has been 
                  linked with moves to sign some of England’s top   young stars with the 
                  likes of Jack Rodwell, Jordan Henderson and Alex   Oxlade-Chamberlain 
                  high up on the Scot’s radar.</p>
              <p>Such a leaning   towards youth is of course no surprise as a 
                  number of Man United’s old   guard edge nearer to the end of their 
                  glittering careers. Gary Neville   and Edwin Van der Sar have both 
                  announced their retirements and the   likes of Paul Scholes and Ryan 
                  Giggs are clearly nearing calling it a   day. Michael Owen and Owen 
                  Hargreaves are unlikely to be offered new   deals and there are constant
                   injury concerns over Rio Ferdinand so this   summer could see a lot of 
                  comings and goings at the Premier League table   toppers.</p>
