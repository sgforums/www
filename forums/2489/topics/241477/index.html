For the first time in my career a manager said in public that I did not completely fit in with his plan.<br><br>"That's not exactly great motivation. If he thinks that why am I here?<br><br>"One on one with me he cleared the matter up and said his opinion had been twisted. But inside it still bothers me.<br><br>"I don't like arguing but I don't forget things either. If the club boss asks me again what I think of the manager then I'll speak for me personally."<br><br>Shevchenko, who also admitted he is struggling to settle in London, added: "Mourinho is a very good manager, but I don't fit into his system. In any event I know it can't carry on like that.<br><br>"Our relationship is professional. Nothing more nothing less. He is a tactical fox and has strict beliefs, but I've had better managers."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i don't really understand, its a typical case of the mgr not being to have his say in the players to buy.  Shev can be so yaya here becos he knows he has a godfather in Abra and that the writing is on the wall for Mourinho.<br><br>But Mourinho is also not stupid, he is going to be a rich man with such a fat golden handshake coming his way haha.</div>
