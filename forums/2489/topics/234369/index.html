Ronaldo signed a new contract in 2005 to stay with us until 2010.<br><br>"He is clearly someone we want to stay and we will make sure that he does."<br><br>Gill underlined that United's strategy is to strengthen their squad, not to sell any of their best players.<br><br>He stated: "The big clubs may talk in the papers but they fully understand our position. They know we are not a selling club of our prize assets so there is no way that will be sanctioned.<br><br>"As I think Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has said on many occasions, football clubs aren't banks - we are there to provide top-class entertainment and put out a top side.<br><br>"There is no point having Â£35m, Â£40m or Â£45m if we can't replace that talent. At 21, Ronaldo has had a great season and we believe the best is yet to come."<br><br>Gill said any offer would have to go to the club's owners, the Glazer family, for consideration - but is adamant it would be rejected.<br><br>"If I put it to them it would be a very short call," he explained. "If the manager says 'no sale' then they go along with it without a doubt.<br><br>"They are fully in support and they fully understand sport. They want to invest in talent, they don't want to sell our top talent."<br><br>Gill admitted it is unlikely that United will capture Bayern Munich midfielder Owen Hargreaves during the January transfer window.<br><br>United made a fresh offer for the 25-year-old England international earlier this month but, according to reports from Germany, Bayern will not let him leave until the summer.<br><br>Gill said: "There are three days to go until the end of the transfer window so that is a fairly sensible conclusion.<br><br>"We are interested in the player but Bayern are not willing to sell him so we have to leave it at that."<br><br>Gill also played down the possibility of veteran striker Henrik Larsson staying at Old Trafford on a permanent basis - but did not rule out extending the 35-year-old's loan deal from Helsingborgs.<br><br>"Henrik played for Barcelona and went back to Helsingborgs for family and other reasons, so I would have thought that is extremely unlikely," Gill explained.<br><br>"He is due to go back in the middle of March and we haven't really discussed that yet as we are focusing on the next few weeks and we will see what happens.<br><br>"I think it is a bit early. You can never say never and we will go through that nearer the time with Henrik and the club.<br><br>"I know for a fact Alex, Carlos Queiroz and all the players are very impressed with him in terms of what he can do, his attitude and how he has fitted in and we want great players at the club."<br><br>Ferguson is expected to recall Ronaldo and striker Louis Saha into his squad to face Watford on Wednesday.<br><br>Both players missed Saturday's FA Cup fourth round win over Portsmouth on Saturday.<br><br>"Cristiano played in the third-placed play-off for Portugal at the World Cup in Germany and he has been playing for us all season," Ferguson said.<br><br>"We have been looking at ways to preserve the players and felt this was a great time to give him a week's holiday. He has enjoyed it and hopefully we will get the benefit of it in the weeks ahead.<br><br>"Louis got a kick on the back of the knee in training. It is nothing really, just bruising. He will be okay for Wednesday."<br><br></div>
