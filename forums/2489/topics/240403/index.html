            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had told Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho to "button his lip" for the rest of the season.<br>Ferguson also accused Mourinho of reacting badly when refereeing decisions have gone against the Blues.<br><br>The United boss said: "He's come out with stuff this week about us and I expected that.<br><br>"He's been talking about referees and I think he is the last person who should talk about referees."<br><br>Mourinho had claimed earlier this week that United's challenge for the Premiership and Champions League titles had been helped by a combination of good luck and controversial refereeing decisions.<br><br>United currently lead Chelsea at the top of the Premiership by nine points, having played a game more.<br><br>Ferguson's men could go 12 points clear with victory over Liverpool, as Chelsea do not play until Saturday evening.<br><br>Mourinho had drawn particular attention to United's Champions League win over Lille and their Premiership victory over Tottenham.<br><br>But Ferguson responded: "His football club have been involved with so many things with referees over the years.<br><br>"It seems to me that if you contest something and they don't get their own way, there's something happens, whether it's referees or players threatened or something like that.<br><br>"It's an incredible club, so I think he should button his lip now for good for the rest of the season, " said Ferguson who claimed to have a dossier on Chelsea's misdemeanours.<br><br>"There's plenty of talk about Chelsea and referees and Jose and referees. I have a big catalogue on it but I'll leave that for another day."<br><br>Ferguson also condemned Chelsea's role in the brawl that marred their Carling Cup final victory against Arsenal.<br><br>He said: "I think the clubs have to hold their hands up, we've had to do it ourselves, we're not exempt.<br><br>"Over the years there have been situations we've had to control and we've had some feisty players."<br><br></div>
