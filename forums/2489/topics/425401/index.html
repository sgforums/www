              <p class="ss-text-bold">Wayne Rooney has rubbished reports suggesting he has fallen out with Sir Alex Ferguson and claims he intends to stick with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Recent speculation had hinted that Ferguson was ready to cash-in on the England striker over the summer after growing disillusioned with his inconsistent form and a shock transfer request in October 2010.</p>
              <p>A bidding frenzy was widely touted; with there likely to be no shortage of takers were <a class=" lingo_link" style="font-style: normal; display: inline; font-family: arial, sans-serif; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 400;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Wayne+Rooney/?section=football"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Rooney</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="position: static; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; margin: 0pt; width: 12px; display: inline; background-repeat: no-repeat; float: none; height: 12px; visibility: visible; vertical-align: top; top: auto; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; left: auto; border: 0pt; padding: 0pt;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""></span></span> to be placed on the open market.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has moved quickly to deny the reports, though, claiming his relationship with his manager remains as strong as ever.</p>
              <p>He is adamant that he will be going nowhere unless he is forced out of <a class=" lingo_link" style="font-style: normal; display: inline; font-family: arial, sans-serif; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 400;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/Old+Trafford/?section=football"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Old Trafford,</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="position: static; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; margin: 0pt; width: 12px; display: inline; background-repeat: no-repeat; float: none; height: 12px; visibility: visible; vertical-align: top; top: auto; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; left: auto; border: 0pt; padding: 0pt;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""></span></span> with it his intention to remain at the club for many years to come and help them cement their standing as a force to be reckoned with in European football.</p>
              <p>Asked for his take on the recent rumours regarding his future, Rooney said: "I saw that, but I've never seen such rubbish in my life.</p>
              <p>"My relationship with Sir Alex has no problems whatsoever.</p>
              <p>"I'm enjoying my football here and if I was going to leave in the summer I wouldn't have signed a new contract when I did.</p>
              <h4>Angry</h4>
              <p>"I've signed it and I intend to see it through to the end.</p>
              <p>"You get angry when people question you. On Sunday I was on the way home from training. I stopped off at the garage to get petrol and a few people asked me if I was leaving in the summer.</p>
              <p>"I didn't know where it had come from. I said, 'Where did you hear that?' and he said it was in the newspapers. But I'll be here until I'm well into my 30s.</p>
              <p>"I signed a new contract to stay here and unless I'm ever not wanted then I'll be staying here, that's for sure.</p>
              <p>"I admit I made a mistake like I've said lots of times, by saying I wanted to leave, but I've committed my future to United and I'm happy and my family are happy so there's no reason for me to move elsewhere.</p>
              <p>"I want to try and win more trophies and bring more success to this club."</p>
              <p>Rooney hopes he will be getting his hands on a collection of silverware this season, with United still chasing a Premier League, <a class=" lingo_link" style="font-style: normal; display: inline; font-family: arial, sans-serif; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 400;" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://topics.skysports.com/UEFA+Champions+League/?section=football"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">UEFA Champions League</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="position: static; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; margin: 0pt; width: 12px; display: inline; background-repeat: no-repeat; float: none; height: 12px; visibility: visible; vertical-align: top; top: auto; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; left: auto; border: 0pt; padding: 0pt;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""></span></span> and FA Cup Treble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Sharp</h5>
              <p>He believes he is in the best possible physical condition heading into the end of season shake-up, with a couple of early niggles having helped to keep him fresh.</p>
              <p>Rooney added: "The last two to three weeks is the best I've felt all season. I feel sharp and if the manager needs me to get up and down the pitch then fine.</p>
              <p>"I haven't played as many games compared to this time last season so I feel good, but the more you do play the more consistent you are and better you feel.</p>
              <p>"I'm delighted we are still in three major competitions and it's going well.</p>
              <p>"I don't think we need to prove anything to people, just probably more to ourselves really.</p>
              <p>"We didn't win the league last year or the Champions League and FA Cup, so we need to prove to ourselves that we are capable of doing it.</p>
              <p>"At the minute it's going well and we think we can go far in each tournament, but to be honest we have to just take each game as it comes.</p>
              <p>"We can't look at the Treble. If you talk about that then it just puts pressure on yourself so we need to just concentrate on each game and see what happens."</p>
