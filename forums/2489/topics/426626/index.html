              <p>Manchester United are preparing an audacious summer move for Bayern 
              Munich playmaker Franck Ribery. Sir Alex Ferguson has set his sights on 
              the French international and hopes that the uncertain situation at the 
              Allianz Arena may aid a move to sign the talented French international.</p>
              <p>Last seasons Bundesliga champions have had a shocking season that has
               cost Louis Van Gaal his job and the Old Trafford boss may feel the 
              conditions are such that the 27 year old may be open to a move to the 
              Premier League table toppers, and the chances of such a deal proving 
              successful could be aided if the Bavarian side miss out on a Champions 
              League spot for next season.</p>
              <p>Currently Bayern Munich are in fourth spot, which this term is not 
              enough to claim a Champions League place and the fact that they languish
               14 points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund has caused much 
              consternation at the club and led to Van Gaal announcing he would leave 
              in the summer and veteran boss Jupp Heynckes will take his post.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has tracked Ribery for some time and attempted to land the 
              skilful flair player when he was at Marseille, however the winger opted 
              instead for a move to Germany and is now in his fourth season at Bayern 
              Munich and although he signed a new long term deal a year ago, it is 
              worth noting that he did so after the club has secured a domestic double
               and reached the Champions League final, a lot has happened since then.</p>
              <p>£30m rated winger Ribery can play on either wing and could definitely
               add value to Man United’s attacking options not least with Luis Antonio
               Valencia only now coming back from long term injury and with the likes 
              of Gabrial Obertan and Bebe failing to make any impact whatsoever. There
               has even been talk that top wide man Luis Nani is not totally happy 
              with his lot at the club and he has been targeted by the likes of Inter 
              Milan and Juventus for some time.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has stated his intention to spend this summer and 
              chief executive David Gill has reaffirmed the financial backing he will 
              receive to do so and it seems that a few ‘marquee’ signings have been 
              speculated as possible additions to a Man United squad that is 
              reportedly set for something of a clear-out.</p>
