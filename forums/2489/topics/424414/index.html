              <p><strong>Award winning American poet Jennifer Juneau reflects on the success at <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> of David Luiz when compared with fellow new signing <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fernando Torres</span></span></abbr>.</strong></p>
              <p>He didn’t come with a £50 million price tag, but what came for half the price proved twice his weight in gold when on 1 March David Luiz, Chelsea’s new multi-talented signing, sealed his fate at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>When a ball from Branislav Ivanovic fell in front of him so fluently, Luiz acted quickly and volleyed it past <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Edwin van der Sar</span></span></abbr> in the ninth minute to the second half. It seemed so natural that fans not only hope to see more performances like this in the future, they expect it.</p>
              <p>Manchester United’s goalkeeper never saw it coming. Neither did anyone else, who still wait for Chelsea’s other current signing, <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fernando Torres</span></span></abbr>, to prove his worth.</p>
              <p>Two signings. One star. What’s in a name? Apparently £50 million.</p>
              <p>For now it’s the twenty-three-year-old São Paulo born player that has everyone in the football world talking, because let’s face it, where is the pressure to score goals when you’ve been signed as a defender? His first starting game against <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fulham</span></span></abbr> earned him Barclays Man of the Match and his energy on the pitch hasn’t disappointed fans since.</p>
              <p>When the January transfer window shut and <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> introduced Torres and Luiz, the focus was on the ex-<abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Liverpool</span></span></abbr> striker and Luiz’s name became drowned out in the Torres buzz. Not only because <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> and Torres fans trusted no. 9 to bring <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> out of their slump, but because the monetary value placed on Torres to perform miracles was horrendous.</p>
              <p>Now ironically, with all of Torres’s talent foot-dragging to the surface, the high price has taken its toll on the player, keeping his loyal followers making yet more excuses for being goal-shy. The latest excuse? — he’s under pressure.</p>
              <p>But don’t write the ex-Reds player off yet. Little by little his proficiency is rising and soon enough he’ll be back in the game.</p>
              <p>Compared to Torres’s first couple of matches with <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> against <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Liverpool</span></span></abbr> and <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fulham</span></span></abbr>, the striker is starting to wake up. In Chelsea’s last match against <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Manchester United</span></span></abbr>, he seemed more at ease with his Blues teammates.</p>
              <p>If anyone is confident Torres will explode on a scoring tear soon, it’s <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Carlo Ancelotti</span></span></abbr>. Or it could be that he is just exhausting his money’s worth, but Ancelotti has started Torres, leaving Chelsea’s top scorer <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Didier Drogba</span></span></abbr> warming the bench.</p>
              <p>Rightfully so. Drogba has demonstrated in past matches that he prefers to go solo.</p>
              <p>It is difficult to imagine the two players connecting and by starting Torres Ancelotti might be defending his proposed mistake—not a mistake by signing Torres, but placing a high value on his commodity to clean Chelsea’s record up.</p>
              <p>But the fact that Torres said in an interview with <em><abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> Magazine</em> that he is adaptable to any team’s style of playing may go against him.</p>
              <p>During the <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Manchester United</span></span></abbr> match Torres was wide open to receive the ball from Drogba who took the liberty of keeping it and shooting from too far a distance, right over the goalkeeper instead of passing it to an uncovered Torres.</p>
              <p>How does one adapt to that?</p>
              <p>The adaptable one is clearly Luiz, who has the ability, according to his past record, to counteract setbacks.</p>
              <p>Or, in the instance of continued success, <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chelsea</span></span></abbr> may have to learn to play around their new center back.</p>
              <p>Luiz’s determination is right on target and sparks when he emerges out of defence with the ball to make things happen. Should his deviation be a call for concern? Not as long as he continues to make things happen.</p>
