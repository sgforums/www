              <blockquote>
              <div>
              <p>Liverpool are preparing a clear-out as the Anfield side looks to   generate funds for significant signings this summer. Kenny Daglish and   director of football Damien Comolli have reportedly been considering   which players in the club’s squad they are willing to offload and   perhaps unsurprisingly a number of those are players brought in by Roy   Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Milan Jovanovic has failed to make an impact at the club   and will be allowed to leave should a decent offer come in for the   Serbian who is being chased by a string of Bundesliga sides. Philipp Degen is currently on loan at Stuttgart and the signs are that the Swiss international is unlikely to return to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Paul Konchesky has had a dire time at Liverpool and was sent out on loan to Nottingham   Forest where he has proved a success and there is talk that Fulham may   be interested in buying the 29 year old back and given that he cost the   Merseyside club nothing in the first place it could take as little as   £1.5m to take the defender back to Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Christian Poulsen came in for a torrid time during the Hodgson reign and has barely   featured since Kenny Dalglish arrived on the scene and the defensive   midfielder will be offered at a reduced price of around £3-4m and there   is reported interest from some Serie A sides including from Genoa and   Cagliari.</p>
              <p>Emiliano Insua is also very much up for sale and looked   likely to join Fiorentina last summer until the deal stalled but a move   to Florence may be back on although the Argentine may seek to stay at   Galatasaray where he is currently in the middle of a loan spell.</p>
              <p>Alberto Aquilani is having a great season at Juventus and has fought his way back into   the Italian national team set-up but the Turin side are unwilling to pay   the £15m that Liverpool are demanding, although the 26 year old has   stated that he would be open to a return back to England the signs are   that there are a number of other Serie A sides who may well be willing   to pay the asking price.</p>
              <p>Finally Joe Cole stands on something of a precipice. Dalglish is keen to give the former   Chelsea man a chance to prove himself and the England international has   not really had a run of games to show the Liverpool boss what he has to   offer. There is apparently a queue of clubs who would jump at the   chance to sign the attacking midfielder with West Ham and Everton   apparently willing to take the 29 year old on if he is indeed offloaded.</p>
