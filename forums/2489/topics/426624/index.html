              <p><strong>Barcelona are planning to cut 6 first team stars this summer 
              according to esteemed Spanish publication AS in an effort to raise funds
               to launch a bid for Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The </strong><strong>Barcelona</strong><strong> President Sandro Rosell has 
              revealed that the club will only be able to launch a summer offer for 
              Fabregas if they sell a number of their current first team stars to 
              finance the deal. The six players tipped to leave the Nou Camp are 
              Adriano, Ibrahim Afellay, Maxwell, Seydou Keita, Gabi Milito, and 
              Jeffren. The news will alert the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham 
              Hotspur who have been interested in two of the aforementioned squad 
              members.</strong></p>
              <p>SOURCE: <strong>Sport.co.uk</strong></p>
              <p>A great deal of speculation that surrounded the issue of finances at 
              the Nou Camp and that the lack of funds for Pep Guardiola was preventing
               the Catalan club from meeting any valuation placed on Arsenal captain 
              Cesc Fabregas as opposed to any feeling that too much was being demanded
               by the North London club, with that in mind this source believes that 
              the La Liga champions are willing to sell a number of first team squad 
              players to help fund a move for the Spanish international.</p>
              <p>Some sources are stating that Arsenal have quoted a fee of €60m 
              (£52.6m) for their captain and as recently as this week Barcelona 
              president Sandro Rosell has stated his club were not willing to pay such
               a fee but apparently Pep Guardiola has identified Fabregas as his main 
              target for this coming summer and expects his side to fund a move, hence
               the potential sales.</p>
              <p>Of the players named Ibrahim Afellay is perhaps the most attractive 
              with many sides interested in the former PSV man who only arrived at the
               club in January. Jeffren has been linked with a move to Liverpool and 
              Aston Villa are reportedly keen on utility defender Gabriel Milito.</p>
              <p>Barcelona have also been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal 
              winger Samir Nasri and there has been interest from Bayern Munich in 
              Gael Clichy and Andrei Arshavin and Arsene Wenger knows that if the 
              Gunners fails to land the Premier League title this season then he may 
              struggle to keep the nucleus of a side that has failed to seal any 
              silverware in six seasons.</p>
