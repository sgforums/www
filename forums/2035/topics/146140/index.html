He's a doctor.'"<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A small voice at the back of the room rang out, "And<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there's the teacher. She's dead."<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; __________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A teacher was giving a lesson on the circulation of<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the blood. Trying to make the matter clearer, she<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, "Now, class, if I stood on my head, the blood,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as you know, would run into it, and I would turn red<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the face."<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; "Yes," the class said.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; "Then why is it that while I am standing upright in<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the ordinary positions the blood doesn't run into my<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; feet?"<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A little fellow shouted, "Because your feet aren't<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; empty."<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; __________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The children were lined up in the cafeteria of a<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Catholic elementary school for lunch. At the head of<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the table was a large pile of apples.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The nun made a note, and posted on the apple tray:<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; "Take only ONE. God is watching."<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Moving further along the lunch line, at the other<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; end of the table was a large pile of chocolate chip<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cookies. A child had written a note, "Take all You<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; want. God is watching the apples!"</span></div>
