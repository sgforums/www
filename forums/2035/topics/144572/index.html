            <div class='col-md body'>Today someone asked me these question and kinda struck with it..<br>Now coming to my senses i shall share what i or how i felt abt love;<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">LOVE </span></strong><br><br>--A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.<br><br>--A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance.<br><br>--An intense emotional attachment, as for a pet or treasured object. A person who is the object of deep or intense affection or attraction; beloved. Often used as a term of endearment.<br><br>--An expression of one's affection: To like or desire enthusiastically.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Those listed above are the answers explained directly from a dictionary. What would I say love is? </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Subarugal version of love ;</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">An emotion, gathered and stored by the heart and soul of each person, whether it be for another, themselves, or anything else with deep emotional attachment. It is not found, nor grown. It just comes, and is there. It warms your heart and your thoughts, and grows even more when love is given in return. For those that have said it truly doesn't exist? Your wrong, Love can whither and die, just as surely as that of the petals of a rose can, but the reason for it dying will always be an effect from yourself.<br><br>Life is not about the fairy tale version of what love is, or how it comes about, or how it ends. Love is simply a likeness for life. It too will hold troubled times, lost times, or periods of confusion, but within those, warm memories always shine through, reminding you of what a great and ominous feeling love can share. Thats the one reason why those that have lost someone or something they loved, continue to live each day. You remember what it was like, and how it could be again. Love is simple.......Love is Life......Love is just Love. There are no true definitions, for love is interpreted by each person in their own way.</span><br><br>So do you agree ?  Or do u have a diff concepts ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">I. LOVE IS A SACRIFICE </span><br><br>1) Your object of love becomes #1, your marriage partner.<br><br>2) If every husband in this auditorium would die to himself, his marriage would live forever.<br><br>3) If every man would look at his wife with the love that Jesus looked at us with, his marriage would never end.<br><br>4) If every wife here today would die to herself, her marriage would live forever.<br><br><span style="color: red;">b. Must die to individual pursuits. </span><br><br>1) More homes are wrecked because one marriage partner puts a hobby or profession above the marriage.<br><br>2) IÂ’ve heard wives say, "If only he thought as much of me as he does his golf, or his boat, or his antique car.<br><br>3) When he gets home from work he heads straight for the garage, and I donÂ’t see him until bedtime.<br><br>4) What a shame, and it is also true of some wives!<br><br><span style="color: red;">c. Must die to the past. </span><br><br>1) Whatever you were before is now secondary.<br><br>2) Your obligation now is to make a home and a marriage work.<br><br>3) The past is gone.<br><br><span style="color: red;">B. A Sacrifice Must Suffer Long. </span><br>"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up." cf 1Co. 13:4<br><br>1. Real love is long suffering.<br><br>2. Jesus suffered long hours on the cross.<br><br>3. He suffered for hours in the garden, before going to the cross.<br><br>4. If you display godly love, you will be long suffering.<br><br>5. So before you pack your bags and move out, read 1 Cor. 13:4.<br><br><span style="color: red;">C. Love Gives Itself. </span><br><br>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." cf Gal. 2:20<br><br>1. You will never find Christ leaving us. It is always that we leave Him.<br><br>2. Giving yourself makes the marriage permanent.<br><br>3. If you gave yourself to your mate, you wonÂ’t ever back out. "Who loved me, and gave himself for me."<br><br>4. One of the greatest disabling factors to any marriage is "selfishness". Give yourself.<br><br><span style="color: red;">II. Love is a Commitment. </span><br><br>Note: John 14:24-27<br><br>A. When Jesus left heaven He was committed to the cross. "...for this cause came I unto this hour."<br><br>1. That was a commitment.<br><br>2. Nothing WOULD change that.<br><br>B. Marriage vows are a commitment.<br><br>"When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay." Eccl. 5:4-5<br><br>1. When we stand at the marriage altar and repeat a vow before God, He doesnÂ’t take it lightly!<br><br>2. If we enter our marriage with the thought or possibility of ever getting out, then we shouldnÂ’t enter.<br><br><span style="color: red;">C. When Jesus made His commitment to us it was forever. </span><br><br>1. It wasnÂ’t a trial basis.<br><br>2. It wasnÂ’t a test to see, if it would work.<br><br>3. IT WAS A COMMITMENT.<br><br>4. Some may say, "We werenÂ’t meant for each other."<br><br>5. After the wedding vows you are, because you are committed.<br><br><span style="color: red;">III. Love is Inseparable and Forgiving.</span><br><br>Note: Rom 8:35-39<br><br>A. Real love cannot be separated.<br><br>1. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. cf Ep. 5:25<br><br>2. If we love our wife like with the love described in these verses, our marriage can survive any attack.<br><br>3. This issue of submission is settled with love...<br><br><span style="color: red;">B. Real love is forgiving. </span><br><br>1. "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do".<br><br>2. The Lord could have called legions of angels and been set free, but He didnÂ’t seek revenge.<br><br>3. He could have rained down fire from heaven and destroyed them all.<br><br>4. But He chose to forgive...<br><br>5. No we didnÂ’t deserve forgiveness, deserve mercy and grace...<br><br>6. But because of His love for us, He chose to forgive us!<br><br>7. Our marriages will be severely damaged if we try to seek revenge.<br><br>8. We may even think that we are justified in seeking revenge, but it will only bring heartache.<br><br><span style="color: red;">C. Real Love is Eternal.</span><br><br>1. Never-ending love.<br><br>2. ChristÂ’s love for us is eternal.<br><br>3. Nothing shall separate us from True love.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by subarugal:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">I. LOVE IS A SACRIFICE </span><br><br>1) Your object of love becomes #1, your marriage partner.<br><br>2) If every husband in this auditorium would die to himself, his marriage would live forever.<br><br>3) If every man would look at his wife with the love that Jesus looked at us with, his marriage would never end.<br><br>4) If every wife here today would die to herself, her marriage would live forever.<br><br><span style="color: red;">b. Must die to individual pursuits. </span><br><br>1) More homes are wrecked because one marriage partner puts a hobby or profession above the marriage.<br><br>2) IÂ’ve heard wives say, "If only he thought as much of me as he does his golf, or his boat, or his antique car.<br><br>3) When he gets home from work he heads straight for the garage, and I donÂ’t see him until bedtime.<br><br>4) What a shame, and it is also true of some wives!<br><br><span style="color: red;">c. Must die to the past. </span><br><br>1) Whatever you were before is now secondary.<br><br>2) Your obligation now is to make a home and a marriage work.<br><br>3) The past is gone.<br><br><span style="color: red;">B. A Sacrifice Must Suffer Long. </span><br>"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up." cf 1Co. 13:4<br><br>1. Real love is long suffering.<br><br>2. Jesus suffered long hours on the cross.<br><br>3. He suffered for hours in the garden, before going to the cross.<br><br>4. If you display godly love, you will be long suffering.<br><br>5. So before you pack your bags and move out, read 1 Cor. 13:4.<br><br><span style="color: red;">C. Love Gives Itself. </span><br><br>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." cf Gal. 2:20<br><br>1. You will never find Christ leaving us. It is always that we leave Him.<br><br>2. Giving yourself makes the marriage permanent.<br><br>3. If you gave yourself to your mate, you wonÂ’t ever back out. "Who loved me, and gave himself for me."<br><br>4. One of the greatest disabling factors to any marriage is "selfishness". Give yourself.<br><br><span style="color: red;">II. Love is a Commitment. </span><br><br>Note: John 14:24-27<br><br>A. When Jesus left heaven He was committed to the cross. "...for this cause came I unto this hour."<br><br>1. That was a commitment.<br><br>2. Nothing WOULD change that.<br><br>B. Marriage vows are a commitment.<br><br>"When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay." Eccl. 5:4-5<br><br>1. When we stand at the marriage altar and repeat a vow before God, He doesnÂ’t take it lightly!<br><br>2. If we enter our marriage with the thought or possibility of ever getting out, then we shouldnÂ’t enter.<br><br><span style="color: red;">C. When Jesus made His commitment to us it was forever. </span><br><br>1. It wasnÂ’t a trial basis.<br><br>2. It wasnÂ’t a test to see, if it would work.<br><br>3. IT WAS A COMMITMENT.<br><br>4. Some may say, "We werenÂ’t meant for each other."<br><br>5. After the wedding vows you are, because you are committed.<br><br><span style="color: red;">III. Love is Inseparable and Forgiving.</span><br><br>Note: Rom 8:35-39<br><br>A. Real love cannot be separated.<br><br>1. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. cf Ep. 5:25<br><br>2. If we love our wife like with the love described in these verses, our marriage can survive any attack.<br><br>3. This issue of submission is settled with love...<br><br><span style="color: red;">B. Real love is forgiving. </span><br><br>1. "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do".<br><br>2. The Lord could have called legions of angels and been set free, but He didnÂ’t seek revenge.<br><br>3. He could have rained down fire from heaven and destroyed them all.<br><br>4. But He chose to forgive...<br><br>5. No we didnÂ’t deserve forgiveness, deserve mercy and grace...<br><br>6. But because of His love for us, He chose to forgive us!<br><br>7. Our marriages will be severely damaged if we try to seek revenge.<br><br>8. We may even think that we are justified in seeking revenge, but it will only bring heartache.<br><br><span style="color: red;">C. Real Love is Eternal.</span><br><br>1. Never-ending love.<br><br>2. ChristÂ’s love for us is eternal.<br><br>3. Nothing shall separate us from True love.<br><br></div></blockquote>Um...... food for thought......will come in handy......<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
