He is one of the moderator around here.<br><br>U know there are usually trial lessons available. So seat in for the first lesson to know more about the art but most importantly take note of the way the lessons are taught and see whether u like it or not. If u dont like the environment u will not stay long anyway?<br><br>How old are u anyway? Financially stable? U know private tai ji lesson by a good teacher can cost up to $50 per hr. However if u are learning from CC i think its 95 per 3 month and not per month.</div>

No martial artists should look down on other martial arts.<br><br>There is no place in Aikido for pettiness and selfish thoughts. Rather than being captivated by notions of "winning or losing," seek the true nature of things. Your thoughts should reflect he grandeur of the universe, realm beyond life and death. If your thoughts are antagonistic towards the cosmos, those thoughts will destroy you and wreak havoc on the environment.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I never looked down on other martial arts. I was saying about Wushu... their stances. I'm trained in Wushu and Xingyi, so what I'm saying is from my experience. Wushu styles are fancy, but does no good without practice. Same for Xingyi. It's deceptively simple, but until one has trained in it, one would then realize how hard it is.<br><br>Not to say that Wushu is bad, I'm a student of the art, it makes no sense to degrade my own art, but rather, points out the weakness in their system.<br><br>I have not talked about Aikido, I know nothing about it, so not in a position to comment. Neither do I comment about TKD, as I'm not trained in it.</div>

It actually depends on you yourself.<br><br>If you are flexible (not in terms of movement, but the mind), it actually helps in mobility.<br><br>Having learn Xingyi for quite a while, one thing I learnt there is flexibility. Their stances are dead, but humans are alive. One main stance in Xingyi is called san ti, and one can move their leg forward or backward or in other ways so that it doesn't impede mobility.<br><br>Same for Wushu. The horse stance is great, but shift a little weight to your left or right leg, and it will be another stance. Move your leg a little forward or backward, it's another stance.<br><br>Never let stances restrict you.</div>
