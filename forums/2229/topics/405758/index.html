              <p>While dim mak pressure points are most often associated with self defence, correct acupressure on certain points can be used as healing massage to improve health and assist in injury repair caused during training.</p>
              <p>How a point is manipulated determines whether it may cause damage or improve an injury or illness state or symptom. This is determined by both the force used in pressure application, and whether multiple points are struck or manipulated to receive the desired result.</p>
              <p>While these points are not intended as a replacement for acupuncture or other methods, such as Western medicine of healing, they are a powerful supplement to these methods of health improvement and repair.</p>
              <p>Pressure point manipulation to improve health can be attained in one of three ways, that of applying a certain amount of pressure to the point, by employing a massage technique, or using a mix of both techniques.</p>

              <h3>Pressure Point Kidney 1 Yong Quan</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.dim-mak-world.com/images/PressurePointYongQuanKidney1.jpg" alt="Dim Mak Pressure Point Kidney 1 yong Quan" align="right"></p>
              <p>Kidney 1 - Yong Quan is one such pressure point. While once considered a death point, changes in the way that we practice martial arts have emphasized this point's healing properties to a greater extent than that of its self defence application. Thispoint has many therapeutic benefits and it is the first point that a student should learn how to manipulate for healing benefits.</p>
              <p>As taught in my book <em>Two Dragons of Dim Mak</em>, correct manipulation can relieve headaches, anxiety, agitation, hot flushes, hypertension, nose bleeds, throat pain, pain and swelling in the lower leg and a range of other symptoms. For some symptoms, manipulation of more than one point may be necessary to produce the most effective results.</p>
              <p>It must also be remembered that these points have the potential to cause injury, so when using pressure points for healing purposes care must be taken to ensure that they are manipulated correctly to produce a healing effect. Incorrect pressure or use may induce the same affect as if the point was struck in a self defence situation.</p>
              <p>Not all dim mak pressure points function as healing points and it is important that you understand which points are beneficial for which ailments and the correct method of manipulation.</p>
              <p>A student using dim mak pressure points for the purposes of healing needs to remember basic treatment procedures. When using points for healing it is important that the practitioner makes sure that the treatment area, and the person being treated, are warm and that there is no wind or breeze.</p>
              <p>The practitioner's hands should also be warm and clean, and the person should not have just eaten, be inebriated, pregnant or seriously ill, that there is no broken or bleeding skin in the area to be worked on, and that if the symptoms get worse or there is no relief, the practitioner needs to stop treatment and refer to a registered health practitioner.</p>
