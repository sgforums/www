Well, it's actually an internal chinese martial art, with the longer name of Taijiquan - tai chi fist, if you will.<br>There are a few different "styles" within this art, and Chen just happens to be one of them. I am not going to go into a history debate here with anyone, because there are some differing opinions about what came first, who changed what, etc., but the general consensus is that Chen was the original style from which others later came.<br><br>Zhan Zhuang<br>This is usually translated as "standing on stake" or "stake-standing", and a host of others...<br>In general, this refers to a set of standards &amp; pointers to this type of practice. Many different styles use this as a training aid.<br><br>It's most commonly seen as "tree-hugging" stance. In its very basic practice, it's a beginning static qigong, useful for aligning the posture, building root, internal strength, etc. It provides such benefits at the basic stage, however some styles will practice it much longer, and with added things or a different emphasis/awareness, to further develop different things.<br><br>I know that explanation sucks lol but it's difficult to describe, but I think you've probably seen it before (but maybe didn't know that's what it was).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ndmmxiaomayi:</div><div class="quote_body">I didn't mean all at one time.</div></blockquote>Okay, so then I guess you are seriously curious then...Here goes (and remember, you asked for it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )<br><br>After learning some <strong>TKD</strong> from age 9 - 11, and going to the library and doing research on martial arts in general, I realized that chinese martial arts was what I mainly wanted. So I searched.<br><br>I could only find mainly "Tai Chi" listings. So finally I went to a teacher who taught Chinese stuff (listing was for some different Tai Chi styles and a bunch of different qigongs, but I didn't know much about it then).<br>I began studying different qigongs there for awhile.<br>I then found out he also taught <strong>Northern Shaolin</strong> (hereafter referred to as <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>BSL</strong></span> [BeiShaolin, Bak Siu Lam, etc.]), so I began learning BSL at just before my 12th birthday.<br><br>From about age 12 - 18, it was mainly BSL &amp; Qigong, and a little bit of basic yangjia taijiquan, but my teacher would often take us to train with teachers of different styles from time to time, to get exposure of different styles. Here I was introduced to ChoyLayFut, Southern Preying Mantis, Taijiquan (yang &amp; chen), Hop Gar, ChangQuan, YingJowPai (Eagle Claw), Shorinji Karate, various grappling, and contemporary modern wushu.<br><br>Immediately after finishing High School (this is all happening in the USA - I think it is called secondary school here, but not sure of all the different education levels here - quite confusing for me to understand actually), I was debating on whether or not to move to California and go to a Traditional Chinese Medicine School, as I had studied some basics during my BSL &amp; qigong training. So for about six months (age is about 18.5 - 19.25 yrs.) I did not train my BSL, as my teacher told me to take time off for thinking on my TCM decision. During this time I found <strong>Capoeira</strong>, and went regularly to training, and also actually some <strong>7-Star northern preying mantis</strong>. I was not considering this to be serious training, but just for enjoyment and exposure.<br><br>After this time (and decided not to go to TCM), I moved into my <strong>BSL</strong> teacher's home/school and attended junior college. He was working with his FT-job, publishing a book, and doing some seminars ard the country so was quite busy. I was then left, along with some other senior students, to lead the classes. During this time, believe it or not, I actually also went back to <strong>TKD</strong> (so many people in class were insulting it, so I wanted to go back in and see for myself, now that I was older &amp; a bit more experienced).<br><br>After a while, I decided to go to University, which was about an hour and a half away, so I moved there and went to school. My BSL teacher allowed me to teach "Introduction to Chinese Martial Arts" (JiBenGong), our BSL style up to a certain point, some of the basic qigongs, and basic-level introductory yang jia taijiquan.<br><br>I had a car though, so was able to travel between these two cities when I wanted, which was usually about twice per week.<br><br>So in Athens - the city where my University was - I practiced what I was taught, I began teaching, and was taking University classes too of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. In Atlanta - my hometown - I continued my BSL learning, I began learning <strong>Hung Gar</strong>, and more Yangjia Taijiquan. I revisited <strong>Hop Gar</strong> and trained with them on/off for while, coming once in a while, but practicing what I had learned at home. I revisited the <strong>Southern Preying Mantis</strong> style &amp; qigong, and continued learning that for a while (maybe about a year max).<br><br>After awhile, I stopped Hung Gar &amp; played with <strong>Chenjia Taijiquan </strong>(just a short while of exposure), while learning <strong>Gao Baguazhang</strong> and <strong>HsingYi Quan</strong>.<br><br>Throughout the years, my student-base grew, and I moved back to Atlanta, but kept driving back to Athens to teach (I later taught in both cities).<br><br>Here in Singapore, I have had a bit of exposure, but I've not been able to dedicate myself to a school yet.<br><br>So, anyway there it is - a lot of exposure, with real learning in a few styles, but most learning was in BSL &amp; qigong.</div>

Wing Chun is good.. not bad but just aint good enough. I still say go for those combat that teaches u how to survive in a brutal gangbang. Tae is all about defence.. n it becomes natural to block n stuff..   but when it comes to the real thing man.. i still think going for objects n randomly whacking is better..<br><br></div>

Like I said - TKD is generally taught as sport, and "sparring" and "combat" are two extremely different things.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BadzMaro:</div><div class="quote_body">Wing Chun is good.. not bad but just aint good enough.<br></div></blockquote>lol - Sorry bro, but it's not the art that should be criticized but the individual student, teacher or school.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BadzMaro:</div><div class="quote_body">I still say go for those combat that teaches u how to survive in a brutal gangbang.</div></blockquote>Then you definitely don't want martial arts, most of them shouldn't want you either. "Gang Bang" is usually a term representing someone who is "looking for fights"... Traditional martial arts are about much more than "surviving gangbangs"...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BadzMaro:<strong><br>Tae is all about defence.. n it becomes natural to block n stuff..   but when it comes to the real thing man.. i still think going for objects n randomly whacking is better...</strong></blockquote>Well, like I said - martial arts aren't for you. However, I somehow dont think your "randomly whacking is better..." will stand for the majority.<br><br>For example, if you take one person "randomly whacking" at me, I have a feeling that I'd have the advantage. But in a "GangBang", I wouldn't even be involved...</div>
