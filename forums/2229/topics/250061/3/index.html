Exception is that you are a medical doctor doing surgery etc...  Even then there can be investigation into whether you were negligent or not.<br><br>If you want to test "qigong" the proper way is to test in the following order.<br><br>Wood, Bricks, Metal.<br><br>Once you learn to demolish wood easily then move on to bricks and finally to metal etc...  but most ppl stop at bricks.  Personally I think the wood stage is enough to do some pretty serious damage in a fist-fight.  Bricks stage can kill a person easily by accident.  Metal is for those Xiaolin Monks.<br><br></div>

Provided that they don't kicks... qigong works best when the distance between an opponent is very short.<br><br>Nobody will stand there for you to hit... it's one of the rules that allowed us to easily defeat them... they have a habit of grabbing people by the neck, pull them close and using their knees to hit us... so before they strike, we strike first.<br><br>As I said, internal energy works best at close distance, that one is near enough to deliver a fatal punch if the practitioner chooses to.</div>

There is really no secret to having good fighting skills. Its just training, training and more training in techniques that work and can be easily explained. E.g you punch, I slip and counter with a hook. You kick, I block and counter with my own kick. You come close, I clinch and throw knees. You grab me, I perform osoto gari. Etc. No super mumbo jumbo theories.<br><br>I'm not directing this at you personally, maybe you were told this by someone else, you seem like a nice enough person. If I've offended you in my previous post, I sincerely apologize. But frankly, I don't believe it.<br><br>Why? Because the people who push these astounding feats of power are always the last ones to step in the ring to put prove their theories. They will give lots of excuses why they cannot step into the ring to fight and prove their powers (because our art will kill you, because we train for peace not for war, because ours is for real fights not for sport, because we believe in discipline and respect for others, etc.) If you can't even win a sport fight in a controlled and safe environment, how can you win a real fight in the streets when you have to account for weapons and multiple attackers? To me, these are just "siam"-ing.<br><br>Why do I think there's no such thing? Because the prize money for winning a K1, Pride or UFC fight is sometimes close to a million bucks. If these arts were real, don't you think the fighters will go learn chi kung and easily dispatch their opponents with just one punch? People are willing to eat all kinds of shit and live on an island for months with other smelly people to win $1 million, winning K1 with one punch should be easy money.<br><br>These feats of superhuman power are always practiced on or demonstrated on their own disciples, who've been conditioned to believe in this. Against fighters from other physical arts, they don't seem to work. Why is this so?<br><br>Please don't get your entire school to challenge me to fight. The burden of proof is on you if you claim to be able to do the things you claim. You can go sign up at any muay thai or sanda fight and show to the world the power of your chi kung. Since its so easy to KO a muay thai fighter with just one punch.<br><br></div>
