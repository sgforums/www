Especially CMA. You're an educated man, you will understand what I mean.<br><br>Even in TKD, you know what we used to do to the wooden blocks before we kick them? We soak them in water to get them water logged, then put them out in the hot sun to make them super brittle. Not much force is needed to break them.<br><br>For some other materials like bricks, they will make small stress fractures on it before the breaks, like doing what I just described, or else there's a hollow in the centre part where it's weaker than the rest. Or you can also saw a bit on the ends to make it break there.<br><br>AFAIK, karate doesn't do all these bullcrap, they're real hardcore one so I respect them. They don't "chuo shou jiao" to the things they break, they train their body till they can break them.<br><br>On chopping metal, think about it. What kind of metal do you assume it is? Metal can be hard (and brittle) or tough (and malleable). You can make steel very very brittle by introducing a very high carbon content, heating it up then dunking it in oil or water to cool it rapidly. Steel in this state is very brittle and contain tiny stress fractures in it.<br><br>In the normal steel manufacturing process, you follow this process by annealing. You heat the steel up, then let it cool at a controlled temperature to let the steel molecules arrange themselves in a stable matrix, this takes out the brittleness in the steel.<br><br>If you don't anneal it the steel is very hard, but very very brittle. I will even break just by dropping it from a man's height on a floor and a part of it hit's something. The longer you make it, the easier it will be to break it.<br><br>See this video:<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2EQWCpnIR8<br><br>If you think what the monks are breaking is normal steel that's been manufacturered in the normal way, I'll bet money for them to replicate it with steel of my choosing.<br><br>You know that's just not possible. Bone, no matter how dense, will never be harder than high carbon steel manufactured in the correct way. Think logically for a second and you will know what I say is true.<br><br>This is just one area of making you believe in the impossible, because you're assuming the steel is normal, when it is not. There are lots of others.</div>

Yes, Muay Thai does grapple and knee but the knee is appearing on the opposite side of the grapple. Hence, your counter-strike will not hit the opponent at full strength as the Muay Thai practitioner will twist his body to knee from the other side and your strike will not hit his centreline. Of course, he will not try the same trick twice so you better make that first counter count.</div>

They did not claim superhuman power on this forum. From what I know of Taiji (not the type practiced by old folks, but the actual martial art), it is a form of grappling, with joint manipulation and joint locks and throws. From what I see, it can work. High probability? Realistic training methods? IMO, no. There is no active resistance in the way it is practiced (from videos I've seen). Shuai jiao on the other hand, will work very well.<br><br>I only ask that people claiming to have supernatural power to back up their claim. That's all. From what I hear, James Randi's offer of US$1 million dollars still stands if you can prove publicly that your superhuman power exists. Sure beats teaching class in communitiy centres don't you think?<br><br>Why not ask the masters in the countries you named to take part in K1 and challenge Buakaw Por Pramuk? Or  Kaew Fairtex? Or Bas Rutten? Or if you need a nearer location, just sign up at Lumpinee in Bangkok.<br><br>A master should challenge another master, shouldn't he? Beating me, a mere student, will be a joke and will make said master a laughing stock even if he could win (emphasis on the word "if"), don't you think?<br><br>And Buakaw has never given himself the title "master" so your masters should be able to clean the floor with him easily. Or kill him with one punch when he attempts to clinch and throw knees.<br><br>Posting this on SgWutan will achieve nothing but to anger people who practice CMA. What does that achieve if we want to find out the truth of the matter, which is, does chi kung give a person supernatural powers?<br><br>Unless the objective is to rally other practitioners to bully me into silence, then what ends does that achieve? What do you as a practitioner (if you are one) gain from that? Continue living in delusion?<br><br>On the other hand, I gain totally nothing by holding on to my stand. My only objective, is to help new comers to martial arts know what they're getting themselves into, with both eyes open, and not waste their time and money on something that I know will not be as effective, when there are much better alternatives available.<br><br>But if this board is for the sole purpose of promoting a certain martial art or group of martial arts, for commercial purposes, disguised as a forum for all martial artists to discuss their views freely, then I will gladly take my leave.<br><br></div>

If everyone were to learn martial arts just so that they can fight with others to see who is stronger , there will be lots of fighting and mayhem in the streets and due you think you will dare to let your children , wife or gf walk in the streets alone ? Even if they were not be involved in fighting , but they may get hurt by other pples duels also .

Don't take offense, just think in my line of thought.<br><br>If I were marketing something that I knew was not as good as other products, or even blatantly untrue, and I knew I would be open to challenges to back up my claims, what would be the logical choice to make to shield myself from such challenges, and still be able to retain my students?<br><br>Wouldn't it be to think up some reasons why I cannot be challenged, or asked to back up my claims? Such as one should be virtuous and benevolent when practicing this art and should never accept challenges?<br><br>In my experience in the martial arts, it is the very people who compete, and enter the ring to fight, who have the most "virtue". Most of them that I know are humble, peaceful people, and are respectful people on and off the ring. It is the people who do not fight, who are the politicians. They politick, backbite and backstab in an attempt to politick themselves into a position of power within the national martial arts structure, for the sake of money. This has been my personal experience. Throw money and "face" into the equation and then see where all this talk of virtue and benevolence goes, I'm sure you'll be surprised.<br><br>I agree with you on benevolence, forgiveness and all that. It makes a good person. However, if you're practicing a martial art for self defense, don't you think it'll be logical to test it out in as real an environment as possible, against as wide a sample of opponents as possible, to verify the truth of your theories? Before you need it?<br><br>And there is no loss of virtue to enter a competition to compete. It is a sport. There is no malice or anger at all. Anger will sap you of your stamina and will take away your ability to think, and if you go into a ring angry and swinging wildly, it'll be your ticket to a fast knockout. Every trained fighter knows that.<br><br>Virtue is also associated with courage. The masters of old that we respect are all courageous people. Huo Yuanjia is one example. And he was not averse to accepting challenges. Which is why he became good in the first place.<br><br>Not testing out your theories is like designing and installing airbags in cars and then not testing them in a real crash, or monitoring how they performed in the real world and then refining them. You would never know that airbags will kill little children, or that they'll fail to fire in certain circumstances, or if the force is too strong, or the airbag deploys too slowly etc. etc.</div>

They did not claim superhuman power on this forum. From what I know of Taiji (not the type practiced by old folks, but the actual martial art), it is a form of grappling, with joint manipulation and joint locks and throws. From what I see, it can work. High probability? Realistic training methods? IMO, no. There is no active resistance in the way it is practiced (from videos I've seen). Shuai jiao on the other hand, will work very well.<br><br>I only ask that people claiming to have supernatural power to back up their claim. That's all. From what I hear, James Randi's offer of US$1 million dollars still stands if you can prove publicly that your superhuman power exists. Sure beats teaching class in communitiy centres don't you think?<br><br>Why not ask the masters in the countries you named to take part in K1 and challenge Buakaw Por Pramuk? Or  Kaew Fairtex? Or Bas Rutten? Or if you need a nearer location, just sign up at Lumpinee in Bangkok.<br><br>A master should challenge another master, shouldn't he? Beating me, a mere student, will be a joke and will make said master a laughing stock even if he could win (emphasis on the word "if"), don't you think?<br><br>And Buakaw has never given himself the title "master" so your masters should be able to clean the floor with him easily. Or kill him with one punch when he attempts to clinch and throw knees.<br><br>Posting this on SgWutan will achieve nothing but to anger people who practice CMA. What does that achieve if we want to find out the truth of the matter, which is, does chi kung give a person supernatural powers?<br><br>Unless the objective is to rally other practitioners to bully me into silence, then what ends does that achieve? What do you as a practitioner (if you are one) gain from that? Continue living in delusion?<br><br>On the other hand, I gain totally nothing by holding on to my stand. My only objective, is to help new comers to martial arts know what they're getting themselves into, with both eyes open, and not waste their time and money on something that I know will not be as effective, when there are much better alternatives available.<br><br>But if this board is for the sole purpose of promoting a certain martial art or group of martial arts, for commercial purposes, disguised as a forum for all martial artists to discuss their views freely, then I will gladly take my leave.<br><br></div></blockquote>How about challenging me?
