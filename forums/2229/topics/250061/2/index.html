Some of the Shaolin monks you hit them they also no pain.<br><br>Also how to control this skill? Like you want to shake hands with ppl then they feel pain?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div></blockquote>Errm... what I've describe is my skills level... and that's all I have. Other than that, nothing...<br><br>As per usual, I'm still a human, so everything applies. If I'm hit, I will still feel pain. It will take years to reach those Shaolin monks stage... but even so, you can only tahan a certain level of pain. My teacher can, I hit him hard before.<br><br>I'm not able to smash hard objects.<br><br>Shake hands no problems... only problem comes when you start hitting people... like a friendly pat. I haven't got to the stage where I can control it, so now I can only restrain myself from patting people. At the most shake hands.</div>
