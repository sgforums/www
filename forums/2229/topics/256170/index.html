            <div class='col-md body'>Hello All,<br><br>I seen some time back somebody was asking about Qi-Gong in singapore.<br><br>I heard of one school called Nam Wah Pai &amp; they say they are ok for martial arts &amp; health purposes. I will check for some more if anybody is still interested in the subject.<br><br>But others say the system is limited &amp; demonstrations of Kong Jing Power are fake ?<br><br>Maybe somebody else know of different Shifu with other style of qigong in Sing.<br><br>Cheers,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Newage,<br><br>Not to brag My Friend, But i have travelled extensively to many places &amp; have only seen (what you would term) "Ling Kong Jing" only Once.<br><br>I have visited indonesia,china, and most other asian countries and visited masters claming to have mastered this skill (Trust Me<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">,and one thing i have discovered is most are liars &amp; conmen looking for fame/recognition.<br><br>I encountered Pencak Silat Gurus,Gong-Fu Shifu, All who said they could move Me without touch, make Me feel heat, ETC, Nothing happened.<br><br>Most of the time they ended up saying i wasnt sensitive enough to the energy or some other Lame excuse.<br><br>Some even had the Hide to say i would be internally injured,so they had the students demonstrate instead.<br><br>What followed were some of funniest &amp; most ridiculous events i have ever witnessed to Date.<br><br>Most of the teacher in Singapore are not real Qigong master. And the students that follow them are usually very weak minded &amp; their want of supernatural power blinds them to the reality of the situation.<br><br>These recent taichi demonstrations "By Very Well Known Masters !!!" where the students Begin JUMPING &amp; BOUNCING all over the place are aslo complete utter nonsense &amp; the masters should be banned from teaching.<br><br>I dont know why these students contunue deceiveing &amp; deluding themselfs following this garbage.<br><br>Do i believe in chi &amp; LKJ,of course i do. But the real thing is not very easy to come by thats all.<br><br>Good luck &amp; if You really know a master in this field then you are truly Blessed   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Err.. qigong has to be done in very close range. If the distance is far enough, you won't feel any effects.<br><br>Whoever says he can make you feel something while you are far away is talking rubbish. Internal energies work well at near distances and they do a lot of damage.<br><br>It's like a gun. Once you are out of range from a gun, it won't be able to harm you. But if you are within range, you will be hurt. Or it is really near enough, it can kill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear fireball_smith,<br><br>Sorry for the late reply.<br><br>The master i says he do not know LKJ and he only knows a little about tai ji, he is constantly learning everyday.<br><br>I do not know if its magic or what but he is able to push me backward when he was standing one leg over another. The push was a light one and i was fully prepared for it. Well that couple with his knowledge on martial art is enough to make me learn from him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was learning the old 108 yang form. Was taught the zhang zhuan which is the round hand round leg one.  He never taught me much about qi gong. He say everything u need is in the form. If u had practiced taiji before u will know that moves are hidden in moves especially in small frame therefore the position and movement requires great precision something that i lack.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi NewAge,<br><br>The thing about taiji is the chi can become easily confused with so many different movements.<br><br>It doesnt know where to go or what to do.<br><br>Thats why people who study zhan zhuang a short time get quicker results - Hence the chi is trained thru pure repetition over &amp; over.<br><br>The old way of learning taiji was the same,you were only ever given the first movement to be practiced after first learning to hold its pose for hours.<br><br>This serves many purposes &amp; eventually connects one internally resulting in perfect alignment which is paramount to enhancing better Chi Flow,Rooting,Jing Power,etc. !<br><br>Cheers,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My senior say he does zhang zhuan for half an hour everyday. When i asked my teacher about this he say that zhang zhuan is good but not compulsory. Zhang zhuan usage and purpose is diff at each lvl of practice. Ever seen an old master does zhang zhuan regularly?</div>
