Taijutsu was the body techniques used by religious medicants(yama bushi) and lay followers of such medicants. As some of the lay followers settled down into villages, they transmitted the self defence methods to fellow villagers. Ninjutsu was something the sukbo (villager spies) first used  in the civil wars of Japan with certain combat techniques of taijutsu for close in combat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL, that is true. But on the other hand, knowing it means you will have to learn to guard them or you will be the one that ends up handicapped or dead. This is the most effective strategy, but even an average person will know how to guard against them (without knowing they are deadly points). I'll put it to instincts.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sho Kosugi the actor, really helped promote Ninja awareness with his Ninja movies of the 80s in America.Unlike his father ,Ken Kosugi does not have the screen charisma playing a Ninja so he has down graded to B-rated movies and playing Kindergaten host on Japanese TV.We all need an Asian action hero in Hollywood now,problem is they either die young,ugly looking &amp; clownish or cant speak English enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
