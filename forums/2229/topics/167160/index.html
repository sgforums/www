            <div class='col-md body'>What is iaido?<br><br>Iaido is the art of reacting to a surprise attack by counter attacking with a sword.<br><br>An in-depth reading of the Japanese characters for iaido is:<br>I = being, AI = harmony, DO = way . "The way of harmonising oneself in actionÂ”.<br><br>The Iaidoka (a practitioner of iaido) wields a sword: not to control the opponent, but to control himself. Iaido is mostly performed solo as a series of Waza. The Iaidoka executes various techniques against single or multiple imaginary opponents. Each Waza begins and ends with the sword sheathed. In addition to sword technique, practitioners require imagination and concentration in order to maintain the feeling of a real fight and to keep the Kata fresh. In order to properly perform the waza, Iaidoka also learn posture and movement, grip, and swing. Iaido is never practised in a free-sparring manner.<br><br>Iaidoka practice to prepare for a surprise attack, where an immediate, efficient solution to the problem of aggression is necessary. Therefore, the technique is highly refined. Every unnecessary movement is cut away. Technique is simple and direct. The training method is aimed towards development of the practitionerÂ’s every mental and physical resources.<br><br>Iaido is an authentic martial art that proved its martial values in a time of constant battle and warfare, that was preserved and passed on directly from teacher to student over generations in an unbroken lineage for 450 years. Iaidoka developed the mind towards an ultimately peaceful, harmonious, and active state ready to react and deal with any life situation.<br><img src="http://www.iaido.org/pages/images/standing2.png"><br><br>History of eishin ryu iaido<br><br>The full name of the style of IaÃ¯-do that is the most widely practiced in central Japan today is muso jikiden eishin ryu, meaning Â“peerless, direct transmission, true-faith style of eishin.Â” Eishin Ryu claims a lineage about 450 years long, making it the second oldest existant martial art form in Japan.<br><br>The founder of eishin ryu was Hayashizaki Jinsuke Minamoto Shigenobu, who lived between 1546 and 1621 in present-day Kanagawa prefecture. Many of the historical details of Hayashizaki's life are suspect, since, like most famous martial artists in Japan, his story has been widely fictionalized, but it seams clear that he grew up during a time of constant warfare in Japan, and was exposed to various sword fighting methods from an early age. It is said that he went to Yamagata prefecture to pray for guidance and receive divine inspiration for a new way of drawing the sword.Whatever the circumstances, at some point he established his own style of swordsmanship and called it shimmei muso ryu, Â“divinely inspired, unparalleled styleÂ”.<br><br>Hayashizaki's iaÃ¯-do has had many names since then. It is considered the foundation for the two major styles of iaÃ¯-do practised today: eishin ryu and muso shinden ryu. In each generation a headmaster, or soke, has been appointed to guide the practice of the art, and each soke has had his own influence on the development of iaido.<br><br>Eishin ryu claims an unbroken line of transmission from Hayashizaki Jinsuke through twenty two generations to the present-day soke, Ikeda Takashi Seiko, who was appointed by his predecessor Fukui Tarao soke. The names of all the headmasters from the founders time are as follows:<br><br>Hayashizaki Jinsuke Minamoto Shigenobu<br><br>2 - Tamiya Heibei Narimasa<br>3 - Nagano Muraku Nyudo Kinrosai<br>4 - Momo Gumbei Mitsushige<br>5 - Arikawa Shozaemon Munetsugu<br>6 - Banno Dan-Uemon-no-JÃ´ Nobusada<br>7 - Hasegawa Chikaranosuke EÃ¯shin<br>8 - Arai Seitetsu Seishin<br>9 - Hayashi Rokudayu Morimasa<br>10 - Hayashi Yasudayu Seisho<br>11 - Oguro Motoemon Kiyokatsu<br>12 - Hayashi Masu-no-JÃ´ Masanari<br>13 - Yoda Manzo Takakatsu<br>14 - Hayashi Yadayu Masataka<br>15 - Tanimura Kame-no-JÃ´ Takakatsu<br>16 - Goto Masasuke Magobei<br>17 - Oe Masamichi Roshu<br>18 - Hokiyama Namio<br>19 - Fukui Harumasa Tekkotsu<br>20 - Kono Minoru Hyakuren<br>21 - Fukui Torao<br><br>Current soke is Ikeda Takashi Seiko 22nd Generation.<br><br>Most iaÃ¯-do historians agree that the inspiration for the name eishin ryu came from the name of the seventh generation headmaster, Hasegawa Chikaranosuke Eishin. Certainly the characters used in his name are the same as those used in the name of the style.<br><br>After the eleventh generation, the lineage split into two separate lines: one leading to Saito Iamau, the eighteenth generation soke of the muso shinden ryu, and the other to Ikeda Takashi Seiko, as shown above.<br><br>There are a number of others, less widely practiced forms of IaÃ¯-do that grew out of Hayashizaki JinsukeÂ’s art.<br><br>Today, eishin ryu is practiced by two or three thousand people in Japan, and has exponents around the world. The administration of the system is primarily handled by the Eishin Ryu Traditions Association, led by the soke, and by the all Japan IaÃ¯-do Federation, which oversees competitions and promotions in many different IaÃ¯-do styles.<br><br><img src="http://www.takeda-kampfkunst.at/photos/iaido_fotos/iaido_foto_4.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>History of the japanese sword<br><br>Archaeological evidence indicates that swords have existed in Japan for its entire historical period. Short straight swords imported from China and Korea are among the earliest weapons found in historical sites around Japan. After 2000 B.C., when these swords first appeared, the Japanese began making their own swords. Around 700 A.D., Japanese swordsmiths forged the first of what are now considered the finest swords ever made.<br><br>The person considered responsible for vastly improving Japanese sword design and manufacture was a smith named Amakuni. Like others in his profession, he was responding to the huge demand for weapons made by local, provincial, and national leaders. Regional conflicts over land rights and issues of power continuously erupted, and, when not warring among themselves, the early Japanese were invading the Korean peninsula or China, or defending themselves against Korean and Chinese For more photographs visit www.corbis.com - All photographs are copyright of their respective owner invaders. Any leader with a supply of superior weapons was at a great advantage, so a constant, long-term effort to find swordmakers improving the craft ensued. The most devoted smiths made the quest for the perfect blade into a lifetime pursuit, and men exist today who devote their lives to the art of swordmaking.<br><br>The long sword in Japan has seen three major incarnations, and for each type of sword exists a fighting style to match the blade's shape. The early blades, called chokuto or Â“straight swords,Â” tended to get longer as metallurgy techniques improved. Though not much is known about how these weapons were wielded, the extra length - without any significant increase in weight - certainly gave the fighter more reach. The handle size of these blades suggests that they were held in one hand. The two-edged blade suggests a thrusting and hacking style of fighting.<br><br>The first major change in the shape of the sword came during AmakuniÂ’s time, a style perhaps created by Amakuni himself. Warriors found that, compared to a straight blade, a curved sword can be drawn from the scabbard more quickly and can provide a more effective cutting angle. For more photographs visit www.corbis.com - All photographs are copyright of their respective owner Consequently, swordsmiths developed forging techniques to make a curved blade at least as strong as the earlier straight ones. These swords, called tachi, were extremely long, some nearly four feet, and were generally used by soldiers on horseback. The long, curved blade was ideal for a sweeping draw and slash against opponents on the ground or mounted upon other horses.<br><br>Later in Japanese history, most soldiers found themselves doing battle on foot, or engaging in individual combat against one another. For such men, the tachi were too long to be drawn or wielded comfortably, so a shorter sword was developed. This sword was the katana, and the katana is the sword that most practicianers of IaÃ¯-Do systems use today. Katana are generally between two and four feet in length and, though curved, have a less pronounced arc than the tachi. They can be efficiently drawn from the scabbard into position for a horizontal, diagonal, or vertical cut, and the curve of the blade lends itself well to the efficient slashing cut characteristic of IaÃ¯-Do.</div>
