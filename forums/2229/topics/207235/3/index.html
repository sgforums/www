            <div class='col-md body'>Wah. this thread from a loser purple belt suddenly became a thread on Darren. Well, anyway, I guess the gyms dislike him because he is doing well. Plus his students are doing well too.<br><br>Saw the combatacademy website..Cool. KOTC in Singapore in Nov. Wow. Mma is growing here on our little island eh? I guess from a much much earlier reply from one of you about 'proof' let's see if Jason sends in anyone (or maybe himself) to fight in this one. Afterall, he is one of the 'highest ranking belts' in Singapore.<br><br>Aiya, I saw the grappling tournament you were talking about kimuraguy. Was it last year? I cant remember. The bloody fool Jason must have been the fat guy who tried to pin the skinny guy against the wall a couple of times right? Never seen that move in a grappling tournament before. So cannot-make-it.I agree, Darren's guy was robbed.  I was sitting beside a ABC guy and he said that he (Jason) must have sucked some guys c#$k for his blue belt. I just laughed...It's all coming back to me now.<br><br>Anyway, I found that tournament  so badly organised. Some poor angmoh broke his leg and there was no ambulance or medic on site...And yes...I thought that many of the judges decisions were questionable. Sometimes, 1 shoulder off the ground also consider pin. Maybe the judges kelong. Needless to say, I would never go to watch one of their tournaments again. Waste time. Plus you are right..There were only a few students who performed submissions. The rest all by pin. Sibeh Sian. You are telling me that ALL the submissions I saw were by Darren's students only?<br><br>But it is so funny...After the tournament, all of the different instructors shake hands like friends lei. Then now I hear they dun like Darren. Aiyo. So beetchy.<br><br>Hmm some of you maybe wondering what martial arts I do....I do KNNBCBHootAH..Singapore Style <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . Aiya. I just like to watch and beetch only lah. But judging from the standard I saw at that competition. I REALLY dun think some of them can even tap a spectator like myself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all this badmouthing is totally unnecessary. We learn an art to improve ourselves. Some people will just be better physically from the start than others, there's no necessity to call anyone a loser or whatever. I can be a karate, judo, bjj, akido, bullshido black belt 9th dan, and Fedor can be in his totally untrained state, and in a fight he'll probably still kick my ass real bad.<br><br>I agree that this Jason guy, if he's really overpowered by a white belt, his belt ranking system is really suspect. Because I understand that you have to be able to tap most of the white belts in your school, and also from other schools in tournaments, before you can be promoted to even a blue.<br><br>I don't think a reputable purple belt will be tapped out by many white belts, maybe one or two out of a lot, because like I said some people are just naturally very good or already have a judo background or even a judo black belt. What I've read on the net says that even a BJJ blue belt can regularly tap out judo black or brown belts.<br><br>And when the term "Darren's guys" are used, did Darren train these people from scratch, or are these people ang mohs from other country who've already trained for many years, or from the Phillipines, and they just fight under Darren's banner? Because if they were already all trained overseas by good teachers and just come to fight here under a certain gym's banner, then they're not really Darren's students right?<br><br>I am very against this kind of attitude because my TKD coach also used to be like that. Very aggressive and belligerent, always want to make trouble and cannot get along with anybody. In the S'pore TKD Federation, he dunno quarrel with how many people, even woman also he quarrel. Somemore in some demo match he go and kick the woman figher's head and make her KO, and still can feel very proud about it and boast to us. I got very sick and tired of his attitude, he's not a sportsman, even though his skill is good and he's my coach, he's just a chow ah beng.<br><br>No social skills one, but he's a construction worker so I can understand. He can fight, but I don't respect his character at all, although he has trained a SEA games gold medalist. I don't think he understand the meaning of sportsmanship. Good thing not many of his students adopt his attitude.<br><br>E.g. I like painting, and have been doing it for years. There was this guy I've known for years who's been practicing painting too. He's actually not very good, but he's very passionate in what he does and it makes him happy and he has experienced personal growth with his painting, and he keeps getting better. I don't consider him a loser, I respect him for his tenacity and passion.<br><br>Normally people don't dislike you because you're doing well or you've won tournaments or you're good etc. That sounds just like what Americans say when people dislike them. Oh..they're jealous of our freedoms, our greatness, our power, our great country, etc. But we know that's not the reason. We dislike them because they're rude, arrogant, pompous and insensitive. Same goes with people. Sakuraba beat Gracie, yet look at how humble he is in victory. I'm sure there is no bad blood between them, and I'm sure the Gracies respect him very much as a fighter and as a person, and not dislike him because he's good.<br><br>When we lose a match, we say judges kelong, not fair, etc. This is really not sportsmanship. This is a very loser attitude. Look at the Thais. They go to china to fight, the chinese govt. rigs the fight by making them wear elbow pads and modifying the rules to favour the sanda fighters. Does the muay thai guy complain? No, he just takes it at that and proceeds to do his best in the ring. That, to me, is the ultimate courage and sportsmanship. They don't argue over every little detail, they just go in and do their best, and they end up kicking everybody's butt anyway. Outside the ring they are humble, courteous and there's no bad blood.<br><br>If all the products of this Darren's gym are like this, I think I'll just give it a pass. Sigh...is it so hard to find a good instructor here in S'pore.</div>

In fact, I think a lot of people take up martial arts because they were bullied as a child. Others take it up because of movies. But I find those that are more interested in "real-world" arts that can be applied have mostly been beaten up or bullied sometime in their lives. It is like this for me too.<br><br>But I don't think we should turn around and become bullies once we become good at fighting, then what different are we from the people who bullied us in the first place? I believe in using my art to give me confidence and give me the option of protecting people who can't protect themselves, not to bully people.<br><br>I have been under the thumb of my terrible instructor for so many years, he'll even humilate us with vulgarities in front of girls in the class if we don't perform up to his standard, so hell if I'll submit myself to this kind of instructor again.<br><br>Some of the best fighters are real nice people, like Geoff Thompson, whom I've met and who's been in hundreds of street fights as a bouncer. But beating up people is his job, but in real life, the guy is very humble and very nice, no tough guy attitude at all.<br><br>Tough guys are people who just haven't found the confidence in themselves to be nice, and need to project a "front" and fake facade to "make" people respect them.</div>

Sigh...is it so hard to find a good instructor here in S'pore.</div></blockquote>You make some good points here.  I apologize on behalf of "Darren's guys" if we came across as such "products."<br><br>Let me share with you briefly how it's been.  I've know Darren since 2002 and as the rest have said, he's not very well-liked by the others in the community.  Why?  I have no idea but as the rest have suggested, could be due to his "relaxed" philosophy when it comes to student-teacher relations, could be due to his success, or it could be that they viewed him as a threat because of his skills (imagine if you were a ranked BJJ exponent who knew you were nowhere near him in skill), etc.  As a student and a friend, it is definitely not due to his attitude.  Darren goes out of his way to help his students and fellow instructors in any way he can.  He let a Kyokushin-karateka to teach in his school when he wanted to start out, helping him market his classes in his advertisements, asking only that he pay for utilities.<br><br>As a result of being, in a sense, an "outcast", he gets funny calls challenging him to fights only not to turn up (Jason challenged Darren to a fight but backed down - this was back in 2003), the school does not get invited to tournaments until the very last minute (leaving us no time to train - but we still win anyway), and if you looked at the internet forums before, he's always been bad-mouthed.  However, through all these, he's managed to persevere and now that his students are numerous enough to defend him online, we seem to have reversed roles on the surface.  But you must understand that whatever shit gets thrown at Darren, is shit thrown at us too and we're tired of it.  Darren doesn't control us and doesn't condone all this.  If you think we're dirty, you should've seen what they were doing.<br><br>I have had personal experience with this Chinatown instructor so my view is biased.  If any of you wish to learn BJJ/grappling, all these schools offer trial lessons.  The best judge of anything is yourself so my suggestion would be to try out each and everyone of these schools, and then decide for yourself.<br><br>Schools that I know of would be: MMA Academy, Jason's Machado school, Kon's Kreation Jiu-jitsu, Chris DeWett's Contact Kinetics and perhaps Budo Academy (although this could be Kon's too).<br><br>Google the schools, I'm too lazy to post the adds.  As for your comments about Darren's fighters not being his products, his fighters are his fighters.  The best examples would be his two best fighters: Bruce and Cain.  The overseas students only form a very small portion and they're usually just visiting.  The student who competed in NAGA was a judo exponent who learnt his groundwork from Darren, a Singaporean.<br><br>Alright, enough nonsense.  Good luck to whoever's searching for a school.  Gotta get ready for training.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Btw, NoRiceBoys, if you're ever interested in checking out Darren's school, drop me a PM.  I'll be glad to show you around.</div>

There is no reason any instructor should make you feel less about yourself. Punishment trainning is a very poor form of motivation, it eats up your sense of self-respect, especially for young people who are growing up and developing their own sense of self awareness. it can be a dangerous thing.<br><br>A mark of a good instructor is his ability to bring out the best in the people around him. not just in terms of skill but also in terms of self-worth. with self-worth, motivation comes naturally.<br><br>this is not to say that he shouldn't push you. He should be pushing you hard to challenge your limits, and you should be knocked down, suffering physically, throwing up buckets, but it should never eroded your self-respect.<br><br>simply said, despite the physical pain if you don't enjoy the company of people and the activity you engage in at some mental level, then you are most probaly in the wrong place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:</div><div class="quote_body">I think all this badmouthing is totally unnecessary. We learn an art to improve ourselves. Some people will just be better physically from the start than others, there's no necessity to call anyone a loser or whatever. I can be a karate, judo, bjj, akido, bullshido black belt 9th dan, and Fedor can be in his totally untrained state, and in a fight he'll probably still kick my ass real bad.<br><br>I agree that this Jason guy, if he's really overpowered by a white belt, his belt ranking system is really suspect. Because I understand that you have to be able to tap most of the white belts in your school, and also from other schools in tournaments, before you can be promoted to even a blue.<br><br>I don't think a reputable purple belt will be tapped out by many white belts, maybe one or two out of a lot, because like I said some people are just naturally very good or already have a judo background or even a judo black belt. What I've read on the net says that even a BJJ blue belt can regularly tap out judo black or brown belts.<br><br>And when the term "Darren's guys" are used, did Darren train these people from scratch, or are these people ang mohs from other country who've already trained for many years, or from the Phillipines, and they just fight under Darren's banner? Because if they were already all trained overseas by good teachers and just come to fight here under a certain gym's banner, then they're not really Darren's students right?<br><br>I am very against this kind of attitude because my TKD coach also used to be like that. Very aggressive and belligerent, always want to make trouble and cannot get along with anybody. In the S'pore TKD Federation, he dunno quarrel with how many people, even woman also he quarrel. Somemore in some demo match he go and kick the woman figher's head and make her KO, and still can feel very proud about it and boast to us. I got very sick and tired of his attitude, he's not a sportsman, even though his skill is good and he's my coach, he's just a chow ah beng.<br><br>No social skills one, but he's a construction worker so I can understand. He can fight, but I don't respect his character at all, although he has trained a SEA games gold medalist. I don't think he understand the meaning of sportsmanship. Good thing not many of his students adopt his attitude.<br><br>E.g. I like painting, and have been doing it for years. There was this guy I've known for years who's been practicing painting too. He's actually not very good, but he's very passionate in what he does and it makes him happy and he has experienced personal growth with his painting, and he keeps getting better. I don't consider him a loser, I respect him for his tenacity and passion.<br><br>Normally people don't dislike you because you're doing well or you've won tournaments or you're good etc. That sounds just like what Americans say when people dislike them. Oh..they're jealous of our freedoms, our greatness, our power, our great country, etc. But we know that's not the reason. We dislike them because they're rude, arrogant, pompous and insensitive. Same goes with people. Sakuraba beat Gracie, yet look at how humble he is in victory. I'm sure there is no bad blood between them, and I'm sure the Gracies respect him very much as a fighter and as a person, and not dislike him because he's good.<br><br>When we lose a match, we say judges kelong, not fair, etc. This is really not sportsmanship. This is a very loser attitude. Look at the Thais. They go to china to fight, the chinese govt. rigs the fight by making them wear elbow pads and modifying the rules to favour the sanda fighters. Does the muay thai guy complain? No, he just takes it at that and proceeds to do his best in the ring. That, to me, is the ultimate courage and sportsmanship. They don't argue over every little detail, they just go in and do their best, and they end up kicking everybody's butt anyway. Outside the ring they are humble, courteous and there's no bad blood.<br><br>If all the products of this Darren's gym are like this, I think I'll just give it a pass. Sigh...is it so hard to find a good instructor here in S'pore.</div></blockquote>dude, you just gotta go try, if you cannot stand it you can always leave. darren won't force you to stay..</div>

In this case martial arts.<br>That way we get an insight to the mind of a typical student of a particular school. From there readers can deduce if they would able to fit into the school's culture.<br><br>whatmore, i think would make more decent conversation. as compared to stating my school is this, has so many champions, has x number of students, etc...<br><br>Let's try to make this thread more insightful</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Thunder a agree and also disagree on what you wrote. i disagree that stating the acheivements would be a negative effect here. i mean whats wrong with stating the acheivements of a school here. if it has produced champions and has a larger number of followers is that not a good sign for a gym?<br><br>i really wish people here can share their experiences and knowledge on martial arts instead of bitching.<br><br>So to get the ball rolling i shall contribute an article or tips on martial arts or self defense every week and hopefully we can all come together and help each other better ourselves. (will try hard as i can as i have limited knowledge on the arts)<br><br></div>

Proof that shows the actual skill level of a gym, such as a video clip. making a claim such as "i was there along with  a dozen other people when we sweep up all the gold medals" isn't good enough. such statements are inconclusive at best and misleading at worst. It leaves too much doubt, for example all the other competitors could be crap.<br><br>a school having a large number of students do not necessarily mean quality. A school with a large number of lousy students is still gonna be a lousy school. A school that has smaller number of students with porportionately high skill level and more importantly a culture that encourages peer learning would be a much better place.<br><br>in short, i would appreciate posts that provide accurate insight and inspire new ways of thinking.</div>
