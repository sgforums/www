            <div class='col-md body'>hi thunder well i guess if you want proof go down to the purple belts class or ask any of his senior students (If they have not run away by now.) heard it's near the cinema in chinatown<br><br>or just drop by his class although it's in a secret location and only a refferal will get you in. (Maybe he want to screen his students to ensure only the weak or stupid joins so that he can tap them out.)<br><br>thunder ask around and maybe you might just get a refferal.<br><br>good luck</div>

Please don't take my post personally, I'm just a very straightforward kind of guy.<br><br>As I said in my other posts, I'm quite a skeptical guy because of my past experience in MA and the tons of bullshat that comes with it.  I don't really care if it's more competition or textbook based, like the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Has Darren's guys wrestled or bjj'ed (or whatever it's called) with Kon's guys before? Has Darren wrestled with Kon before? Who won? What's the score like?<br><br>There's been talk that a white belt has tapped out Jason Qwek a purple belt, but until now, one says he got tapped out once, another 4 times, another that the purple belt was someone else, and nobody can name who's the white belt and where he's from. I don't know if the post was meant to be a promotions/marketing thing to promote a certain gym or to badmouth another gym, but I want to know only the truth. I don't know any of them btw.<br><br>I think having people to train with you from UK and Phillipines does not prove anything, it may just be good marketing. People believe that Sai Baba is God too so people will believe anything.<br><br>So unless there's some proof of it, I'm skeptical. Kon learned from Darren? Is there any proof of that or just heresay? Anyway it doesn't matter who learned from who but who can teach better, and know their stuff better.<br><br>Also what belt is Kon and what belt is Darren in BJJ? I guess BJJ is one of the martial arts where the belt really means something, from what I read anyway.</div>

There's a lot of bullshat flying around, and unless there's a fair and formal contest to find out who's the king of the hill, I'll remain your humble skeptic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey noriceboys<br><br>glad there is a straight forward guy in the arts. And what "Sai baba" is not god?? man i kinda liked the afro. sigh lol<br><br>well firstly about Jason's guys tapping darren's guys. well it's a myth. in fact darren's white belt (a old guy) tapped out jasons blue belt (Shawn a young guy). in fact only darren's  guys tapped their opponents by submission while the other gyms won by judges decision or by pinning. (why call is a submission grappling tournament if no body does submissions.) Well Jason himself could not tap out darrens skinny while belt. and this is not heresay coz i was there myself. In fact i think that fight is in his fight archive.<br><br>Well there was a one of Kons student that i know of who came over to Darren's gym. He got tapped out by the guys there pretty quick. He wanted to join the class by darren did not let him. But darren gave him a few pointers and he was happy.<br><br>Don't know what belt darren is but his student are at least blue as they have been tapping out blue belts from overseas.<br><br>And i think if people from overseas join his gym it's a good sign as darren does not market his school and his student tapped out guys overseas where they train. So these guys wanna know why they got tapped out by a white belt when they are blue and purple, and after learning the moves from darrens student they actually came over to train with him.<br><br>And yes kon actually trained in darrens class before as i saw him in class once when they trained at the singapore drama centre.<br><br>well martial arts is a personal journey. so its all up to you.<br><br>Sai baba is not god??????<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all<br><br>yup but sai baba got one cool arfo? lol<br><br>well i've known darren for year and he's a real friendly and nice guy. has nothing bad to say to anyone. he's alway looking for the positive in people and situations.<br>the man has no egos trust me.<br><br>a story here comes to mind. once a guy came to the gym wanting to learn mma from darren. he was a little down as he was turned down by many gyms due to his condition. (he has only one working arm) he then asked darren whether he could do mma in his condition. darren said what condition? he guy then got angry and said can't you see that i have only one working arm? darren's said that nope i see an oppurtunity to make that working arm the hardest punching arm around coz when we focus to two arms you can solely focus on one and make it the best arm possible. the guy joined up and darren actually modified the techniques to suit him.<br><br>i guess he's not liked as he treats his students as friends and there is no traditional bowing to instructors or calling of "sensei". darren philosophy is if they are better people from training thats enough and if they respect me thats a bonus.<br><br>i also think he's disliked coz he take a technique rip it apart and constructs it again making it better.<br><br>i guess some people hate changes (sometimes even for the better) thats why i think he is disliked.<br><br>funny though coz he always says good stuff about other martial arts instructors in singapore.<br><br>i guess we fear, hate and discriminate what we don't know. sadly human nature<br><br>thats life i suppose</div>
