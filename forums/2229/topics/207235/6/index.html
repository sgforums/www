It as good as saying that I tapped Jacare or Roger Gracie...of course I don't have proof, but if I tell enough naive and gullible newbees they will sure believe it and start spreading the news...that I beat Roger and Jacare. You are just throwing out unsubstansiated statements and when you are asked to prove them, you just repeat the shit...like an old broken record.<br><br>The truth is still that Darren never fights and he has no MMA or grappling background other than books and DVDs. Never seen him at any of the big grappling seminars in Singapore. I guess Darren don't want to "waste time" grappling with low life grapplers like the world famous Matt Thornton or the world class Adam kayoom or any other Singapore grappler outside his own safe house.<br><br>Talk is cheap....walk the walk or shut up!</div>

Well, now I guess have to wait for the results for the upcoming KOTC. BTW, Darren is far from arrogant as many guys here claim. His boys in the gym have a lot of respect for him. And its a good environment there. Eh Brenden, where did you get the Mark Kerr Dvd from? I've been trying to find it, tried HMV and all. Don't have. Oh yes. and Darren can grapple..there is no doubt about that. His standup.....well, he knocked me out...So cant be that bad, giving that he is about 30 kilos lighter than me.</div>

However, speaking to someone and getting that someone's account is NOT proof of anything. That's just words from a person's mouth. And if it is Darren's who you spoke to, that is definately not fair if it is against anyone else. Just like the firstly "story" you kept telling, how true is it? how reliable is your source?<br><br>until now, no one especially you can tell everyone here, what belt is Darren, where did he learn his bjj....... are these questions too difficult to answer?<br><br>BTW, I saw the combat academy website and Darren is indeed quite impressive with his profile there. However, I noticed  there was no mentioning of BJJ at all.<br><br>Oh yah, participating in any competition does not mean one is good. It just show you are a participant. And there are many good MA practitioners who do not participate in competitions too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Albinogorilla,<br><br>Thanks for providing some info.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Ok guys just spoke to the man himself.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Let me clarify this, the guy refers to Darren?<br><br>&gt;&gt;Firstly Jason did get tapped out by a white belt 4 times. I beleive he's from a gym in Sydney. I fu you want his email me and i'll forward it to darren.&lt;&lt;<br><br>I think since this was brought up by you, and because this is called into question, the burden of proof is on you.<br><br>Remember, your post is casting a bad light on someone doing this for a living.<br><br>First, what is the name of the tournament? Where did it take place? When?<br><br>What is the name of the white belt and what is his email address? I volunteer to contact him personally, just provide the information. It shouldn't be so hard. I'll ask him what is his martial arts background and then can a student of Jason contact Jason to verify this. If there is a dispute, let's get both parties here to clarify things.<br><br>I'm not making excuses for anyone, but a white belt in BJJ could have a 4th dan in Judo and competed extensively in Judo tournaments or he could have other competition experience. So unless we make things clear, let's wait for more information before making a judgement.<br><br>And I'm wondering what is a purple belt doing competing against a white belt?<br><br>&gt;&gt;He won his division? He rolled with Sam. An average grappler and could not even submit him. &lt;&lt;<br><br>Who is Sam? Which gym is he from and what is his belt in BJJ?<br><br>&gt;&gt;And someone actually posted the video is some other forum. And he has a purple. &lt;&lt;<br><br>Post the video or the link here pls.<br><br>&gt;&gt;GEEEZZZE how much did that purple cost. Can i get one from toyrus. If so which branch and while section do i go to to get my purple belt.&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm assuming Jason learned under John Will in Australia, if this is wrong someone pls correct me.<br><br>Pls post your name and email address here. I will personally contact John Will to let him know about the dispute of Jason's purple belt and get him to talk to you. You can post the result of the conversation here, and we'll verify that with John Will.<br><br>Your accusation is a very serious one. You're saying that John Will gives out belts like candy, without the person being worthy of it, is that what you're claiming? Pls make that clear so we understand. BJJ is one of the last martial arts where the belt actually means something.<br><br>&gt;&gt;If the dude is the man in grappling what champion has he produced?????&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'll let his students answer this as I have no idea.<br><br>To be fair, since you ask these things about Jason, pls state what champions Darren has produced.<br><br>&gt;&gt; And what championship has he won? &lt;&lt;<br><br>What championships has Darren won?<br><br>&gt;&gt;AND if anyone says he's a very good grappler, how do you assess if he's really good? &lt;&lt;<br><br>His purple belt is given by John Will, and is a legit belt. I checked it some time ago and his name appears on their website.<br><br>What belt in BJJ is Darren? Who are his instructors and what is the lineage? Pls provide this info.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Have you seen him competed against other purples in competition?&lt;&lt;<br><br>Have you proof that he did not compete with purples in Australia? There are no purples in S'pore besides him AFAIK.<br><br>BTW, I don't know if Jason is a new purple or a high purple, to be a new purple, you just have to submit all the blues in your shool and in tournaments with other schools regularly, and if your instructor sees fit he will promote you to purple.<br><br>You then have to validate this belt in competitions against other purples.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The mma gyms guys have gone so far as to compete in NAGA and indonesia to fight professionally. HAS ANY GYM DONE THIS????????&lt;&lt;<br><br>Where is this NAGA held? And which fight in Indonesia? If your claims are true then that's a good sign for the gym.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Next SBG in singapore has any of the UFC fighters trained here with the trainers in the gym. Do they train there CONSISTANTYLY or were there to visit on a PR basis??????? Have they won any Muay Thai, Boxing or MMA event. I think not.<br>GET BACK TO REALITY THIS IS SINGAPORE NOT THE STATES.&lt;&lt;<br><br>I agree that the quality of a gym is in the champions it produces. Fair enough, although I do not know if they have produced champions.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Well can Chris instruct in syncronize swimming? if not then that does not make him a good trainer in any sport. Has any of his guys won anything???&lt;&lt;<br><br>This argument is bullshat. If Chris is a seasoned kyukushin tournament fighter, I'd say he'll be the best instructor in standup techniques of all the others mentioned, simply because of his real competition experience. He still needs good instructional skills though (some people can fight but can't teach) but that's easy to learn compared to the real experience part.<br><br>&gt;&gt;On the other hand the MMA guys keep winning. the last tournament in seletar (where i met them and made friends) i think they won 4 golds 2 silvers and 2 bronze out of SIX weight divisions. If that ain't good what is?????? &lt;&lt;<br><br>That is frankly a very good result. Were all the fighters trained from scratch by Darren? What kind of tournament was it and can the results be verified? Pls give a site link to the governing body or something.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The last grappling tournament they took part in they won at least 60% of the medal and the last boxing won 3 medals.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Pls, if you want to put a claim, you need to NAME THE TOURNAMENT, DATE, VENUE, WHO took part and the names and weight divisions in which they won.<br><br>&gt;&gt;SO COME ON, IF YOU ARE GONNA GET REAL GET OUT OF THE LIE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN AND COME TO YOUR SENSES. HE STARTED GRAPPLING AND MUAY AND MMA BEFORE ANY OF YOU GUYS.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Yes he may have started doing all this before all of us in this forum. But he sure didn't start grappling before Jason I'm sure, he sure didn't have the fighting experience of Chris DeWet.<br><br>To be objective, what do you mean by "started grappling?" Does this entail competiting in grappling tournaments, or does learning off DVDs qualify?<br><br>Started Muay Thai..again what does this entail?<br><br>Doing MMA? Again what does this entail? So someone training with a training partner in a room is to be given more credibility in MMA then someone like Chris Dewet who has competed in numerous bare-knuckle full contact fights in numerous countries?<br><br>&gt;&gt; KON USED TO TRAIN WITH HIM AND I THINK HE KNOWS CHRIS PERSONALLY (SAW THEM TALKING) DUNNO IF HE KNOWS JASON.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Kon used to train with Darren? That is a very sweeping statement that can hide a lot of untruths.<br><br>To be honest, I do not know the facts behind this, but I can give you an example of what I mean.<br><br>E.g. Kon was looking for a class to continue training in BJJ. Darren was the only guy doing this at that time. Kon pays up and goes to his class.<br><br>During the class, Kon sees the BJJ techniques being demonstrated and he goes "WTF!!??!" Did this guy learn of books and video tapes or what? Why the hell am I paying good money to be here learning from someone who knows far less than me?<br><br>"I think I'm going to start my own class if I want to train in a proper way."<br><br>You see how your statement can be partially true, but yet convey the wrong meaning?<br><br>&gt;&gt;And if he is that bad howcome he brings home the medals where the other guys don't. &lt;&lt;<br><br>Please name the medals he has brought home. We are not hero worshipping here, we are finding out the truth. Remember the Dewet is a full contact kyukushin player who has fought and won in many tournaments. I'm sure Jason and Kon have competed in BJJ tournaments too.<br><br>&gt;&gt;i guess he does not compete because he wants to give his students a chance. imagine facing your student in the ring and you won? IS THAT REALLY A VICTORY?????????&lt;&lt;<br><br>You buy this theory? Look I am actually a Nigerian and I have $1,000,000 stuck in a bank, and if you help me I'll give you 10%...<br><br>Albino, thank you for continuing this discussion in a mature manner. I hope we can continue this way and just discuss the facts without insults.<br><br>Have a good day.</div>

I've been trying to find it, tried HMV and all. Don't have. Oh yes. and Darren can grapple..there is no doubt about that. His standup.....well, he knocked me out...So cant be that bad, giving that he is about 30 kilos lighter than me.</div></blockquote>Vingster,<br>Nice to have you on this thread.<br><br>However the fact that he knocked you out makes him a bad instructor in my books. WTH is an instructor doing KO'ing a student?<br><br>And as for grappling, you have to be a good grappler yourself to judge if someone can grapple. I too can learn from tapes and in 2 years know a few moves and if I did it on a complete newbie he will think I'm good.<br><br>But will it win me tournaments? I doubt it.<br><br>I'm sorry, but I'm not trying to get on your back, you sound like a really nice guy, but we just want the facts here.</div>

These are the things that are never said, thanks for clearing that up.<br><br>Not to take away the honour of winning from the guys that fought, they deserved it and earned it, but its things like that which needs to be made clear, old-hand amateur fighters vs. someone fighting his virgin fight.<br><br>We also need to take into account not only the fight experience, but the number of years they've been training. Muay thai doesn't have a belt structure, so it's hard to tell how experienced a competitor is, some instructors allow students to take part after 2 years or less, compared to people who've been training for 5 - 10 years, their chances of winning are definitely slim.<br><br>There is another reason why I always ask for the number of people who took part in each weight division.<br><br>Let me give an example.<br><br>In the amateur boxing tournaments years ago, many of the boxers taking part are from Kadir's boxing gym. It's like the majority of boxers are from his gym. So if Mr. Syed Kadir was to come out and say that my guys won 4 golds and 4 silvers and 4 bronzes, it would sound like his boxers swept the floor at the tournament.<br><br>However, the truth was the majority of people taking part were from his gym. Perhaps there were some representatives from the Gurkha regiment or SPF, and if all these minority club members won a medal, it will still seem like Kadir's boxers are better, simply because of the number of people taking part.<br><br>This is in no way saying that Kadir's boxers are not good, in fact they are one of the best in S'pore, and Mr. Syed is from what I heard a great coach and a great boxer himself, but you see how information not disclosed leads to a wrong conclusion.<br><br></div>

Perhaps BXG fitness students weren't ready to fight yet. Perhaps BXG doesn't have the students. We don't know.<br><br>You also say that BXG sent one professional fighter who won by KO. Wow, so we are to think from your statement that BXG fighters are all good, when they choose to send fighters to compete. Who is this fighter? Was he trained by BXG only or has he been overseas trained all this while, coming back to Singapore and choosing to represent BXG? Is he a trainer who was imported from overseas? We don't know.<br><br>You too, make nice sweeping statements. Again, the ball is in your court. You can make this thread meaningful by taking up my offer. Or, we can continue to bicker like children and nitpick at each other's statements until the cows come home.</div>
