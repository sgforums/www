However, you seem to be the one who's missing the point of my posts. Rather, you seem pretty bent on finding fault with me.<br><br>I stand by the assumption. You just happen to be one of those who probably actually trains. You or someone else would have fallen into this category (those are train), you just happened to mention it. Only you yourself will know whether you have put in the time - 18 months is a very short time (everyday, once a week, once in two months, etc?), I'm just giving you the benefit of the doubt. You could very well be the sh itz, or utter sh it. Behind a computer screen, only you will know.<br><br>The quality of the content depends on the quality of the writer's experience.

Anyone knows who this [b]joker </strong>is?<br><br>- you started the mudslinging by calling people a joker<br><br>Or maybe he just so paiseh that he got tapped out.  It's ok to lose. But why announce it to the world about your purple belt and furthermore teach the art when you got tapped out 4 times! Kimuraguy. I didn't know he got tapped out 4 times. I only heard once. Geeeeeez. that's worse than I thought.<br><br>- then you drag people's name in the mud just because they lost a competition.<br><br>somebody pm'ed me the <strong>joker </strong>name already<br>- more mudslinging<br><br>So it's ok that you insult this Jason guy, but it's not ok that people ask questions about Darren? Nobody even said anything about this Darren guy except that a lot of people dislike him, which could be true if he churns out losers like yourself.<br><br>Again for the record I don't know any of these people and just want to point out the discrepencies in your posts. You talk of this competition that competition but you can't even name where the competition was held, what the date was, how many schools take part, the results etc.<br><br>Just good at talking crap about others only. People who dare to take part in the competition are better than losers like you who only sit there and watch and then make fun of those who lose. If you'll join you'll probably get your ass kicked by even the lousiest grappler in the competition. At least they had the guts to join.<br><br>So people say that Darren is disliked, they are pricks, and you're not one yourself when you call everybody else names?<br><br>Now you go on and insult other instructors also? So who's the biggest prick?<br><br>So just because people say that Darren is not well-liked they are cocksuckers, so by that logic you must live under Darren's table? You must also be losing hair from the top of your head from banging your head on the underside of his table so often?<br><br>If my mum's a man I shudder to think what your mother is, you albino gorilla. Was your mum the albino dog or the albino gorilla bitch that got raped?<br><br>Loser.[/b]</blockquote>Ok. here goes. I asked the forum if they knew who the clown was. And you f kers go on and on about this school and that school.  Now. I didn't start the mudslinging did I, you c nt? As for who is the biggest prick...I am. Dun hate me for being well hung. SO you lil wanke r, listen and stop listening to that voice in your lil head. take your lips of your mother's fanny and talk some sense. And if you are looking for a fight. Bring it. I've never turned one down. But please learn how to argue. You can practice with your imagiinary girlfriend. C U N T.</div>

Listen, YOU are a prick. You. That doesn't mean you're well hung. It means you're a prick, you uneducated dipshit. If you have a problem with Jason, you know where to find him. Don't be a dipshit and badmouth people behind your keyboard on the internet. If you have any real balls, go call him a clown to his face.<br><br>I'm wondering, do you own a martial arts business yourself? Because your nick sure reminds me of someone that looks like an albino gorilla. I hope you're not so low that you badmouth others to make your own business look good you dipshit.<br><br>Let me give you a clue, since you seem to lack one.<br><br>Fighting != success in life.<br><br>Being able to fight, doesn't make your arguments any stronger, or your points more factual.<br><br>Until now, you still can't provide a single fact about the tournament you're talking about. No venue, no date, no names of schools participating, no official results, nothing. I'll have to call bullshit on that. White belt submitting a purple belt? Where's the proof? Where's the video? I can start a thread and say I heard you were knocked out in a fight by a 17-yr old skinny gay boy too and later got ass-raped.<br><br>Are you doing this to discredit someone else's business, dipshit?

What's Darren's belt?<br><br>This way, we can see more clearly.<br><br>And those how mocked at the instructors, have you challanged them personally since you can say until they are so bad?
