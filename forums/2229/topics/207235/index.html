            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno stelazio. Nobody knows. It's so secretive. Maybe it's an underground dojo... like the kumite from the movie bloodsport! Or maybe he just so paiseh that he got tapped out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">It's ok to lose. But why announce it to the world about your purple belt and furthermore teach the art when you got tapped out 4 times! Kimuraguy. I didn't know he got tapped out 4 times. I only heard once. Geeeeeez. that's worse than I thought.</div>

You know grappling but you do not know BJJ.<br><br>BJJ stands for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It has an overwhelming emphasis on ground fighting and contains many chokes and joint locks. So yes, I guess it has quite a bit to do with people rolling on the ground.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It is, as some would say, "t3h gh3y".

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya lor Black belt Jones, I also agree. you talking about the chinatown one right? Or you talking about THE OTHER purple belt that got tapped out? So far the grappling tournaments here I go and see, only got 1 purple belt lei. and the last time I see him grapple, I think he had to give his instructor bj for his bjj blue belt (At that time he still blue). He won that one...but everyone who saw the tounament thought he must be doing 'undertable' for event organiser. But so funny right? I dunno anything about this dojo in Selegie though? Anybody have any idea of this other underground dojo?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow did not know there was so many purple belts in singapore.........<br><br>well what i found out that a guys named jason who used to teach somewhere near peranakan place was the one that got tapped out 4 times in 4 mins by a white belt.<br><br>who's eric by the way??? another purple belt?????<br><br>darren overrated.....man you must have not met him and grappled with him in person. i was present in some grappling tournament where his white belt was grappling with the purple belt bjj guy from peranakan place and the purple belt COULD NOT EVEN TAP HIM OUT.<br><br>But darren rolls with this guy and taps him out every time in a min. (The bet is that if darren can't tap him out in a min he owns the guy a drink.)<br><br>so please meet the guy and grapple with him and then tell me he is over rated. By the way he has produce a number of grappling champions locally and overseas.<br><br>has any school won anything overseas? His students have won bjj championships as far as America.<br><br>So unless you have walked the walk talk about the walk. if not sssshhhhhh and keep quite</div>
