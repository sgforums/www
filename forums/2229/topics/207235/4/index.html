I don't give a flying f**k as to whether you're convinced or not. If you want to learn something, put in the effort. Don't expect EASY ANSWERS.<br><br>Join whatever school you want to. The more people learning BJJ or grappling, the bigger and better the community. Back when we started, there was practically no information on the internet regarding this, much less your youtube videos. Credible online information is still scare but now, all of you expect the easy way out. I can't be bothered.<br><br>Instead of asking for youtube videos and the like, asking for the addresses of the various schools would be more constructive.</div>

For me, competitions are the best places for me to do this.

Without UFC, we will still be in the dark about what works and what doesn't. Without cross-training comptitions, akido people think that their art can help them defend themselves in a street confrontation. Some even think taiji will help you in self-defense. A friendly competition with a kyukushin karate, muay thai or BJJ fighter will change that misconception very quickly, and help us learn. All it takes is a hard thigh or liver kick and most people will immediately be unable to continue. I know because I've taken one before. Hell, just watch some clips on youtube, and you'll see even gigantic muscle bound boxers get incapacitated by a few thigh kicks.<br><br>I guess I'm a truth seeker.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mudslinging? Who the hell was mudslinging? Was asking about an instructor. The mudslinging began when you pricks turned it into a forum on darren. That's when it began. You want mudslinging? Here goes. I think Jason an Kon are a bunch of wankers who have no idea of what they are doing and probably have rich families to pay for their belts. I think you probably learn from one of them and that's why are so defensive. either that or you suck their c#ocks for a hobby. And last but not least, I think your mum's a man.</div>

Anyone knows who this <strong>joker </strong>is?<br><br>- you started the mudslinging by calling people a joker<br><br>Or maybe he just so paiseh that he got tapped out.  It's ok to lose. But why announce it to the world about your purple belt and furthermore teach the art when you got tapped out 4 times! Kimuraguy. I didn't know he got tapped out 4 times. I only heard once. Geeeeeez. that's worse than I thought.<br><br>- then you drag people's name in the mud just because they lost a competition.<br><br>somebody pm'ed me the <strong>joker </strong>name already<br>- more mudslinging<br><br>So it's ok that you insult this Jason guy, but it's not ok that people ask questions about Darren? Nobody even said anything about this Darren guy except that a lot of people dislike him, which could be true if he churns out losers like yourself.<br><br>Again for the record I don't know any of these people and just want to point out the discrepencies in your posts. You talk of this competition that competition but you can't even name where the competition was held, what the date was, how many schools take part, the results etc.<br><br>Just good at talking crap about others only. People who dare to take part in the competition are better than losers like you who only sit there and watch and then make fun of those who lose. If you'll join you'll probably get your ass kicked by even the lousiest grappler in the competition. At least they had the guts to join.<br><br>So people say that Darren is disliked, they are pricks, and you're not one yourself when you call everybody else names?<br><br>Now you go on and insult other instructors also? So who's the biggest prick?<br><br>So just because people say that Darren is not well-liked they are cocksuckers, so by that logic you must live under Darren's table? You must also be losing hair from the top of your head from banging your head on the underside of his table so often?<br><br>If my mum's a man I shudder to think what your mother is, you albino gorilla. Was your mum the albino dog or the albino gorilla bitch that got raped?<br><br>Loser.</div>
