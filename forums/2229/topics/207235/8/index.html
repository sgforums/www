[in BJJ] But if Andrew Gorton thinks he's a blue belt, then that's Andrew's credibility as a blue belt world champion on the line. Remember, in grappling/BJJ, you're constantly rolling with your students. Your skill is always on the line. It's not how well your kata looks, it's how well u apply the moves and teach. Exactly why I was training with a multiple times will-machado former white belt (he's a blue now) BJJ champion (in Melbourne) this very afternoon under Darren. =)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank you for sharing. It just show how bias you are.<br><br>Compared to showing off medal tallies of unknown competitions, it is obvious.<br><br>Why do you have to resort to personal attack against me? I am just comparing since you accused the purple belt of being proud because he mentioned a little incident.</span><br><br>So basically when you mean comparing..you're saying that both are bad, just that one is LESS bad than the other? This is your argument?<br><br>Ah I see..coming on to the internet and saying he tapped a white belt, 4x in a min is..a little incident? Different people have different opinions. So i'm going to email John Will now and quote YOU and JASON"S SCHOOL - MACHADO SG stating that going on the internet and telling people that a purple tapping out a white 4x in a min..is a little incident. Oh not to forget that you, jason's underling also question other instructor's belt and skill level.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I am sorry if "boast" hurt, but so far everyone can see how you guys attack another and kept on promoting Darren by "sharing proudly without shame" (this is not boasting?) about their "achievements" but unable to tell which particular competitions. However, thank you for showing how bias you are since using "joker" to insult another is acceptable but using "boasting" hurts you badly.</span><br><br>Actually no, not at all..boasting does not hurt me badly. Its the way you use words to bring people down. Seems like you are one of those people who shoot their mouth off on the street.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I am not sure about his students, but there are all kind of students in a school. And how do you judge? Bringing it to a personal level because you are unable to deal with the issue itself? Avoid my questions?</span><br><br>Oh boy i don't judge, do you?<br>Questions? Again..what are you talking about?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You are indeed shameless to simply avoid, twist the entire thing around and then blame ME. WOW!</span><br><br>Bringing it to a personal level because you are unable to deal with the issue itself? Sounds familiar? Hey two can play the same game..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Excuse me, but asking what belt he is holding and where he previously trained in BJJ is ATTACK?</span><br><br>Woah suddenly you're a nice guy now huh..i can even feel all the politeness in this sentence. Why don't you go back and read what you have written when you 'asked' about his belt and skill level.<br><br>I am just finding out more since it was not available on his profile. I even praised he got an impressive profile! But nothing about BJJ.<br><br>Make myself look good? I am not the one boasting about my medals! How can this make me look good?<br><br>Sure it can..go think about it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Until now, how did anyone bash Darren? By asking? While what did you do? Mockery at the purple belt?</span><br><br>I mock at the purple belt?..why don't you quote me again? you're good at that, don't you?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">And since the students of Darren HERE are bashing the purple belt Jason, why not go there and experience the truth? It is not some underground training as suggested by you guys, the address is there, available to everyone. Go there and make Jason tap out! Prove yourself! No one can argue anymore if you succeed. If you fail to, what will that show?</span><br><br>Prove myself whatever for?..no actually i'm scared, he might ask his student to come on here and said that he tap me 10x in a min.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">BTW, I am just speaking from a neutral point of view as a stand up MA practitioner who had very limited grappling training. I just cannot stand people manipulating on forums to attack another. Not happy, go challange. Talk is cheap! And the school is not very far from North Canal Road either.</span><br><br>I think you need to realise that some people do not just go challenge another person, just because one is "not happy". Ah i get it, you must be "from da streets". Now that's tough.</div>
