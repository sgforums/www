            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;Thanks for the link. We all know Jason is a legit purple belt but if you go back to the first post, the thread starter was asking about rumours he or she heard about Jason being submitted by a white belt.. 4 times or something. He was questioning his skill, not his belt. &lt;&lt;<br><br>So are you saying that John Will gives out BJJ belts when the person is not deserving, is that what you're implying?<br><br>If the question is with Jason's skill level, Albino could easily have requested to have a friendly roll with Jason and find it out, or even just ask to roll with his students to find out their skill level, not post a backstabbing email and be a keyboard cowboy here on the forums. That is the polite thing to do.<br><br>I think there are no rumours, you guys could easily have verified the truth if you wanted to. Let me know if you'd like me to pull up all the previous posts to prove this to you.<br><br>This smells to me like a personal vendetta. And I think you guys know each other, it's clear that you are from MMA Academy, and Albinogorilla is affilated with the gym. In fact, I have a good idea who he is.<br><br>&gt;&gt;There is no contention about Jason's belt.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Then you do know that in BJJ, a person's belt is representative of his skill level don't you? This can be easily resolved if you have any contentions.<br><br>&gt;&gt;As for Darren, he teaches submission grappling and MMA. He doesn't teach BJJ. If you come down to the gym, you will see that we train no-gi. Nobody ever said Darren taught BJJ. So what's your beef?&lt;&lt;<br><br>http://www.mma-academy.com/coursesched.htm<br><br>See BJJ there?<br><br>http://www.combatacademy.com.sg/index.html<br><br>See Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu there?<br><br>My beef is with someone badmouthing a legitimate practioner/instructor by someone else without providing any kind of proof, in the false pretense that it is for the reason of "clearing up a rumour."<br><br>The irony is that the person doing the badmouthing is the one from a gym which has no verifiable credentials at all in the said art.<br><br>So my beef is with bullshat.<br><br>On hindsight it was wrong of me to bring Darren into this discussion. He has nothing to do with this (I hope) and I apologize.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Clearly, you seem to be well-versed in the MA scene here. &lt;&lt;<br><br>No I'm not, it's nothing that a few phone calls and some research will not dig up.<br><br>&gt;&gt;You would also know that online documentation is poor, if any of it even exists. Your link is to an Australian website - the sport is highly developed there. Do you see many kung fu schools with websites up? Not many.&lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm not asking for a website. I'm asking for the name of the person who awarded him his said belt in BJJ, and his contact info if any. It is not difficult to find out if this person is legit and did give out the belt, as long as I can have his name.<br><br>&gt;&gt;So, stop asking for ONLINE proof.&lt;&lt;<br><br>See above. You know, if I really had certifications and someone asked me to prove it, I will have no problems proving it to you.<br><br>&gt;&gt;You clearly know that none of it exists and you are using that to your benefit. &lt;&lt;<br><br>I know that the legit belt rankings don't exist? I know that what doesn't exist?<br><br>&gt;&gt;If you are genuinely not trying to stir shit, PM me and I'll bring you down to Darren's and you can have a go. Perhaps we can also visit the other schools together and we can come back here to give a fair assessment of the various schools.  &lt;&lt;<br><br>I'm not trying to stir shit. I'm trying to clear up an allegation that was started by someone else. Do not change the subject. While you're at it, pls invite him back to clarify the questions we have for him.<br><br>Define "fair assessment." So far, nothing that I've seen that's been posted has been fair. And that's the reason this thread has dragged on so long.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The ball is in your court.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Now it's in yours.</div>

So far, no one attacked Darren but his student(s) had been attacking another instructor who is even listed in a legitimate BJJ academy.<br><br>The question remained unanswered --- where did Darren learn his BJJ and what belt is he holding?<br><br>Till now, I think I have asked 3 times and no answer but the usual derailing to what people dun like darren, people jealous of him.<br><br>For goodness sake! I even praised Darren for his impressive profile in Combat Academy's site! But BJJ is missing from his profile. And the issue here is BJJ right from the start.<br><br>Who has been picking? Right from the start, it is obviously this is targeted at the purple belt. He was insulted. His class was insulted. His students were insulted.<br><br>Why are Darren's "loyalists" so against the purple belt? Could it not be the same reasons they gave for people "against" Darren? If they felt Darren suffered prejudices from others, then why are they commiting the SAME onto others?<br><br>It's a shame, and this reflect badly on Darren. And this is totally unfair to Darren too.<br><br>sigh</div></blockquote>Did you not attack darren with the questions you asked? You, questioning his skills and belt is also attacking another instructor.<br><br>Yes you did praised him but you also insinuate slyly that bjj is missing from his profile. Don't make yourself look good.<br><br>The rest about darren i'm not commenting b/c i'm not his student, so i don't know much. I'm not siding with any one here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh... an extremely long post to reply to.<br><br>First up, thanks for the name of the BXG fighter. Was he trained up by BXG or did he go overseas to train and compete, came back and chose BXG to represent? I'm asking becaue I don't know.<br><br>&gt;&gt;So are you saying that John Will gives out BJJ belts when the person is not deserving, is that what you're implying?&lt;&lt;<br><br>Nope, that's what the thread starter implied.<br><br>&gt;&gt;I think there are no rumours, you guys could easily have verified the truth if you wanted to.

Settle this with him. I have no idea.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Then you do know that in BJJ, a person's belt is representative of his skill level don't you? This can be easily resolved if you have any contentions.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Maybe that's the issue. So since Brenden, a multiple white belt champion from Melbourne, from the same lineage, is here. Why don't you ask him what he thinks? I'm sure he should be a good judge. He has chosen not to train with Jason. What are Jason's competitive credentials anyway. I can't seem to find them online.<br><br>A BJJ belt is indeed supposed to be a representative of a person's skill level. I have a friend who was under Bruno Pano of Gracie Sydney. He's not there anymore - working in HK. He's a white belt still and according to him, Bruno only promotes you to the next belt if you top your division in your state, i.e. u become the white belt champion, then u get promoted. That's a high standard to uphold and maybe not all practioners follow that. So some blue/purple/etc belts are harder to come by then others.<br><br>&gt;&gt;On hindsight it was wrong of me to bring Darren into this discussion. He has nothing to do with this (I hope) and I apologize.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Actually, it was his students who did that and we kind of cornered ourselves Mr. Logical Proof. So no worries.<br><br>&gt;&gt;No I'm not, it's nothing that a few phone calls and some research will not dig up.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Dude, not so free leh.<br><br>&gt;&gt;I'm not asking for a website. I'm asking for the name of the person who awarded him his said belt in BJJ, and his contact info if any. It is not difficult to find out if this person is legit and did give out the belt, as long as I can have his name.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Darren is currently a blue belt and was awarded the belt by Andrew Gorton of Roots Academy in Sydney under Paulo Guimaraes. Andrew Gorton was a former BJJ blue belt world champion. He's a purple now. Did some quick googling and here's what I found: (search for "Andrew Gorton" on the pages)<br><br><a href="http://www.cbjjo.com.br/resultados/campeonatos2003/campeonatosem2003/copadomundo2003/resultados.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbjjo.com.br/resultados/campeonatos2003/campeonatosem2003/copadomundo2003/resultados.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.onzuka.com/news_2004July2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onzuka.com/news_2004July2.html</a><br><br><a href="http://www.cbjjo.com.br/resultados/campeonatos2004/copadomundo2004/resultados.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbjjo.com.br/resultados/campeonatos2004/copadomundo2004/resultados.htm</a><br><br>Paulo is a 2nd generation Rickson Gracie black belt.

You, questioning his skills and belt is also attacking another instructor.<br><br>Yes you did praised him but you also insinuate slyly that bjj is missing from his profile. Don't make yourself look good.<br><br>The rest about darren i'm not commenting b/c i'm not his student, so i don't know much. I'm not siding with any one here. Just feeling some of you so-called "defenders" are guilty of bashing others too.<br><br></div></blockquote>Excuse me, but asking what belt he is holding and where he previously trained in BJJ is ATTACK?<br><br>I am just finding out more since it was not available on his profile. I even praised he got an impressive profile! But nothing about BJJ.<br><br>Make myself look good? I am not the one boasting about my medals! How can this make me look good? I just saw a thread here with one aim that is to bash a purple belt and then filled with baseless and contradicting attacks. So to be fair, I asked anyone to share their background. Blackgorilla shared a summary of it and I thank him for that.<br><br>To be fair to Darren, I cannot simply take blackgorilla's words. I mean, he mentioned Darren learnt from books and DVDs. So I was asking, hopefully Darren's supporters can share the truth. How is this attacking? Unless, what blackgorilla shared is the truth, and Darren indeed learn BJJ from books and DVDs, otherwise this is a good chance for Darren's supporters to show to everyone.<br><br>Until now, how did anyone bash Darren? By asking? While what did you do? Mockery at the purple belt?<br><br>Sorry folks, I do not look down on Darren, I do not dislike him either. I would say the same about his students HERE base on their behaviour here.<br><br>I saw his profile and it was quite impressive. But the fact remain, he is obviously proficient in Boxing, Hapkido and probably self-defense. The issue here is however regarding BJJ. Therefore, if I were to train with him, I will learn boxing, hapkido and maybe self-defense too. If I were to train BJJ, I will find a legitimate instructor with proper background from a genuine academy.<br><br>And since the students of Darren HERE are bashing the purple belt Jason, why not go there and experience the truth? It is not some underground training as suggested by you guys, the address is there, available to everyone. Go there and make Jason tap out! Prove yourself! No one can argue anymore if you succeed. If you fail to, what will that show?<br><br>BTW, I am just speaking from a neutral point of view as a stand up MA practitioner who had very limited grappling training. I just cannot stand people manipulating on forums to attack another. Not happy, go challange. Talk is cheap! And the school is not very far from North Canal Road either.<br><br>Please share when you guys going down. I am sure some members here would like to be witness for you guys. And we can share the evidence!<br><br></div>

I'm asking becaue I don't know.<br><br>&gt;&gt;So are you saying that John Will gives out BJJ belts when the person is not deserving, is that what you're implying?&lt;&lt;<br><br>Nope, that's what the thread starter implied.<br><br>&gt;&gt;I think there are no rumours, you guys could easily have verified the truth if you wanted to. Let me know if you'd like me to pull up all the previous posts to prove this to you.<br><br>This smells to me like a personal vendetta. And I think you guys know each other, it's clear that you are from MMA Academy, and Albinogorilla is affilated with the gym. In fact, I have a good idea who he is.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Good for you. Settle this with him. I have no idea.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Then you do know that in BJJ, a person's belt is representative of his skill level don't you? This can be easily resolved if you have any contentions.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Maybe that's the issue. So since Brenden, a multiple white belt champion from Melbourne, from the same lineage, is here. Why don't you ask him what he thinks? I'm sure he should be a good judge. He has chosen not to train with Jason. What are Jason's competitive credentials anyway. I can't seem to find them online.<br><br>A BJJ belt is indeed supposed to be a representative of a person's skill level. I have a friend who was under Bruno Pano of Gracie Sydney. He's not there anymore - working in HK. He's a white belt still and according to him, Bruno only promotes you to the next belt if you top your division in your state, i.e. u become the white belt champion, then u get promoted. That's a high standard to uphold and maybe not all practioners follow that. So some blue/purple/etc belts are harder to come by then others.<br><br>&gt;&gt;On hindsight it was wrong of me to bring Darren into this discussion. He has nothing to do with this (I hope) and I apologize.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Actually, it was his students who did that and we kind of cornered ourselves Mr. Logical Proof. So no worries.<br><br>&gt;&gt;No I'm not, it's nothing that a few phone calls and some research will not dig up.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Dude, not so free leh.<br><br>&gt;&gt;I'm not asking for a website. I'm asking for the name of the person who awarded him his said belt in BJJ, and his contact info if any. It is not difficult to find out if this person is legit and did give out the belt, as long as I can have his name.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Darren is currently a blue belt and was awarded the belt by Andrew Gorton of Roots Academy in Sydney under Paulo Guimaraes.
