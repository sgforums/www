Although it is classified in the same category as tajiquan and baguazhang, it is offensive when compared with these two.<br><br>Xingyi mindset is simple, just get offensive. They don't dodge when being hit by others, but will catch their opponent's hands and neutralize the attack. Most of the time, they will attack the opponents when their opponents' punches or kicks are being neutralize.<br><br>We also uses a linear system, meaning we move straight into the opponent, rather than sidestepping them.<br><br>Qigong is compulsory for xingyiquan as we don't use force to neutralize the attack, but internal energy to do so. Even when attacking opponents, no brute force is used. Just internal energy. A seemingly light tap is very painful, it feels as if a stone had dropped on you. My master loves to use try this out on new members, and I had a taste of it. Painful, although he didn't hit me. He tapped me only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of principles in Wing Chun are applicable in Xingyiquan. Their thinking and Xingyi's thinking is the same. The only difference lies in that Xingyiquan has no kicks while Wing Chun has (not a lot). Wing Chun is also much gentler than Xingyiquan, as this art originates from a woman and is specially for women and children. Xingyiquan has hidden kicks. The kicks are not obvious. Until you learn Xingyiquan, you won't know what I am talking about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some principles of Xingyiquan</span></strong><br><br>Xingyiquan's principles is somewhat the same as Wing Chun.<br><br><strong>Practicality</strong><br><br>Xingyi was designed purely for fighting rather than artistic or sport applications. As such, its techniques emphasise practicality and effectiveness over aesthetic or athletic value. Most strikes are fatal and target vulnerable areas of the body such as the throat and eyes.<br><br><strong>Economy of Movement</strong><br><br>Most Xingyi movements are linear and initiated along an imaginary line of attack, or the centerline. The pao quan (cannon punch), for example, is delivered centrally from the practitioner's chest rather than diagonally from the shoulders in the first two forms. This helps teach the centerline concept, but in later forms the punch is delivered from the practitioner's shoulder to the centerline, because the distance is shorter than bringing the hand from the shoulder to the center of the chest, and then to travel down the centerline at your opponent. Also, as an expression of one's skill and experience, the punch is delivered from any starting point in time and space, to a specific finishing point in space where both the centerline and your opponent meet. This is achieved through successful negotiation of the centerline through any weakness found in your opponent's pressure.<br><br>Xingyi uses all four limbs in fighting because this offers the practitioner more options in selecting the best limb for the task. The legs seemed as if it is not utilized, which in fact, are being utilized. Xingyi legs are called "hidden" legs, because you can get hit by the practitioner in the leg yet not see their legs moved a bit.<br><br><strong>Efficiency</strong><br><br>Xingyi stresses that one must deflect punches or blows, not block them. That is because if you block, you will expose your body. Exposing your body means the attacker can find vulnerable points in your body and attack you. However, if you deflect, your hands and legs are still close to your body. Since they are close to your body, you can move faster than your opponent. Deflecting your opponent's punches or blows are also meant to offset their balance. Experienced practitioners will be able to do this. Beginners will find this hard and find themselves blocking all the time.<br><br><strong>Centerline</strong><br><br>The following should not be considered an authoritative work, Center Line Theory is not something that found from reading about it, one should discover their own center line under the guidence of a qualiied sifu.<br><br>Xingyi emphasizes attack and defense along an imaginary horizontal line drawn from the center of the practioner's chest to the center of the enemy's chest. The human body's prime striking targets are considered to be on or near this line. Most of the deadly points are also located more or less along this line, and if you are attacked in your centrepoint, it is usually fatal.<br><br>A Xingyi practitioner will strive to protect his centerline and attack his opponent's. Footwork is used to offset you from your enemy's centerline while keeping your enemy in yours. Most hand techniques place one hand close to the chest, to ward off punches that manage to get past the lead hand. The elbows are kept low, to protect your vulnerable spots on body, and keep your structure strong (elbows should be a fists distance from the body).<br><br>Xingyi techniques are "closed", the limbs drawn in to protect the centerline and also to maintain balance. Generally, the hands do not move beyond the vertical circle that is described by swinging the arms in front, with the hands crossed at the wrists. To reach outside this area, footwork is used.<br><br>One subtle advantage of attacking the centerline is force redirection, or rather the lack of it. Hitting someone on the side (for example the shoulder) will cause the recipient's body to twist, harmlessly dissipating a portion of the attacking energy. Hitting someone in the center causes more of the energy to be transmitted to the body. (The closer the line of force is to the center of mass, the less torque, and thus less rotation, result.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Xingyi punch</strong><br><br>All kicks are kept below the waist for speed and to avoid being grabbed by an opponent's faster hands.<br><br>Even though in the previous post I mentioned that we have "hidden" legs, not all  forms have it. Some forms, like the dragon, will kick the opponent.<br><br>Punches are thrown with the elbow down and in front of the body. The fist is held vertical and the contact points are the bottom three knuckles.<br><br>Xingyi favors the vertical punch for the following reasons:<br><br>1) Speed. Because the fist is not loaded by first pulling the elbow behind the body, the vertical punch is faster than a conventional roundhouse punch. This sacrifices power for speed and directness. Xingyi mitigates this disadvantage by training the practitioner to generate power with alternate methods (internal energy or qi)<br><br>2) Protection. Keeping the elbow low and forward protects the front midsection of the body whereas pulling the elbow back would expose it. The unconventional elbow position makes it more difficult for an opponent to execute an elbow lock/break. This also aids in generating power by use of the entire body stucture rather than only the arm to strike.<br><br>3) Alignment &amp; Structure. The vertical punch allows a practitioner to absorb the rebound of the punch by directing it through the elbows and into the stance. In contrast, the rebound of the horizontal punch creates torque in the puncher's body.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After learning for half a year, I finally grasp one concept that my master has been saying: "Relax your body"<br><br>Relaxing your body makes your muscles more flexible, therefore allowing you to hit better without using much strength. Xingyi stress on using one's internal strength to beat opponents, not muscular strength. Parts of my body are quite relaxed now, and I can hit better without using too much muscular strength.<br><br>Still don't have much internal strength, so still using muscular strength.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The power from Xingyi techniques comes from the whole structure of the human body in coordination.  For example, the 'Beng' or 'Crushing Fist', comes from the forward movement of the whole body, initiated by the stepping in of the front feet, which is followed up by the stepping in of the rear feet almost simultaneously.<br><br>Both the foward momentum of the body, sinking of the center of gravity, and the stepping in of the rear foot, are the sources of the power, which is then transmitted by the turning of the waist and the torsor.<br><br>The shoulders and arms then transmit the power of the punch.<br><br>The forward hand will pull-back and the punching hand (the rear hand) will punch forward at solar plexus level, simultaneously.  Both arms keep close to the body.<br><br>In other words, power actually comes from the feet first.  That's is why, mastering and standing in the 'SanTi' Posture exercise is very important.  It trains you in the correct posture and strengthen your legs.<br><br>Relaxing of muscles and body parts before a strike, only facilitates the transmission of power, by allowing the body move in coordination and providing a smooth path for power transmission.<br><br>Therefor, relaxing muscles or body before strike cannot increase your striking power if the above factors are not present (body coordination and 'Santi' posture)<br><br>It is hard to explain the mechanics of a technique in words, I have try my best in the above explanation, eventually, it is up to the individual to practise to fully understand and master the technique.<br><br><blockquote></blockquote></div>
