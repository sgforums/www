            <div class='col-md body'>Kendo (剣道 Kendō, 劍道<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , which is the modern martial art of Japanese fencing, developed from traditional techniques of Japanese swordsmanship known as kenjutsu. Since 1975 the goal of Kendo has been stated by the All Japan Kendo Federation as "to discipline the human character through the application of the principles of the katana (the Japanese standard two handed sword)". However, Kendo combines martial arts values with sport elements, with some practitioners stressing the former and others the latter.<br><br>Taught using "swords" made of split bamboo (shinai) and extensive protective armour (Bogu), practitioners are called kendoka or "kenshi". Kendoka merely means one who practices kendo. Kenshi means swordsman. Both terms are used, though many clubs have a preference for one term. Kendoka also use bokuto (wooden katana) to practice set forms known as kata. On formal occasions, real swords or metal swords with a blunt edge, called habiki, can be used. There are 10 basic kata.<br>Contents<br>[hide]<br><br>* 1 History<br>* 2 Modern Kendo<br>* 3 Ranking<br>* 4 See also<br>* 5 External links<br>o 5.1 Organizations<br><br>[edit]<br><br>History<br>Kendo at an agricultural school in Japan around 1920<br>Enlarge<br>Kendo at an agricultural school in Japan around 1920<br><br>Kendo, "The Way of The Sword", embodies the essence of the Japanese fighting arts. Since the earliest samurai government in Japan, during the Kamakura period (1185-1233), sword fencing, together with horse riding and archery, were the main martial pursuits of the military clans. In this period Kendo developed under the strong influence of Zen Buddhism. The samurai could equate the disregard for his own life in the heat of battle, which was considered necessary for victory in individual combat, to the Buddhist concept of the illusory nature of the distinction between life and death. Since that time many warriors have become enlightened through Kendo practice. Those swordsmen established schools of Kendo training which continued for centuries, and which form the basis of Kendo practice today. The names of the schools reflect the essence of the originatorÂ’s enlightenment. Thus the Itto-Ryu (Single sword school) indicates the founderÂ’s illumination that all possible cuts with the sword emanate from and are contained in one original essential cut. The Muto (sword less school) expresses the comprehension of the originator Yamaoka Tesshu, that "There is no sword outside the mind". The 'Munen Muso RyuÂ’ (No Intent, No preconception) similarly expresses the understanding that the essence of Kendo transcends the reflective thought process.<br><br>The formal Kendo exercises set down sometimes several centuries ago are studied today using wooden swords in set forms, or 'kata'. Training using bamboo practice swords and substantial armour includes both formal exercises and free fencing. Thus today it is possible to embark on the quest for spiritual enlightenment followed by the samurai of old. Concepts such as 'Mushin', or 'empty mind' as professed by exponents of Zen are an essential attainment for high level Kendo. Fudoshin, or 'Unmoving Mind', a conceptual attribute of the deity Fudo Myo-O, one of the five 'Kings of Light' of Shingon Buddhism, implies that the fencer cannot be led astray by delusions of anger, doubt, fear, or surprise arising from his opponentÂ’s actions.<br><br>In 1920, DaiNippon Butoku Kai (大日本武徳会, developer of the Japan Martial Arts Foundation) changed the name of Gekiken (撃剣, "hitting sword") to Kendo.<br>[edit]<br><br>Modern Kendo<br><br>In modern kendo, there are two types of attacks - strikes and thrusts. Strikes are allowed against only certain areas on the body. The valid targets are men (top of the opponent's head), sayu-men or "yoko-men"(the left and right side of the opponent's head), right kote, or wrist at any time, the left kote when it is in a raised position (such as jodan), the left or right do (in tournament situations points are rarely awarded for striking the left side of the opponent's do). Thrusts are only allowed to the throat (tsuki). However, since a wrongly done thrust could injure the neck, thrust techniques are often left out at the starting level and practiced at later levels.<br><br>In matches, a point is only awarded when the attack is done firmly and properly to any of the allowed targets with Ki-ken-tai-ichi, or spirit, sword, and body as one as well as "Zanshin" or continuation of awareness. This means for an attack to be successful the shinai must strike a proper target at the same time the attacker's front foot makes contact with the ground and at the same time of a kiai or shout that displays good spirit. Though it is common, especially in matches within a dojo, a kiai need not be the target name that is being struck.<br><br>In a tournament, there are three judges (shimpan), each holding a red and a white flag in either hand. Each competitor has either a white or red flag attached to his or her back. For a point to be awarded, two judges must agree. To signal this, the judges lift up the color flag of the player who scored the point. The first to score two points wins the match. If the time limit runs out before two points are awarded, several things may happen: If one player has one point and the other does not, then the player with one point wins. In cases of tie, the match may be decided by a period of overtime, sudden death overtime (the first to score a point wins regardless of time left), or a hantei, or judges' decision.<br><br>The International Kendo Federation (IKF) has members in 44 countries. The international championships are held every three years since 1970, when the IKF was founded.<br>[edit]<br><br>Ranking<br><br>Achievement in Kendo is signified by advancement in rank, or dan, with the eighth rank (hachi-dan) currently the highest rank attainable through testing. Higher dan is awarded on an honorary basis as recognition to one's lifetime contribution to the advancement of Kendo as an art. Additionally there are six ranks below dan known as kyu. The number preceding the kyu is the number of ranks it is below the first dan rank (sho-dan). Sho-dan is equivalent to a first degree blackbelt.<br><br>In kendo there is no external sign of rank.</div>
