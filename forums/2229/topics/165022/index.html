            <div class='col-md body'>Memorandum by Morihei Ueshiba<br><br>The Bu of Budo Must Be Made One with the Universe.<br>All techniques, every one, must be in line with the Truth of the Universe. Technique which is not will surely rebound and cause the destruction of one's body. Any martial activity which is not tied to the universe in harmony is not to be called the Bu of Takemusu. Bu which is so tied to the universe is graced with the love that binds human beings together and so it may be called the Bu of Takemusu, (that is, the martial art which generates martial virtue).<br><br>The Things of Heaven and Earth are of the Same Root.<br>This echo of the universe in which the myriad things of the heavens and the earth find their life follows the path of never-ending fostering and evolution by becoming the mainstay of the moral governance of the space within the universe. This it does through unification with the echo of the five body parts. For us it is to utilise Masakatsu, Agatsu and Katsuhayabi, to store up in our one point (lower abdomen) with fate of Heaven and to become one with the Universal. Thus we foster spirit inside and outside of the universe and like the echo of the body extablish a purified link up which flows without interruption or interference. We realise the single origin of ourselves and the world of the Universal and plumb the depths of their common root. Then with no misunderstanding of the center of the universe or of Masakatsu, Agatsu and Katsuhayabi, we may walk the Path which produces spirit through the power of the breathing of the "Ah" and "Uh" of the Bu of Takemusu.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Characteristics of Aikido Techniques<br><br>The goal of Aikido training is not perfection of a step or skill, but of becmoing one with nature. And it ist his aspect which is appealing to Westerners, especially to those who have an interest in Zen. Aikido, sometimes called "moving Zen", provides guidelines for improving the human spirit, and the fact that it is now spreading throughout the world may well be because people are starting to seek, through martial arts, not physical strength but strength of character, or harmony between their spirit and mankind.<br><br>Through the practice of Aikido, one's character is developed so that one becomes "tough" inside in such a way that this strength is expressed softly in movement. This is exactly like nature: Nature's movements are efficient, rational, and soft, but the center is immovable, firm, and stable. This can be said for Space and Earth - they all have a hard core - and must be true for human beings. These cores should become as one, so that the culmination of nature can be expressed.<br><br>Maintaining this firm, stable center, Aikido movement, with its emphasis on spherical rotation, is characterised by flowing, almost dancelike, circular motions (pivoting, entering, circling) that are used to overcome and control the strength of the opponent. The principle of spherical rotation makes it possible to defend one's self from an opponent of superior size, strength, and experience.<br><br>Although Aikido movements are as soft, rational, and smooth as nature, by applying a bit of force, it can become "tough" and devastating. The soft or gentle quality of Aikido makes it appealing to men and women (regardless of age) and children. It not only offers spiritual development, but also provides excercise and teaches proper etiquette and behaviour.<br><br>At the heart of Aikido is the Oriental concept of the universal creative principle, Ki. Aikido ("the way of harmony with Ki") seeks to achieve the total unification of this universal Ki with the Ki (life force or breath) of the individual self.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Selected Teachings of O-Sensei (Morihei Ueshiba)</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;"><br>Aikido is non-violence. Every human being has been entrusted with a mandate from heaven, and the victory we seek is to overcome all challenges and fight to the finish, accomplishing our goals. In Aikido we never attack. If you want to strike first, to gain advantage over someone, that is proof your training is insufficient, and it is really you yourself who has been defeated. Let your partner attack, and use his aggression against him. Do not cower from an attack; control it before it begins. Nonviolence is the true practice of Aikido</span>.<br><br><span style="color: cyan;"><br>In my Aikido, there are no opponents, no enemies. I do not want to overwhelm everyone with brute strength, nor do I want to smash every challenger to the ground. In true budo there are no opponents, no enemies. In true budo, we seek to be one with all things, to return to the very heart of creation. The purpose of Aikido training is not to make you simply stronger or tougher than others; it is to make you a warrior for world peace. This is our mission in Aikido </span><br><span style="color: violet;"><br>First of all, you must put your own life in order. Then you must learn how to maintain ideal relations with your own family. After that, you must work to improve the conditions in your own country, and then how to live harmoniously with the world at large. This is our duty as practitioners of Aikido </span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><br>War must cease. We are all members of one big family; now is the time to eliminate fighting and contention. This world was created to be a thing of beauty. If there is no love between us, that will be the end of our home, the end of our country, and the end of our world. Love generates heat and light. That is the spirit of Aikido training </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ai Â– Harmony<br>Central to Aikido is the idea of being in harmony with your opponents, rather than in conflict with them. The movement and energy of an attack is redirected without the need for collision or the use of force. The physical practice of this fundamental principle of Aikido, leads to a better understanding of people and nature, while teaching essential skills for the resolution of conflict.<br><br>The movements of Aikido are circular and flowing. They are designed on the principles of nature and move in circles and spirals.<br><br>When Aikido is performed well there is great beauty and composure in the movements of both partners.<br><br>Ki Â– Life Energy<br>Ki is universal energy, which gives life and vitality to all things.  The understanding of Aikido principles and developing the ability to direct and use Ki are an integral part of Aikido training.<br><br>Relaxation exercises, breathing methods, meditation, bokken (wooden sword), and jo (wooden staff) are used to help students master Aikido principles by giving them the opportunity to experience Ki with their own minds and bodies.<br><br>Understanding and developing Ki is a way of enhancing your natural strengths and abilities.  As you begin to understand Aikido principles, you will in turn develop creative and practical new ways to apply these principles to your daily life.<br><br>Do Â– The Way<br>The Aikido dojo (meaning Â‘place of the wayÂ’) provides a secure and friendly environment where we can begin to see and understand our fears, anxieties, reactions and habits. Aikido training is entirely non-competitive and fosters a cooperative and supportive attitude.<br><br>The concentration and discipline required for Aikido training brings focus to our daily lives. Aikido challenges us to improve our skills and attempt new things. By achieving these skills, we gain confidence in our ability to maintain stability whenever we encounter difficulty.<br><br>The first thing you notice about someone is their attitude. If your attitude and thoughts are positive, your life reflects positive results.<br><br>Training in Aikido requires consistent and diligent practice. Although as a beginner you might train just once a week, you should be prepared to make a commitment to train at least two or three times a week if you want to make progress in the future.<br><br>Sincere and dedicated practice is required to attain a state of being in which philosophy, technique, attitude and spirit merge.  When there is no longer a distinction between daily life and the practice of Aikido we truly will be following the Â‘Way of HarmonyÂ’.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brief History of Aikido in Singapore<br><br>[ Special thanks to Freddy Sensei of the Aikido Federation (Singapore) who had provided me with the details of Aikido's history in Singapore. The information is based on his recollections and he apologizes for any errors.<br>Thanks also to Seah Ah Hee Sensei who had provided me with the lineage table below.]<br><br>Teddy Lee Meng Kum Sensei had founded the then Singapore Aikido Federation. Several current senior instructors in Singapore had begun their Aikido training under Lee Meng Kum Sensei. The diagram shows the basic lineage of instructors that are still practicing Aikido today who had trained under Sensei Lee.<br>Late Teddy Lee Meng Kum<br>Singapore Aikido Federation<br>1956 - 1972<br><br>Harry Ng<br>Cheng Kan<br>Aikikai (Singapore)<br><br>Freddy Khong<br>Tee Hin<br>Aikido Federation<br>(Singapore)<br><br>George Chang<br>Ueshiba Aikido<br>Association of<br>Singapore<br><br>Francis Chong<br>Hong Siong<br>Ki-Aikido<br>Singapore<br><br>Seah Ah Hee<br>Independent<br>Mushin Kan<br><br>Philip Lee<br>Fook Chuen<br>Aikido<br>Shinju-kai<br><br>( This table is displayed in no particular order. )<br><br>During the early years, trainings were held at the backyard of an office belonging to Sensei Lee's father. The dojo was originally in the vicinity behind the old Capitol Building, but later moved to a commercial building located at Chulia Street. The number of students then was small and would number not more than twenty each time. Classes were not as readily available to the public as it is today as you had to be recommended by someone from the dojo in order to join. Later on, the training venue moved again to a warehouse space (which belonged to a Mr Thomas Ang, a business partner of Sensei LeeÂ’s) along St PatrickÂ’s Road.<br><br>Around the late 60s, Aikido made its debut into the Metropolitan YMCA (MYMCA) at Stevens Road and Palmer Road, with Harry Ng, Edward Lye, Freddy Khong, Alan Tham, George Chang, Francis Chong, Seah Ah Hee and Jeffery Ang instructing. Aikido finally went public and interest in the art began to grow. As Sensei Lee was often kept busy with his business, instructing was slowly transferred over to his senior students.<br><br>Sometime later, George Sensei, together with Francis Chong and Jeffery Ang, left the Singapore Aikido Federation to form the MYMCA Aikido Club, while Freddy Sensei left Singapore to pursue Buddhism as a monk in Thailand. Ah Hee Sensei, under the recommendation of Master Lee Yew Yeow (who was Ah Hee Sensei's Tai Chi Chuan master), was able to start Aikido classes at the YMCA along Orchard Road. With the kind assistance of a Mr Alan Ong, Aikido soon found a permanent spot at SAFRA Bukit Merah and later SAFRA Tampines (when the adultÂ’s classes were put under the charge of Philip Sensei, and the children's classes under Freddy Sensei). Mr Alan Ong was the person in charge of Aikido programme at YMCA Orchard Road. He later joined SAFRA and hence, also played a part in introducing Aikido into the SAFRA clubs.<br><br>Later on in the late 80s, Senseis Harry Ng, Freddy Khong, George Chang, Seah Ah Hee, Philip Lee and other senior students came together to form the Aikikai (Singapore), thereby obtaining an official recognition from Aikido World Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. The Aikikai (Singapore) was formed with Harry Ng as President, Freddy Khong as a Committee Member, George Chang as Vice-President, Seah Ah Hee as Treasurer, and Philip Lee as Secretary, Chey Chor Khoon as Assistant Secretary and Teo Kay Gin as Assistant Treasurer with other Committee Members consisting of Lim Joo Lay, Lee Chin Ghee, Vincent Ee and Adrian Chew. After a period however, George Sensei left Aikikai (Singapore) and continued teaching Aikido with MYMCA Aikido Club, later forming the Ueshiba Aikido Association of Singapore.<br><br>As the membership of Aikikai (Singapore) grew, Harry Ng Cheng Kan, Freddy Khong Tee Hin, Seah Ah Hee and Philip Lee Fook Chuen Senseis got together and in October 1995, formed the Board of Supervisors as the Directive Committee, to oversee their Management Committee. (This was a requirement stated by Aikido World Headquarters for a recognized organization.)<br><br>Despite its ups and downs, the size of people practicing Aikido has been increasing steadily and there is a pretty large number of Aikidoists in the country right now. Considering the small size of Singapore, the growth of Aikido has been pretty impressive. Singapore has been really blessed with a good foundation of Aikido since its initial inception. We really have got some great teachers found here. Thanks to their hard work, there are now several Aikido schools and clubs located all over in Singapore.<br></div>

They are all listed in alphabetical order below.<br><br><strong>Aikido Federation (Singapore)</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.aikidofederation.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aikidofederation.com/</a><br><br>Aikido Federation (Singapore) was registered on 14 August 2002 with Freddy Khong Tee Hin Sensei (5th dan) as its Chief Instructor and President. Freddy Sensei stepped down as Vice-President of Aikikai (Singapore) on 17 Aug 2002, following the establishment of the Aikido Federation (Singapore).<br><br>To date, the Federation's membership number over 200 adults and children. Alvin Khong, Richard Lee and Syed Ismail came forward as dojo assistants in order to accommodate the increasing size of the classes.<br><br><strong>Aikido Institute (Ai)</strong><br><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a><br>(Extract and excerpt from NTU Aikido Club and Tendoryu Aikido Berlin websites, and special thanks to Foong Wai Luan Sensei of the Aikido Institute.)<br><br>Previously known as the Centre for the Advancement of Aikido, the Aikido Institute is an independent Aikido school with no affiliation to any style of Aikido. The simply practice Aikido, not style of Aikido, to avoid any 'politics' and the ego-game of affiliating with any particular style. They choose to look for common grounds to build friendship and harmony with other Aikido schools rather than find differences (e.g. different styles) to sow discord.<br><br>The following is an excerpt from their brochure:<br><br>The Aikido Institute (Ai) was founded by Psychologist &amp; Aikido Sensei Foong Wai Luan. It is the only independent Aikido school in Singapore with no affiliation to any 'style' of Aikido. The Aikido Institute was founded on the premise that Aikido in and of itself has no particular style or form and so Aikido training is not an end by itself but the means to self-enrichment and self-enlightenment. The Institute aims to build friendship and harmony with all styles of Aikido, and even beyond that, with all other martial arts &amp; non-martial art organizations. This approach also offers room for infinite variations in the creative use of Aikido principles, particularly in personal development, conflict resolution and leadership training, and allows Aikido to continue to evolve as a practical &amp; universal philosophy for peace. Thus, at Aikido Institute, AikidoÂ’s physical techniques and philosophy are practiced, together with cutting-edge knowledge in psychology, exercise science and martial arts, as a means to teach people to be better human beings.<br><br><strong>Aikido Shinju-kai </strong><br><br>(Special thanks to Mr Kelly Tan who had provided me with an update of club and Ms Annie Goh of Aikido Shinju-kai who had provided me with the writeup of the club.)<br><br><a href="http://www.aikidoshinjukai.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aikidoshinjukai.com/</a><br><br>Aikido Shinju-kai was formed in April 1988 by Philip Lee Fook Chuen Sensei (5th Dan Aikido; 4th Dan Kodachi Goshindo).  Philip Sensei has 40 years of experience in various martial arts training, including Wushu, Judo, Taichi and Karate.<br><br>Philip Lee Sensei started his first independent dojo at SAFRA Tampines, where he began grooming senior students of the club to be instructors.  Since then, it has grown from its humble beginning to be what it is today, and help to generate greater awareness and interests of this martial arts in Singapore.  Presently, Aikido Shinju-kai runs regular classes at more than 30 different locations, with a strength of over 1400 members, including 350 children.  Aikido Shinju-kai is also officially recognized by Aikido World Headquarters, Tokyo, Japan.<br><br>Over these years, Aikido Shinju-kai also has the great honour of organizing many Aikido Seminars by reputable Shihans from all over the world, such as those by Hombu Shihan Hiroshi Tada (9th Dan), Yoshimitsu Yamada (8th Dan), Seiichi Sugano Shihan (8th Dan), Hironobu Yamada Shihan (7th Dan), Kenneth Cottier Shihan (6th Dan), and many others.<br><br>In April 2002, Aikido Shinju-kai started to further propagate Aikido in China (Shanghai) and the first Dojo was established in June 2002, registered as Aikikai Shanghai.<br><br>In August 2003, Aikido Shinju-kai became the first Aikido Organisation in Singapore to establish a permanent Hombu Dojo and Office as its Headquarters.  This is located at Level 3 of the SPANS-JOM Clubhouse at 31, Ah Hood Road (off Balestier Road), comprising an area of 400 square metres with 150 Tatami training mats.<br><br><strong>Aikido Yuishinkai Singapore (Excerpt from Aikido Yuishinkai's website.)</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.aikidoyuishinkai-sg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aikidoyuishinkai-sg.com/</a><br><br>This Aikido school was successfully registered in Singapore on 28 September 2002 under the directorship of Frankie Chan Sensei, the Head Dojo Instructor. Aikido Yuishinkai Singapore found its humble beginnings through a small group of former Ki-Aikido practitioners who wanted to set up their own dojo to continue training in the art of Aikido. The school is associated with Master Koretoshi Maruyama, the founder of Aikido Yuishinkai, and his Chief Regional Instructor, Michael Williams Sensei.<br><br>Frankie Sensei was appointed as Head Dojo Instructor of Aikido Yuishinkai Singapore and awarded the rank of 3rd Dan .

On the other hand, Birgit Lauenstein Sensei had lived here for four and a half years.<br><br>-- The Tendoryu style of Aikido was founded by Kenji Shimizu Sensei (8th dan), who held 4th dan in judo when he was invited to become a personal student of Aikido's founder in 1963. He became one of the last and best-loved personal students of O-Sensei. After O-Sensei died in 1969, Shimizu Sensei, then holding 7th Dan in Aikido, founded his own school in Tokyo named Tendoryu Aikido which separated from Aikikai around 1973. Some years later, he received his 8th dan in Aikido from the Japanese Budo Federation.
