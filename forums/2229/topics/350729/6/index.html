              <p>Dear Herzog_Zwei =)</p>
              <p>Its true that every technics have their pros and cons. I practice Krav Maga when i was overseas went on a little course. I believe TS wanted to seek a martial art that he/she could find it of use with instant effect on defending one self in the streets. True that once a Krav Maga Killing technic is block its rendered much useless but Krav Maga does not land just one killing strike. A simple technic would be something like this.</p>
              <p>Kick/Knee to Groin &gt; Sledge fist to temple &gt; Eye strike &gt; Throat strike &gt; Right elbow slice&gt; Left elbow slice &gt; Coup de grace &gt; Rear naked choke &gt; Weaken the enemy and end it with a Neck twist which ends in an almost instand death.</p>
              <p>All these movements are executed within seconds which involves a simple three step killing technic inside. Throat strike, Coup de grace and Rear naked choke. To do a neck twist a rear naked choke must be dealt properly.</p>
              <p>Ki techniques take years to master and maintain so i believe that for one that has a faster option within a span of a year to be able to defend oneself at a certain degree would be Krav Maga.</p>
              <p>So no offense to it ya? Im just giving TS a lethal martial art that could help him in normal day circumstances and that could be learnt within a shorter period but as usual all martial arts that years to master just that some are easier to execute at the moment of adrenaline.</p>

              <p>The moves will work on any idiot streetfighter but on adepts of any martial arts, I highly doubt so. If the same moves were tried on a shaolin martial monk of at least 16 years, the krav maga practitioner will get a broken shin or dislocated knee from the strike to groin, a broken wrist from attempting a sledge fist to temple from a iron-head counterstrike, a couple of broken ribs from a drunken fist bob and forehead bash due to trying to eye strike, nerve strikes to both elbow slices which leaves both arms paralysed for a good 10 minutes and grinning widely when attempting a throat strike and dislocating the neck as the last 2 moves will never work on the martial monk. </p>

              <p>wow seem like a lot of debate on martial art here. Well for any martial art u do, Passion is the thing that will last. Once u choose it, maintain it and tried to explore it. Any senior / aka black belt to any martial is the beginning journey of learning. There is no fool proof to any martial art, it the person using it that see the different. For  wat i think stamina is the more of impt thing as in sparring, if stamina run out, u couldnt even stand up properly.</p>

              <p>Thanks to your idea, i've started a exchange of FAQs through my mail for all kinds of questions regarding self defense and our work. Also, I'll be in forums such as this giving my 2 cents worth of knowledge. Because as in comments and feedbacks received, there are alot of keyboard and electronic warriors around and my opinions might help to clear the air about some DT and SD issues lingering in a lot of people'smind. Of course, I would not wish to incur the wrath of such electronic warriors.</p>
              <p>What I'm trying to do is to add value to knowledge already known and those unknown. hey, knowledge should be shared right.</p>
              <p>Anyone out there with questions, feel free to shoot!</p>
              <p>Btw, from what i see here, seems that the DT and SD community locally is still alive and breathing ;)</p>

              <p>Shaolin monks cannot disarm a gun or rifle? Have to be kidding me. Shaolin monks have participated in several wars throughout history and the last battle was when artillery and rifles were used against Shaolin Temple and the attackers of Shaolin Temple had a 10 to 1 numerical superiority against the martial monks. In the end, the monks won the battle at great cost. Yes, quick fists from a martial monk won't have any effect on a kelvar vest as who in living hell would aim blows at the kelvar? éš”å±±æ‰“ç‰› is the only possible technique I can think of with no other possible moves left. I was talking about the age of a martial monk, if I remember correctly, martial monks start their training at age 4.</p>

              <p><br>Did I state that Shaolin Wu Shu is best? I am just stating that any martial arts with qi training is better than those without , using Shaolin moves to compare with Krav Maga. Akido has some qi blows to deal with martial artist who wear kelvar armour with hard to disrupt stances. Karate is another martial art that emphasize on ki, especially the guryudo. I still feel Krav Maga is very useful for dealing with groups of amateur fighters as the moves rely on being hard,fast, sharp hence maximum effieciency. But when surrounded with groups of trained ki using martial artists, krav maga will be <strong>sold short</strong>. So in terms of self-defence, can anyone predict what you will face in the future? Please don't tell me Krav Maga practitioners can fly.</p>

              <p>No u did not state but u sure did praise them to sky nine. I did not say Krav could be like redbull who will give you wings. Yes Ki technics are indeed strong but like i was saying, at the end of the day humans needs something more practical. Krav maga is made up from researching many other martial arts including wushu. so you have to admit there will be ki technics inside. Ask master -.- he and i practiced Krav Maga for quite some time. Irregardless you should not be bias in stating Ki fighters are better then none ki fighters. Boxing is none ki. Simple pyhsical brute strength but it can take down a bull or a bison in an instant when trained properly. someone like mike tyson proved that you can deal a instant kill bowl without ki technics. Every martial art is balanced. Pros and cons alike.</p>
              <p>Read it up and you will notice how many martial arts there arethat is very deadly and they are non-ki. Muay thai is Non-Ki also yet it is extremely devastating. The amount of blows they can receive it stunning. But its not ki its just plain trainning. Shaolin monks have a wide vast of martial arts experience. But sad to say, future can only advance not go back. Old stuff don't go new ones won't come. Shaolin monks or Krav artiste or not this world is reality.</p>
              <p>Face one thing no matter how powerful a martial artiste you are humans will remain humans. You do not see a shaolin monk nor Krav artiste disarm a nuclear bomb have you? Face it our world has change. Urban self defence is the best option for anyone of us now. Not the perfect option but it is definately the best urban option you will have. As you say you won't know what the future lies. But at least always be sure that guns and knives do. A bullet can still kill if you do not have the proper infomation. And yes shaolin monks can't disarm a gun in split seconds like a Krav could but a Krav could not disarm a spear as fast as a shaolin monk can. Like i say Pros and cons.</p>
              <p>I talked to you nicely replying with what you said despite you mocked me already at that point of time. So why not just reflect that what you have done only shows you have no respect for martial arts because your bias. You watch too much shows. Humans are humans. We all have a limit break the limit you break your body. Simple logic aye? Does one need to master Wushu just to take down a few thugs? how many millions of masters are there in this world could you tell me? No but i definately can tell you that there are many Thugs. So if your in the right mind. Should'nt Krav be more practical? Since you insulted it with amatuer fighters. Face it. One nuclear holocaust even your ki can't save you neither can krav.</p>

              <p>Hm...If you guys don't mind, may I say something<span style="font-size: x-small;">?</span></p>
              <p>The face of the DT and SD community globally has changed alot over the last 1 - 2 decades. From the 80s where Karate, TKD and most striking arts became the craze, to the 90s where the UFCs first appeared that shot Royce Gracie and his family to fame, and that was when grappling, BJJ etc became the next craze. To the current times, MMA and Reality based systems are catching up.</p>
              <p>Over the many years, alot of new guys and systems are helping to spread the word of the importance for the need to be self proficient in protecting ourselves, in all areas, emotional, physcological and physically.</p>
              <p>One of the foremost pioneers that started such a change, is Bruce Lee. Allow me to quote him:</p>
              <p>"Before I learnt the art, A punch was just a punch, A kick was just a kick. When I was learning the art, A punch was no longer just a punch, A kick was no longer just a kick.</p>
              <p>After I understood the art, A punch was still just a punch, A kick was still just a kick."</p>
              <p>These were the words that Bruce Lee once said they have influenced how a lot of people viewed the various arts, styles and systems all over the world. It has also influenced myself personally on the way I hold my trainings. These words invoke thoughts, I hope it'll help to invoke the way our local community think as well, in a positive way of course.</p>

              <p>wow seem like a lot of debate on martial art here. Well for any martial art u do, Passion is the thing that will last. Once u choose it, maintain it and tried to explore it. Any senior / aka black belt to any martial is the beginning journey of learning. There is no fool proof to any martial art, it the person using it that see the different. For  wat i think stamina is the more of impt thing as in sparring, if stamina run out, u couldnt even stand up properly.</p>

              <p>No u did not state but u sure did praise them to sky nine. I did not say Krav could be like redbull who will give you wings. Yes Ki technics are indeed strong but like i was saying, at the end of the day humans needs something more practical. Krav maga is made up from researching many other martial arts including wushu. so you have to admit there will be ki technics inside. Ask master -.- he and i practiced Krav Maga for quite some time. Irregardless you should not be bias in stating Ki fighters are better then none ki fighters. Boxing is none ki. Simple pyhsical brute strength but it can take down a bull or a bison in an instant when trained properly. someone like mike tyson proved that you can deal a instant kill bowl without ki technics. Every martial art is balanced. Pros and cons alike.</p>
              <p>Read it up and you will notice how many martial arts there arethat is very deadly and they are non-ki. Muay thai is Non-Ki also yet it is extremely devastating. The amount of blows they can receive it stunning. But its not ki its just plain trainning. Shaolin monks have a wide vast of martial arts experience. But sad to say, future can only advance not go back. Old stuff don't go new ones won't come. Shaolin monks or Krav artiste or not this world is reality.</p>

              <p>Then what are the human limits? Qi disciplines allow humans to be at their maximum limits. Question is you don't know who your next enemy will be, a thug or a ki-using martial artist. Will you risk being caught wrong-footed and with no idea or technique to deal with a ki-using martial artist? I wouldn't master wushu as there is no qi technique in it due to it being watered down since the Qing dynasty. Muay Thai does have ki training as there are single touch killing techniques in its repetoire.  A nuke is definitely out of any martial artists repetoire of skills but an assasination?<br>Speed and power should be able to deal with a gun wielding assasin with the exception of snipers. Krav maga will excel in such a situation. But against an assasin trained in dim mak or artemi striking, krav maga doesn't have the training</p>

              <p>Zwei~~ Ninjutsu is dim mak. The one hit ko almost all has it. If your reference to ki is inner energy then Krav has it too. But inner energy is just the ability to gain as much energy from the ground and your surroundings. Making your body the fulcrum to the point of impact. Notice how wushu focuses on small hits ? like a small fist but with power? Wushu is sharp and quick which makes it deadly. Krav is more on disarm and kill fastest and quickest way. As i was saying each has their pros and cons. Stop arguing that wushu is best. Your post are implementing it all my dear friend. I understand your passion for wushu but like i was saying, even if you do not know who you opponents are, at the end of the day no matter what you learn its your experience in fighting and your split second reflexes that slams it all into your victory. As bruce lee said. A punch is a punch. A kick is sitll a kick. But both will hurt as long as im the first to connect my punch to your skin. My kick to your face and my throws on your ground. No martial art is absolute.</p>
              <p>PS- Krav also did do pressure points. Serious no joke. Jujutsu and ninjutsu make up the majority for Krav besides russian sambo and Akido. So Krav has pretty much more Ki technics then you imagined =)</p>

              <p><br>As I said before, I didn't study wushu. I understand your theory of pros and cons and I really find it hard to believe that Krav Maga has workable ki theories. Inversion of acupoints, reversals of blood flow, total control of blood pressure are derivable physical aspects of ki discipline. Yes, I have seen a slight increase in blood pressure in krav maga practitioners as the fight-flight response begin but not to the point that I can admit ki mastery. Speed of the body and experience in fighting is important but without ki aspects, one is at serious disadvantage.</p>
              <p>So far, among the Krav maga practitioners I know, I have not seen any that can self-invert acupoints and control their own blood pressure with their ki. If you are in a fight with 6 or 7 pressure point striking opponents, those 2 skills are important. </p>

              <p>Got this question in the mail last night, sounds like he's a reader of the forums and he has asked a question that is asked by many and I have answered the same way to all. So i'll just answer accordingly to what I have in our blog and others who have asked the same question. And I think I got to start collecting money for this question, seriously. Just my 2 cents worth of opinion here, hope it answers you KY Ong.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm looking to train but what is the best martial arts? There seems to be a hype all around and each seems to be the best by what they are saying." Question posted by: KY Ong.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There are different opinions and views. People do different Arts for different reasons.<br><br>In short, Train for what end result you want. What are you training for?<br><br>The modern martial arts are neither bad or wrong, some arts are pure SPORTS with lots of rules, others are there to preserve TRADITIONS and DOCTRINES.</span></p>
              <p>Most martial arts teach their students to defend against their own styles.<br><br>Example: Judo against Judo<br>TKD against TKD etc<br><br>Boxers are trained to BOX, not fight against street assailants or grapplers. etc You won't see for example, TKD teaching you how to defend against some mystical arts people made up in their mind or to keep up with the times, MMA?</p>
              <p>Though there are many benefits from these arts, most won't really work for real self-defence.<br><br>And often the training leaves them very ill-prepared for a real street confrontation.<br><br>The answer is simple : You must train for what you WANT! Makes sense?<br>If you are looking to train and prepare for real street encounters, ask yourself these questions:</p>
              <p>What are the elements and compositions of a true street or violent confrontations?<br>What would I encounter in a a true street or violent confrontations?<br>Whatever I might be training in, would it address these issues and not just  a group of techniques that might falter?</p>
              <p>Finally:</p>
              <p>Would you go to a 100 meters sprint training to improve your StandChart Marathon? NO WAY!<br><br>But both teaches you to run right? Same as in the DT and SD world. If you wish to improve your chances of surviving or disengaging violent confrontations, you must prepare yourself for THAT eventuality.</p>

              <p>Though there are many benefits from these arts, most won't really work for real self-defence.<br><br>And often the training leaves them very ill-prepared for a real street confrontation.<br><br>The answer is simple : You must train for what you WANT! Makes sense?<br>If you are looking to train and prepare for real street encounters, ask yourself these questions:</p>
              <p>What are the elements and compositions of a true street or violent confrontations?<br>What would I encounter in a a true street or violent confrontations?<br>Whatever I might be training in, would it address these issues and not just  a group of techniques that might falter?</p>
              <p>Finally:</p>
              <p>Would you go to a 100 meters sprint training to improve your StandChart Marathon? NO WAY!<br><br>But both teaches you to run right? Same as in the DT and SD world. If you wish to improve your chances of surviving or disengaging violent confrontations, you must prepare yourself for THAT eventuality.</p>
