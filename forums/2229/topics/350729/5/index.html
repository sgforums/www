              <p>What are the known skill sets is the school capable of defending against? How many years does a normal human need to master the defending techniques, tactics and philosophy?</p>
              <p>Technically, there is a need for testing like in the oldern times where 1 school of martial arts will pit against another. No testing means the new school is still not ready for teaching student actual street self-defence techniques where they may be facing multiple masters of different multiple schools of martial arts.</p>

              <p>There is an older form of Muay Thai going by another name that was created for use on the battlefield if I remember correctly. The techniques include something similar to diem mak or dian xue. Multiple requirements to undergo the training which includes that you be Thai, having Buddhism as a religion as the technique is meant to kill and don't know what else. Present day Muay Thai is meant as a sport, not as a self-defence technique</p>
              <p>I really don't understand about self-defence is to defend oneself against what? Amateur close combat fighters or professional killers? Multiple cross discipline training? If I remember correctly some Fijian wrestling techniques includes firearms wrestling training. Does self-defence training include counter-firearms techniques.</p>

              <p><br>Krav maga is a physical contact technique, if the blow is blocked, the killing strike is rended ineffective. Ki techniques like éš”å±±æ‰“ç‰› or Gyudoryu karate joint-locking punch are created to deal with people who like to block the killing blows. So technically speaking, krav maga is great for dealing for dealing with huge groups of amateur fighters, against masters of ki discipline, it might get into trouble.</p>

              <p>Its true that every technics have their pros and cons. I practice Krav Maga when i was overseas went on a little course. I believe TS wanted to seek a martial art that he/she could find it of use with instant effect on defending one self in the streets. True that once a Krav Maga Killing technic is block its rendered much useless but Krav Maga does not land just one killing strike. A simple technic would be something like this.</p>
              <p>Kick/Knee to Groin &gt; Sledge fist to temple &gt; Eye strike &gt; Throat strike &gt; Right elbow slice&gt; Left elbow slice &gt; Coup de grace &gt; Rear naked choke &gt; Weaken the enemy and end it with a Neck twist which ends in an almost instand death.</p>
              <p>All these movements are executed within seconds which involves a simple three step killing technic inside. Throat strike, Coup de grace and Rear naked choke. To do a neck twist a rear naked choke must be dealt properly.</p>
              <p>Ki techniques take years to master and maintain so i believe that for one that has a faster option within a span of a year to be able to defend oneself at a certain degree would be Krav Maga.</p>
              <p>So no offense to it ya? Im just giving TS a lethal martial art that could help him in normal day circumstances and that could be learnt within a shorter period but as usual all martial arts that years to master just that some are easier to execute at the moment of adrenaline.</p>

Once u choose it, maintain it and tried to explore it. Any senior / aka black belt to any martial is the beginning journey of learning. There is no fool proof to any martial art, it the person using it that see the different. For  wat i think stamina is the more of impt thing as in sparring, if stamina run out, u couldnt even stand up properly.</p></div>
