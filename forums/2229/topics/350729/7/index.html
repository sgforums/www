              <p>Actually I have just organised somewhat of a mixed martial art tournament recently which I called Martial Art Tanding Tournament.</p>
              <p>The word Tanding signifies that it follows loosely the silat sparring tournament. This tournament was open to walks of life be it one with martial art background or one without. The result was a great tournament that brought out the best of each Martial Art or street fight. Managed to attract practitioner of Silat, Muay Thai, Capoera and street fighter (no martial art background)</p>
              <p>You can view it via this link</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E12pU--ILE&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E12pU--ILE&amp;feature=channel_page</a></p>
              <p>There are 3 other parts to this tournament in youtube...Go watch it ... Enjoy...</p>
              <p>And 1 more thing I would like to add is, after a very hard fight, all the contenders became great friends... This is what fundamentally we want to achieve... Respect among fellow martial artist...</p>

              Bruce lee created JKD as a way for martial artists to learn the most effective way for combat and self defense. Never encountered JKD training in SG before so cant comment much. 
              
              However there are a few points to take note:
              
              Bruce Lee had a very important principle upon which the whole JKD system was built upon, Simple, Direct and Non classicial (this is also the one true where we have built our training system around also).
              
              Over the years, many around the world have evolved the original JKD system into something to fit their needs for training, scenarios, environments etc. Sadly, some have mutated it in a bad way. You will have to check out their training sessions, talk with their Coaches to find out more about how and why they train. (at this point, like said before; it depends on what you are training for, real confrontations, competitions, keeping fit or spiritual growth etc.)
              
              Next, bruce lee was way advanced during his time; meaning how people fought that time definitely aint how people fight now. So how they train ppl to fight or engage should have evolved and improved and not stayed at that time (though the training philosophies and principles should be there). This is one of what Bruce Lee thought about when he created the Taiji symbol with arrows and the chinese words : having no way as way, and no limits as limits.
              
              Also, it has to emphasize on various elements around fighting like the different ranges, all dimensional training (emotional, pshycological and skills). Lastly, you must be able to implement or execute what you have learnt. This is a principle I base all my trainings upon "Teach the students not what I can do, but rather what they can do". Whats the point of monkeying and copying a instructors moves if you know you cant do it and most likely it will fail you?

              <p>Thank you eastpaw for helping to explain some of the concept here... </p>
              <p>However about the power kicks to legs... it is not totally disallowed... It is allowed to a certain extent. Example is when the power kicks to the legs with the intention to make the opponent fall is definitely allowed. But if the kicks are meant to weaken the opponent, this is not allowed because the game is mostly won through points and not K.O.s or submissions... There are still T.K.O.s example <br>1. When the opponent could not take the impact of the hits from the contender even though it hits the legal areas.</p>
              <p>2. When the opponent could not contain the contender in the bout.</p>
              <p>The power kicks to the leg that is not allowed is the one that is directly hitting the knees, and thighs with the intention to weaken and injure the opponent in order to capitalize on the opponent state. If by any chance the kick hits the illegal areas and the opponent cannot continue momentarily, the bout will go to the opponent instead.</p>
              <p>However after saying that, the kicks to the thighs are still allowed if it happens in the middle or at the beginning of an attack because now it function as a distraction to the opponent in order for the contender to gain points through hits into the legal areas... Hence when the kicks to thigh area happen as a lone kick and at the end of the attack, the contender will be caution and eventually points will be taken away.</p>
              <p>But Kaya please come and immerse yourself in the seminar on the 15th Nov. to get a first hand experience. Eastpaw is able to relate to you because he was there and had a go at it...</p>
              <p>We are still at the formation state and we welcome all feedbacks in order to make the game more appealing to all. All suggestions are valid as long as it adhere to the objective...minimum risk, maximum impact and a whole lot of fun... </p>

              <p>If one is unable to expose oneself to experience real time fight situation which definitely carries dire consequences, the closes one can get it is through sports sparring. This is because one can still employ most of the fight technique and most important of all the activation of the acute sense of timing to execute it to perfection. This is definitely a preparation for the worst and chances are you can survive the worst if you are constantly doing sports sparring especially with all other MAs, which is what I am promoting in the other thread in this forum.</p>

              <p>If one is unable to expose oneself to experience real time fight situation which definitely carries dire consequences, the closes one can get it is through sports sparring. This is because one can still employ most of the fight technique and most important of all the activation of the acute sense of timing to execute it to perfection. This is definitely a preparation for the worst and chances are you can survive the worst if you are constantly doing sports sparring especially with all other MAs, which is what I am promoting in the other thread in this forum.</p>

              <p><br>You should see Bujinkan training or some of the older Karate ryus training, fractures and mortal wounds are usual and considered part and parcel of the practice.  They train in offence and defensive techniques against live blades and firearms so there is a sense of life and death in training.</p>

              <p>If anyone is interested in <strong>SWORD </strong>martial arts, I'm training NihontoDo with Samurai Sports Singapore. It's a school of Kenjutsu, Japanese sword fencing.</p>
              <p>http://www.spchanbara.com/samuraisports/nihontodo</p>
              <p>We train at full contact speed, so chances are if you can get away from a sparring session without being even hit once, you'll do well enough in a real contact situation.</p>
              <p>Do come down and join us to test it out yourself before criticising.</p>
