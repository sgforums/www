Not just aim target, but aim to prevent you from fighting back as well. Those who are well versed in Xingyi will know that Xingyi attacks in a straight line, going straight through and attack. They can make the attacker off-balance of their direct style.<br><br>Those well versed in Bagua will know that they like making circles, making the opponents confused before striking. Muay Thai attackers can do a roundhouse, but if you meet a strong Bagua attacker, then good luck. They are faster than you think.<br><br>I'm not too sure for Taiji.</div>
