              <p><strong>Bruce Lee's JKD,  the "Original Mixed Martial Art"</strong></p>
              <p>Although
               the Gracie family of Brazil successfully transplanted BJJ and Vale Tudo
               to the world via the UFC many in the greater martial arts community 
              also credit Bruce Lee’s philosophy of “not being bound"  by any 
              particular style of martial art, as the seed of today’s Mixed Martial 
              Arts Movement. MMA Superstars, Frank Shamrock and Randy Couture consider
               Bruce as the "Father" of MMA and Dana White (President of the UFC) has 
              crowned Bruce Lee as the inspiration and original martial artist in 
              mainstream America, who trained like an MMA fighter and taught the 
              teachings of the MMA world, way before UFC was even thought of.<br><br>Bruce Lee<br><br>In
               1958 an 18 year old Bruce Lee moved from Hong Kong to the U.S. and 
              eventually attended the University of Seattle, where he majored in 
              philosophy. There he began the journey of creating his own personal 
              martial art. Around 1967 he named his method Jeet Kune Do (JKD) or “way 
              of the intercepting fist". In 1970 he returned to Hong Kong to make 
              movies and unexpectedly passed away in 1973. Posthumously Lee became a 
              superstar worldwide, revolutionized the world of modern martial arts and
               continues to inspire martial artists today.<br><br>Research and Development<br><br>While
               in Hong Kong Lee studied “Wing Chun", a style of Chinese Gung Fu. 
              According to many, early on Lee’s goal was to be the best wing chun man 
              around. However, Lee was already researching different styles of MA and 
              was highly influenced by other Chinese Styles, Western Boxing and 
              Western Fencing. When Lee moved to the U.S. he also began to research 
              Judo, Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling. Lee’s research entailed both book/film 
              research as well as hands on experience. This “hands on" experience was 
              usually accomplished through exchanging his knowledge of Gung Fu with 
              practitioners of a different styles willing to compare notes and 
              experiment outside of their system.<br><br>Reality<br><br>Bruce Lee felt
               that a real fight was unpredictable and that most classical styles 
              emphasized “dead patterns" instead of live and spontaneous training. Lee
               believed that combative sports such as boxing and judo were practiced 
              more realistically than most classical systems. Why? They made real 
              impact and they practiced live training and not dead patterns. Lee also 
              came to the conclusion the MA was Universal and that “unless there is a 
              being with more than two arms and two legs, that there is only one style
               of fighting, the human style." So, Lee conceptualized martial art as a 
              whole and embarked upon a scientific course. Not one that blended styles
               but one that was born of the idea of non-style, geometry and physics. 
              One as he described as “simple, direct and non-classical" (functional). 
              In a sense Lee’s JKD is a martial art with no rules that is practiced 
              like a combative sport with real impact (full contact) and live 
              training. This approach was very revolutionary during the time of its 
              creation and is still quite rare in contrast to the many classical 
              martial arts schools of today.<br><br>Philosophy<br><br>At the same time
               that Lee was creating his martial art he was also very much into 
              philosophy. One source of philosophy was Zen Buddhism. One of the 
              primary tenants of Buddhism is detachment or more clearly, 
              non-attachment. The tenant of non-attachment can be a paradox for most. 
              However for Bruce Lee it was the perfect vehicle of understanding 
              (enlightenment) that he needed to create his Jeet Kune Do. While 
              non-attachment is a mental state, non-engagement is its physical 
              counterpart. In the sense of fighting attachment or engagement imputes 
              struggle. So with non-engagement through the use of physical science, 
              our goal is non-struggle or to fight with the least amount of struggle. 
              Actually this theory is nothing new and can be found in styles such as 
              aikido, tai chi and jiu jitsu/judo.<br><br>Simplicity<br><br>JKD however
               is the way of the intercepting fist and seeks to end the fight as 
              quickly as possible through striking. In JKD engagement is any touch 
              reference other than the strike itself. So ours is a very aggressive 
              form of non-engagement which is a paradox to most but the "true vehicle"
               of understanding and expressing JKD. JKD primarily emphasizes stepping 
              and evading to strike (without prior touch) and secondarily deflecting, 
              trapping and grappling to strike (with prior touch). For decades 
              following Bruce Lee’s death JKD was promoted as the concept of cross 
              training and doing your own thing. This view of JKD gave birth to the 
              creation of many “freestyles" and “hybrids" throughout the world. Not a 
              bad thing but not JKD. Bruce Lee clearly researched the totality of 
              martial art, which includes striking and grappling both standing up and 
              on the ground. But because Lee found that the “height of cultivation 
              lead to simplicity" and that non-engagement is the height of that 
              simplicity, JKD is a scientific vehicle of expressing simplicity in the 
              chaos of fighting. Lee was also an actor and had the ability to use the 
              screen to get some of his ideas across, like in the opening scene of 
              “Enter the Dragon", with Samo Hung, Lee clearly illustrates his interest
               in the idea of the “complete fighter". (kicking, punching, take downs 
              and submissions) But what does complete mean? And complete at what cost?
               These are important questions for each individual martial artist 
              seeking totality.<br><br><br>Mixed Martial Arts<br><br>The distinction 
              between fighting and any combative sport is that it has rules and a real
               fight does not. However in a civilized world, a fighter with morals 
              needs a place to play - seriously. Mixed Martial Arts is the perfect 
              arena for such serious play. Is MMA the evolution of combative sports 
              that Lee envisioned through his martial art so many years ago? 
              “Partially so". Lee directly and indirectly, during and after his life 
              affected so many martial artists.<br><br>Has MMA evolved to Lee’s simple
               and pragmatic approach? As MMA has evolved as a sport so has its 
              strategy and it’s players. In the beginning, in events such as the UFC, 
              Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Players and Wrestlers dominated the arena against 
              classical strikers who never trained to (en) counter grappling. Today’s 
              MMA athletes are mostly “well rounded" fighters in the realms of 
              striking and grappling both standing up and on the ground. However the 
              majority of athletes do not struggle as much as their founding fathers 
              did. Controlling distance to strike and avoid take downs, seeking 
              dominant position to strike and getting up off the ground quickly have 
              become the strategy of the new fighters. Why is this true? Because “the 
              height of cultivation leads to simplicity". Why struggle when you don’t 
              have to?<br><br>At first Maurice Smith led the way to strikers being 
              recognized in the MMA arena. Then more and more fighters “blossomed" as 
              well rounded fighters, like Frank Shamrock, Kazushi Sakuraba, Vitor 
              Belford and todays champions, like Anderson Silva and Georges St. 
              Pierre. Real impact and live training are the hallmarks of JKD and may 
              be applied in the arenas of Self Defense as well as Combative Sports. 
              Competition is a great arena to test yourself and is much safer than the
               street. And as you win and lose remember that you are your own best 
              friend as well as your own worst enemy and that your most apparent 
              strength is also your most apparent weakness. These are the tenants of 
              yin/yang that Lee chose so well to symbolize his martial art both 
              physically and philosophically.<br><br>MMA has come a long way and is 
              here to stay. Whether ones “foundation" is striking or grappling, stand 
              up or ground fighting, the plain and simple truth is that you need to be
               exposed to all possibilities. How you deal with them will be based upon
               the foundation you choose and a working knowledge of the rest.</p>
