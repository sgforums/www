            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's bullshit. The only thing I agree, is that martial art, means the art used in warfare.<br><br>For example, some of the bullshit I quote below:<br><br>"Often within a martial arts school it is taught that 'this exact style is the best system and it was created to beat all the others'. Of course every martial artist would seem to think their style is the best because that is the style they have chosen to do, but in actuality what they are saying is 'this is the best style for me as it suits myattitude and I like the teaching environment'. "<br><br>This is a quantifiable thing. It can be tested, it can be proven. And it already has been proven.<br><br>"Just because a style doesn't focus on whatever it is you are interested in doesn't make it a bad style, it just makes it not the right style for you."<br><br>Remember, what is martial art again? That's right, an art used for warfare. If you bring a sword to war, and I bring an M-16, who's going to win? There's no bad style? How about if you shoot your pistol gangland style without aiming, and I use the weaver stance? Who's going to hit more targets?<br><br>"You must maintain 100% safety when entering into the opponents attack range, this means to control any dangers that could occur by being in control of them. (Methods of entry must be sophisticated yet simple, fast as well as safe!) "<br><br>This is absolute bullcrap and just goes to show the writer has never even been in a hard sparring match before. There is no 100% safety in a fight. Even the best boxers get hit. A fight is like trying to control a car without brakes down a hill. You just do your best. Anyone who says otherwise if full of crap and has never been in a real fight before.<br><br>"The ability to change and - Techniques, attacks and defenses must flow but not necessarily at a constant pace. Adaptability to choose what's next is vital! "<br><br>What nonsense is this? You have time and inclination to think about how well your techniques flow in a real fight? And aren't attacks and defense techniques? What's the diff? You don't choose what's next, when your opponent attacks, you defend. It's that simple.<br><br>People who know will break it down simply for you. People who don't will try to weave up complicated bull crap to cover up their ignorance.<br><br>"P. Sundbye who has been training in various martialarts for the last 11 years including Wing Chun Kung Fu, Aikido, Tong Long and the Lee Total Control system."<br><br>No wonder he writes such crap.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a video that shows you how:<br><br>1) An ineffective martial art tries to come up with complicated theories about fighting to explain "principals" etc.<br><br>2) An ineffective martial art actually looks very deadly and dangerous when done against their own students who're cooperating and not actively tryiing to defend and attack back.<br><br>Then it shows you what happens when said martial art, with all its theories and "showiness" and "deadliness" look like when you put them in a real fight.<br>Despite how good and "effective" it looks in demonstrations and training, in an actual fight it doesn't work. In fact, none of their techniques seem to work at all. That's the funny part.<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=283564<br><br></div>

At least the guy getting into the cage is in good physical shape.<br><br>&gt;&gt;While true that one may not have the time to think, but everything must still flow smoothly and one must be flexible, whatever techniques you choose. &lt;&lt;<br><br>Please elaborate on what you mean by "everything must still flow smoothly" and "one must be flexible."<br><br>Then explain how it will help you in a real fight. Please use simple terms and explain it simply for me, using facts that we all understand.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Not sure for Western arts, but from a Chinese martial arts view, there's the 5 elements. Each element on its own is a weakness, but when together, is a strong. Water counters fire, fire counters metal, etc. &lt;&lt;<br><br>How does that translate to fighting? If you tell any guy in the street that, will he be able to understand what you've just said? Will it make sense to him? Because it makes no sense to me, and has no relevance to real fighting.<br><br>There is no difference whether it's western or chinese or middle east martial art. The only thing we should be interested in is, does it work? Is it effective in a real fight? Can it be done with a high probability of success?<br><br>If the answer is yes, I will take and use it, I don't really care where it comes from.<br><br>&gt;&gt;The defender will need to identify the type, and choose a suitable counter attack.&lt;&lt;<br><br>You have an argument with someone at the pub. He insults your wife (or husband). You call him some unflattering names. He starts charging at you and starts to swing for your head.<br><br>Now, what element is he? Water, fire, metal, earth, wind, ninja? You have exactly 1/2 a second to answer before his punch lands in your mouth.<br><br>&gt;&gt; It doesn't necessary need to flow in the 5 elements order, but the attacks and defends used will be based on the 5 elements itself.&lt;&lt;<br><br>Please just answer this very simple question for me. How many real fights have you been in?</div></blockquote>I think you're confusing martial arts with beating the crap out of people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi again, NoRiceBoys. Thanks for taking the time to write back. Here are some thoughts I have on your reply.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>The black swan theory. I'm familiar with it. But now, let's be practical. If every single crow you've seen is black, and I made a bet with you to guess the colour of the next crow we'll see.<br><br>Will you put your money and say it's a white crow?</blockquote>I'd be pretty dumb to bet on white, of course. That said, inductive support is still not deductive proof, which was my point here to begin with.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>The best were invited to fight. They declined. In his prime, Tyson was personally invited to a fight by Rorion Gracie. Tyson never replied. I don't blame him, he was making millions, why risk it to fight a relative unknown?</blockquote>That still means that the best boxers in the UFC aren't the best in the world, possibly by a long shot.<br><br>On the other hand, didn't the Gracies <span style="font-style: italic;">invent</span> BJJ? I would imagine they're at the top of their game.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>Why do they have to be the best they can ever be? Doesn't this same standard apply to the MMA fighter? Not every MMA fighter that enters the cage is the best nor is he the best anyone ever can be.</blockquote>Of course the standard applies to everyone. Since it cannot be met, a UFC contest only proves that one man beat up another man. It does not prove that one art is superior to another art. Again, this was my point in the first place.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>A usual ploy used by those who will not compete. But I'll humour the question.<br>What are the rules in question? No eye gouging? No groin strikes? No fish-hooking?<br><br>These rules are there to protect the sportsmen entering the cage to fight. Nobody wants to do a sport and end up dead.</blockquote>Dying would be quite a downer, wouldn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The rules I was talking about include things like the fighting environment. A cage with a flat, clear floor in the case of the UFC, and a square ring in the case of K1. Would the usual suspects fare as well on a flight of steps, for instance? That said, I would imagine that if matches were played out on a greasy surface the groundfighters would win even more easily than they do now.<br><br>Another rule would be the one-on-one, bare-handed, refereed nature of the fights. Effective self-defence calls for the ability to defend oneself from multiple armed opponents with no safety net. A good cage fighter may not actually be a good street fighter. Of course, this doesn't mean that a bad cage fighter would automatically do well on the streets.<br><br>What's fish-hooking, by the way? I'm guessing it's sticking fingers inside someone's mouth and yanking at the flesh.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>Again, it can't be helped if the lecturers were smart and refused to take part, isn't it?</blockquote>Yep. However, this does cast quite a shadow on the "UFC fights have proved..." statements.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>Again, a strawman argument. Why does it have to be the best boxer against a mediocre MMA fighter? The MMA/BJJ fighter is also not the best in all time. Do you see why this argument is irrelevant? Maeda is dead. Helio is old and frail.<br><br>And what does putting Jack Dempsey or Ali to the test do? You're never going to be them, and that's what you want when you train, to protect yourself.</blockquote>Actually, that's not a strawman argument. A strawman argument is when you misrepresent someone's position with an easily refutable one and then tear that down.<br><br>Your statement was "MMA fights have proven which martial arts are the best". All my responses were directed at the fallacy of that statement, and I have not at any point pretended that your position was anything else.<br><br>If anything, your response here was the strawman argument. That part of my post you were responding to there was one reason I gave why results from the UFC et al do not prove your statement: that the different martial arts were not evenly represented. Whether or not Maeda is alive, Helio is young, and I am Dempsey does not make my reason less cogent.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>Fact: When you get into a fight with a grappler, it's you who's going to end up on the bottom, not the grappler. So glass, lava, razors, stale pizzas is going to hurt you more than the grappler.</blockquote>It's the stale pizzas I fear most, of course!<br><br>I concede your point here: when two fighters clinch, the one who knows how to grapple is more likely to be able to control the fall.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>So why can't another 2 BJJ guys with guns appear and take the grapplers side? Or M16s and bazookas? Why does the grappler always have to be unarmed and outnumbered and out weaponed but the other guy does not face the same? See where this argument is going?</blockquote>Because in both versions of my story, the outnumbered person was the martial artist. If two BJJ guys with guns get to come in to save their BJJ friend, then I demand that they come in to save the boxer too!<br><br>You've kind of missed the point here, really: Ending up on the floor is not a good idea unless you're the one with all the friends.<br><br>Edit: Oops. I got longwinded and the post wouldn't show properly. Have cut it into two chunks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And the post goes on:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>I don't advocate going to the ground in a street fight.

It's silly for someone to handicap himself by refusing to learn a certain aspect of fighting on principle. Remember, my argument was never that BJJ/groundfighting is useless; it was that the UFCs haven't proven anything.<br><br>Actually, do I sense support for my arguments here? If you would not willingly go to ground in a real fight, and most UFC fights are concluded on the ground, then UFC fights are not representative of real combat. Maybe there is no choice but to go to ground, in which case you would be wiser to take a real fight to the ground quickly to end it, wouldn't you? But that latter scenario would contradict your advice...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>But just to play along, you're assuming the grappler won't charge you, lift you and slam you on the back of your neck. Your knives are not going to be much help in this situation.</blockquote>Yes, my knives would be useless here, because I like to stand still to get charged, lifted and slammed onto the back of my neck.<br><br>Seriously, don't you think it's silly to argue that, all else being equal, an unarmed martial artist would have the advantage against an armed one?<br><br>What I was saying was that the tactics of the modern grappler put him in danger much more than the moves of a good striker in a real situation. Of course, in a serious self-defence situation, both the grappler and the striker are probably going to get it real bad. Nobody ever picks a fight he doesn't believe he can win, and someone who starts something with you almost certainly has backup you can't see.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by NoRiceBoys:<br>See, again the friends, buddies, knives and glass shards are always presents for the grappler, and never the other way around. </blockquote>Actually, they are there against <span style="font-style: italic;">both</span> the grappler and the boxer.

Does that tell you something?</blockquote>It tells me that the right ballet fighter hasn't yet entered the UFC.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span><br>I agree that if you watch 100 fights and in all 100 the Muay Thai + BJJ guys beat up everyone else, that suggests that Muay Thai + BJJ is a very effective combo in the ring. It's probably plenty effective outside the ring as well, and I'd be stupid to not give these fighters respect.<br><br>However, there is a logical problem with claiming that this (or any other) combo has been proven to be "the best", because these are fights between individuals and not between martial arts styles. Also, what works most well in one environment (e.g. the ring) may not work well at all in another (e.g. the streets, a bar, a swimming pool, etc.). Hence, "the best" is a title that is very much environment/rule-dependent.<br><br>Another important issue is that the different martial arts are very differently represented. While the Muay Thai and BJJ fighters in the UFC tend to show some modicum of skill, the Taekwondo, Wing Chun and Ballet crowd tends to be clumsy and poorly trained. Sometimes, a Wing Chun (or whatever) guy wins a match, but he does so using MMA tactics - this suggests that either Wing Chun (for instance) is so completely useless that even their best fighters have to resort to MMA moves, or that the Wing Chun representatives don't actually know any real Wing Chun.<br><br>For once, I'd like to see someone employing real Wing Chun in one of these tournaments - only then could we learn a little something about the relative merits of Wing Chun and BJJ, or Wing Chun and Muay Thai - while taking into account the fighters' individual style-independent strengths and weaknesses, of course.<br><br>Lastly, one reason why fights in the UFC almost always go to the ground (is this correct?) is because UFC fighters generally punch like pussies. Actually, just about everyone today punches like a sissy, including most boxers. And don't even get me started on the kickers. What's happened to the expert boxers and kickers of 50-100 years ago?<br><br>Disclaimer: I do not do Wing Chun either. I used to do Taekwondo years and years ago, but modern Taekwondo is a joke.<br><br>By the way, NRB, are you based in Singapore? I get the sense you are fairly knowledgeable about groundfighting, and I sure wouldn't mind learning something about it from you if I get the chance. That is not a veiled challenge, by the way; I know nuts about groundfighting. I promise to leave my knife, assault rifle and yo-yo at home.<br><br>Edit: Changed "p-u-s-s-y" to "sissy" because the board's swear filter doesn't like cats.</div>
