            <div class='col-md body'>WHAT is the ENTITY of the NEW UFCÂ® [ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIPÂ®]?<br>The entity of the New UFC [Ultimate Fighting Championship] is the worldÂ’s leading mixed martial arts sports association, formed in January, 2001 by Zuffa, LLC. The New UFC features a strong ownership and a depth of management experience across a spectrum of live event sports, television production and ancillary business development. The New UFC is positioned well for the future as the standard bearer for the evolving and exciting sport of mixed martial arts.<br><br>WHAT is MIXED MARTIAL ARTS?   [Top]<br>Mixed martial arts (MMA) is an intense and evolving combat sport in which competitors use interdisciplinary forms of fighting that include jiu-jitsu, judo, karate, boxing, kickboxing, wrestling and others to their strategic and tactical advantage in a supervised match. Scoring for mixed martial arts events in Nevada, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Florida is based on athletic-commission approved definitions and rules for striking (blows with the hands, feet, knees or elbows) and grappling (submission, choke holds, throws or takedowns). No single discipline reigns.<br><br>WHAT is ULTIMATE FIGHTING in the UFC?   [Top]<br>Ultimate Fighting is a proprietary term of the UFC. It is defined as mixed martial arts competition between high level professional fighters who utilize the disciplines of jiu-jitsu, karate, boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, and other forms in UFC live events. UFC competitors or Â“Ultimate FightersÂ” are among the best-trained and conditioned athletes in the world. While this is a highly intense sport, fighter safety is of paramount concern to UFC ownership and management: it is noteworthy that no competitor has ever been seriously injured in a UFC event.<br><br>WHAT is the NEW ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP?  [Top]<br>The new Ultimate Fighting Championship is a series of international competitive mixed martial arts events televised several times yearly and available live or tape-delayed on pay-per-view and other formats, seen domestically and internationally. The New Ultimate Fighting Championship is committed to providing the highest quality live event and television production available to entertain and engage viewers in a fascinating sport. The New Ultimate Fighting Championship distinguishes itself from the controversial spectacle of the last decade: The first event produced under new ownership and management was February 23, 2001.<br><br>The Ultimate Fighting Championship is produced exclusively in cooperation with Zuffa, LLC.<br><br>WHAT DISTINGUISHES UFC FROM ITS COMPETITORS?   [Top]<br><br>The elite level of the competitor also known as an Â“Ultimate Fighter.Â”<br><br>The UFC brings together the most talented martial arts experts in the world. UFC fighters come from the US, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Russia, Holland, England, etc. All UFC fighters have previous combat sports experience and many are world or Olympic champions. UFC athletes train up to six hours a day or more in preparation for an event. Almost all have studied martial arts as a lifelong vocation and many are college educated. In addition to their UFC careers, many of these men are business owners. They are also students, professionals or managers working for diverse types of companies. But it is the success, discipline and focus of the Ultimate Fighter that makes him different from just about any other competitor in or out of mixed martial arts.<br><br>Absolute consistency of rules: presence of officials, judges, weight divisions, rounds, time limits<br>Leadership in obtaining commission approval for a new sport<br><br>Mandatory Equipment:  [Top]<br>Competitors may only use UFC and commission approved 4-6 oz gloves, designed to protect the hand but not large enough to improve the striking surface or weight of the punch.<br>Commission approved MMA shorts and kickboxing trunks are the only uniforms allowed. Shirts, gis and shoes, and the problems they present for grabbing are not allowed.<br><br>The Octagon:   [Top]<br>The UFC Octagon is unique from any other fighting arena. Doctors and martial artists designed it to create an enclosure that would act as a neutral arena to showcase the skills of martial arts disciplines while providing maximum safety to the fighters with commission approved ring structures, canvas, and all safety padding and fences.<br><br>The Octagon ensures that all of the action stays safely contained in the fighting area, whereas competitors can fall over or through the ropes of a boxing ring.<br><br>Absolute adherence to commission mandated rules for MMA:  [Top]<br>Commission approved gloves<br>Weight classes<br>Time limits and rounds<br>Mandatory drug testing<br>No head butting or kicking to the downed opponent<br>No knees to the head of a downed opponent<br>No downward point of the elbow strikes<br>No strikes to the spine or the back of the head<br>No groin or throat strikes<br>State Athletic Commission approval in such major states as New Jersey, Nevada, Florida &amp; Louisiana.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the cage is more favourable to grapplers/ground attacks in a way.However i disagree with their statement of being the leading MMA show, there seems to be more PRIDEfc fans...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All styles are effective in MMA today. It's just how you utilize each aspect of the art and adapt it to MMA. Judo for example, a skill people that many would think wouldnt be really effective in MMA. Wrong! You need to watch Karo Parisian and see how he's adapted judo to his game and even Fedor Emelianenko, Pride HW champion who is a judoka amongst other disciplines. Every little helps in this sport.<br><br>The days of the Gracies are over. True, and thats because fighters HAVE to crosstrain in various other disciplines. Fighters are more well rounded than before. The sport evolves continuously and will keep doing so for many years.<br>Even the Gracies have been forced to incorporating striking. Look at Renzo Gracie for example who is probably the most recognised out of the Gracies for incorporating striking into his GJJ teachings. Or look at Nick Diaz, a Gracie Jiu jitsu brown belt fighter, who is known for going toe to toe with opponents to trade punches rather than takedowns and submissions.<br><br>But is the UFC the biggest MMA organization? well not quite yet at this moment but Zuffa, the company who own the UFC are probably the most financially dominant MMA organisation at the moment with their success in the US with their Spike TV shows like The Ultimate Fighter, UFC Access all areas, the free to air Ultimate Fight Night, etc... as well as their deal with HBO. Zuffa if not yet are definitely making a huge step to becoming the biggest MMA organisation. Zuffa, also recently acquired various independent promotions in the US such as the WEC and WFA as well as the fighter contracts with each promotion.  and with whats in store for 2007,  it seems that they will continue to grow.<br><br>But how bout Pride? Despite being the hardcore MMA fans favourite organization, Pride have been through some difficulties recently after losing mainstream coverage free to air programming in Japan due to some scandals involving the yakuza. And with some of Pride's big draw fighters leaving the company ('Gracie Hunter' Kazushi Sakuraba to<br>K-1 Heros as well as Mirko Crocop and Quentin Jackson both to the UFC) to go elsewhere, Pride may find themselves having to put on the fights we've seen numerous times before, such as nogueira vs fedor 4, or coleman vs fedor 3.<br><br>Pride still have a great roster despite the losses to the roster but whether their matchmaking will be as exciting remains to be seen.Will Pride's attempt to expand to the US be successful? Maybe that question will be answered at the end of the year.<br><br>K-1's attempts at MMA is their Heros event and that isn't as successful as their the main K-1 show. If anything Hero's is the least popular MMA event amongst most Hardcore MMA fans.</div>
