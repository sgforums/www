            <div class='col-md body'>This piece is not written by me. It's written by a professional MMA fighter from other forum, who trains in kung fu + some grappling arts. He is highly abrasive, but he's one of the most open minded person I've encountered.<br><br>There's a lot of truth to what he's saying (even though he bashes the art I train in  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>===================================================<br><br>Personally speaking some of the nutriders on this board are fucking bugging the crap out of me. None of you are correct, dissect the arguement all you want the bottom line is can you get the job done? Let's start here:<br><br>Wing Chun kung-fu: Like most of the stylized kung-fu systems out there they get caught up in the who's instead of the why's and how's. The fixed positions and the inability to expand out of their systems fighting position leaves it vunerable to take downs, angled attacks, multiple person situations, and takes too long to implement the ideas to practical use.<br><br>Taekwondo: You're represented by the biggest morons out there WTF and ATA. These orginizations are out for your money, boosting their prestige, and brain washing you into believing that there is a purpose to what they are doing. All the while, WTF specifically, handing you this crock of shit on how long taekwondo has been in existance. Because of their predjudice outlook toward the karate/Japanese culture in which it originated from they've developed a sport based on a game played over 1000 years ago and make people think they're actually learning how to defend themselves. They refuse to look toward proper training for fighting effectively taking them out of the true realm of martial arts. Now there are some fairly solid TKD orginizations out there but they're not represented by the vast majority thus undermining any attempt at validating their system.<br><br>Kempo: Like saying car, there is no true identity for this system of martial arts. Are we Japanese, American or Chinese. Who give a rats ass. Most systems have tried their damndest (is that really a word?) to validate a fairly effective group of fighting techniques while others get bogged down in the muck of trying to lay claim to some wierd Chinese Shaolin authenticity. Kenpo/Kempo has been represented over many years as some of the hardest hitting, most ferocious fighters in existance. There was a reason they became popular but because of greeed they watered it down to a state where you'd be lucky to find an instructor that wouldn't get you killed in your first encounter on the street. Now a majority of kempo guys are fat, out of shape fucknuts who are more interested in getting your check book then getting in shape. They have gone the way of TKD but fortunately most schools are changing for the better and maybe in the next decade or so they can rise to the prestige they deserve.<br><br>Shaolin Kung-fu/Wu Shu: Doesn't exist people it's fucking myth, as a martial arts you are learning to be a fucking gymnast/ballet dancer. Fucking stage performers are all they are. If you like that shit fine but stop licking the balls of these so called Chi masters as if most their stuff wasn't parlor tricks and simple athletic acrobatic techniques. Simple and to the point.<br><br>Other systems of Kung-fu: if you aren't training in modern ways then you're not training in Kung-fu. Systems were not to be mired down to tradition they were supposed to change with the time, passing on techniques that worked and adding new ones on to make their respective kwoons "bad ass". Unfortunately you've all seen too many Jet Li and Jackie Chan circle jerk movies and believe half that shit is real. It's the fucking movies people get over it.<br><br>Judo: Fucking turning into a bunch of pansies I swear, they outlaw so many moves we're soon going to be left with nothing but a pussified sumo match where only pushing is allowed.<br><br>Jujitsu: The problem here is identity. Like so many arts Jujitsu wears many masks and covers many different areas of grappling. Some Jujitsu systems look like modern MMA events while others are so bogged down in theoretical shit that they have no comprehension on what works and what doesn't work. Bottom line is if you haven't done it against a fully resisting opponent you'll have no idea if it'lll really work. Most of these practitioners get tied down to tradition and never question for a second their "masters" teaching because they've seen him/her throw some cooperative bitch around. Find Jujitsu that works people.<br><br>Brazillian Jujitsu: Unfortunately for BJJ schools around the world they're represented by a bunch of newbie snot nose punks. I've seen the way they teach classes and it's a psychologists dream world. A bunch of Males trying to establish a level of Alpha dominance and force their peers to submit and thus establishing a pecking order in the microcosm that is. Two type of guys come out of these gyms. The guys that learn decent technique because they put their ego asided establish a good level of respect for one another and learn and the fuckers who develope a bully mentality and never get past their own ego. There's nothing wrong with pride until the pride gets in the way of true learning. I saw over a dozen BJJ fighters go into matches against 'inferior' styles because they saw Royce Gracie do it in the UFC. Unfortunately most of those guys forgot they were doing a sport and the Gracies had been accepting challenges for decades before the UFC came around, their style was designed in neutralizing the mono stylistic stand up fighter who believed they couldn't be taken down. The guys that get mired into the BJJ is all you need to know get caught up into the same downfalls as all the other systems that eventually failed due to their inability to change. The minute you don't fear and give respect to another style is the day you're going to leave yourself open to defeat.<br><br>SAMBO: Got caught up in nationalistic pride and failed to branch out beyond the neccessity that developed in the first place. Look we can do throws and all kinds of joint locks but we won't choke people out. How much sense did that make? Fortunately it has made the changes neccessary but sport sambo has not changed with the time and will not succeed until it gets over a lot of the rules that limits it's capablities. Most sambo guys turned to jujitsu, judo and wrestling, you rarely see a pure samboist anymore. Then you have that group that got caught up in the "combat" aspect of sambo. Take a look at the Jujitsu section of this and find out what we think about theoretical martial artist.<br><br>Ninjitusu: God what a bunch of freaks. Can this shit work, I guess so but whats your fucking goal, you want to be a power ranger or a fucking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. Seriously, what's the point in doing Ninjitsu? Fuck Ninjitsu up its fucking ass I have no respect for the art so I might as well end this shit right here. I here the Taijitsu hand to hand can be quite effective but the other stuff is queer eye for the straight guy gay.<br><br>Aikido: WTF, artful form of evasion that's all this is. Great fucking concept but stop saying you're a martial art, you're not. If you're not going to engage the opponent and you're a bunch of whining pacifistic cultist seeking enrichment then fine, go eat your tofu and circle jerk in the corner and leave the real martial artist to the real people. Don't get me wrong I love some of this shit but if you like most of the aspects and want to learn how to defend yourself find an Aikijujitsu school that does some level of sparring and leave this shit to the ball room dancers.<br><br>Muay Thai: Muay Thai is not kickboxing people, it's what they do but it's not kickboxing. I'm sick of hearing this shit. Muay Thai teaches more than sparring in the ring. Great form of fighting terrible for self-defense. What's that? You heard me, specifically for guys. After you elbow somebody in the face and knee the crap out of their body what are you going to tell the cops "oops?". God no, if you want to learn self-defense take some Japanese Jujitsu/Combat SAMBO stuff, at least if the theoretical stuff doesn't work you can beat the crap out of them afterwards.<br><br>Kickboxing: It's a fucking sport people get over it.<br><br>Boxing: They're all jealous of MMA fighters. I hate boxing. Hate it.<br><br>Wrestlers: Being on your back is not gay.<br><br>Freestyle grapplers: This includes the grappling gambit here, going to the ground on the street sucks ass. Been there, done that, if you have and got away untouched you got lucky.<br><br>Krav Maga: Probably one of the most effective theoretical based systems I've come across next to Combat sambo. But then again you saw what I said about Combat SAMBO. Unfortunately they got greedy too and allowed a bunch of half educated punks go out and teach there system for obscene amounts of money only to teach nada.<br><br>So these are the nutriders I've come across in my nearly 4 years with bullshido formerly known as Mcdojo.com. It's been said before but let me summarize it for you. If you are at a school and you're happy so be it. If you want to look for an effective system that you can learn how to fight you must learn stand-up and grappling. If you want to learn self-defense make sure there's some level of effective sparring that allows you to attempt some of the theoretical ideas. For those stand up guys that think they can't be taken down I hope a grappler comes along and drops you on your head. For those grapplers who think they can take anybody down I hope you get KTFO. For those of you who don't spar and think your shit really works I hope you get mugged and for all you bullshit artist that weren't even worth my time in mentioning I hope you contract a painful disease and die like the piece of shits you are.<br><br>*PS if I missed your style up here and you think you need to say someting let me intercept you comment and use the universal ::: middle finger :::: salute.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i mean is, the way he bashes these arts shows how disrespectful he is as a person. I don't know him, he may be a nice guy in real life, but still.. pro fighter or not, its what you do in life which people will perceive you as a person.<br><br>I believe every arts has its own positive influence. For example, some people may say that TKD is overrated, not a combat art and not to be used in a ring fight. However, i believe TKD instill discipline and confidence into a person. I'll still send my kids for Wushu or TKD classes if they want to.<br><br>Basing other arts are just not right. I do not wish to turn this into a flame war so i hope u'll understand what i mean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no such thing as Shaolin martial arts as far as I know.

            <div class='col-md body'>Excuse me shaolin kungfu comes from the monk Da Mo . While he was having a retreat in cave , he thought of doing some exercise to strengthen his body to make it healthy . The initial form of martial arts of shaolin were more for keeping the body healthy . As i believe many of you have heard of yi jing jin and xi shui jing which enables the body to maintain suppleness and the be nimble . Is after some time due to some incident then they realize they need to defend themselves and slowly evolve it into more attacking form . And because there was a fire which unfortunately burnt their library where they store their manualls of many scriptures and martial art skill . So those villagers that know the skill that was lost in the fire came back to tell them agn so that it won't be lost . But nevertheless the highest form of their martial art yi zhi chan was lost permanently because at that time nobody manage to master that art , and only er zhi chan is left . I hope someone will correct me if i'm wrong in any area . Wudang is in china . Please do not say things don't exsit just because you never seen it before . If that is the cause then anyone can also just say that you don't exist at all cos they never seen you before . I encourage anyone to read up first before passing one sided comments .</div>

We're Chinese ourselves so we know better.<br><br>BUT........the thing is, many of the good kung fu masters, and even what China calls National Treasures, have migrated to the US and are teaching there! And they have many of these high level Chinese masters passing on their knowledge to ang mohs! So what does that leave us in S'pore?<br><br>Unless the martial arts teacher travels frequently to China and seeks out the best teachers, most of what they teach should be suspect anyway shouldn't it?<br><br>These ang mohs have been practising Bajiquan and Xingyiquan for a long time! I haven't even heard of these two kung fu in S'pore till recently and learnt that they were the arts used by the Manchu elite bodyguards and others whose life depended on it. (Their original training methods v.s. what I see being practiced in S'pore, and whether they're still relevant in today's world is up for debate.)<br><br>So give these ang mohs a little more credit, some of them know more than me in terms of Chinese culture and language!</div>

I think the message he's trying to get across to ALL martial arts practitioners is this:<br><br>After everything is said and done, does your martial art deliver what it's supposed to deliver? Not good health, not discipline, not long life, but the ability to fight and defend yourself in a real confrontation.<br><br>Martial = pertaining to war or warfare<br>Art = the art thereof<br><br></div>

Well as pple say pride comes before a downfall . Typical ang mo attitude , also a very experienced fighter will never say such things , maybe he suffered some forms of defeat from one of the martial art form that he criticised so badly in his message . So he wrote that to make himself feel better . Like pple said " if you dunno how to swim , don't complain that your swimming pants or suit is too big ." </div></blockquote>Instead of making emotional comments, it'll be more constructive to point out which points he makes in his article you disagree with, and give proof of why you think your conclusion is more valid then his.<br><br>For me, I just ignore all the cussing in the piece and try to read his message. He is a professional fighter. That means he fights for a living. I would say he has a better idea than all of us on what works and what doesn't. How many fights have we got into in our whole lives, compared to someone who trains for it and does it everyday of his life?<br><br>Calling pride typical ang mo attitude is not a fact. There are no statistics to back that up and we're judging them based on our own cultural background.<br><br>Saying an experienced fighter will never say such a thing is also untrue. Because 1) the guy who said it IS an experienced fighter, and there are also many other highly decorated martial artists like Gene Lebell who say Akido is bullshit (not my words).<br><br>So let's debate the piece logically and with facts instead of emotional outbursts just because we may not like what we hear.</div>

That's why he's called a fighter.<br><br>If he called himself a cultured martial artist, on the other hand, then I will agree with you.<br><br>But attacking a person's character still does not take away from the logical points that the person has made.<br><br>The argument put forth by the person is the only thing that should be judged, on whether it be true, or not. The personality of the person putting forth the argument, no matter if we like him or not, is not what's under debate. Correct?<br><br>Although we would be more likely to accept what he says had he said it in a more gentle manner.<br><br>BTW, he's not my friend, I don't know him, and frankly I don't really like him as a person, but I think what he says makes a lot of sense.</div>
