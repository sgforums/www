              <p>Add more punch to your fitness regime with these underground combat courses. 
              By Baey Shi Chen</p>
              <p><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/459/12-HnF.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></p>
              <p>Aside from picking up selfdefence skills, combat courses can be a good 
              way of building your mental resilience and self-confidence. So, whether you want 
              to toughen yourself up, find another way to work off your pent-up frustration, 
              or simply learn something new, here are a whole slew of combat techniques to 
              help you perfect your moves. Get ready to rumble. <br><strong><br>Brazilian 
              Jiu-Jitsu </strong><br><strong>The lowdown: </strong>Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) 
              is a martial arts and combat sport that focuses on grappling, ground fighting 
              and positional strategy. With the goal of gaining a dominant position by using 
              joint-locks and chokeholds, it aims to force an opponent into submission. With 
              origins in judo, it evolved into its present form after Mitsuyo Maeda, a 
              Japanese expert in judoka, brought it to Brazil in 1914. The sport is sometimes 
              also known as Gracie jiu-jitsu, after another famous practitioner, Rorion 
              Gracie.<br><strong>The damage: </strong>At Budo Academy, which is run by 
              Jagsport, Brazilian jiu-jitsu classes are overseen by Kreation Jiujutsu. 
              Beginners are advised to sign up for a two-session trial package at $90 to 
              determine their most appropriate level. What’s more, other than Brazilian 
              jiu-jitsu, the school provides lessons in combat techniques such as chanbara, 
              judo and sambo. It also runs programs for accredited courses for those who want 
              to train as instructors in Dynamic Combat.<br><strong>340B King George’s Ave., 
              6297-1202, www.jagsport.com</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Capoeira <br>The lowdown:</strong> A dazzling mix of martial arts, 
              games and dance, this 16th century fighting technique was invented by African 
              slaves in colonial Brazil. Comprising acrobatic sparring moves and the 
              innovative use of maneuvers such as slaps, elbow strikes and head-butts executed 
              to musical rhythm, it is graceful yet lethal. A quintessential part of the 
              vibrant Brazilian street culture, it even spawned the genre of breakdance, which 
              is inspired by certain capoeira moves.<br><strong>The damage:</strong> Capoeira 
              lessons are held by Bantus Capoeira (<a title="www.sg.bantus.org" href="http://www.sg.bantus.org/">www.sg.bantus.org</a>) at the YMCA. Lessons 
              start from $120 per month for students and national servicemen and $150 per 
              month for working adults for unlimited sessions. Single classes are also 
              available at $20. A one-time Bantus Capoeira Singapore registration fee of $50 
              comes with a Bantus t-shirt and a YMCA membership will be levied at $21.40 for 
              adults and $10.70 for those under 21. <br><strong>1 Orchard Rd., 6336-6000.

              <p><strong>Krav Maga <br>The lowdown: </strong>Hebrew for “hand-to-hand combat,” 
              krav maga developed in Israel, and this formidable self-defence technique is 
              part of the training regime of the Israeli defence forces as well as other 
              international militaries. A self-preservation skill that focuses on neutralizing 
              threats through a quick transition from defensive to offensive tactics, this is 
              a take-no-prisoners technique that requires endurance and quick reflexes. Krav 
              maga stands apart from most defence techniques as it is devised from a 
              combination of martial arts disciplines such as muay Thai, aikido and jiu-jitsu, 
              and it does not have the set routines common to other fighting 
              techniques.<br><strong>The damage:</strong> Fightworks Asia conducts regular 
              krav maga classes seven days a week and boasts the reputation of being the only 
              certified and approved IKMF (International Krav Maga Federation) training center 
              in Singapore. Class fees are $200 per month for unlimited training sessions, and 
              personal training sessions are also available. Basic safety gear consisting of 
              protective guards and shields can be purchased at $250. For those who want to 
              acquire IKMF certification, the program costs $1,500 and you need to be 
              eligible. The school also offers a comprehensive range of combat techniques such 
              as jeet kune do, boxing, capoeira, muay thai, gungkite kali derecho (SKD), judo 
              and more. <br><strong>#04-00 Standard Photo Building, 565 Macpherson Rd., 
              6285-6028, www.fightworksasia.com.sg</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Muay Thai<br>The lowdown:</strong> The national sport of the Thais, 
              the ancient art of muay Thai is known as “the art of eight limbs” and is guided 
              by Buddhist spiritual tenets. With the hands, shins and elbows heavily employed 
              during combat, available points of contact are increased during bouts, thus 
              increasing the variety of strategies available to the fighters; and making this 
              sport especially thrilling to watch. Consisting of a complex series of moves 
              such as hooks, jabs, knee strikes and uppercuts, muay Thai is good for building 
              flexibility, agility and stamina.<br><strong>The damage: </strong>At Royal Thai 
              Fitness, set up by Master Thomas Chan, you get to learn the skills of muay Thai 
              in a unique outdoor pavilion. Lessons range from basic to expert and include 
              guided one-on-one sparring sessions. Fees start at $25 per session for group 
              training to $65 per session for personal training sessions. Alternatively, you 
              can also sign up for packages consisting of four (individuals, $300 or $360; 
              group, $140 or $220) or eight sessions. <br><strong>#05-02, 55 Newton Rd.,

              <p><strong>Panuntukan<br>The lowdow: </strong>Known as “dirty boxing,” 
              panuntukan is a fighting system from the Philippines that developed in the 
              streets. Based on movements from the kali knife system (another indigenous 
              Filipino martial art), its movements comprise swift upper-body actions, 
              prioritizing parries and deflections over blocks. It also includes low-line 
              kicks to the legs and knees. According to Guro Fred Evrard, founder of Kali 
              Majapahit, a local martial arts school that specializes in Filipino martial art, 
              it’s the efficiency in techniques that sets Filipino fighting systems, such as 
              panutukan, apart from others. “Panuntukan’s techniques look similar to muay 
              Thai’s, but it has some added tricks. It is not ruled by regulations and was, 
              kept as a warrior art, with the obvious efficiency that comes with it, he 
              says.<br><strong>The damage: </strong>At Kali Majapahit, a panuntukan programme 
              is priced at $99 per month for two training sessions per week, and the school 
              provides heavy bags, speed balls, wooden dummies and tatami mats so that you can 
              practice in safety. The school also offers lessons in kali majapahit, a martial 
              art created by Evrad, and programs specially designed for children as young as 
              six. <br><strong>#02-01, 43 Carpenter St., 6534-5254,

              <p><strong>Mixed Martial Arts <br>The lowdown:</strong> Can’t decide which 
              martial art discipline to try? Give Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) a go. A blend of 
              muay Thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing and wrestling, it is suitable for 
              learners of all ages and fitness levels and trains you into a complete fighter 
              adept in four primary ranges of combat—kicking, punching, 
              clinching/kneeing/takedowns and ground fighting. Chatri Sityodtong, muay Thai 
              instructor at Evolve Mixed Martial Arts, says, “Ninety percent of all martial 
              art moves are actually ineffective in real life, but every technique in MMA has 
              been proven to work in reality. MMA takes the best 10 percent techniques from 
              every martial art around the world.”  <br><strong>The damage: </strong>Boasting 
              an impressive roll call of professional MMA fighters and instructors, including 
              top MMA fighter in Singapore, Setsuma Takeda, Evolve Mixed Martial Arts offers 
              an extensive range of packages depending on the length of commitment of each 
              participant, and prices start from $189 per month. The school also has a special 
              program to train professional fighters and offers lessons in individual combat 
              disciplines such as muay Thai, submission grappling, street self-defense, 
              Brazilian jiu-jitsu and wrestling. It also has a program for children aged six 
              to 15 years-old to develop discipline and self-defence 
              skills.<br><strong>#02-22,1 Selegie Rd., 6337-0082, <a title="www.evolve-mma.com" href="http://www.evolve-mma.com/">www.evolve-mma.com</a> </strong></p>
