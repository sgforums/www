            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Seibukan Jujutsu History<br><br>"By bringing awareness and freedom of individual expression through the path of Seibukan Jujutsu, each person has the opportunity to reach their highest potential and achieve self-mastery." - Julio Toribio-Kancho<br>History of Jujutsu<br>The history of jujutsu lies in the pre-history of Japan, actually, in the reality of mankind. Man has needed to defend himself from the dawn of time. The earliest traceable culture in Japan dates from the year 5000 BC. From this period, clay figures of warriors were uncovered from tombs. Though the history of Jujutsu may well be considered to have begun in the first or second century BC, it's renaissance or Golden Age" was during the Tokugawan era, (1603-1867 AD). It was during this period that major schools of the art flourished and became specific, identifiable martial sciences.<br><br>This period of time was the filter bed of the martial arts. They were tried and tested, passed or failed during this time. Those that failed, did so because of their ineffective or unrealistic techniques. Some styles were absorbed into others, and new styles arose through improvements on the techniques of the original schools. The testing ground for theory was in actual combat. The term jujutsu was formulated during the seventeenth or eighteenth century. Jujutsu once had many other names, such as: Tai-Jutsu, Kumiuchi, Hakute, Torite, Kenpo, and Yawara. Jujutsu is also spelled: Jiu-Jiutsu, Ju-Jitsu, or Jiu-Jitsu. The spelling, Jujutsu, is traditionally used. Jutsu refers to an art, science or discipline. Ju refers to yielding, flexibility and suppleness.<br><br>Prior to and during the rise of the Tokugawan Shogunate (Military Government), many schools of martial arts developed immobilizing holds and methods of striking, which we know as Atemi. These methods utilized mainly the elbows, hips, fists and knees, with none of the finger jabbing associated with the late Edo period jujutsu or present day styles. Grappling was used primarily as a standby or asset to the weapons training of the bushi (military). During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a few bujutsu ryu (martial art systems), gave prominence to the grappling techniques over weapons techniques.<br><br>The Samurai had an arsenal of weapon arts to choose from:<br><br>* Sojutsu: The Art of the spear and associated weapons<br>* Kenjutsu: The Art of the sword and other hand held bladed weapons<br>* Bojutsu: The Art of the stave, stick, baton or cudgel-type weapon<br>* Bajutsu: The Art of horsemanship<br>* Suieijutsu: The Art of swimming, both with and without armor<br>* Senjojutsu: The Art of military tactics<br>* Kyujutsu: The Art of archery<br>* Hojutsu: The Art of gunnery<br>* Naginatajutsu: The Art of the long halberd<br>* Iautsu: The Art of drawing the sword (also known as Battojutsu)<br>* Kusarigarnajutsu: The Art of chain and sickle<br>* Tantojutsu: The Art of the dagger<br>* Toritejutsu: The Art of rope binding<br><br>Ryu is a system, mode or tradition of martial practice. Some excelled in certain forms and became noted for their field of excellence. For example, Tenshin Katori Shinto Ryu is classified as a kenjutsu ryu. Muso Shinden Ryti is an iai-jutsu ryu. The schools or traditions of Ninjutsu were broken down into Togakure Ninpo Ryu,(Tai-jutsu), Koga Ninja Ryu, Gyokku Ryu and Kotto Ryu which were grappling and tearing schools, who used Tekagi (spiked gauntlets) or Shuriken (spikes). Being classified a jujutsu school did not exclude the use of weapons.<br><br>It was in the Tokugawan era that two lineages of jujutsu became interwoven. The first lineage was the purely Japanese methods such as Oshi-Ki-Uchi modes of the Daito Ryu. The second lineage is that of the Chinese connection. There are two points of transmission in the history of jujutsu. One was pre-Tokugawan and the other Tokugawan. The first, legend says, is that a physician and herbalist traveled to Peking to study Chinese methods of healing. He learned resuscitation techniques, massage, bone setting and joint manipulation which are known in Japanese as Kappo or Kuatsu. He learned the theory of yin and yang and trained many days in a monastery. Upon returning to Japan, he formed the Yoshin Ryti which incorporated techniques he learned and adapted, and added the principle of non-resistance. Offshoots of this ryu came into being. One, Kiaijutsu, centered upon the source of "Ki", energy. Others developed their own strengths, taking what they felt was best from the Japanese and Chinese knowledge.<br><br>The second was the Ryoi Shinto Ryu, founded in a monastery in what is now a suburb of modern Tokyo. A Chinese master of Chiao-Ti-Shu (Chinese version of jujutsu) and healer with a Confucian background moved to Japan to escape the Mongol invasion of China in the 1600's. He met a Japanese master of jujutsu. These two masters met and exchanged information. Eventually the Chinese master returned, and Fukuno, the founder of Ryoi Shinto Ryu adapted all he learned into his system. This was the beginning of the rise of modern jujutsu.<br><br>The Beginnings of Modern Jujutsu<br>In the mid 1800's the first "diplomatic" mission from the West entered Japan. After much "negotiating", the Japanese were coerced into the nineteenth century civilization. The Japanese eventually became open to western influence and western methods. The day of the Samurai warrior was over, and the day of the merchant began. The West succeeded in reversing the Japanese social structure, placing the merchant on top and the warrior on the bottom. This was the beginning of the end of the Tokugawan regime. The use of the sword and its teachings were prohibited. This was a strife filled time until it settled and the Samurai found other methods to exist. Some became "yakuza", protecting brothels and gaming places, others went on stage to demonstrate their arts for money. Many martial systems were lost or died out and some opened schools of Martial Arts. So it was with jujutsu. This was the first time an attempt was made to organize the martial arts. In 1895 the Dai Nihon Butokukai was formed by various Bujutsu styles. The Butokuden Martial Arts Hall was established in 1899.<br><br>Jigoro Kano was born in 1871. He, like many, studied jujutsu. He also was politically involved, and rose quickly in the system as a member of the Japanese Parliament. Kano was very involved in jujutsu and realized that many masters were dying and taking their techniques with them, as martial arts and jujutsu were no longer needed. He created Kodokan Judo,(hall for the study of the way of the gentle way). This was his way of inaugurating a new school of jujutsu. This style was based mainly on the throwing techniques of the Kito Ryu and the striking and locking techniques of the Tenjin Shin'yo Ryu. He added techniques from other schools and had teachers like Saigo Shiro of Daito Ryu teach there also. He did not wish, as is understood, to dismember jujutsu and replace it with a sport, but rather envisioned the Kodokan as an institute which would preserve all teachings and techniques of the various jujutsu ryu. Daito Ryu Aiki Jujutsu.<br><br>Another development during this time was the Daito Ryu Aiki-Jujutsu School. This Ryu was actually developed in the mid 800's AD by Teijun Fujiwara. According to legend, he was the sixth son of Emperor Seiwa and discovered the principle of aiki ("harmonious spirit" or energetic connection). He passed the art to his son, who was given the name Minamoto and passed on to his descendants. They are known as Seiwa Genji and kept aikijujutsu as their secret family art. These were all men of historical importance. They held the position of general in charge of the Northern Army.<br><br>There are those who regard these beginnings as legend, but it is undeniable that the Seiwa Minamoto went from nothing to become the most powerful warriors in Japan. And they did this in only four generations despite many older, wealthier families who had more combat experience. The sudden rise of the Minamoto is attributed to their hijutsu (secret art).<br><br>The name "Daito Ryu" (the great eastern style) stems from the Minamoto family being the most powerful family in eastern Japan. Minamoto Yoshimitsu is regarded as the actual founder of Daito Ryu. He was a master of many arts. He was a poet, warrior, physician and historian. It is said he advanced the art of atemi (striking vital points on the body) and kansetsu joint locks) by dissecting the bodies of criminals and war dead. He is also said to have devised many new methods of restraining a prisoner by observing the action of a spider weaving a web about its prey.<br><br>At the beginning of the Meiji era, (late 1800's) Saigo Tanomo Chikamasa, a Shinto priest, was all that was left of the Daito Ryu. He was a Daimyo and member of Aizu clan and lord of a fortress. Now the samurai was just a Shinto priest. Saigo approached a young swordsman, Sokaku Takeda and hired him as a bodyguard.<br><br>Takeda was a skilled swordsman, born and raised as a Samurai. By the time he was 20 years old, he had mastered the Ono-ha Itto Ryu sword school and the Kyoshin Meichi Ryu and Jikkishin Kage Ryu sword styles as well the spear techniques of Hosoin Ryu.<br><br>Saigo wished Takeda to study Daito Ryu and pass on his knowledge, but he was still busy with his sword. Takeda was later attacked by a mob of workmen as a result of words over his sword. Some three hundred workers attacked him, the majority of them armed. Police intervened and saved Takeda, but before they did he had killed twelve and wounded several more. Saigo advised Takeda to learn his system, since the time of the swords was over. Takeda still declined. Saigo, instead took Shida Shiro and taught him the techniques of Daito Ryu. Shiro went on after his training, to join Kano at the Kodokan and was a driving force with Kano in the early days, aimed at saving Jujutsu.<br><br>Saigo, in 1898, contacted Takeda again, and persuaded him to study Daito Ryu. Takeda quickly was interested, and earnestly began his studies. He greatly improved the aiki-jujutsu techniques. He opened a dojo and taught Daito Ryti Aiki-Jujutsu. Takeda moved to Hokkaido where he was visited by Judo master Mifune, who had been sent by Kano to learn Daito Ryu techniques to incorporate into Kano's Judo. Two other students came as well, Kotaro Yoshida and Morihei Ueshiba. Ueshiba had studied other arts and later, obtained permission from Takeda to teach Daito Ryu. As is now known, he went on to develop Aiki Budo, which later became Aikido.<br><br>Takeda continued teaching with the help of his son, Tokimune. Tokimune is considered the person in modern times who was instrumental in the spread of the art throughout the world. This art is based on a series of techniques with emphasis on Ki, (extension of energy) and has been the foundation in the development of many current martial arts, i.e. Aikido, Yamate Ryu, Hapkido, Yanagi Ryu and Hakko Ryu.<br><br>Daito Ryu has 118 basic techniques, 164 higher level techniques and 66 secret techniques. Daito Ryu dojos are very traditional in structure. In Japan, outsiders would not be permitted without formal recommendation and even when this condition is met, tests of respect, attitude, and dedication are subtle throughout the training. The secret techniques are never taught except to an uchideshi and then only under the promise of keeping them secret, and never sharing it unless with direct permission. It is understood that students of jujutsu train to acquire a spiritual and technical maturity in the art and then transcend it ultimately. This is done with combative experience and the practice of being admitted to the knowledge of the "Hidden-sho", special techniques of the school. Today, this attitude is held by many teachers and dojos of classical and modern arts. Sokaku Takeda died in 1943 and is considered the main developer of the Daito Ryu system. His son Tokimune Takeda took over the position of Soke (headmaster of the ryu) and continued teaching and spreading the art. In 1993 he passed away, having named Katsuyuki Kondo his successor.<br>Hakko Ryu Jujutsu<br>A prominent student of Daito Ryu was Ryliho Okuyama, founder of Hakko Ryu or school of the Eighth Light. He was a direct student of Toshimi Hosaku Matsuda, an instructor under Sokaku Takeda. Okuyama studied extensively the techniques of Daito Ryu Aiki-jujutsu and in Takeda's later years, studied under him as well. Ryuho Okuyama, Shodai Soke traveled and studied extensively throughout Japan and Okinawa developing his martial skills. He also studied various schools of weaponry. Among the major ones he studied Hasegawa-ryu iaijutsu (sword drawing) which he learned from Shihan Yamaguchi in Sapporo; shurikenjutsu (various throwing weapons) and jojutsu (stick) from teachers in the mountains of Nugata; kusarigama (sickle-chain) in Ise; Nito-ryu kenjutsu (sword) at Kumamoto Hot Springs; and sojutsu (spear) as well as kyujutsu (archery) in Yamagata province.<br><br>Besides his study of various martial arts, he studied healing systems and apprenticed to masters of Oriental medicine. He met and studied with Ryozan Hirayama in 1930. Mr. Hirayama was a teacher and practitioner of the Japanese In/Yo theory as applied to meridian therapy. Okuyama learned the principles and application for the diagnosis of disease, both pulse and face reading, shiatsu (finger pressure technique) amma (massage) and diet. He also met a teacher and later friend who gave him an understanding of what was then, new, Western medicine.<br><br>At the age of 40, he broke away from his classical teachers and founded Hakko Ryu Jujutsu. On June 1, 1941 he officially proclaimed his school and art, Hakko Ryu Jujutsu. Ryuho Okuyama died in 1986 and passed his name and title to his son Toshio, now Ryuho Okuyama-Nidai Soke. Nidai Soke grew up in the Hakko Ryti Honbu dojo, studying and acquiring the physical skills of the system. He, along with a council, oversee the Hakko Ryu organization in Omiya City.<br><br>Hakko Ryu Jujutsu is a traditional martial art which emphasizes a series of prearranged techniques (kata), similar to Daito Ryu. These are model attacks and defenses in which each student knows what action the other will take and no major alterations are made. There are seven levels taught to the students in this system. The first four are black belt levels, Shodan, Nidan, Sandan, Yondan. The last three levels: Shihan, Menkyo Kaiden, and Sandaikichu can only be given and authorized by the founder or designated successor at Hombu Dojo, Omiya, Japan. The belt color for these three levels is purple. The idea behind the name Eighth Light had to do with the nine color bands in the sun's color spectrum. The eighth color is red which has a powerful vibration. He likened it to the techniques of Hakko Ryu. The purple in the upper belts comes from purple being a color of royalty and honor in Japan.<br><br>The techniques of Hakko Ryu retain their strength and aiki foundation. The organization and political underpinnings are slowly eroding the cohesion of the ryu at this time. Many first generation students/teachers from Shodai Soke have left. The future of the ryu is unknown.<br>Seibukan Jujutsu<br>Julio Toribio studied and achieved the highest rank in Hakko Ryti Jujutsu. Times had changed and arts need to evolve. Toribio Shihan could no longer continue the path of the old traditions and strict rules. Faced with different challenges than those of the samurai days, different tools were required. His desire to continue learning, training and being creative, prompted him to combine his knowledge, and adapt those skills into what is now Seibukan Jujutsu, an art and path for modern times.<br><br>At the age of 13, Shihan Toribio began his studies of martial disciplines. Among the various Japanese Systems he studied and achieved Black Belt levels in: Okinawa Tempo Karate, Aikido, Hakko Ryu Jujutsu, Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu/Ninjutsu and Ensign Itto Ryu Iaido. He served as a US Army Airborne Ranger and taught hand to hand combat. Toribio Shihan has also studied various healing arts, including Combat First Aid, Physical Therapy, Nursing, Koho Shiatsu and Massage. He has vigorously sought exposure to numerous martial disciplines, spiritual paths and grappling arts. Among those are: Jujutsu, Judo, Ninjutsu, Daido and Aikido from Japan; Haw Rang Do, Kuk Sool Won and Hapkido from Korea; Chin Na, Tai Chi and Shuai Chiao from China; Arnis and Eskrima from the Philippines; and the most ancient of all, Kalaripayit from India. All these and more have contributed to the formation and development of Seibukan Jujutsu.<br><br>Seibukan Jujutsu is an effective and practical martial art developed for self-protection as well as personal development. Based on ancient tradition, Seibukan Jujutsu has been developed to meet the needs of the modern day warrior. Its Japanese roots, and the Seikendo healing art, make it unique among other systems. The name, Seibukan Jujutsu, describes the art. Seibukan means (Sei= correct, Bu= martial, Kan house) the house of correct martial arts. Jujutsu means (Ju= flexible, Jutsu= art) flexible art. Seibukan Dojo means the house of correct martial arts training hall.<br><br>The physical and self-defense aspect of Seibukan Jujutsu emphasize defense against armed and unarmed, single and multiple assailants. Gun, knife, club, rope, sword, long and short sticks are some of the weapons used in Seibukan Jujutsu to teach disarming techniques. The Taijutsu, or unarmed techniques, teach escaping, throws, chokes, grappling, join locking, counter techniques, and ground defense. The effective and practical application of the art are preceeded by learning and using: pressure points, kicks, and strikes to the body as distractions or to properly control and subdue an attacker. As a result, the students are conscious of avoiding unnecessary injuries.<br><br>Seibukan Jujutsu consists of twelve levels of study. The first five are Kyu levels. These levels are preparation to become a black belt. During this time, students find their own pace of learning, and setting and achieving goals thorugh practice of Awareness, Assesment, and Action. The last seven are Dan levels. These are the black belt levels. In a progressive way, each level as a theme, self defense techniques, and self development concepts to study and put in practice. Each black belt level consists of it's own unique Kata (prearrange techniques with a partner), principles, and many unarmed and disarming applications.<br><br>On June 1st, 1993, Julio Toribio Shihan officially announced the founding of Seibukan Jujutsu. He has combined his skills, knowledge and experience to give us Seibukan Jujutsu, a martial discipline and path adapted to modern times. As a contribution to the marial art world, it is his vision to expand Seibukan Jujutsu around the globe.</div>
