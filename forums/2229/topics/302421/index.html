            <div class='col-md body'>I always thought these army survival courses were totally pointless and completely stupid. (a reflection of the people up there who plan these?)<br><br>Teaching you how to kill a chicken, frog, iguana, etc. The question is, can you find it and catch it first? If you can't even catch the animal in a survival situation how the heck you going to need to kill it?<br><br>Wouldn't living on easily obtainable foods like fruits (bananas, coconuts, banana shoots, buah cherry, papaya, etc), root tubers (tapioca) and insects be a more highly probable way for the normal soldier to survive?<br><br>And when you're really in a survival situation and you're hungry enough, I don't think anyone will have any problems killing anything. I'll just rip it in two if I need to, which makes these courses totally pointless. I won't need to learn how to kill a chicken when I'm hungry. I'll just bash it's skull with a rock till it's dead and throw it on the fire.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">Erm... in army, during the POW training course, almost everyone could kill a chicken...
