              <p>We just had our Combat Game Try Outs last Sunday 15th Nov 2009 at Cheng San CC. For those of you who are not aware of it, I used to call it Martial Art Tanding Tournament (MTT) in the other thread.</p>
              <p>I would like to thank people in this community (sgforums) for supporting this concept. That day's session 1st timers were made up of people from this forum and I hope more will turn up next time. The feedbacks we got were very encouraging. Therefore we have decided to hold it once every 2 months... You can view all the matches <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pallov92">here</a> </p>
              <p>With this one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Wcd3IGeE8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Wcd3IGeE8</a> being the most highly charged match...</p>

              <p>I just met him today and we took off very well... He is a fine martial artist and we talked about philosophy and stuff which I found very engaging indeed... I am very glad to have made his acquaintance. Too bad that I only got very limited time and promised that we will continue our conversation in the future...</p>

              <p>That's the biggest reason why right now we are not allowing any hits to head. Anyway most of the trainer present at this event are first aider and the ref will control the combatants while they are sparring and definitely will intervene when there is a disparity in the level of competency.</p>
              <p>We have run altogether 3 try outs without any problem so far and there is one scheduled on the 14th of March at Cheng San CC as well 2pm to 6pm</p>

              <p>That's the biggest reason why right now we are not allowing any hits to head. Anyway most of the trainer present at this event are first aider and the ref will control the combatants while they are sparring and definitely will intervene when there is a disparity in the level of competency.</p>
              <p>We have run altogether 3 try outs without any problem so far and there is one scheduled on the 14th of March at Cheng San CC as well 2pm to 6pm</p>

              <p>there was a report last year or before, there was this kid  TKD, I think who died after being kicked in the chest or stomach accidently by the opponent. in a freak accident, you are only one kick or punch away from fatally wounding or killing the opponent.</p>

              <p>I don't think so... Its was unfortunate that it should happen. The guy was hit directly at his throat / neck area. And as you can see we have taken precautions that the head hit starts from the area below the neck. That should more or less give some level of protection...</p>
              <p>This kind of sparring is not something new and you do not have to scare people away if you are not comfortable with it. I would like to invite you to see the sparring for yourself during one of my training sessions at Cheng San CC Ang Mo Kio St 53 behind Ang Mo Kio MRT station every thursday night 8pm to 9:30pm and then you judge whether it is safe or not... ok ? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
