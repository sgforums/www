              <p>What are the rules and regulations in a martial art competition?</p>
              <p>It seems that there are many stupid rules like what leg cannot kick too high lah etc.</p>
              <p>When you learn martial art is to learn how to defend yourself when you get into a fight. During a real fight there will be no judge standing down there telling you to stop etc because you have broken the rule etc.</p>
              <p>I believe that during Bruce Lee time when he join martial art competition there is no so many stupid rules. Otherwise, he will not be able to display out all his real skills if he had to follow all kinds of stupid rules.</p>
              <p>During a martial art comeptition, as long as the participants do not use weapons such as knife etc it should be ok already what. Where got cannot kick too high lah so stupid rule. As long as you do not use weapons and you can knock your opponent out you win already what.</p>

              <p>High kicks to the head makes a person easily unbalanced. Just watch any taekwondo sparring match, including those from the olympics, where arguably the best TKD sparrers compete in. It is not very impressive to kick once then fall down on your own.Â </p>
              <p>Another reason is that the force of a kick is much harder to control than a punch, especially if the kicker has not trained enough. It has enough force to concuss and in more severe cases kill a person if the kick is not blocked. Competition sparring is not real fighting, it has to ensure reasonable safety of its competitors.</p>

              <p>Hi, Daveteo, as you yourself have said, there are no rules in a fight. (Actually there are still laws and social mores, but never mind.) A truly "realistic" fighting competition should involve multiple scenarios, including uneven numbers, disparity in weapons (bare hands versus knife, for instance), uneven terrain, and surprise elements (e.g., getting ambushed from behind halfway through the fight). Hence, "no holds barred" competitions like the UFC still are very far from capturing the majority of primary factors in a fight.</p>
              <p>The very presence of a referee, the safety net of being able to tap out or throw in the towel, and the certainty of when and how the fight is going to start also change the milieu completely.</p>
              <p>Therefore, rules are always in place in a competition, and even the UFC has a huge set of explicit and implicit ones. Certain rules favour certain fighting styles or mindsets, certainly, and it is thus common for fight organizers to set up the rules so as to give the advantage to their own guys. And then there's the safety issue. Nobody wants to get sued, and nobody wants to have someone die or become crippled during their tournament.</p>
              <p>It's true, I guess, that the more unfamiliar rules there are, the more restricted one becomes. A part of your mind gets caught up in remembering to dampen your natural instincts, which could totally change your game plan, flow, etc. Perhaps you could approach such events as just-for-fun exercises to see how you would do under different circumstances? Sparring is never the same as real fighting anyway, and even real fighting spans a huge range of situations and consequences.</p>
