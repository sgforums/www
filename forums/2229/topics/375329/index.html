            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hello fellow Martial Art Enthusiast,</p>
              <p>Recently, (1st and 2nd August 2009) I managed to organise a Tournament that allows everyone with or without Martial Art background to compete in a sparring competition. The reason why it is called Tanding (which actually means match in Malay) because the rules are based on silat sparring competition. We did not follow wholesale but customised and tweaked it so that we can run the competition with minimum risk but maximum impact !!!</p>
              <p>The following link is an excerpt from the competition...</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E12pU--ILE&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E12pU--ILE&amp;feature=related</a></p>
              <p>and you can view the rest as there 3 other parts to it...</p>
              <p>The link below will bring to the rules and regulations that governs this competition for that day... it needs further tweaking as the game develops in the future...<br><a href="http://www.macanpasrah.macan.info/?p=156">http://www.macanpasrah.macan.info/?p=156</a></p>
              <p>Even though the respond for the event was not what we expected but we managed to get the result we wanted because there was a team of non-silat athletes who trains on their own joining the tournament and a single street fighter who compete the next day. You see...most of the contenders were from silat background...</p>
              <p>This non-silat participants provided us with a glimpse of what to expect if we manage to attract more participation in the future. I feel this is definitely an alternative tournament all martial artist and enthusiats should consider competing in because what is the point of practicing martial art just to compete with similar genre ? You may never be able to appreciate your art fully if you just compete among yourself... There infinite ways and combinations of fight techniques one should be exposed to for one to develop one's own techniques to the fullest, agree ?</p>
              <p>The Tanding Rules (customised) may not be the best rule but it provides a platform for almost all martial art techniques to be executed without being biased. What I meant is if you get a silat practioner to wear gloves, then he/she will be handicapped because in silat every single part of the body from the toes and fingers is needed to execute the moves fluently and effectively... Hence this tournament does not restrict whether you wear or do not wear any gloves and protected guards (abiding to the rule) in order to compete.</p>
              <p>However hitting the head is a total disqualification because this is a competition for the masses. Hitting the head area will definitely invite unfortunate accidents that can result to death or being maimed for life. Come on... this is a sport and not a brawl but a platform to appreciate the beautiful techniques of the martial art... Hitting the head area will not only be dangerous but it promotes animosity among contenders...</p>
              <p>Through our experience, friendship bonds will almost always be forged right after a good clean match because it raised the respect and appreciation among contenders... This is not a sissy tournament be cause you can hit as hard as you want at all the legal areas of the body in order to score points.</p>
              <p>The previous tournament was for team event and we discover that this was one reason why participation was low therefore the next tournament will be for individual contender male and female. </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; line-height: normal; color: #444444; font-size: 13px;">Basically if it is organised for individual, the match will be a 2 round match of 2 to 3 mins per round. The contenders will know the result after every round and the next round will start with a clean score sheet. The winner is decided if he/she can either win both rounds or at the tie-breaker round (which means they spar for 3 rounds)...</span></p>
              <p>I appreciate very much any comments regarding this matter...</p>
              <p>Thank you...</p>

              <p>After saying that the hits to gain points must be hard and significant in order to be legitimate...</p>
              <p>The first of its kind here where all martial arts are not being handicapped except that they need to wear body protectors that will cushion abit of the blows but soft enough for the contender to move in...</p>

              <p>Oh Ya ! I forgot to write this down earlier... If we reach the quota of 40 participants, contenders can look forward to compete at least 4 times.This covers preliminary up to quarter-finals...</p>
              <p>Those who goes through quarterfinals will have to compete two more times because we also cater for 3rd and 4th placing matches.</p>
              <p>This is made possible because we are making provisions for four category of finals, similar to a rugby league format where you have the bowl, plate and cup categories in the finals. Of course we will termed it differently...</p>

              <p>Actually not really as the main obstacle of getting a place to hold the tournament and qualified refereeing panel have all been settled... the only obstacle now is to convince people to join the tournament which will cost them $30 as entrance fee. It is not too expensive, is it ? All contenders will get to download their match via their own thumb drive as soon as it is uploaded in the computer. Not to mention having the chance to continue to compete even after losing a match.</p>
              <p>I have organized a trial tournament before and it is actually very safe and fun. At the same time, contenders can use it as a yardstick to measure how much they have internalize their own art which is one of the objective of the tournament. Next objective is to provide a safe and control environment for all martial art enthusiast to internalize and explore their mastery of the art they are practicing. At the same time having a chance to sample and observe other martial art technique in live action. It also provides a platform for all to network for future community projects.</p>

              <p>Yes, there is no weight category, however the minimum age we put it at 16 years old but if a younger contender feels he/she is up to it, I don't see why not ?</p>
              <p>About the street fighter style of fight, we can control them through the rules and regulations which are pretty tight as of now and which we will be giving a lot of attention during the seminar... On the flip side, wouldn't you want to pit your skill with with those who do not believe in practicing any art and feels that they can beat the crap out of us ?</p>
              <p>You see... this tournament celebrates all martial art style and exposes them to people who feels that it is a waste of time practicing it. Let's see whether their theory holds water... You may never know that we can make converts out of them ?</p>
              <p>And on the other hand, the martial artist will know how well they can defend themselves with the art they are practicing because this tournament is the most safe and controlled scenario you will ever get to discover your skill level in the face of a real fight and knowing the street fighter, their offence is their defense. Hence you can get to realize the effectiveness of your defense skills real time... </p>

              <p>I was trained in various styles outside just for sports and the real scary stuffs inside the Armed Forces but too old to compete now even if I wanted to it is really interesting to know that such a competition is possible.You know street fighters wouldnt stand a fat chance in a contolled tanding like this and so would a Martial artist who is trained in only one discipline because he wouldnt have the versatilty to size up and beat his opponent.So how fair is this competition?</p>

              <p><br>ps hor bcoz i know this is out of topic but i bet to differ!! my friend is a street fighter (not the game) challange someone from martial arts and it was a draw.... bcoz street fighting is abit similar to kickboxing and they bear no rules. Some fighting style at least have a few forbidden strike like for example ah, like cant hit inbetween the groin or cant attack person on the ground and such because they were raise thru teaching. Street fighting is like they themselves learn one so its different and i bet they spar alot without any guidance so their experience gain is more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so i think that everyone is welcome...maybe street fighters do have a chance here!! but so far, only judo can stop street fighters &lt;---got it from my friend</p>

              <p>This is just my opinion so dont take it too seriously.</p>
              <p>A person trained in Martial Art can fight like a madman going for your vital organs if he wanted to but not a street fighter doesnt know how to fight like a trained exponent.That is if you still want to talk about Street brawls and barfights but in a competition with rules the street fighters brutality is being controlled</p>

              <p>Of course street fighter is welcomed in this tournament and definitely they have a chance of winning the tournament as much as anyone else... The rules basically disallowed all vital point hits. Only hits to the torso is allowed and hits to the legs must make the opponent fall before you can get your points.</p>
              <p>Actually what we want to achieve is to regulate the match which can be enjoyed by all and still keep it safe for the contenders... This by no means trying to discover which martial art is better but to unearthed a good all rounded fighter which has total control of the technique be it from the streets or  martial art school for everyone to appreciate and for the practitioner to use and refine it further...</p>
              <p>Street fighters are natural fighters with good motor skills. Hence that may be one reason why they feel that learning martial art is not necessary. Which I agree to a certain extent...</p>
              <p>So if know of anyone who categorize themselves as street fighter, please spread the news to them because this may be the only tournament that they can compete in without sacrificing most of their technique and it is totally legit...</p>

              <p>I would not go as far as saying the Street fighter do not have a fair chance in this tournament. If they spar often enough they may be able to discover technique that they can execute effectively especially if they have been sparring with people with martial art background.</p>
              <p>As for martial art practitioner...at last this is one tournament that never restrict them from having to wear gloves or high scoring just from kicking the opponent. All hard significant hits scores the same points be it from kicks, punches, elbows, knees etc... On top of that they can execute takedown maneuvers as well with 3 points given to it.</p>
              <p>Martial art has to be versatile and dynamic for it to be effective because if ever one needs to employ it effectively one cannot just hope that the threat comes in a certain way. Threats can come it any ways possible and the tournament just prepares the martial artist to it in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
              <p>The seminar is organized to attend all these concerns and aspire to create a level playing field for all to compete in. </p>

              <p>Thanks buddy for the interest you have shown in supporting the thread... </p>
              <p>Yes, many more of this tournament will be held if we can get more people to join in. I am definitely going to organize this at least two to three times in a year... This forum will be the first one to know of any plans in the future because of the amount of support I am getting from it as a spin off from the discussion held here.</p>
              <p>I am even hoping if we can do it at the atrium of one the Shopping Centers here if can generate more interest and sponsors...</p>
