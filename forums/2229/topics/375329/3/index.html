              <p>At workshop or seminar we do not need them (medics) but during the tournament we will have first aider stationed... if we need to ferry anyone to the hospital, we can just call for ambulance 995...  no problem... done it before... no hassle...</p>

              <p>Hey, thanks man... I hope we can get better fighting moments this time around... I need all the support that I can get... especially if anyone here can connect me with some events management company that can enable future tournaments to be held at Shopping Centers...</p>
              <p>I am glad that you can see the potential of using Tanding as the basis but it has changed so much and moved very far away from the original concept... Actually I hope to bring in a martial art group from Melbourne if the concept can be agreed upon but I feel that we should do it 1 more time with a more larger pool of participants from a variety of martial art again in order to refine the rules and regulations further... </p>

              <p>Hello guys,</p>
              <p>For some of you who are worried about the logistical aspects of the MTT, rest assured that it has all been taken care of. I have organized similar sparring tournaments before. 3 times before to be exact and many friendlies...</p>
              <p>However, I need your suggestion on how to increase the participation. This tournament can take in 40 contenders. If you don't mind, please suggest ways to ease the registration so as not to inconvenience potential contenders...</p>
              <p>To start the ball rolling, the following are what I have in mind...</p>
              <p>1. Contenders download the application and indemnity form from my website.</p>
              <p>2. Submit the completed form plus payment to Cheng San CC. This is where one of the problem arise... Actually I do not mind picking them up or perhaps I can do a courier service style like how the credit card company do it ? Where they will send a dispatch rider to your place and collect everything from you...</p>
              <p>Of course, it will be good if let's say I dedicate certain days where I stationed myself in certain areas so that participants can make their way there and process the application.</p>
              <p>What do you think ?</p>

              <p>However after saying that, you can always use part of the technique for takedown points which gets the most value that is 3 points...</p>
              <p>You are able to employ your technique against a totally different way from yours and perhaps will be able to refine the way you are able to execute your maneuver from a different perspective...</p>
              <p>I am sorry that I cannot satisfy all martial art but I strongly feel that grappling style of art also has many different interpretation, be it BJJ, Wrestling, Ju Jitsu, MMA etc. hence warrants another genre of all style grappling tournament.</p>

              <p>I have my first meeting with my refereeing panel and some of their recommendations are as follows.</p>
              <p>1. There will be two weight categories. <br>Lower weight category is 75kg and below.<br>Higher weight category is above 75kg .</p>
              <p>2. Kicks will get 2 points and punches 1 point from every legal hit.<br>This is because there is a possibility of the opponent's ability to grab the kick and do a takedown maneuver from it.</p>
              <p>Please give me your feedbacks whether it is ok or not...</p>

              Very funny! After considering the past competition, a defensive strategy relying on the integrity of the body guard and baiting opponents into kicks to the torso definitely came to mind. Anyone silly enough to kick into a guard deserves the takedown they'll get handed. ;)
              
              So I'll have to disagree with the 2 points for a kick. If a kick is a poor offensive choice, then I don't think that it should be encouraged with extra points.
              
              Also, if someone weighs in less than 75kg, can they also compete in the above 75kg category?

              <p>Thank you for your feedback which gives us another perspective to it. </p>
              <p>The fact that there is a possibility of the kick being grappled and the contender taken down will stop the contender from employing kicks if there is no premium in the form of 2 points given  to the hits from kicks.</p>
              <p>Kicks are by no means a poor offensive choice, on the contrary, it is very good offensive and defensive technique. But it cannot be employed by people who does not possess the knowledge of executing it correctly... Remember, we do not want this tournament to be just like another boxing tournament but a truly new way of sparring competition that is very exciting visually...</p>
              <p>As for now, the weight category is tentative. The reason we put it in such a way is because we do not want to see a 55 kg contender to fight a 110 kg contender but this is open for discussion and we will take a vote at the seminar whether to carry on with this or otherwise... Most of the rules and regulations will be discussed during the seminar and a show of hands will be the deciding factor whether the r &amp; r will be implemented or not....</p>
              <p>The weight category is also not easy to carry out and we will get a better picture after we get all the participants signing up for the competition... </p>

              <p>hi, are we allowed to miss matches and still not be knocked out? due to work commitments and stuff.. i mean its the participation that matters rite?</p>
              <p>and i agree, in order not to encourage a boxing match, kicks should be awarded more than punches, similar to most stand-up fighting rules. otherwise, it'd be labu and labi (classic p. ramlee movie). hehe...</p>

              <p>We will definitely look into the matter for those contender that are unable to make it for certain matches but in order to minimize this we will not schedule the rounds very close to each other, meaning it will not be like 1 weekend after the other... we will get all contenders that can proceed to the next round to agree to commit before deciding to hold the competition for that particular round...</p>
              <p>Next, I want you all to consider another point.</p>
              <p>The referee told me to consider the point system that gives just 1 point to hits that come from several hits but from the same punches that is the contender uses 1 hand repeatedly to hit the legal areas. Their argument is so that the contenders are encouraged to produce a variety of punches to the match...  I am on the fences with this one. </p>
