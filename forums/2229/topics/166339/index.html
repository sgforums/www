            <div class='col-md body'><br>What Is... Pencak Silat?<br><br>To understand what Pencak Silat is, one must have an understanding<br>of the history and geography of Indonesia and Malaysia.<br><br>A string of large and small islands, it's history and cultural development<br>is as diverse as the surface area of the thousands of islands that make<br>up the archipelago.<br><br>The cultural and administrative center is Java, which has an ancient history<br>of both conquest and invasion, and that enriched the world with a royal<br>culture of great depth and refinement. Most of the best known Pencak Silat<br>styles are from this island. Java's urban centers have given rise to very<br>practical, streetwise forms like Mustika Kwitang and Tjinkrik, as well<br>as the highly practical Pukulan forms. Middle Java created the deceptive<br>style of Setia Hati, while East Java's most famous style is the highly<br>organized Perisai Diri. This form is characterized by it's upright stances<br>and staccato execution.<br><br>The second-most important island, Sumatra, created the highly<br>characteristic Harimau form, which is sometimes called the<br>crawling tiger form, as opposed to the standing tiger Macan<br>(Matjan) style. Harimau was created by the Manangkabau<br>people. A lesser known style is Kumango which seems adapted<br>for use on a sandy surface, like a beach. Patai hails from the<br>mountainous Bukittingi region, and the combatant seems to<br>try and position himself on higher viewpoint than his opponent.<br><br>The highly cultured island of Bali, a modern tourist destination,<br>has it's own style called Bhakti Negara Pencak Silat. Deception<br>and evasion characterize this arm and hand technique based style.<br><br>Pentjak Silat is often divided up into two components - the<br>Pentjak or exercises in proper movement, which are sometimes<br>even dancelike and always graceful, and Silat, which are the<br>highly destructive and lethal applications of the Pentjak. Rather<br>than seeming without use, Pencak is needed to create the proper<br>power generation and reflexes through the creation of leverage<br>and learning to move the entire body as one.<br><br>Unlike more stylized martial arts, the practical history of Silat<br>never lets its practitioners forget that it is better to have a weapon<br>than not. Knifes, sticks, swords, Okinawan (karate) weapons and<br>more exotic implements are used, sometimes in combination with<br>poisons.<br><br>Psychological preparation is a necessity of combat as well,<br>and the preparation of the mind takes great care. Pencak<br>Silat practitioners will often prepare themselves mentally to<br>take great punishment from sticks, swords and knifes. The<br>spiritual training can go far beyond that and is intended to<br>create harmony within the practitioner as well. Kebatinan<br>is often still kept secret, although there are more and more<br>teachers who are opening up about this spiritual aspect<br>of Pencak Silat. The Indonesian equivalent of "beserk" is<br>"mataglap", which is a concept that is very important in<br>effective self-defense. The ability to call on one's primal<br>instincts and lose oneself in the moment of the attack can<br>mean the difference between life and death.<br><br>Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art, and practiced<br>extensively in Indonesia. Because Indonesia was a Dutch<br>colony for several centuries, many of the people of Dutch-<br>Indonesian descent came into contact with Pencak Silat,<br>and brought it with them when they emigrated to Holland<br>after Indonesia became independent. It was popular<br>after the war for Dutch people emigrate to countries like<br>Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA, and many<br>Dutch-Indonesians took up this opportunity, spreading<br>Pencak Silat and Pukulan to the USA. Especially Rudy<br>ter Linden and the de Thouars brothers became famous<br>in California, as did masters Willie Wetzel and Jim<br>Ingram in Washington state.<br><br>Even though Pencak Silat in Indonesia has become more<br>stylized (strong central governments aren't very keen on<br>citizens practicing deadly arts - the same can be seen with<br>Wushu in China), this art will survive and is probably more<br>alive than ever.</div>
