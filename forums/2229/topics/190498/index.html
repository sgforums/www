But I prefer tkd. The stances are shorter, thus you would be more agile/ready to respond to your opponent/assailant's movements. Karate's stances are very wide, by the time you bring your leg to the front to kick the guy, the guy wld have gotten at you already (this is what my instructor demonstrated anyway hah).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually in street combat stance shld not be too wide, definitely not wider than 1.5 shoulder breath for mobility. A successful def depend on a lot of things like what skill your oponent use, long range or close range and so on.  As long as u master a skill well and is able to make use of the skill advantages and get out of the opimum range of your attacker then u shld be relatively safe. Both Tkd and karate can be used for self def as long as u have a good instructor and u train well.</div>

What good would spins + no hand combat do for u in an actual street situation.</div></blockquote>But for Karate, I definitely don't see how useful it could be, when strength is challenging strength. The stronger ones would win. Having hand combat can be risky as you are too near to your opponent. If you are using legs, at least there's enough room to separate you and your opponents. Of course, there's a chance that your opponent would grab your leg and cause you to fall off, but with proper training, you should be able to get up in time.<br><br>In a street situation, I am in the view that no matter how trained you are, you won't win. When a person is just anyhow throwing punches to injure you, you are thinking of ways to defend against his punches, which can throw you off balance anytime if you aren't fast enough. The best is still to run away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Karate has practical attacks and counter attacks which can be easily applied in street fights. You dont even have to think of doing it. Unlike TKD karate is about practicality, not patterns. Mayi, you have officially shown that you have no knowledge on martial arts whatsoever with what you have just said. I suggest you guys join MAP (Martial arts planet) forums and learn from real experienced people there.<br><br>I take offence in what you say, you are butchering the art by the things you are saying. You obviously haven't heard of the many stories of martial artists in singapore in dangerous situation example 1 v 6 and still owned the attackers.<br><br>If you say that i expect you to have no confidence in your art what soever. and if what you say is true, self defence is useless.</div>

I mean both have their merits, but there are a lot more choices.<br><br>No matter in any style of martial arts, discipline, techniques and constant practise are needed to attain certain level of skills. Asking which is more useful is quite redundant. U should look into what is more suitable for urself.
