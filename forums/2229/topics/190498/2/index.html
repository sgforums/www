You will fight full-contact bare-knucke. I'm a TKD black belt, for self-defense TKD is useless. The objective in TKD is to score points by making loud "piak" sound on the opponent's body protector, not to do major damage so he can't continue to fight. Only kick that I'm scared of in TKD is the backthrust and turning kick to head. Most other kicks can be easily blocked or just don't do much damage at all. The axe kick or "slamming kick" is a total waste of time, I don't know why people even waste time on it.<br><br>Most TKD teachers only teach TKD to make some money. The students can't fight for nuts. Most don't even fight in competitions themselves so what experience do they have to teach people how to fight.<br><br>Also, cannot kick to the legs, so what's the point? Leg kicks are one of the best tools in a street fight, if you kick hard enough, the guy will not be able to continue already. One kick is enough if the guy is not conditioned (99.99% of people). It will not kill him and will heal in time, so no major damage done.<br><br>If possible go and learn muay thai lah. Muay thai is the best.</div>

The stances are shorter, thus you would be more agile/ready to respond to your opponent/assailant's movements. Karate's stances are very wide, by the time you bring your leg to the front to kick the guy, the guy wld have gotten at you already (this is what my instructor demonstrated anyway hah). </div></blockquote>I think there are different kinds of karate, shotokan, kyukushin etc. This is not true for kyukushin karate, it is very effective for fighting and will kick most TKD people's butt. If dun believe ask your instructor to go to a kyukushin school and try to spar with the students there.<br><br>Can go to youtube to do a search.

Let's say I know you are a TKD trained guy. I understand TKD. All I have to do is to circle around to your outside of your lead leg so that I can close with you. Once I've got you in a clinch, what're you going to do to me?<br><br>Crescent kick me in the face? You don't even have the space.<br><br>While I elbow and hook/uppercut you or headbutt you and knock you out? Street fights are not like ring fights, fighters don't attack and back off to test each other or to score points, they rush you and pummel you with no let-off. When you're angry you don't care if you're being punched or kick, you just wanna get at that sonofagun. That's the diff between ring fights and street fights, in a street fight there is anger and malice, in a tournament there is none.<br><br>TKD will be totally useless at the clinch range. You'll fight like you train.</div>

The stronger ones would win. Having hand combat can be risky as you are too near to your opponent. If you are using legs, at least there's enough room to separate you and your opponents. Of course, there's a chance that your opponent would grab your leg and cause you to fall off, but with proper training, you should be able to get up in time.<br><br>In a street situation, I am in the view that no matter how trained you are, you won't win. When a person is just anyhow throwing punches to injure you, you are thinking of ways to defend against his punches, which can throw you off balance anytime if you aren't fast enough. The best is still to run away. </div></blockquote>I think you've never been in a street fight before? There are real arts where skill will negate strength. Like BJJ. A high-ranking girl will have her way with you once she gets you to the ground. No matter how strong you are its useless, because when she gets you into certain positions there's just nothing your strength is going to do for you.<br><br>Also the theory that it's better to use legs than hands, in a street fight, the person will just rush you, the most you can only get ONE kick in, then it's all hands from then on. Like I said, it's not a ring fight, once they close with you, they don't back off and circle you like in a ring fight. They come in and pummel and pound and punch.<br><br>Get up in time, once you fall, he'll be all over you, stomping on your ankles, wrists, groin, face, etc. There is no chance for you to get up unless you are familiar with grappling skills and know how to protect yourself on the ground. A good BJJ player is even dangerous on the ground even if you're standing up if its a one-on-one fight.</div>
