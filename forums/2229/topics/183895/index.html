As far as I know, Jujitsu maybe an offensive art, but it don't teach people to break ribs or hit the eyes. Besides, all martial arts philosophy is never to get offensive. Unless he forces you to an extent that you have to hit the opponent. Otherwise, it's a no no. The best defence is to run away.</div>

Unfortunately he has a mindset of violence through martial arts already and with his instructor likes to teach people on how to kill, specificly knife slashing and stabbing attacks and all the vital killing points, it just doesn't sound right. At first i thought he was bragging, but when i see some of the techniques he has performed on me, it looks pretty deadly.</div>

In a real situation, you don't slide. If someone is trying to make you fall, you will fall sideways and hit with your hand. That hit with the hand will break the fall, plus the correct way of falling. Never to fall on your butt or spine area, because you will hurt them. Fall slightly sideways.<br><br>Wait for Take to come in. He's an Aikido student, can tell you better on breaking falls.</div>

You will have some cushion with you and your master will give you fake weapons to use.
