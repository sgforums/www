In a real situation, you don't slide. If someone is trying to make you fall, you will fall sideways and hit with your hand. That hit with the hand will break the fall, plus the correct way of falling. Never to fall on your butt or spine area, because you will hurt them. Fall slightly sideways.<br><br>Wait for Take to come in. He's an Aikido student, can tell you better on breaking falls. </div></blockquote>Keep working on your rolls, and your breakfalling skill will follow naturally. Allow yourself to be relaxed and not think about whatever is going through your head at the time. It's understandable that you think you will break your back, but that won't happen. Let that thought go and just do it. Also, focus on the basics that you're taught in your dojo such as learning how to slap out and the proper body positioning. Also, try grabbing a sempai in your class to help you out before or after class.<br><br>I also found watching ukemi videos helped, too. The ones by Donovan Waite and Bruce Bookman are both very good. Bookman's videos focuses more on the traditional breakfall and Waite's focuses on "soft breakfalls." Depending on what is taught in your dojo one might be better than the other. Ask someone in your dojo for advice as which to choose. Go into the video reviews on this site and you can find links to them. Also, a lot people her recommend the Ellis Amdur video, too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MuayThai is the best,more straightforward,no nonsense,most hard hitting &amp; brutal combat arts in the world la okay..In Taiwan, they have "San Da" which is a mix martial arts as well..<br><br>I have studied most of this stuff for years; and I can tell you a few things from my experience:<br><br>First, there are two dominant styles currently (and their variants)<br><br>BJJ, Muay Thai.<br><br>Brazilian Ju-Jitsu is superior on the ground, it incorporates a lot of locks, traps, and guards. Great for 1vs1 fighting.<br><br>Muay Thai has devistating kicks and punches... But what is more lethal are the elbows and knees. As elbows and knees generate 3x the power of a kick or punch. One of the most effective assaults is the Muay Thai kick, different from all other kicks in all other martial arts in the world. the Muay Thai kick uses the very hard shin bone as sort of a club, it doesn't snap the kick, but rather uses a full hip rotation (a lot of power) and then uses the shin as the baseball bat. Aimed at either the ribs, back of the thighs, or neck, it's devistating.. If need be, aimed at the knees and bye bye knees. The only effective way to block that is with your own shins, or get out of the way. A hit to the back of the thighs will render your leg numb, as there are major nerves in the back of the thighs.They are alots of dirty dangerous tricks to be used in Muaythai..What u have seen in the thai rings are just the 'clean version'..If u face a thai boxer in the street..He would have killed u or break ur bones in seconds..<br><br>BJJ can be countered by Muay Thai just like Boxing can. Although boxing has a much fuller array of punches, it loses to Muay Thai because, while a boxer is trained to bob and weave and duck, that opens him up for a knee to the face, which is good night if you get hit by one. Muay Thai has a very effective clench, which allows it to control the head and entire upper body, and that is why it's effective against a BJJ fighter; if you grab me and don't take me down within the first second, you will get a bombardment of elbows and knees..<br><br>But if you can take a Muay Thai onto the ground, and you are BJJ, you will have the upper hand. One of the good backgrounds against BJJ's on the ground is grecko roman wrestling, as most GRW's are very "slippery" and can get out of quite a few holds while at the same time having good skills at holding an opponent on the ground.<br><br>A Muay Thai + BJJ is all but unbeatable...<br><br>Muay Thai kicks, elbows, and knees, plus good ground work a la BJJ, is awesome and if you want any of the Pride fights or NHB stuff like Ultimate Fighting or any MMA, then you will see that what I am saying is true..<br><br>San Da tries to counter Muay Thai by adding the throw into the mix, that way, when a Muay Thai is about to clunch, they get thrown instead. While I like SanDa, I have to say, the kicks are nothing like the Muay Thai kicks, and so while great for "sport" it's not as effective as far as self-defense.<br><br>One thing I like about BJJ, you can make the guy submit, without damaging him; in Muay Thai, most end up seriously bloody...<br><br>There are a few parts that need consideration:<br><br>First, both are standing, how do I deliver as much punishment as possible (to end it ASAP)<br><br>Second, how do I prevent him from taking me to the ground?<br><br>Third, how do I take him to the ground and make him submit or subdue him?</div>
