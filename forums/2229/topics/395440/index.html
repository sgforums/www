              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">FUNDAMENTALS AND ROLE OF VARMAM IN FORENSIC MEDICINE</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">INTRODUCTION :<br><span style="color: #000000;">A resurgence of Varmam takes place nowadays. Varmam has crossed the frontiers of our country and spreads its wings world wide. More foreigners are very fond of learning and practicing it. Hailing as a unique branch of siddha medicine it is the only science used to heal and harm. Therapeutic varmalogy had already attained a mark in treating nerve injuries, neurological disorders, degenerative diseases etc. In martial field Defence Varmaolgy has sparked a ray of light. Professionals of karate, Judo, Wrestling, all are concentrating in varmam as it is very lethal and supreme than all. Kallari - the South Indian martial art teaches defence varmalogy at the stage of perfection owing deep respect to the art.</span></span></p>
              <p>Fights and wars, accidents and trauma are the order of the day. Criminals and terrorists pose skillfullness in attacking peasants; few apply varmam to hurt the public creating harm to life. Punishment and penalty for all criminal activities have been established under law leaving varmam and its impact. In Olden days varmam gained special fame in history &amp; criminal courts, and then gradually lost its glory. Now its the right time to think about the, scope of it in Forensic Medicine.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">PRANA :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Prana being the basic energy of life acts as functional unit of varmam. Amutha Kalasam the generating source of Prana emanates pranic energy all over the body through proper channels. Energised pranic currents are named as Vasi, its flow determines the quality of varmam based on the sites of placement. Varmam in short explains the spot where pranic energy dwells with different concentrations . Two main divisions of varmam namely padu varmam and thodu varmam signifies the name by the difference in concentration of pranic energy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">FORMATION OF VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">To explain in detail about the formation of padu varmam first pranakalai and Jeeva kalai are considered. Pranakalai is the kalai which feeds the prana with four subtle angulas of Vaasi and its action is exposed in eye. whereas Jeeva kalai is the kalai which supplies Jeeva with eight subtle angulas of Vasi promoting Heart to beat in rhythmic intervals, the movement of which is felt through nadi. Union of 4 pranakalai and 8 Jeeva kalai determines the formation of padu varmam where the prana strikes or impinges (paduthal) with high pranic energy concentration at 12 centres and hence the name padu varmam. Twelve kalai nadi's (nerves) conjugate with 12 uyir karuvies and nourishes the 12 padu varmam with 12 kalai's. Twelve kalais moving through 12 kalai nadi's fuses with twelve padu varmam and thereby branches into 8 divisions in each padu varmam forming 8 thodu varmam, thus each padu varmam gets knitted with 8 thodu varmam. Thodu varmam are centres where prana touches ( thoduthal) with low pranic energy concentration conjugated with 96 thathuvas. Each padu varmam are webbed to eight thodu varmam through which pranic energy has been transmitted.</span></span></p>
              <p>Three humours Vatha , Pitha and Kapha webs with 12 kalais, 96 thathuvas and Pancha patchi forming 64 vatha varmam, 26 pitha varmam and 6 kapha varmam. Varmam acts as kaalam when time and pancha patchi come to syncronize each other initiating amuthanilai to collapse. That time the activeness of varmam stays in high efficiency, its impact will be more serious &amp; dangereous. AmuthaNilai plays a vital role in feeding prana with the divine food "Amutham" thus energising it and eliminating the toxin called Visham. Its motion be happened in cyclic process lay ascending from every new moon to fullmoon &amp; decending from fullmoon to newmoon. Any derangement to this cycle will create dangerous situations. The later effect of varmam or hindrance to amuthanilai or changes in vishanilai with respect to pancha bootha and time named as Kayam. Ten forms of kayam are expressed, while moving in body through saptha dadhu, kalai and saram relying on which the effect varies. Merging of kayam and visham occurs in certain injuries, the effect of which will be dangerous or death.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">FORENSIC APPROACH TO VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Forensic Medicine has laid down strong foundation in analysing all criminal action-anatomical, physiological, pathological, toxic etc., giving more importance for external anatomy, physiology not considering the subtle anatomy, physiology or philosophy. Varmam is the only science to picture this subtle anatomy in detail. Any hindrance or trauma to this subtle anatomy can't be identified or investigated by modern science as it never put this science into account or no instrument is so far deviced to analyse this subtle anatomy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">PADU VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Padu varmam gains much importance in forensic medicine as it effects are lethal, directly controlled and connected to prana. Any impact to padu varmam blocks the flow of prana leading to dangerous conditions. The prognostic complications are neurological dysfunction, sterlity, impotence, loss of speech, loss of vision, numbness, headache or death which are the results of varmam when full mathirai( depth &amp; width ) be falls.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">SPECIAL VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">In pregnant ladies 6 varmam shows special functions, their activation offers more pranic energy to the offsprings. Injury to this varmam can bring worse effects to the baby leading to cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, sterlity, mental retardation, deformity or death or even create death to mothers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">SURGERY AND VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Surgery is supposed to do anywhere but its impact in varmam has not realized and recognized . Surgery if executed at the time when varmam is active, the effects of it are lethal or critical creating more complications. If surgery deaths be occured due to varmam what punishment would it be given to surgeons? or What would be its influence in forensic medicine?</span></span></p>
              <p>Death which happen due to surgery are of various reason, one among them was not recognizing the varmam lying on the spot of surgery or ignorancy of the subtle anatomy. Before undergoing surgery one has to think about the activeness of varmam concerned with the spot where one execute surgery, its association with complication and prognosis, its nature whether lethal or mild all should be noted. Surgeons are cautioned about lethal varmam, subtle anatomy, flow of amirthanilai. pancha patchi and its relation to death or deformity and its approach to Forensic medicine. Knowingly or unknowingly if a doctor creates harm to varmam while treating or manipulating it must be brought under law.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">FAME OF VARMAM IN OLDEN DAYS :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Even about 30 years back in kanyakumari District judges asked Varma asans to appear in court and enquired about the varmam, spot of injury, its future effects before convicting the culprits. Their evidence are considered as evidence of Forensic experts. Now by the advent of modern instruments and development in forensic medicine they are neglected and ignored. In Travancore empire varma asans are considered as granded doctors and special power was given to appear in court before offering final judgments for analysing the criminal activities and fights, since they know well about subtle anatomy. More over they are asked to explain the mode of fight and its effect to create injury.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">SUICIDAL VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Certain varmam are planned for suicide also. Suicide is easily possible for those who learned the secret of kaalam, amuthanilai and in that case it is very difficult to find that the cause of sucide. Kaalam by name itself signifies death or time which when applied skillfully should bring an end to life. In such a case what would be the court's opinion in case of judgement for suicide? What significance would be given for suicidal varmam in forensic medicine.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">MARTIAL VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Criminals and Terrorists who are well versed in varmam can apply and create great harm to public. Defence Varmalogy teaches its martial aspects how to hit and lock an enemy or how to kill him. More awareness shoot up among young generations to learn this art, and now it is easy to avail through media and kallary professionals. Varma attacks during fights and its complications must be stated in law. Varmam above ½ or ¾ mathirai if exerted meticulously will create dangerous effects, not analysed or traced by modern investigation and remains a quest to forensic medicine. Great care must be given otherwise in future its results will be alarming to the safety of our country.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">ASTROLOGY AND VARMAM :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Astrology and Varmam got deeper and inseperable connection in determining the exact cause of injury, complication and death. 27 stars connect 27 respective varmas and 12 rasi relates to 12 varmam each. Their influence with varmam produces great impact in human life. 27 varmam concerned with 27 stars are sensitive and crucial. Death of victims of varmam must pay special care to find the varmam by analysing the star of victims and it must be stated in forensic medicine.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CONCLUSION :<br><span style="color: #000000;">Any trauma or injury resulting to death if brought for legal purpose the spot of injury, its relation to varmam must be considered to establish the cause of death or injuries. When death of symptomless origin and markless findings happen, special emphasis must be provided to analyse the varmam and varmam experts are asked to picture the death.</span></span></p>
              <p>In forensic medicine punishment for infanticide, murder, sexual harrasment all has been stated but nothing for varmam is noted. Lethal varmam which are vulnerable should be clearly pointed out in forensic medicine in order to sort out the trauma and varmam, prognosis must also be carved under the pages of law based on effects of injury.</p>
              <p>Anatomy, physiology, pathology etc are added in forensic medicine and focused as forensic anatomy, forensic physiology, forensic pathology respectively. Similarly varmam in forensic medicine must be treated as Forensic Varmalogy and more research should be carried on. If more significance is given to varmam, more unanswerable questions in forensic medicine will easily be solved and unfolded.</p>
