            <div class='col-md body'>Common Martial Arts Injuries and How to Prevent Them<br><br>Just as with any sport or fitness endeavor, there is a risk of injury in martial arts training. However, contrary to some people's beliefs, this risk is no higher than in sports such as football, rugby, soccer, wrestling and other sports. Remember, warming up properly is the first line of defense in preventing most common injuries. Taking some simple precautions can help reduce the risk of injury and keep you training towards your goals.<br><br>Common Injuries<br>Some of the more common injuries in the martial arts are:<br><br>* Cuts and Bruises<br><br>While cuts and bruises are an unavoidable injury in any type of contact sport, you can try to avoid them by wearing the proper safety equipment when sparring. Also remember to watch the level of contact that you use, and always remain focused on what you are doing.<br>Sponsored Links<br><br>Speed &amp; Agility TrainerInstructor Certification Program Homestudy &amp; Comprehensivehttp://www.nestacertified.com/<br><br>The Shocking Truth AboutRealistic Self Defense - What the Masters Won't Tell You!www.Street-Self-Defense.com<br><br>Fear No ManDiscover What The Martial Artists &amp; The Army Don't Want You To Knowwww.TopSecretTraining.com<br>Many cuts and bruises are caused by someone going too hard or by someone not paying close attention to what they are doing, and that "slip up" causes an injury that otherwise would not have occurred.<br><br>* Sprains<br><br>Sprains are also very common injuries in the martial arts. Most sprains occur in the ankles, elbows and toes. Many ankle sprains occur when running or kicking on uneven or overly soft flooring, such as old gymnastics mats, or mats that have gaps between them. Other times ankle sprains can occur because of improper weight distribution when kicking. To help avoid ankle sprains, make sure your training surface is in good condition, and make sure you are standing in a proper stance and well balanced before throwing a kick.<br><br>Most elbow sprains occur due to either hyperextension or due to a lock or other joint manipulation technique. To avoid these injuries, remember to always keep a slight bend in the joint when punching, and make sure to go at a slow enough pace for your partner to not injure you accidentally. If grappling, remember to tap out when you first feel pain, instead of trying to muscle out of a lock and risking injury.<br><br>* "Jamming" The Fingers and Toes<br><br>Most times this occurs due to throwing a kick or punch improperly and either having your opponent block your foot or hand directly on the toes and fingers, or hitting a bag or pad and jamming these yourself. If a kick calls for the ball, heel or instep of the foot, remember to fully flex the ankle in the proper direction to get the toes out of the line of fire. If punching or throwing some sort of open hand technique that requires the palm or knuckles, remember to either keep a tight fist with the fingers placed properly, or to completely open the palm and keep the fingers pressed tightly together. Executing a technique with proper form is absolutely essential to not only prevent injuries but also to perform the technique effectively.<br><br>* Head Injuries<br><br>A serious injury that can occur in training or competition is a concussion. The first line of defense against a concussion is to wear a high quality and properly fitting helmet and mouthguard. A helmet alone is not enough because the jaw must be aligned properly and protected as well. Only advanced practitioners should ever spar or compete without a helmet, and only in upper level competitions or events. Even professionals train with helmets on. Throw out your ego and be smart. Train safely to avoid seriously injuring yourself.<br><br>By warming up properly, training carefully and wearing the proper equipment, you can help avoid many of the common injuries that get in the way of your training. Train smart, and train effectively.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How To Warm Up To Prevent Injuries<br><br>Warming up is essential for preventing injuries and getting the most out of your martial arts training. This how-to will guide you through a safe and effective warm up that can be used in conjunction with any other training regimen.<br><br>Difficulty: Average<br><br>Time Required: 15 minutes<br>Here's How:<br><br>1.   Neck Rotations<br><br>Slowly rotate the neck from shoulder to shoulder in a circular motion. Repeat 10 times in each direction.<br><br>2.   Shoulder Rotations<br><br>Slowly rotate or "shrug" your shoulders 10 times forward and 10 times backward.<br><br>3.   Arm Circles<br><br>Extend the arms out to the side at shoulder level. Circle the arms forward and backwards 10 times using small circles. Then repeat using larger circles. Be sure not to drop the arms below chest level while circling.<br><br>4.   Wrist Rotations<br><br>Rotate the wrists 10 times inward and 10 times outwards.<br><br>5.   Waist Rotations<br><br>Bend deeply at the waist and rotate in a full circle. Be sure to rotate the waist as opposed to the hips. You should feel a stretch in the waist and lower back.<br><br>6.   Knee Rotations<br><br>Place your hand on your thighs above your knees, not on the knees themselves. Rotate slowly and deeply 10 times each direction.<br><br>7.   Ankle Rotations<br><br>Hold on to a wall or chair, lift your leg about 6 inches off the floor and rotate each ankle 10 times inward and 10 times outward.<br><br>8.   Seated Stretch<br><br>Sit with your legs spread as wide apart as you feel comfortable. Lean out towards each leg, and the center. Remember to keep the back straight. A good way to remember this is to try to touch your chin to your knee or shin instead of your forehead to your thigh. Go down slowly and exhale, holding for at least 10 seconds each side. Remember not to bounce or move too quickly. Use smooth, slow movements.<br>Tips:<br><br>1. Remember to always move slowly and smoothly. Using quick, jerky movements increases your chances of injury and doesn't stretch you as effectively.<br>2. Always try to relax. Tensing up while stretching eliminates the effectiveness of the stretch.<br>3. Increase the number of repetitions as you progress.<br><br>What You Need:<br><br>* Comfortable clothing<br>* A wall or chair</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Safety Tips For Martial Arts Training<br><br>From the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons<br>News Release, 2004<br><br>Due to the ever increasing popularity of martial arts, and the official adoption of taekwondo as an Olympic sport in 2000, countless numbers of kids and adults alike have taken up the ancient art of defense either as a competitive sport, self defense technique, or simply for exercise and to decrease stress. While there are many different styles, such as taekwondo, hapkido, and karate, there is still potential for injury. In 2003, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported more than 70,000 injuries related to martial arts were treated in hospitals, doctorsÂ’ offices, clinics, ambulatory surgery centers and emergency rooms.<br><br>Though some styles of martial arts may be considered as much of a contact sport as football, for example, the training is very different.<br><br>Unlike other sports where weightlifting to build muscle mass and strength is very important, success in martial arts is built on strategy, technique, mental discipline, endurance and flexibility. Â“Training with your own body weight used as resistance or working with light weights are preferred methods of preparation,Â” says Sherwin Ho, MD, orthopaedic surgeon and associate professor of surgery, Section of Orthopaedics at the University of Chicago. Â“Exercises that serve to develop strength, balance and flexibility are integral to martial arts training and help prevent injury,Â” Dr. Ho added.<br><br>Sprains, strains and contusions or bruising are some of the more common injuries associated with practicing martial arts. Strains can occur in both muscles and tendons and are caused by a sudden and extreme force that is greater than that areaÂ’s ability to handle. Bruising is another common injury seen in martial arts, occurring both in soft tissue areas, and also to bones.<br><br>When someone is struck on a bony surface, there may not be any discoloration, or swelling, but the impact may cause small fractures in the outer layers of the bone, which may take weeks to heal completely.<br><br>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers these tips for martial arts participants to train and compete safely:<br><br>* Consult with a physician before beginning your conditioning to establish your readiness<br>* Train under the direction of a martial arts instructor who focuses on form and technique, rather than competitive strategy<br>* Wear the appropriate protective gear for your type of activity; for example, taekwondo, as a full contact sport, requires a head guard, a body protector, forearm and shin guards, and a groin guard<br>* Exercise to strengthen the stabilizer muscles: rotator cuff muscles and hip adductors (inner thigh muscles or groins) and abductors (muscles on the outermost part of the hip), which help to support the back and hipsÂ—critical to this activity<br>* Maintain proper breathing techniques when practicing martial arts to avoid injuryÂ—breathing out during the contraction portion of any stretching movement, and breathing in during the extension portion of any stretching movement</div>

This is because Chinese martial arts stress on stances, and a prolonged training without rest can cause a strain on your knees.<br><br>To prevent this, warm up your knees.

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway as a standard, for all injuries remember the RICE principle<br><br>Rest<br>Ice<br>Compression<br>Elevation<br><br>This treatment reduces the inflammation that comes with acute injury. Inflammation often causes redness, heat, swelling, and pain. The earlier you start the RICE treatment after an injury, the better it works.<br><br>REST the injured area. Your body is telling you to stop if moving the injured area causes pain.<br><br>ICE in a cold pack applied to the injured area will help to reduce swelling. Swelling causes more pain and slows healing. Cover the ice pack with a wet cloth and apply the ice for 10 to 30 minutes intermittently for 48 to 72 hours. A package of frozen vegetables makes a good ice pack. It is lightweight, conforms to the injured area, and is inexpensive and reusable.<br><br>COMPRESSION, or use of a pressure bandage, also helps to prevent or reduce swelling. Use an elastic, or ACE, bandage. Wrap the injured area with the bandage, but not so tightly to cut off the blood flow. It should not be painful. Fingers or toes beyond the bandage should remain pink and not become "tingly".<br><br>ELEVATION means raising the injured area above the level of the heart. Prop up a leg or arm while resting it. You may need to lie down to get your leg above your heart level. Elevation may also reduce the "throbbing" pain that may be present.<br><br>Do all four parts of the RICE treatment together. If this does not work after one or two days, consult your health care provider. Do not use the RICE treatment without consulting your healthcare provider if you suspect a more serious injury, such as internal bleeding or a broken bone.</div>
