            <div class='col-md body'>for a guy with no martial arts training he held his own against the BJJ guy.... I am not a fan of BJJ - two fights that I have had with BJJ guys were quite sad... one was less than 60sec knock out - the other guy did get me to the ground but i ended up knocking him out on the ground while also breaking a number of his ribs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The bjj guy got him in an armbar and would have popped his elbow had the referee not stepped in. Watch it slow-mo at around 04:10 of the video. If getting your elbow joints popped are not considered taken out, then what is?<br><br>The theory of bjj is to manipulate basically the laws of leverages and body positioning to overcome heavier, stronger opponents. True, pedro sauer is a bjj black belt, but the bodybuilder was much heavier and stronger. Thus its considered a break-even.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Technique &gt; Strength.<br><br>The problem with BJJ nowadays is that people have started to mystify the art after itÂ’s initial success in the MMA, thinking that just knowing BJJ is a substitute towards being creative about the way you fight.<br><br>Which is kinda sad, because the people who developed BJJ, the Gracies and the like, were originally innovators and ready to learn and incorporate anything to improve their style, but perhaps in recent times have started to believe their own hype, as they have started to suffer defeats.<br><br>I donÂ’t think BJJ in ineffective, with a skilled and creative practitioner it is extremely effective. The problem is some people get locked into the style, think that it is the answer to all your solutions, they are actually disadvantaging themselves. They are in a sense becoming just like the strikers who had no clue on what to do once the fight came to the ground and grappling.<br><br>Once a style becomes very famous, you can be sure that people will find ways of getting around it. Once grappling proved their worth in MMA, the strikers eventually learnt on how to avoid takedowns or even incorporate ground fighting into their style and won upsets. Spraw-and-Brawl and Ground-and-Pound are but birthed from such cross-fertilization of styles.<br><br>As for the bodybuilder losing to the BJJ guy, it is still worthy to note that itÂ’s a good show of technique and creativity in a fight over brute force. If you know proper ground fighting the BJJ guy did most of his things right. He managed to keep his opponent off balanced during the stand-up phase of the fight and when it went to the ground fight he held his opponent in a cuff that prevented the big guy from landing proper punches before springing the arm bar when the guy presented his arm. All in all a good show of how having the skills matter more then buffing up to be as strong and threatening as possible.<br><br>Personally prefer striking and stand-up fighting, but I make it a point to know some ground fighting. As would any ground fighter needs to learn proper striking, as the Royce Gracie loss to Matt Hughes showed. While Gracie was the superior ground fighter Hughes was able to frustrate his attempts long enough before finally getting a mount and landing 17 uncontested punches on GracieÂ’s head.<br><br>So there, no style is perfect and itÂ’s really up to the fighter.<br></div>
