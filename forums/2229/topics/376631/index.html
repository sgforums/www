              <p>Utter nonsense. Traditional wushu is ridiculously effective. However, it is seldom seen today. Most of the "Shaolin monks" who go around aren't even monks, much less from Shaolin.</p>
              <p>Modern wushu, however, is pretty much useless. Hua1 quan2 xiu4 tui3.</p>

              <p>Frankly, what you said contradict leh. I don't think you've a clear understanding of what's "traditional" and what's "modern". In the 2nd paragraph, you made it sound like people practised modern wushu in ancient times. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The modern style (what you always see in sports, sea games &amp; etc) of wushu focus is on exhibition. There are still practitioners who practise wushu as a martial art, and these are the traditionalists who focus on application.</p>
              <p>And those 'simulated sparring' one would always see in modern wushu are forms to display technique and all. Already said modern style focus is on exhibition liao right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The vastness of chinese martial arts extends beyond its kicks and punches leh, brudder..</p>
              <p>"That's the reason why Bruce Lee invented JKD"... Haiz.. see substance like this.. also no mood carry on discussion with you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
