A martial artist doesn't aim to kill, they only aim to get ample time to run away if they start attacking.<br><br>Firstly, when you whack, you don't kill. You only hurt them such that it's so painful and they won't be able to chase you. You take this chance to run away.<br><br>Secondly, you whack to throw them off balance. Balance in martial arts is very important. Once you lose your balance, that's it. They throw you to the ground, force you to a wall, you can't fight back. You can't kick or punch, because everything will be well-defended. The only thing you can do is to step on their legs in this case if you are forced to wall. If you are thrown to the ground, you have to make sure you get up fast enough and run away before they catch you.<br><br>Thirdly, it's wrong to use self-defense just for whacking. It's as good as showing off. The best defense in every situation is to never provoke, or if the attacker decides to attack you, run away instead. If he catches up, it's only then you attack to get him off.<br><br>Lastly, there's more than just hitting, punching and kicking in self-defense. You have to learn how to fall properly in case you are off balanced by the attacker. You also have to learn to be alert, street smart and use your common sense.<br><br>Alert <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> meaning not SMSing or talking on the phone when going to any place. Talking or SMSing makes you less aware of your surrounding, and more prone to attacks.<br><br>Street smart <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> some areas are known to be very popular where fights can break out. Avoid these areas. It also means that you have to know your way around a lot of places. If you are not sure, just don't go there or ask a few friends to accompany you.<br><br>Common sense <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> don't take short cuts early in the morning when it's still dark (if you have to go to work between 6am to 7am when the sun has barely risen) or at night. Don't carry a lot of cash with you and cover yourself adequately. If you are going home late, ask your friends to accompany you, or take a taxi home. If possible, ask someone to wait at the bus stop or the lift for you.</div>

If there's a group of people, you sure wouldn't want an offense because no matter how skilled you are, you can't beat a group.<br><br>If the person is alone, you still have some chance of winning if you are on the offensive side, provided that the person doesn't call police.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The basic function of a martial art have always been to hurt, to stop and to kill. Of course a modern martial artist won't wanna kill anyone, don't wanna get into trouble with the law yeah?<br><br>So I guess the current function is to hurt and to stop.<br><br>When you are forced to the wall or on the ground, you should still be able to fight back. When on the wall or ground, you should be able to keep your attackers at bay and try to reposition yourself so that you can fight back.<br><br>About just whacking... Who the hell goes around finding someone to whack? Something must be wrong somewhere. If you think you have an advantage because you learnt martial art, let me introduce you to my metal pole... Someone else may introduce me to a gun.<br><br>And yeah... there's more to martial art then kicking and punching. We also have kneeing and elbowing =P<br><br>I however feels that martial art can be used in another way. Say you see a group of bullies beating up a guy on an MRT. And you know you can stop them. I am not gonna just stand there and watch.</div>

I definitely agree while your at it, you might as well learn something that is useful.<br>i would recommend this place, Contact Kinetics ( http://www.contactkinetics.com ). they have classes for mixed martial arts (MMA), Okinawan Goju Ryu Karate and Balintawak Arnis stick fighting. Great bunch of people to train with. mature, very responsible, good sense of humour. quality instruction. good hard physical workout. come down for a free class and see if you like it. Cheers</div>
