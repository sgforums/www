            <div class='col-md body'><p>Most of us know about KTM Intercity running through our country. I shall share a bit on the Singapore Sector of the system.<br><br>Basically, there are 11 daily passenger trains running to and from Malaysia each day. They are:<br><strong><br>Departure from Singapore:</strong><br>26up Lambaian Timur | Singapore &gt; Gua Musang | 0445hrs<br>2up Ekspres Rakyat | Singapore &gt; Butterworth | 0740hrs<br>6up Ekspres Sinaran Petang | Singapore &gt; KL Sentral | 1330hrs<br>14up Ekspres Rakyat | Singapore &gt; Tumpat | 1800hrs<br>12up Ekspres Senandung Malam | Singapore &gt; KL Sentral | 2215hrs<br><br><strong>Arrival to Singapore:</strong><br>61dn Shuttle Tebrau | Johor Bahru &gt; Singapore | 0645hrs<br>11dn Ekspres Senandung Malam | KL Sentral &gt; Singapore | 0820hrs<br>15dn Ekspres Timuran | Tumpat &gt; Singapore | 1126hrs<br>5dn Ekspres Sinaran Pagi | KL Sentral &gt; Singapore | 1605hrs<br>27dn Lambaian Timur | Gua Musang &gt; Singapore | 2045hrs<br>1dn Ekspres Rakyat | Butterworth &gt; Singapore | 0820hrs<br><br>Freight trains operate along the line as well, but arrival and departure times may change daily.<br><br>Butterworth Station is located opposite Penang Island, accessible by ferry. It's layout is similar to Tanjung Pagar Railway Station in Singapore.<br>Tumpat is located along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, near the border of Thailand.<br>Gua Musang is located along the East Coast branch line which runs from Gemas, Negeri Sembilan to Tumpat, Kelantan.<br>KL Sentral is a major hub in Kuala Lumpur. It interchanges with the intercity lines, KTM Komuter lines, Kelana Jaya LRT Line, KL Star Rail (KL Monorail), KLIA Transit, KLIA Ekspres, public buses and intercity coaches.<br><br>The present single track line is 38.6 km long, running on meter gauge (1000mm).

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The history of the Singapore Railway dates back to the early 1900s.<br><br>The Singapore - Kranji Railway, also known as the Singapore Government Railway and the Singapore - Johore Railway at various times, was constructed between 1900 and 1902 under the supervision of C.E.Spooner, the General Manager of the Federated Malay States Railway and was opened from the Singapore terminus in Fort Canning Park to Woodlands in two sections, Singapore to Bukit Timah on the 1st January 1903 and Bukit Timah to Woodlands on 10th April 1903. Total length at this time was 16 miles 79 chains. At Kranji there was a ferry connection to the Malayan mainland. From Singapore the line ran north-westwards and crossed Orchard Road by a bridge near Emerald Hill west of the Singapore Cold Storage by Cuppage Road. It continued north-westwards until reaching Newton station, near where Newton circus now is, and then ran along the north side of Bukit Timah Road, through Cluny station, just west of Adam Road, Holland Road station, and on to Bukit Timah station, which was across the road from Pei Wah Avenue, where the Halfway House stood in the 1960s. At Bukit Timah village the line turned north and ran via Bukit Panjang station, Mandai station and Kranji to Woodlands station, which was adjacent to the jetty east of the present causeway, the section from Bukit Panjang still being in use today as far as Woodlands new station. In 1906-7 the line was extended southwards from a new station at Tank Road via Pulau Saigon bridge, Peoples Park (Chinatown) and Tanjong Pagar, and on to Pasir Panjang (at Chermin Bay) near Alexandra Brickworks. This extension was opened on 21st January 1907. At this time there were stations at Pasir Panjang, Borneo Wharf, Tank Road, Newton, Cluny Road, Holland Road (for the rifle range), Bukit Timah, Bukit Panjang and Woodlands. Total length of the line is stated as 19¾ miles, in which length are 55 gate-crossings, including 23 public level-crossings, where gatemen have to be maintained.<br><strong><br>Singapore and Kranji Railway station opening dates</strong><br><br>Singapore 01 Jan 1903 (Thu) This was the first station, by Fort Canning Hill opposite the Ord Road/River Valley Road junction, converted to goods in 1907<br>Newton 01 Jan 1903 (Thu)<br>Cluny Road 01 Jan 1903 (Thu)<br>Bukit Timah 01 Jan 1903 (Thu)<br><br>Bukit Panjang 10 Apr 1903 (Fri)<br>Woodlands 10 Apr 1903 (Fri)<br><br>Holland Road 16 Jul 1903 (Thu)<br><br>Tank Road 21 Jan 1907 (Mon)<br>Borneo Wharf 21 Jan 1907 (Mon)<br>Pasir Panjang 21 Jan 1907 (Mon)<br><br>People's Park 01 Apr 1908 (Wed)<br><br>More info can be found at <a href="http://members.multimania.co.uk/railsing/Singapore/SRhistory.htm">http://members.multimania.co.uk/railsing/Singapore/SRhistory.htm</a>.</p></div>

              <p>Wa, actually daily got 5 trips from Singapore to Malaysia, each waiting time is approximate 4hours to 6 hours? Maybe I can plan a trip on train in future. (But nowadays KTM in Singapore is quite unheard of, in the sense of partnership with the tourism agency lah etc..... Dunno why? -- Could it be politics again?)</p>
              <p>[PS: I got someone asked me if the Tanjong Pagar Railway station is still in used or not when a bus went pass there] (And the station appeared to be motionless.)</p>

              <p>Tour agencies don't really like to use KTM because they buy tickets at the same rate. Which means when they charge their service fee for example... $2. Let's say the ticket costs $34. When you buy from an agent, you pay $34 + $2 = $36. Cheaper to buy from the station itself, so they gave up.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't exclude politics, but no discussion on politics will be done in this forum.</p>
              <p>What time did your friend pass by? Between around 1pm to 5pm there's no trains.</p>
