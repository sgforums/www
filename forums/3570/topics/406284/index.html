              <h2><span id="Investigation" class="mw-headline">Investigation</span></h2>
              <p>Railway officials initially described how there may have been 
              something wrong with the drivers of the Uttar Banga Express, detailing 
              how the train had passed through a red signal at high speed, with no 
              evidence of a brake application and with no apparent attempt by the 
              driver or co-driver to jump clear of the train cab before the collision.
               Both were found dead in the wreckage, still in their seats. The possibility of the two drivers of Uttar Banga Express being drugged
               had triggered alarm in the railways. However, the <span class="mw-redirect">post mortem</span> of the drivers 
              at the Suri hospital did not show any evidence of drugs.
               As a precaution, drivers and guards have been asked not to buy any food
               or drink at stations.<sup id="cite_ref-Telegraph22_6-1" class="reference"><span></span></sup></p>
              <p>Sainthia railway station was a scheduled stop for the express, but 
              the train is believed to have passed over a bridge <span style="white-space: nowrap;">1.2 km</span> before the accident at three 
              times the line speed. The crew had taken charge of the train at Malda five hours before the 
              accident, and had appeared fit and well to station staff during a 
              previous unscheduled stop at Gadadharpur, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">7 km</span> ahead of the accident site.<sup id="cite_ref-HTT2_9-0" class="reference"><span></span></sup> The signalman in-charge at the station claimed to have heard the 
              station master trying to alert the driver of the Uttar Banga Express via
               walkie-talkie, but got no response.<sup id="cite_ref-NDTV2_10-0" class="reference"><span></span></sup></p>
              <p>The enquiry has found no fault with the train's brakes
               although, the guard, when questioned said that he had applied the 
              emergency brake after the driver did not respond to him on the 
              walkie-talkie, but the brake failed.<sup id="cite_ref-HTT3_11-0" class="reference"></sup> Also there was no signal failure, the approach signal was red.<sup id="cite_ref-Telegraph_8-2" class="reference"></sup> Probable causal factors found are the drugging of the drivers and not 
              setting a diversion route when the Vananchal Express was standing at the
               platform. <sup id="cite_ref-Telegraph22_6-2" class="reference"></sup>It was too late to operate points and divert the train when the Uttar 
              Banga Express was seen.<sup id="cite_ref-HTT2_9-1" class="reference"><span></span></sup></p>
              <p>The driver of the Vananchal Express, said that “even though the green
               signal was given at 1.54am, we could start the train only at 2.01am 
              because we had not received any signal from the guard”.</p>

              <h1 class="story-header">Dozens die in West Bengal train crash</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="introduction">A 
              train crash in eastern India has killed at least 60 people and injured 
              another 120, officials say.</p>
              <p>A speeding passenger express hit another train waiting at a 
              station in the town of Sainthia, West Bengal state, early on Monday.</p>
              <p>The impact sent the roof of a coach into a footbridge above 
              the tracks.</p>
              <p>Residents climbed through the mangled trains looking for 
              survivors. It was the second major railway accident in West Bengal this 
              year.</p>
              <p>In May, nearly 150 people died when a Bombay-bound passenger train 
              derailed and was hit by a goods train. Police accused Maoist rebels of 
              sabotaging the track, but Maoists denied the charge.</p>
              <p>The cause of the latest crash is not yet clear.</p>
              <p>A number of trapped passengers were freed from the wreckage 
              by emergency workers using gas cutters and other tools.</p>
              <p>Local officials say the accident occurred at about 0200 local
               time on Monday (2030 GMT Sunday) when the Uttar Banga Express crashed 
              into the stationary Bhagalpur-Ranchi Vananchal Express at the station in
               the Birbhum district, about 200km (125 miles) north of Calcutta.</p>
              <p>One witness described to the BBC his narrow escape.</p>
              <p>"At the station my train was just about to pull out when I heard a 
              big scream, 'There's going to be a crash,'" said the man.</p>
              <p>"So I clung on to a bar by my feet. Then there was a massive 
              bang. Most of the people in my carriage died in front of me."</p>
              <p>Emergency officials said all the passengers trapped in the 
              wreckage had been rescued and all the injured taken to hospitals.</p>
              <p>Officials believe the trains were packed with commuters 
              heading to work.</p>
              <p>There is speculation that faulty signalling may have been the
               cause of the crash. A police investigation is now under way.</p>
              <p>Accidents are common on the state-owned Indian railway, an 
              immense network connecting every corner of the vast country.</p>
              <p>It operates 9,000 passenger trains and carries some 18 
              million passengers every day.</p>
