              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>228 Tokyo Metro subway trains for KL</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>PETALING JAYA:</strong> The Kuala Lumpur railway service will
                   get a much-needed boost in the form of 228 used Tokyo Metro of Japan 
                  car sets — free of charge.</p>
              <p>The gift is the culmination of efforts by Transport Minister Datuk 
                  Seri Ong Tee Keat who had just concluded discussions with Tokyo Metro to
                   secure the 38x6 used car sets, which are in good operational condition,
                   and have a lifespan of no less than 20 years.</p>
              <p>It was learnt that the cars , which still have an average of 20 good 
                  years left for local use, would be delivered by 2012.</p>
              <p>The sets had been used by Tokyo Metro in their subway lines (tubes), 
                  and some modifications may be carried out to allow the cars to be used 
                  in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Tokyo Metro operates a network of nine subway lines in the heart of 
                  Tokyo, with its network forming a tight mesh throughout the three 
                  central wards of Chiyoda, Chuo and Minato; and the surrounding Shinjuku,
                   Shibuya, Ikebukuro and Ueno areas.</p>
              <p>Upon delivery, the sets are expected to ease the pressure off the 
                  local rail system persistently bogged down by a range of issues that had
                   affected the service's reliability.</p>
              <p>In an interview with <em>The Malay Mail </em>recently, KTMB president
                   Dr Aminuddin Adnan had admitted that reliability was an issue, forcing 
                  KTMB to take several measures to improve the capacity and reliability of
                   train services.</p>
              <p>It had set itself a deadline of two years to give commuters the best 
                  service possible at its optimum capacity level in line with the National
                   Key Result Area (NKRA) target for urban public transport to improve the
                   network.</p>
              <p>Dr Aminuddin had said KTMB was working on completely overhauling its 
                  trains as well as the wiring systems and other services to improve 
                  current services.</p>
              <p>KTMB are also working on refurbishing 15 old electric multiple unit 
                  (EMU) trains, which it aims to put back into service in stages by March 
                  next year. Once completed, the number of trains available will be 
                  increased from 28 trains to 43 by next year.</p>
              <p>The EMUs have been plagued with problems caused by the closure of the
                   two companies that supplied the trains.This had made it difficult to 
                  find spare-parts for the trains.</p>
              <p>Dr Aminuddin had also said that KTMB had ordered 38 six car-trains at
                   a cost of RM2 billion, which are expected to arrive in mid-2012.</p>
              <p>With the increase in number of trains available, KTMB hopes to 
                  accomplish a passenger waiting time of between 10 and 20 minutes.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mmail.com.my/content/38264-228-tokyo-metro-subway-trains-kl">http://www.mmail.com.my/content/38264-228-tokyo-metro-subway-trains-kl</a></p>
              <p>----------</p>
              <p>Do note that the headline is a little bit misleading. It is actually 228 coaches. Divide it by 6 and you will get 38 6-car EMUs.</p>
              <p>But now, with the 38 6-car China EMUs said earlier, one would wonder if they are replacing the China orders with the free Japanese trains, or are they still purchasing the China EMUs, tripling the fleet of EMUs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The picture in the article seems to be a 15000 Series EMU, but it also states that the trains are around 20 years old. I highly suspect that KTM will be receiving the 01 Series EMUs instead. Coincidentally, there are 38 6-car sets in total. But then again, I don't know what they can use to replace these trains on the Ginza Line.</p></div>

              <p>Have to regauge the coaches. They will also have to check the platform width. The EMUs in Malaysia are 2.8m wide. Anything wider, they will have to trim the platforms. The free trains run on DC, so they'll also have to change it to AC. Free trains but so many hidden costs.</p>
