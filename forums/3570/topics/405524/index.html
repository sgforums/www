              <p>Luxury railway the Oriental Express has announced that it is to
              run a series of new rail voyages through Thailand, Malaysia, Laos
              and Singapore.</p>
              <p>The new <em>Chronicles of South-East Asia</em> tours will be
              available from November 2010, and will run alongside existing
              excursions operated by the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express.</p>
              <p>Each voyage is limited to just 60 guests, each of whom will stay
              in the opulent surroundings of a private State of Presidential
              cabin, while all journeys are complemented by exploring excursions
              and overnight off-train experiences. Guest lecturers will also be
              on hand to guide guests through the fascinating history and
              landscape of the countries they pass through.</p>
              <p>One such tour available is the <em>Legends of Peninsula</em>: a
              six-night adventure by train around south-east Asia. Starting in
              Bangkok, passengers will journey through the jungle-covered hills
              of Thailand, stopping at the white-sand beaches of the Anantara Ski
              Kao resort, before crossing into Malaysia and heading to the
              vibrant city of Kuala Lumpar. Excursions here include a morning in
              Penang and a trip to the historic River Kwai Bridge.</p>
              <p>Other trips include an epic voyage around Thailand and a
              <em>Tales of Laos</em> tour, which journeys from the north-east of
              Thailand, through Laos to the mighty Mekong river and the capital
              Vientiane.</p>

              <p>I supposedly took the E&amp;O Express once. But I was like 3 or 4 yrs old then, and can't remember a slightest bit of the journey. Mid 90's IIRC. Went with my parents and my Korean aunts. Back then, it was the earlier years of operations too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was just wondering, why doesn't the E&amp;O Express holding company buy a few diesel locos to run its own operation throughout SEAsia hauling its own carriages and operate as a private company utilising(and thus paying) KTM and SRT royalty fees for track usage? Does renting KTM and SRT locos make more sense cost-wise in the long haul? After all, most, if not all of SEAsia uses metre gauge right? The locos could be based out of Butterworth as you mention that Butterworth terminus is an end-on terminal and trains need to reverse out the other end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe customs could be carried out on the train as per other countries? It would seem more professional also. I guess it would solve a lot of manpower on the train and on ground actually if the train doesn't need to stop at the border for border checks etc.</p>

              <p>E&amp;OE has its own company. They just rent the right-of-way, locomotives and drivers (inclusive of Train Guard). The coaches do not belong to KTM/SRT. </p>
              <p>Why should they waste to get locomotives to run, when KTM has it and can be rented as and when it needs to run. After all, the E&amp;OE doesn't run every week, it runs, like once/twice a month. </p>
              <p>From Butterworth, they will then proceed on to Padang Besar. Passports are collected while passengers are on the train. This means, no passengers will be alighting at Padang Besar for customs immigration. When this goes on, KTM locomotives will exchange with the SRT locomotives. </p>

              <p>I agree.<br>But however, though it seems that the E&amp;O Express runs once or twice a month down to Singapore's Tg Pagar, they also have services up north in Thailand, doing their intra-Thailand's Bangkok-Chiang Mai shuttles in continuation with pax from the Singapore-Bangkok train. In addition, they have other services to Vientiane and another part of Eastern Thailand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their carriages seem quite utilised in that sense. Singapore-Bangkok via Butterworth seems to be only one of the many segments that E&amp;O Express operates in SEAsia. So that was why I was wondering whether it would make more financial sense on E&amp;O Express' Holding Company to have permanent locomotives that run with their carriages.</p>

              <p>Here is the link for the trips they make up north.</p>

              <p>From Butterworth, they will then proceed on to Padang Besar.
              Passports are collected while passengers are on the train. This
              means, no passengers will be alighting at Padang Besar for customs
              immigration. When this goes on, KTM locomotives will exchange with
              the SRT locomotives. </p>

              <p>Oh! That's great for the pax then.<br>At least no hassle for border checks and no red tape involved.</p>
