              <p>Kuyt will stay .... his contribution is obvious for the last few games or so . His contribution is distinction .</p>
              <p>There's not much left footer in our team , Riise is one of the few . He'll likely to stay , unless Rafa found a even more capable replacement that Aurelio and Arbeloa</p>
              <p>Garcia was sold due to his injuries , as well as his desire to go back to spain to finish off his career .</p>

              <p>Kuyt is a striker.</p>
              <p>If he decided to be a winger, in which he is not fast enough and he tend to lose possession when pressed too hard, I guess he will have to fight his place with Pennant.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben will retain him in that position for a long while as he did not have a able replacement.</p>
              <p>So, not sure whether he will return to dutch league as it is no point to remain as a winger if he want to play as a striker for his country.</p>

              <p>rafa playing kuyt as a winger is to use him to harass opponents wingers. Kuyt's ability is his hard work. He determination and work rate is remarkable. I see him at games harassing the opponents defence, closing them down fast. Remember Lpool 1st game against Aston villa? The 1st goal was becus kuyt chased down the ball which i thought was going to end up as a goal kick.</p>
              <p>Garcia might lose possession at times but the goals he scores are impt ones. Who here rmb the UCL semi final?</p>

              <h1>Rafa: Kewell facers fight for new contract</h1>
              
              <p>Rafael Benitez concedes that out-of-favour winger Harry Kewell could
                  struggle to win a new contract at the club after giving his blessing
                  for the player to join-up with Australia next week.</p>
              <p>Kewell, whose current deal runs out in the summer, has been out of favour
                  since the FA Cup defeat by Barnsley and was not even in the squad that travelled
                  to Italy this week for the Champions League victory over Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>And now Kewell has asked for, and been given permission by Benitez, to link up
                  with Australia for their two forthcoming matches in the international break.</p>
              <p>Benitez says: 'They play two games and he is not playing here, so it is good
                  that he goes with them and plays to get fit.
                  '</p>
              <p>I have given him permission because he was not playing for us at the moment.
                  So it is positive for him and his national team that he plays for them.</p>
              <p>'The contract will be more difficult for him, if he plays well for Australia
                  and comes back fit he could have a part to play at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>'But his situation could become more difficult. I will make a decision at the
                  end of the season.</p>
              <p>'
                  Kewell will be missing again tomorrow when Liverpool face Reading tomorrow, a
                  team that Benitez does not believe will be relegated from the top flight.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: 'Reading have a very good team spirit, they work hard and they
                  have beaten us in the league. That was our first defeat of the season and a very
                  disappointing day for us.</p>
              <p>'We know we must keep winning and scoring goals. But Reading are a good side
                  with a good manager and spirit, it is difficult to play against a side who work
                  as hard as they do.</p>
              <p>'It is a surprise that they have struggled because last season they did
                  really well. But they have now won two games in a row and shown they have
                  character.</p>
              <p>'If they keep working this hard they will soon be safe. They are doing a good
                  job and they have the right mentality to stay in the division.'</p>

              <p>To win BPL half of the squad must go, there r young players in the team can play much better than some senior players. Talk about players rotation it only expose some players who r not match fit. Manager motivation r not strong to push the players to win.</p>
              <p>Comparing with Arsenal they lack of motivation and drive, compare to ManU they lack of determination and the kind of Manager to screw them up and lastly is Chelsea cash to buy big star.</p>

              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kewell Linked With Celtic Move</span></h1>
              <h2>A report in The People says Liverpool boss Rafa Benítez has finally given up on Harry Kewell - Celtic are in line for a summer swoop</h2>
              <div class="C">The Australian international's Anfield career has been marred by a succession of lengthy injuries. <br><br>Kewell is now injury-free but appears to be falling short of Benítez' match-fitness demands. <br><br>He hasn't featured in any of Liverpool's recent games and his request to link up with the national team for a training get-together appears to be the final straw at Anfield. <br><br>Benítez has often stuck up for Kewell in the past but feels the player's commitment to the club is lacking at this vital stage of the season. <br><strong><br>Off To Scotland?</strong><br><br>The newspaper reports that Celtic boss Gordon Strachan is extremely keen to bring the Aussie to Parkhead and that the player is also willing to make the move north of the border. At 29 years of age Kewell is said to want a move to a club that already offers top quality European football, a box which Celtic's almost annual Champions League participation ticks.<br><strong><em><br>Graeme Waterford, Goal.com</em></strong><br></div>
