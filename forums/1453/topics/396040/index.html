              <p>Atletico have had plenty of downs this campaign but they could yet finish it as Spain's most successful side as, having already reached the final of the Copa del Rey, they are now within touching distance of a European final as well after getting past quarter-final opponents Valencia on away goals.</p>
              <p>The <em>Rojiblancos</em> were unable to make the breakthrough during a goalless second leg against their Primera Division rivals at the Vicente Calderon but went through thanks to their 2-2 first leg draw at the Mestalla.</p>
              <p>Atletico enjoyed the better of the chances for the first 75 minutes of last night's match, Diego Forlan hitting the post and the Uruguayan and Tomas Ujfalusi both missing one-on-one opportunities against Valencia goalkeeper Cesar Sanchez, but the Rojiblancos had to weather a late storm from the visitors.</p>
              <p>David Villa spurned a great chance when he smashed a shot against the crossbar while substitutes Nikola Zigic and David Navarro both drew finger-tip saves out David De Gea with headers.</p>
              <p>Valencia were also fuming after failing to win a penalty for an apparent foul on Zigic late on, but Atletico held on and they will now face Liverpool and former idol Fernando Torres for a place in the Europa League final.</p>
              <p>"Valencia have been a tough opponent and both teams have done well. Despite the small advantage from the first leg we didn't know what could happen," Assuncao said.</p>
              <p>"We've managed to succeed though and we are very happy to have reached the semi-final of the Europa League. We are a step away from doing something historic. We are in the final of the Copa del Rey and the semi-final of the Europa League, for which we can be very proud.</p>
              <p>"We cannot lower our guard and we need to continue on our good path against Liverpool and after in the final."</p>
              <p>Atletico midfielder Raul Garcia added: "I think the team has worked very hard and we deserved the triumph, although it's true that the changes Valencia made in the second half could have caused us a lot of damage.</p>
              <p>"It was difficult, but we are in a European semi-final. Now we face the Liverpool of Torres. We are really looking forward to that tie."</p>
              <p>The bad news for Atletico is they will be without striker Sergio Aguero for the first leg against Rafael Benitez's men as he will be suspended after being shown an injury-time yellow card against Valencia. <br><br>Atletico have had plenty of downs this campaign but they could yet finish it as Spain's most successful side as, having already reached the final of the Copa del Rey, they are now within touching distance of a European final as well after getting past quarter-final opponents Valencia on away goals.</p>
