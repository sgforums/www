            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>If we end up buying Mascherano from Kia Joorabchian &amp; Media Sports Investment (MSI) that's the total it will cost us, Â£17m for the transfer plus Â£1.8m we paid in the loan deal. That's an awful lot for a defensive midfielder.<br><br>In fact, it would be the second most Liverpool has ever paid for a player and I believe the second highest transfer fee ever for a defensive/holding midfielder by any team. Michael Essien is the only other player of that position who cost more. Chelsea bought him for Â£24.4m from Lyon in the summer of 2005, but one could argue that he's more of a box-to-box midfielder as well.<br><br>Honestly, if you look at what Man United paid for Owen Hargreaves, we'd be getting a steal. The Red Devils paid Â£17m for the Canadian, of whom Mascherano is clearly a class above and nearly four years younger. Also, Javi is a year-and-a-half younger than the aforementioned Essien, and in my opinion, of similar quality.<br><br>Masche is clearly a positive influence to our side. His untiring devotion and reckless abandonment that he displays on the field is inspiring to say the least. Most of all, he allows Steven Gerrard to roam freely without worry of getting back on defense. That, in itself, is priceless.<br><br>Of the 22 matches Mascherano has played for us, we've only lost three. Two of which to dubious circumstances, but I won't divulge for the sake of getting off-subject. Probably the most impressive aspect is that we are 3-1-1 with Masche on the pitch against the big four: Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Everton. He clearly makes us a better side.<br><br>The flip-side of the argument is that we have Xabi Alonso, Momo Sissoko, and Damien Plessis. I won't include Lucas in the equation, but he, like Stevie-G, is very well capable of playing that role. Xabi has proven himself again and again to be a class player, Momo is getting there, despite what his overcritical naysayers cry, and I've been quite impressed with Plessis the few times I've had the chance to watch him play, but he's only 19 and it'll be at least a couple of years before we'll see if he develops into a first-team regular.<br><br>Rafa has stated that keeping Mascherano is a priority, but if we do lose him, I don't think it's a devastating loss. I personally want him to play out the rest of his career with us as he has become one of my favorite players. So much so that I try to catch every Argentina match he's set to play. Also, knowing his ability and commitment, I'm fearful of ever seeing him in one of our rivals' kits.<br><br>The only thing I worry about is whether or not we could use those funds to buy players in areas in which would better benefit the squad. There's no doubt Mascherano is worth it, but we desperately need a class centre back and another class striker. Hopefully we can buy him and fill those other needs as well.<br><br>Posted by steven gerrard's smarter older brother at 10:06 AM<br><br>Labels: Javier Mascherano, LFC, Liverpool, liverpool fc, Michael Essien, Owen Hargreaves, Rafa Benitez </blockquote></div>

"From my point of view it is simple - I want to play for Liverpool, I want to sign a permanent deal.<br><br>"I have told Rafa Benitez this and he has told me he wants to keep me.<br>"I have had enough of travelling the world from club to club. I want roots, and I want them here in Liverpool. I don't want to move again next summer but if I do not sign for Liverpool then I will not play for another club in England. Not Manchester United, not Chelsea or Arsenal.<br><br>"If I am not with Liverpool I don't want to be in England. It would be impossible for me to play against them in the Premier League because of the respect I have for the club. I want to stay in England, but only with Liverpool.<br><br>"The club created an opportunity for me which I am grateful for so no other English club will come into my thoughts." </blockquote>from liverpoolfc.<br><br>thank god  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
