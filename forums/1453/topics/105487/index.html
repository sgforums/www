It's been unbearable. I haven't slept and my family - it's difficult for them,' Moores told the club's annual general meeting on Thursday.<br><br>'I have to consider my options. I love the club, but clearly that's not enough. I can't compete with Mr Morgan's millions,' he added.<br><br>Moores, who owns a 51 percent stake in Liverpool, was referring to businessman Steve Morgan, who told the meeting that he had made a fourth bid to invest Â£70million in the club.<br><br>'There is an offer on the table,' said Morgan. 'And the money can be in the bank by Christmas.'<br><br>A consortium, led by U.S.-based film producer Mike Jefferies and lawyer Stuart Ford, said on Thursday that they may make a takeover bid and had approached the club's financial advisers.<br><br>That was later denied by Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry who said no talks had taken place.<br><br>'We are not in discussions with them, I can confirm that,' he said.<br><br>Another controversial bid from the Thai government, later taken on by Thai media tycoon Paiboon Damrongchaitham, stalled earlier in the year.<br><br>Moores's comments came after Morgan's wife Didy complained of Liverpool's reluctance to deal with her husband and said he had spent more than Â£300,000 in fees in his attempt to put money into the club.<br><br>'It's as if a deal would be done with the devil rather than my husband,' she said.<br><br>Moores said the latest offer from Morgan was being considered but the club were also bound to investigate the approach from L4.<br><br>The AGM also heard that the cost of a proposed switch from Anfield to a new 60,000 seater stadium at Stanley Park had risen from an estimated Â£80million to Â£115million.<br><br>Parry said the club was looking for a grant from the North West Development Agency but the chairman of the NWDA wanted a groundshare with city rivals Everton and a government ruling was expected by the end of the month.<br><br>Parry also revealed that the club decided to sell Michael Owen to Real Madrid for eight million pounds when the England striker refused to sign a new contract.<br><br>'It is telling that there were no other bidders for Michael Owen,' said Parry. 'We did test the water and there was no interest.'</blockquote></div>
