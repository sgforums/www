            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool have played 15 games in this season's unforgettable European campaign and we salute Rafa and the following players.<br><br><strong>Jerzy Dudek</strong>: Jerzy has played in nine of the 14 games leading up to the final and has kept four clean sheets, with two of those coming away at Juventus and Chelsea. Dudek has been safe and steady throughout Liverpool's Champions League campaign and has made some crucial saves along the way.<br><br><strong>Steve Finnan</strong>: The Republic of Ireland international has had a very consistent season and has played in 13 out of Liverpool's 14 Champions League games. Finnan started the campaign playing right side midfield before returning to right back where he has been outstanding.<br><br><strong>Jamie Carragher</strong>: Liverpool's player of the season has played in every game in the Champions League and has been a rock solid and immense figure. He was inspirational against Juventus and Chelsea and has enhanced his reputation in Europe this season.<br><br><strong>Sami Hyypia</strong>: Like Jamie Carragher Sami Hyypia has played in every Champions League game this season. He has also been a rock solid figure alongside Carragher and scored a memorable goal along the way too. His volley against Juventus at Anfield was just fantastic.<br><br><strong>Djimi Traore</strong>: Djimi Traore has been a revelation for Liverpool in the Champions League and has played in nine of the 14 games leading up to the final. His last ditch tackles under pressure have been a real highlight during the matches.<br><br><strong>Josemi</strong>: Josemi made his Liverpool debut in the qualifier in Grazer AK and has played in seven out of the 14 games leading up to the final. One of Josemi's best games was the 2-0 win over Monaco at Anfield when he helped set up a goal for Milan Baros with a long searching pass.<br><br><strong>Steven Gerrard</strong>: The Liverpool captain gave us a fabulous moment in the Champions League with his never to be forgotten winner against Olympiacos at Anfield. It was such a sweet strike and the emotion that went with it was just incredible. Stevie G set the ball rolling for Liverpool in the Champions League this season with two goals in the qualifier in Graz. Gerrard has played in eight of Liverpool's 14 matches in the Champions League.<br><br><strong>Stephen Warnock</strong>: Before Rafael Benitez arrived at the club Stephen Warnock was heading for the Anfield exit door, but under Rafa he got his chance. Warnock made his Liverpool debut as an 80th minute substitute for Steven Gerrard during the qualifier in Graz. He then started in Olympiacos but his most memorable game was away in Bayer Leverkusen. Fans will remember Warnock having a storming game and throwing himself into a tackle in stoppage time to stop the Germans scoring.<br><br><strong>Harry Kewell</strong>: Harry has had an injury hit season but he still made a good contribution in the Champions League. He created a vital goal for Florent Sinama-Pongolle in the comeback of all comeback games against Olympiacos at Anfield. Kewell played well against Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield and won the free-kick for John Arne Riise to make it 2-0. He also did well when coming on as a substitute in the semi-final win over Chelsea at Anfield when he held the ball up and kept it in the corners. Kewell has played in 11 of the 14 games leading up to the final.<br><br><strong>Xabi Alonso</strong>: Xabi might have only played in six of the 14 games in the Champions League leading up to the final but he still made a significant contribution. His performance in Juventus when he had just returned from injury was magnificent. Alonso also played a key role in the 3-1 win over Olympiacos at Anfield.<br><br><strong>Dietmar Hamann</strong>: Didi returned from injury to produce a magnificent performance in the semi-final win over Chelsea at Anfield. He has played in nine of the 14 games leading up to the final and scored a vital goal with a superb free-kick at the Kop end against Bayer Leverkusen.<br><br><strong>John Arne Riise</strong>: John has played in every game leading up to the final and has had an outstanding campaign showing great versatility and bundles of energy down the left flank. Riise also scored a fantastic free-kick in the win against Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield.<br><br><strong>Luis Garcia</strong>: Luis Garcia has had a magnificent Champions League campaign for Liverpool and scored five great goals. Luis got the vital goal in the semi-final against Chelsea and how about his simply sensational goal against Juventus at Anfield that gave the world's most expensive keeper in Buffon absolutely no chance. Garcia also played a massive part in the win over Bayer Leverkusen when he scored in the first game at Anfield then he added another two over in Germany. Leading up to the final Luis Garcia played in 11 of the 14 Champions League matches.<br><br><strong>Neil Mellor</strong>: Although Neil Mellor only featured in two Champions League games because of injury he made a massive contribution. With Liverpool needing to scored two goals in the last 12 minutes against Olympiacos Rafael Benitez sent on Mellor. Within two minutes of coming on he was first to react to a loose ball and score at the Kop end. Then with four minutes remaining Mellor beautifully directed a header into the path of Steven Gerrard who did the rest to send Anfield ecstatic. Mellor also started during the defeat in Monaco and had a late goal harshly disallowed for a foul leading up to his effort.<br><br><strong>Florent Sinama-Pongolle</strong>: Flo turned the Olympiacos game in Liverpool's favour on that never to be forgotten night at Anfield. Coming on as a half-time substitute for Djimi Traore within a minute he equalised at the Kop end. Sinama-Pongolle also provided the cross that led to Neil Mellor's goal and caused absolute havoc to the Greek defence. Sinama-Pongolle played in four of Liverpool's 14 matches leading up to the final.<br><br><strong>Igor Biscan</strong>: Igor Biscan has been sensational in the Champions League for Liverpool and he has really shown everyone how good he can be. With Steven Gerrard out injured and Xabi Alonso only able to make the bench Rafael Benitez called on Biscan for a crucial Champions League encounter away at Deportivo La Coruna. The Croatian midfielder responded with a magnificent performance and the biggest compliment that could be paid was Liverpool didn't miss Gerrard or Alonso. Biscan set up the goal and from then on he hasn't looked back in the Champions League. Igor has played in nine of the 14 games leading up to the final and started in the last six of them.<br><br><strong>Milan Baros</strong>: Milan Baros has been a tireless worker for the team cause during the Champions League run. He has scored two goals in 13 games leading up to the final including a fantastic individual goal in the 2-0 win over Monaco at Anfield. Baros also scored in the 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in Germany. His direct running at defenders has caused problems for the opposition all the way through the tournament.<br><br><strong>Djibril Cisse</strong>: The return to fitness of Djibril Cisse has defied medical science but is absolutely fantastic to see him back in action and a great testament to his attitude. Cisse scored a fantastic goal against Monaco atAnfieldand played two more games before his horrific injury. Cisse returned as a substitute away at Juventus and was unlucky not to score in the semi-final win over Chelsea at Anfield. Leading up to the final Cisse played in eight of Liverpool's 14 games.<br><br><strong>Antonio Nunez</strong>: The man from Real Madrid made a crucial contribution in the 3-1 win over Olympiacos at Anfield. Nunez played the full 90 minutes and set up Neil Mellor's goal when his header was saved. Nunez has also played crucial roles during the win over Juventus and an excellent late cameo role as a substitute during the semi-final win over Chelsea. Leading up to the final Nunez played in five of the 14 games.<br><br><strong>Vladimir Smicer</strong>: Vladimir Smicer might be leaving Liverpool after the final but he has also played a part in the Champions League run with five substitute appearances. Smicer made a lively contribution during the 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in Germany.<br><br><strong>Chris Kirkland</strong>: Chris Kirkland played in the memorable 3-1 win over Olympiacos at Anfield and played in four Champions League matches, keeping one clean sheet against Deportivo La Coruna at Anfield.<br><br><strong>Scott Carson</strong>: Scott Carson played in one game leading up to the final against Juventus at Anfield and he made one fantastic save to keep out Del Piero at the Kop end. He has also been a substitute in five of the Champions League games.<br><br><strong>Anthony Le Tallec</strong>: Anthony Le Tallec returned from a loan spell at St Etienne to feature in the Champions League at Anfield. The biggest game of his career to date came in the 2-1 win over Juventus at Anfield when he responded superbly to the faith shown in him by Rafael Benitez. Le Tallec gave the pass for Luis Garcia's stunning goal and got a standing ovation when he left the field in the second half due to tiredness. Leading up to the final Le Tallec featured in three Champions League games.<br><br><strong>Darren Potter</strong>: The Republic of Ireland Under-21 international has had a season to remember. Darren Potter made his first appearances in the Champions League during the qualifier in Graz as an 84th minute substitute for Steve Finnan. He was then given a start on the right side of midfield and played the full 90 minutes in the return game with Grazer AK at Anfield, and appeared as a substitute during the 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield.<br><br><strong>John Welsh</strong>: Captain of Liverpool Reserves, England Under-21 international John Welsh has had a good season. He made his sole Champions League appearance in the 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen when he came on as a 68th minute substitute for Jamie Carragher. Welsh was also an unused substitute during the semi-final victory over Chelsea.<br><br><strong>Stephane Henchoz</strong>: Stephane Henchoz made his sole appearance during the 1-0 defeat to Grazer AK at Anfield when he partnered Sami Hyypia at centre half.<br><br><strong>Salif Diao</strong>: Salif played in three Champions League games leading up to the final making one start in the centre of midfield against Grazer AK at Anfield.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Does this means that Diao gets a medal too?  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Liverpool's road to Istanbul. </strong></span><br><br>Grazer AK (away): 2-0 (Gerrard 2).<br>Team: Dudek, Josemi, Hyypia, Carragher, Riise, Kewell, Gerrard (Warnock 80), Hamann, Finnan (Potter 84), Cisse, Baros (Diao 73).<br><br>Grazer AK (home): 0-1.<br>Team: Dudek, Carragher, Henchoz, Hyypia, Riise, Kewell (Warnock 58 ), Diao, Gerrard, Potter, Cisse (Sinama-Pongolle 75), Baros (Hamann 90).<br><br>Monaco (home): 2-0 (Cisse, Baros).<br>Team: Dudek, Josemi, Carragher, Hyypia,Riise,Kewell (Warnock 76), Gerrard, Alonso, Finnan, Cisse (Baros 68 ), Garcia (Biscan 86).<br><br>Olympiacos (away): 0-1.<br>Team: Dudek, Josemi (Cisse 74), Carragher, Hyypia, Riise, Warnock (Kewell 45), Alonso, Hamann (Diao 83), Finnan, Garcia, Baros.<br><br>Deportivo La Coruna (home): 0-0.<br>Team: Kirkland, Josemi, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore, Riise (Kewell 65), Alonso, Hamann, Garcia (Sinama-Pongolle 84), Cisse (Finnan 76), Baros.<br><br>Deportivo La Coruna (away): 1-0 (own goal).<br>Team: Kirkland, Josemi, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore, Riise, Biscan, Hamann, Garcia (Alonso 90), Kewell (Finnan 57), Baros (Sinama-Pongolle 84).<br><br>Monaco (away): 0-1.<br>Team: Kirkland, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Kewell 59), Rise, Biscan, Hamann, Garcia (Josemi 5, Warnock 64), Gerrard, Mellor.<br><br>Olympiacos (home): 3-1 (Sinama-Pongolle, Mellor, Gerrard).<br>Team: Kirkland, Finnan (Josemi 88 ), Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Sinama-Pongolle 45), Riise, Gerrard, Alonso, Nunez, Kewell, Baros (Mellor 76).<br><br>Bayer Leverkusen (home): 3-1 (Garcia, Riise, Hamann).<br>Team: Dudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore, Riise (Smicer 89), Biscan, Hamann, Garcia, Kewell (Le Tallec 76), Baros (Potter 85).<br><br>Bayer Leverkusen (away): 3-1 (Garcia 2, Baros).<br>Team: Dudek, Finnan (Nunez 71), Carragher (Welsh 6<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Hyypia, Warnock, Riise, Biscan, Hamann (Smicer 62), Garcia, Gerrard, Baros.<br><br>Juventus (home): 2-1 (Hyypia, Garcia).<br>Team: Dudek, Finnan, Hyypia, Carragher, Traore, Rise, Biscan, Gerrard, Garcia, Le Tallec (Smicer 73), Baros (Nunez 66).<br><br>Juventus (away): 0-0.<br>Team: Dudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore, Riise, Alonso, Biscan, Nunez (Smicer 58 ), Garcia (Le Tallec 84), Baros (Cisse 75).<br><br>Chelsea (away): 0-0.<br>Team: Dudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore, Riise, Alonso, Biscan (Kewell 85), Garcia (Smicer 90), Gerrard, Baros (Ciise 64).<br><br>Chelsea (home): 1-0 (Garcia).<br>Team: Dudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore, Riise, Biscan, Hamann (Kewell 73), Garcia (Nunez 84), Gerrard, Baros (Cisse 59).</div>
