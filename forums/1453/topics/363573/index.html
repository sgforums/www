              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Benitez rules out selling Mascherano to Barca</h1>
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has ruled
                  out selling Javier Mascherano after the Argentina international's agent
                  was quoted as saying the midfielder was keen to join Barcelona.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/August2008/masch-275.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It
                  has been reported than Mascherano's agent, Walter Tamer, has held talks
                  with Barca technical director Txiki Beguiristain, and was quoted in <em>The Sun</em> saying: ''It would make Javier very proud that a club like Barcelona
                  pay him attention after such an incredible year. I believe a transfer
                  would be feasible.''</p>
              <p>However, Benitez has dismissed the idea and insisted Mascherano is happy at Anfield and not for sale.</p>
              <p>''Mascherano
                  has no price,'' the Spaniard told the club's website. ''Barcelona could
                  not afford to match his value to Liverpool Football Club. We do not
                  want to sell and Javier is very happy here.</p>
              <p>''I have spoken to
                  Javier two or three times this summer - the last time was only last
                  week - and he was very happy, very positive. He gave me the private
                  number of his agent, Walter Tamer, and again the conversation was very
                  positive and was all about football.</p>
              <p>''Walter told me that two
                  clubs with big, big names were asking after Mascherano - and I told him
                  to forget it, that Javier was happy in Liverpool and he was not for
                  sale.</p>
              <p>''So I was surprised to see the agent's comments today. He
                  has a long contract and any club can forget about bidding for him. They
                  can offer £40m or even £50m, we don't want to sell.''</p>
              <p>Benitez has
                  already admitted that this summer is unlikely to see any high profile
                  acquisitions as the club's owners do not have the finance necessary to
                  fund serious transfer spending.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss had wanted to
                  augment his squad with players like Gareth Barry, David Villa and
                  Carlos Tevez, but such are the limitations on Benitez that more
                  realistic targets are thought to be Middlesbrough forward Tuncay or
                  Portsmouth defender Sylvain Distin.</p>
              <p>Last week it was revealed
                  that Kop Football Holdings, the company though which co-owners Tom
                  Hicks and George Gillett control the club, suffered a loss of £42.6m
                  last year and must refinance £350m of debt before July 24.</p>
              <p>However,
                  Benitez remains upbeat and insists he knew that the summer would be a
                  relatively quiet time when he signed his new five-year contract in
                  March.</p>
