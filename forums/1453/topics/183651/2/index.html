            <div class='col-md body'>question is: is chelsea capable of winning the tie without cheating? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Drogba admits he cheated</span></span></strong><br>Saturday March 25 2006<br><br><span style="color: red;">An unrepentant Didier Drogba admitted he used his arm to control the ball before scoring Chelsea's second in the victory over Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.</span><br><br>The Ivory Coast striker had put his side ahead in the 30th minute after a good piece of link-up play with Eidur Gudjohnsen, but his controversial second ended City's chances of a comeback.<br><br>Blues captain Sylvain Distin was booked for dissent for complaining about the goal and was then sent off after the half-time whistle after refusing to hand over the ball as he continued his argument with Rob Styles.<br><br>However, Drogba, who was involved in a handball controversy in last weekend's defeat to Fulham, felt little sympathy.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"Yes, it was handball but sometimes this is the game," he said. "I don't know how to explain. The ball comes to me and I can't do nothing but this."<br><br>When asked whether he felt it was unfair to score in such a way the African said: "Okay, so take off the goal I scored."</span><br><br>Last Sunday at Fulham Drogba scored after handling the ball but on that occasion official Mike Dean, having at first allowed the goal, then changed his mind after consultation with his assistant.<br><br>City manager Stuart Pearce refused to criticise Styles for missing Drogba's infringement.<br><br>"When I first saw it, I thought it was handball and I've watched it again and it was handball. Simple as that.<br><br>"These things happen. It was a very quick game out there and if they miss the odd decision it's not for me to criticise.<br><br>"One or two of my players were aggrieved and the captain has got sent off for questioning the decision. The referees have a difficult job to do and hopefully next week we will get one.<br><br>"Drogba is a good player. He scores goals, he costs a lot of money, he is good in the air and he is a handful to play against. I haven't thought about anything else."<br><br>Pearce was disappointed with Distin, who received two yellow cards for dissent after the goal.<br><br>"I'm always disappointed when we get a player sent off. I asked him after the game what happened and one thing I can say about Sylvain is that he doesn't use abusive language.<br><br>"He said he went to see the referee to ask why he had booked him. The referee wanted him to give him the ball back but Sylvain said he was coming as captain to ask an honest question.<br><br>"With that he booked him again and Sylvain will understand next time.<br><br>"In the rugby code it is acceptable for the captain to speak to the referee and in some ways it is acceptable for footballers too.<br><br>"I always liked to ask referees questions as a player because if I can't ask a question then I can't get an answer and I cannot learn."<br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to speak to the press after the match which leaves his team needing four more wins to secure a second successive Premiership title.<br><br>However, Drogba put up for television interviews and he praised the side for their second victory at Stamford Bridge in four days after the midweek FA Cup quarter-final victory over Newcastle.<br><br>The result also extended their lead over third-placed Manchester United to 15 points, although the Red Devils have two matches in hand.<br><br>"We are very happy to win because Manchester United are playing tomorrow so it is good to put pressure on them," he said.<br><br>"Two consecutive victories at home is good."<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.football365.com/teams/chelsea/story_180949.shtml" rel="nofollow">football365.com</a>)</div>
