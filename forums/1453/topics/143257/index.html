We hope to see the player maybe tomorrow, maybe in two days in Switzerland.<br><br>'He is good in the air. He can keep the ball, he can play the ball. With Peter we will have other options.'<br><br>Saints chief Harry Redknapp had been very keen to retain his star striker despite Southampton's relegation from the Barclays Premiership last season.<br><br>Crouch will become the European champions' sixth summer signing and would almost certainly take their spending past the Â£20million mark.<br><br>Crouch caught Benitez's eye with a good display in his side's 2-0 win over Liverpool at St Mary's back in January, where he scored Southampton's second goal.<br><br>Meanwhile, Liverpool are bracing themselves for a storm of criticism from Australia over their medical treatment of Harry Kewell as the Anfield star undergoes his second operation of the summer.<br><br>Kewell last kicked a ball for Liverpool in the Champions League final in Istanbul, and had to be replaced by Vladimir Smicer before the break.<br><br>A shattered Kewell had an operation soon after the final to repair an adductor muscle tear, amid claims that he lacked commitment in some quarters.<br><br>Now, with the season just a few weeks away and Liverpool involved in a crucial qualifying campaign for next term's Champions League, Kewell entered hospital again today for a hernia operation.<br><br>It is just another in the seemingly constant injury problems suffered by Kewell last season, which saw Liverpool fans lose patience with the former Leeds man, while Benitez also showed his displeasure at the winger's attitude.<br><br>Kewell had support from his agent Bernie Mandic and former Australia coach Frank Farina, who both openly criticised the medical treatment their man was receiving at Anfield.<br><br>Liverpool's statement on their website today pointedly explained the new surgery was nothing to do with the operation he had after the European final.<br><br>It said: 'The injury is unrelated to the adductor tear operation the player underwent following the Champions League final in May.'<br><br>But there is likely to be some criticism from Australia that this is a further problem for the player in an area of the body close to the last injury.<br><br>Kewell declined to travel to Bayer Leverkusen last season for a Champions League game, which enraged Benitez, and also had to be substituted in the Carling Cup final.<br><br>Since the end of the season the player has launched a tirade against the British media claiming a vendetta, amid claims from Liverpool fans and critics that he lacked commitment.<br><br>Kewell constantly complained that he had serious injury problems in the groin area and openly questioned whether he should have an operation before the season ended.<br><br>Liverpool now say that Kewell will be back playing again in five to six weeks, but today's operation could mean the player's fears were justified.<br><br>While Kewell is fighting for fitness and his Liverpool career, defender Sami Hyypia today also launched a defiant response to claims that Benitez is about to bring in a new central defender, Real Zaragoza's Gabriel Milito, who could cost Â£10million.<br><br>With Newcastle reportedly interested in the Finnish defender - who is currently negotiating a one-year extension to his contract which runs out next summer - Hyypia has been quick to defend his position at Anfield.<br><br>He said: 'On the first day back in training the gaffer told me a new centre-half would be coming.<br><br>'I just said `bring it on'. Whoever joins this club has to earn his place in the team as much as everyone else.'<br></div>

It was how he is being used that is wrong. Houllier uses a strategy which is not suitable for him. Heskey was consistently used as a target man for long balls. Although he is strong, he cannot control the ball well and cannot distribute the ball properly. I think he was ask to flick the ball to Owen. But how many times can that be successful? And that is easy to defend too.<br><br>If you look at the players Rafa bought correctly. It is obvious that he craves for wingers. And the best target for wingers is of course a beanpole. Also I think Crouch is a team player, unlike Baros. Crouch may or may not be a good buy. But I think if he is used properly, he will be an asset.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fact is that Southampton plays lots of long ball coz their players are not skilful enough. Hence they have to tap on his height to get goals. So in terms of ground passing, Crouch has not prove anything yet. Remember how he struggled at Aston Villa coz they also play the same style as pools.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pool snag lanky Crouch</strong><br>July 21, 2005<br><br>CHAMPIONS League titleholders Liverpool have won the battle to sign highly-rated England striker Peter Crouch from relegated Southampton.<br><br>The 24-year-old - scorer of 16 Premiership goals last season in a vain attempt to stop Saints from being relegated - will seal a 7 million ($20.5m) move should he pass a medical later today.<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has been keen on signing him but had to see off rival bids from Middlesbrough, Charlton and West Ham.<br><br>However, the lanky Crouch - capped once for England against Colombia in May - is reported to have favoured a move to Liverpool and got his wish after Liverpool outbid their rivals.<br><br>Saints manager Harry Redknapp had wanted to keep Crouch as he bids to restore the club's Premiership status but he has eventually had to admit defeat.<br><br>'A fee of 7 million is good money and obviously it was too good to turn down,' said Redknapp.<br><br>'I would love to have kept him.<br><br>'He was a key player ... I am sure he will be a big success there.'<br><br>SIXTH SIGNING<br><br>Crouch will become Liverpool's sixth signing with Jose Reina, Boudewijn Zenden, Momo Sissoko, Mark Gonzalez and Antonio Barragan also joining the European champions.<br><br>Liverpool were also boosted by Steven Gerrard's decision to extend his contract until 2009.<br><br>But Crouch's arrival should accelerate the departure of Czech Republic international striker Milan Baros, who has fallen out of favour with Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez.<br><br>Benitez said: 'Peter is very good in the air and can hold up the ball, which should suit us.<br><br>'Especially in away games where we had our troubles doing that last season.<br><br>'We lost 11 games away from home last season and so we needed to change things.<br><br>'Peter will definitely give us more possibilities.'<br><br>Benitez is a big admirer of the tall striker since watching him score against Liverpool at St Mary's in January.<br><br>'He is a player I like,' added Benitez.<br><br>'I hope to see him tomorrow, or maybe in two days in Switzerland.<br><br>'He is another kind of player for us.' - PA Sport.<br><br></div>
