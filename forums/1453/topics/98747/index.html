            <div class='col-md body'>very very impressive first half performance by liverpool.<br><br>though goal-less, liverpool players' workrate today has been tremendous. i just wish they can play like that week in week out.<br><br>milan baros is still shining since last game. his dribbling has been dazzling today and so is his flair.<br><br>josemi is not as good as he was in the beginning of the season.<br><br>alonso free kick and corner kick still sucks, from the way i see it.<br><br>cisse still needs to work on his positioning. he seems to be either offside or running towards the wrong side of the field.<br><br>if the team continues the way they play in the second half, i wont believe they wont get themselves a goal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool played well tonight.They deserved more from the game.<br><br>Finishing was missing though.Cisse and Baros had very good chances.The front 2 still look disjointed upfront.On too many occassions,Baros shd have laid off the ball to Cisse but opted to go by himself. There are shades of improvements though. Hopefully,the front 2 gels asap.<br><br>Im impressed with Traore at left back and Benitez's decision to sub Kewell with Risse instead of Traore.This shows that reputation counts for little to the manager and thats always a good thing. Players fighting for their own place and having fair competition will certainly improve the overall quality of the team.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cant agree more with rsp.<br><br>second half's performance aint too bad actually, just that it was plagued by a handful of dubious decisions from the referee.<br><br>baros and cisse still have a long way to work with one another.<br><br>i aint as surprised as the commentator that riise is taken off instead of traore as the former has never been up to his standard for quite sometime. on top of that, traore was having a very good game both defensively and offensively.<br><br>liverpool seriously have to learn how to capitalise on their set pieces. i cant emphasize enough that alonso doesnt seems to be the right person to take either free kick or corner kick. none of his efforts have been close to a goal and i am not speaking based on this game alone.<br><br>the game was slightly turned against liverpool's way right after deportivo had their first real chance. since then, liverpool let loose a sight of vulnerability but fortunately they held on.<br><br>good game. though liverpool has not won all three points, they have won my support with their performance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we definitely missed stevie G. The final pass to the strikers are often misplaced. I feel that alonso didn't really make an influence in midfield as compared to fulham.</div>
