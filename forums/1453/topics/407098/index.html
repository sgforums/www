              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> claims to be as committed to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> as the day he joined the club.</p>
              <p>The Spain international, who returned to training on Monday after winning the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World Cup</span></abbr> in South Africa, has been the subject of persistent speculation this summer.</p>
              <p>However, the 26-year-old has moved to cool reports he is ready to move on.</p>
              <p>"I am really happy to be back, really happy to stay with all my team-mates,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed.</p>
              <p>"I am looking forward to the challenge ahead.''</p>
              <p>A disappointing seventh-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League, 
              which meant no Champions League football for the forthcoming campaign, 
              but the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Atletico Madrid</span></abbr> star is keen to fire them back into the top four and begin challenging for trophies again.</p>
              <p>"This is the best club in the country so the targets and expectations are always high,'' he added.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully we can stay at our level. At <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> the aim is to fight for every title.</p>
              <p>"It was difficult last season but we are sure we can improve this season.''</p>
              <p>Torres has no intention of turning his back on the Merseysiders after one difficult campaign.</p>
              <p>"From my first day I got the same welcome as Stevie (Gerrard) or Carra (<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Jamie Carragher</span></abbr>) or players who have been here for a long time,'' he told the <em>club's official website.</em></p>
              <p>"I felt at home from the first day, I feel the fans love me and everyone
               knows I am really happy here and really happy to play at Anfield.</p>

              <p>Fernando Torres has pledged his commitment to Liverpool despite Chelsea's bid to prise the World Cup winner from Anfield.</p>
              <p>The
               Spain striker had been reluctant to talk about his future while on 
              international duty, but after talks with Roy Hodgson and the Anfield 
              hierarchy, he has delighted fans by declaring his happiness on 
              Merseyside.</p>

              <p>'I am really happy to be back, really happy to stay with all my 
              team-mates,' said Torres. 'My commitment and loyalty to the club and to 
              the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed. I am 
              looking forward to the challenge ahead.'</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/03/article-1299978-0AA75D7E000005DC-732_233x395.jpg" alt="Roy Hodgson " width="233" height="395">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Roy joy: Hodgson will be delighted to retain his two star players</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Chelsea had targeted the 26-year-old, while Manchester City and Barcelona were also monitoring his availability.</p>
              <p>Torres
               wanted reassuring that Liverpool would remain ambitious and 
              competitive, and emerged satisfied from talks with Hodgson and managing 
              director Christian Purslow.</p>
              <p>Captain Steven Gerrard made the first 
              step by snubbing interest from Real Madrid in favour of staying loyal to
               Liverpool and Torres has followed suit after returning to training at 
              Melwood this week.</p>
              <p>In the second half of last season Torres 
              claimed Liverpool needed to sign four or five players in order to meet 
              his ambitions in terms of challenging for honours.</p>
              <p>A disappointing
               seventh-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League, which meant no 
              Champions League football for the forthcoming campaign, raised questions
               about his future.</p>
              <p>However, the former Atletico Madrid star is keen to fire them back into the top four and begin challenging for trophies again.</p>
              <p>'This
               is the best club in the country so the targets and expectations are 
              always high,' he said. 'Hopefully we can stay at our level. At Liverpool
               the aim is to fight for every title. It was difficult last season but 
              we are sure we can improve this season.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In the running: Torres can't wait for the season to start after returning to training with Liverpool</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Torres has always felt a love for, and loyalty to, Liverpool and 
              said: 'From my first day I got the same welcome as Stevie (Gerrard) or 
              Carra (Jamie Carragher) or players who have been here for a long time.</p>

              <p>'I'm looking forward to starting the season and playing with my team-mates and for the fans.'</p>
              <p>Torres
               revealed that talks with Gerrard helped him make a decision and the 
              signing of Joe Cole on a free transfer from Chelsea was seen as a step 
              in the right direction.</p>

              <p>'I really appreciated the fact that Roy (Hodgson) came out to see me while I was on my holidays,' said Torres.</p>
              <p>'He
               told me about his plans for the club and what he wanted from me and I 
              appreciated that. I hope he will be the right man to reach the targets 
              of Liverpool Football Club and I am really looking forward to working 
              with him.</p>
              <p>'I was talking to Stevie a lot today and I also met
               with Joe. I think Joe is exactly the kind of player we need to improve 
              the history of our club.</p>
              <p>'We are keeping our best players and so it's nice to be back with them. Hopefully we can play together as soon as possible.'</p>
