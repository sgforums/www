              <div>
              <p><strong>Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher believes his side's
                                      strong run of recent form is due to manager Rafa Benitez's rotation
                                      policy.</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The Reds have won seven consecutive games since their FA Cup
                                      upset at the hands of Barnsley in February and they have set up a
                                      meeting with Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the Champions League
                                      in the process. Benitez has come in for criticism this season for
                                      his tendency to rotate his squad as Liverpool - who face Manchester
                                      United at Old Trafford on Grand Slam Sunday - struggled in the
                                      middle of the campaign.</p>
              <p>However, Carragher is now eyeing a place in the Champions League
                                      final in Moscow at the end of the season and believes he and his
                                      team-mates are benefiting after being rested by former Valencia
                                      manager Benitez. "The first three years the manager has been here
                                      we have been to three finals so hopefully there will be another one
                                      this season in Moscow," Carragher told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>"He gets a lot of criticism for it but you have to look at his
                                      record, not just here at Valencia too, it does prove successful."
                                      Benitez has played a settled side over recent weeks, but Carragher
                                      is expecting more changes.</p>
              <p>Liverpool travel to United at the weekend before welcoming
                                      Merseyside rivals Everton to Anfield the following week. The Reds
                                      then face their Champions League-Premier League trilogy with
                                      Arsenal in April and, with a batch of international friendlies also
                                      due at the end of March, Carragher expects Benitez to shuffle his
                                      squad.</p>
              <p>"The manager takes a lot of criticism but over the last few
                                      weeks we haven't been changing too much as there hasn't been as
                                      many games," Carragher added. "But with these five games coming up,
                                      plus the international game, I'm sure there might be a few
                                      changes.</p>
              <p>"At this time of the season there are maybe a few tired legs and
                                      things just need freshening up every now and again."</p>

              <p>With Arsenal still in with a shout of the Premier League crown, the chances of
              Arsene Wenger making such dramatic changes for this league clash are less
              likely.
              But Liverpool will have looked at the run-in that they and fifth-placed
              Everton have got and seen that the Toffees must also go to the Emirates and they
              also have to play Chelsea.
              So with a five-point lead in the race for the final Champions League spot
              going into the weekend - and a far superior goal difference - Liverpool have
              more breathing space than Arsenal and therefore it is likely most of Liverpool's
              big guns will be left on the sidelines.
              Fernando Torres, taken off in the final minutes of Wednesday's 1-1 Champions
              League draw, is highly unlikely to be risked again if only to make sure that he
              avoids injury ahead of Tuesday's semi-final second leg against the Gunners at
              Anfield.
              And there is every chance that skipper Steven Gerrard, Sami Hyypia, Jamie
              Carragher, Dirk Kuyt and Ryan Babel could be rested for this one.
              Benitez, who could play Peter Crouch and fit-again Andriy Voronin up front,
              said: 'I will need to think carefully about my team for the league match.
              Torres and Gerrard will need to be strong for the second leg, and Kuyt ran
              himself to a standstill on Wednesday.
              'Some players recover in two or three days, others need four. Maybe we will
              need to change some players.
              'The age may be the key. Fernando can recover in two days, but Sami could
              take five. We will have to wait and see.
              'I am expecting to make changes, I cannot expect them to play three times
              like that in seven days, certainly with the very high tempo of the games.
              'It is impossible to play these same players three times in a week.
              Impossible.'
              Liverpool's fringe players could well find themselves thrown into this
              Emirates clash, with Alvaro Arbeloa, Steve Finnan, John Arne Riise, Crouch,
              Lucas, Voronin and Jermaine Pennant all in line for call-ups.
              Suspended Javier Mascherano will obviously be out but it is debatable whether
              he would have played tomorrow even if the FA had not given him an extra two-game
              ban for the charge that followed the Argentinian's red card at Old Trafford.
              Liverpool's priorities are also clear to Babel, who accepts he may be rested
              for the match.
              'The boss will have to make decisions now on who to start and who to rest,'
              he said.
              'It will be impossible to play with the same eleven in three games against
              Arsenal.
              'I think, in this situation, rotation is maybe good.
              'We flew back from London on Wednesday night after the match, and we will go
              back today. It's a hard few days, mentally difficult.
              'On Thursday we had a light training session, and then we will rest and
              discuss tactics and how we will play in the league match.
              'Rafa will have already seen the first game back a couple of times to tell us
              what we did good and bad. He will now tell us how we can do better.'<br><br><br><em>Your views on this story? <a href="mailto:Newsdesk@soccernet.com"><strong>Email Newsdesk@soccernet.com</strong></a></em></p>

              <p>The 4-2-3-1 is working pretty well, so its not pretty surprising that rafa is not changing often, although I would like to see more of crouch.</p>
              <p>at this stage rotation does seem to matter, and perhaps the rotation of players in the earlier days has shown its benefit.</p>
