              <p>not a match to remember.</p>
              <p>whenever trailing a goal, liverpool is the only team i hardly see having any urgency to win. u dont see the manager throw in offensive player in replace of an defender, nor do you see players pouring forward with shots after shots.</p>
              <p>like what my girlfriend said, with 3 minutes of stoppage time, 1 goal lead is never secure enough against man utd or chelsea. but with liverpool, they can have a third half and 20 corners, yet they cant get anywhere close to the goal.</p>
              <p>another observation. when lucas is playing badly, mash is taken off. but when mash is playing badly, lucas is taken off. just when i tot lucas was not performing too badly as compared to how mash surrender the possession for the first goal, benitez took out mash instead.</p>
              <p>9 points is still not impossible to recover if the reds have the same belief like how man utd had last season when they were on a streak. to begin with, rafa can start with a hairdryer...</p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez urged his players to remain calm in their quest for glory after they fell to a third league defeat of the season against frontrunners Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds are now six points off top spot after goals from Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda settled a tight encounter at Stamford Bridge. <br>Â  <br>Asked by journalists where the 2-0 defeat left his championship hopes, Benitez said: "Our target has to be the next game. They asked me in some interviews about three defeats this year, but it's important to keep calm, keep working hard to improve. <br>Â  <br>"We have to focus on the next game, get three points and see what happens. <br>Â  <br>"This year the top sides will lose points against other teams, so we just have to try to win every week. <br>Â  <br>"We will try to win against Sunderland and see. It's a long race and we have to think about the next game, that's it." <br>Â  <br>Asked if he had to convince his players to keep calm, Benitez quipped: "It's more difficult to convince the press of this than my players!" <br>Â  <br>Though disappointed with the scoreline, Benitez took heart from the performance of his side in a difficult arena. <br>Â  <br>"The performance wasn't bad against a good team. We worked hard and had some good play," he said. <br>Â  <br>"I was really pleased for 90 per cent of the game but you have to do almost everything perfectly to win here. <br>Â  <br>"Defensively we were good enough. We defended much better. They didn't have many chances, which means we were defending better, and we didn't have many chances, which means they are a good team. <br>Â  <br>"When you make a mistake against a good team, you pay for it. We lost the ball and they scored. <br>Â  <br>"The game was open after the goal. We had some chances but you have to take your chances if you want to change the situation. <br>Â  <br>"I cannot blame any one of the players because they were working really hard. You have to be pleased with the team effort and disappointed with the result." <br>Â  <br>Quizzed on whether his side should have created more chances, Benitez responded: "We played against Chelsea. Do you expect any team to play here and have 20 attempts? I don't think so. <br>Â  <br>"We had some chances but we couldn't score because their defenders are good defenders." <br>Â  <br>Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti dismissed a question about any damage done to Liverpool's title hopes. <br>Â  <br>"I think the end of the championship is a long way off and Liverpool have the quality to have a very good season," he said."</p>

              <p>on a bright note, ryan babel has shown more improvement than in the past.. he has also helped to bring players into the game... RB cannot afford to screw up nw, LFCÂ is in danger of losing the BPL and CL if this form continues..</p>

              <p>I still think in certain matches , we need someone like Heskey and Crouch to create chaos inside the box .</p>
              <p>CharltonÂ Cole also not bad .</p>
              <p>We just dun have someone that has got heights to do that now .</p>
              <p>Like last night , many crosses was cut off by Terry . We just dun have any receipients .</p>

              <p>we were almost a complete team .... just almost there .</p>
              <p>Crouch , Alonso .....</p>
              <p>Then for no reason , Crouch were sold , heskey were sold .......</p>
              <p>Rafa keeping faith with Lucas , which is a high riskÂ faith , a risk of losing .</p>

              <p>i think Raf's plan is to move Gerrard back to the position he do best , from the central midfield role .</p>
              <p>And move Aquilani into the position Gerrard usually covered just behind the strikers .</p>
