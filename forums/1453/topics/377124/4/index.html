              <p>it's ok we lose so early in the season .....</p>
              <p>In fact , i am glad if we really dun make it .</p>
              <p>I like the facts , all Liverpool fans wanted the 2 Americans out .</p>
              <p>For past seasons , we have been doing well in the BPL and UCL for the revenue to make them curb those debts .... and in return , Rafa was not given what he was promise . All money was repay for the debt for their personal future gain , and nothing was return to Rafa .</p>
              <p>Now let's see , if Liverpool dun make it into the UCL next season , see if the 2 Americans still stay ?</p>
              <p>if i am Rafa , if they do not have the revenue to repay those loans , they eventually have to back out , making ways for new owners .</p>
              <p>I sense a Rafalution to over throne the 2 USA fellas , by not making into those $$$ doors .</p>
              <p>That's the only way isn't it to make them exit ?</p>

              <p><br>haha...cannot compare nazri nasir with lucas la...but seriously, lucas don't fit liverpool's play.. the position he's in requires him to find space and if possible play clever one-twos to charge up the pitch to support and bring the ball to the rest of the attackers.. wat i see from lucas is tt he dun have this ability to do so, as his passing is quite limited( always sideways in the final third), doesn't have the guts and physical strength to force thru the centre( just look at wilson palacios),  not much vision as well( just look at cesc fabregas or xabi alonso)...</p>

              <p>I like the facts , all Liverpool fans wanted the 2 Americans out .</p>
              <p>For past seasons , we have been doing well in the BPL and UCL for the revenue to make them curb those debts .... and in return , Rafa was not given what he was promise . All money was repay for the debt for their personal future gain , and nothing was return to Rafa .</p>
              <p>Now let's see , if Liverpool dun make it into the UCL next season , see if the 2 Americans still stay ?</p>
              <p>if i am Rafa , if they do not have the revenue to repay those loans , they eventually have to back out , making ways for new owners .</p>
              <p>I sense a Rafalution to over throne the 2 USA fellas , by not making into those $$$ doors .</p>
              <p>That's the only way isn't it to make them exit ?</p>

              <p>sorry to tell you, the 2 americans wouldn't leave unless they make a huge profit from liverpool fc, and the solution u thought is worse than the current scenario, as the club may be forced to sell its assets to repay the loans, as the banks will take control of the club. If there are no suitable buyers that want to buy LFC at the banks' price, then the banks will proceed to sell assets like Torres, Gerrard, Benayoun, Aquilani, Reina, Johnson, and even Babel...( lucas, i nt so sure la :)..)</p>
