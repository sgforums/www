              <p>Manager <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=54"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Roy Hodgson</span></a> claims Liverpool's recent improvement is a direct result of his decision to ignore the board's request to sell a number of players in the summer.</p>

              <p>Hodgson has revealed that former managing director Christian Purslow handed him a list of players to sell in the transfer window, prior to John W Henry's Anfield takeover in October, but chose to ignore the advice.</p>
              <p>"I got a list from Christian," Hodgson told the <em>Guardian</em>. "He had been here for just over a year and was a big fan of the club as well as being managing director. He had very strong opinions about lots of players and he gave lots of opinions about them. I listened but I made it perfectly clear that I wouldn't act on it.</p>
              <p>"To some extent, he was saying what a lot of other people might have done. But now when he rings or texts me, to be fair, he says what a good job [that] we didn't do the things that had been suggested."</p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager did not reveal the names on the list but following the 3-0 victory over Aston Villa on Monday night Hodgson heralded the likes <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/108315/Lucas"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Lucas Leiva</span></a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/84000/David-Ngog"><span style="color: #225fb2;">David Ngog</span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/41418/Ryan-Babel"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Ryan Babel</span></a>, who all started in the Anfield victory.</p>
              <p>Although some of Liverpool's previously maligned players have started to flourish under Hodgson the Liverpool boss has urged new owners NESV to strengthen the squad in January.</p>
              <p>"There are still areas of the squad where we are not so rich," Hodgson said. "If we hit a couple of bad spells with injury we could be in quite a bit of trouble. I'm not certain our depth is what it should be and we certainly don't have the depth of Tottenham, Chelsea or Arsenal."</p>
              <p>"My message to them [NESV] would be - and it is not a secret because I have had discussions with John [W Henry] about it - if the right players become available and we really think they will push us on, we should go for them."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Hodgson has insisted that there is no truth in the rumours linking Liverpool with a swoop for AC Milan star Ronaldinho and Ajax captain Luis Suarez, although he does seem keen on deal for Aston Villa winger <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/31810/Ashley-Young"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Ashley Young</span></a>.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldinho and Suarez are players who we have never even thought about but I would think there is not a manager in the Premier League who has not given Ashley Young a thought at some stage or another," said Hodgson.</p>
