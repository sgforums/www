              <p>Considering the value of the squad he took over in 2004 and now, considering the transfer budget he's given each season, I think he's done a pretty good job.</p>

              <p>el zhar was injured pre-season and has only been back the past month.</p>
              <p>nemeth's out on loan.</p>
              <p>ayala is kept out due to insua being eased into the squad (there, 1 ex-youngster who's playing regularly now with an senior argentina cap to boot)</p>
              <p>kelly's conveniently injured several times when johnson wasn't around (search around the prematch reports and you'll find enough of them), hence it's hard to introduce him especially when the back 4's often disrupted due to soto's suspension or agger/skrtel injuries.</p>
              <p>n'gog wasn't suppose to play much this season - rafa was promised by the americans the sale of players will go back to the transfer kitty (hence he sold keane) but they did a u-turn afterwards.</p>
              <p>as for spearing and plessis, who do you want them to replace? lucas, mascherano, benayoun, aquilani, or our captain? </p>

              <p>yes Rafa did very well indeed..............</p>
              <p>after all, when it comes to signing the most number of flops and wasting most money on them, Rafa truly has no equal..............</p>
              <p>and apart from winning a most dubious Champions League final in which Milan most probably threw the match after conceding 3 soft goals to Liverpool..................Rafa has won nothing.............</p>
              <p>if there's a Nobel Prize for football, sure no one deserves it more than Rafa.</p>

              <p>I'll try to explain this as simple as I can.</p>
              <p>Throughout the previous seasons, Rafa has always been given +/- 20mil transfer funds per season plus any amount he generated from player sales.</p>
              <p>Hence:</p>
              <p>Feb 2009 - Sold Keane for 16mil (expecting 36mil available at end of season: 16mil from sales + the usual 20mil every year)</p>
              <p>June 2009 - Bought Johnson for ~6.5mil (plus 11mil for crouch, expecting 29.5 mil transfer funds left)</p>
              <p>July 2009 - Sold Leto for 3mil (expecting 32.5mil)</p>
              <p>5 Aug 2009 - Sold Alonso + Arbeloa for 33.5mil (expecting 66mil)</p>
              <p>7 Aug 2009 - Bought Aquilani for ~17mil to replace Alonso (expecting ~49mil left)</p>
              <p><strong>(between 7 Aug to 21 Aug) - American owners refinance loans and decides not to give Rafa any transfer funds this season. Also, the profits from Alonso's sale used to repay owners' loans (you'll be pissed if you understand what's going on)</strong></p>
              <p>21 Aug 2009 - Somehow coughs up ~2mil to purchase Soto as replacement for Hyypia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine the owners stick to their word and gave Rafa the money as usual - who do you think he would have signed? It's no coincidence we were linked with some of the more expensive strikers during that same time period.</p>
              <p>My dates may not be 100% accurate but the facts are - Rafa was promised funds but then denied and hence messing up his plans - if you want I can look up some of the interviews during that time period where he let his frustrations show.</p>
              <p><strong>I'm not a 100% rafa supporter.</strong> I booed when he took torres off and facepalm when he play lucas again and again earlier in the season. But I'm surprised at some of the posts made here suggesting how he done totally nothing for the club or how he should be sacked etc.</p>
              <p>Personally this season liverpool had been horrible, partly due to the injuries and insufficient squad depth (read: MONEY NOT ENOUGH). However, I think he done a great job overall considering the two clowns we have as owners and an inept ex-CEO.</p>

              <p>The fact is most of his signings are <strong>CHEAP</strong>, because liverpool doesn't have a bank account like man utd or chelsea. Despite this, he has managed to sign several good players like Reina, Agger, Benayoun. Some worked out but were later sold - players like Crouch (doesn't want to play second fiddle to Torres), Alonso (still pissed off from the barry saga), Bellamy / Sissoko (sold to purchase better players since liverpool were ummm broke)</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Misleading. Hard to sign players at huge cost when we dont have the money in the first place T_T.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My point is, there are other teams who can sign 10-20mil+  'fringe' players and put them on the bench. Or play them and when they didn't work out, throw them into the reserves for a few months. However, liverpool is <strong>NOT RICH ENOUGH </strong>to do that, hence when a transfer doesn't work out Rafa needs to sell them to cut his losses and use the money to improve the squad further.</p>
