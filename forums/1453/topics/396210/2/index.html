              <p>When Babel gets the ball, seems to me he'll give away possession 9/10 times and do a spectacular on the rare 10th. Awfully good on that occasion, otherwise pretty bland.</p>
              <p>Just look at Liverpool vs Everton this season, the difference after Babel came on to replace N'gog was huge. (side note - I do not think N'gog is good enough yet, his finishing sucks. However I feel no one here recognizes his ability to maintain possession on his own up front, pretty good considering he's still young and playing in the toughest league in the world)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of your long list of 'not good enough for liverpool' players, bear in mind Rafa's transfer budget. Who wouldn't want to sign big name players if they can afford to?</p>

              <p>Ryan played on the wings of 4-3-3 at Ajax before joining Liverpool. Well he was played up front alone in Torres' absence earlier this season but... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still dont understand why the hatred on Rafa. It's like he's blamed for not signing enough big-named players when 1) we dont have the budget and 2) which big name players did we sign before rafa came?</p>

              <p>When we have the money?? We don't have the money. Rafa's budget have been shrinking year after year, just as his squad list has.</p>
              <p>The club needs to pay off a massive debt, and when you have a massive debt, it means the owners are using borrowed money to buy players, and there's only so much leverage that the club has, which really is close to nothing.</p>
              <p>Just look at this summer -- were not even linked to any players, because there's just no money. If we had the money, David Billa, Gareth Barry, Robbie Keane would all be wearing Red earlier against Fulham, and scoring goals.</p>
              <p>The Truth: There's not much money, and it's as if Rafa's having to barter trade everytime he wants to sign a new player.</p>

CL how many matches nia, 14 matches nia. but then to win CL is also not easy. but to win the league title in truly a good yardstick in your managerial abilities lor. his best chance to win was last season, but he blew it due to his scared to lose mentality. anyway rafa is not known for his caviar like style of football, a betrayal of the liverpool football in the 70s and 80s.</p></div>

              <p>Take a step back out of babel and look at the team since Rafa joined. If you think Rafa did a bad job over 6 seasons and someone else would have done better, I have nothing to say.</p>
              <p>If you think he did ok but do not deserve another season after this, I have nothing to say either.</p>
              <p>Look at our starting 11 the past few games - a 1.5mil old greek CB, a young 1.5mil striker and a winger from a free transfer. The kind of players you expect to win the title?</p>
              <p>I still think he did a great job nonetheless. If you think otherwise, with not playing babel up front as your main argument, speaks a lot about the mentality of supporters here.</p>
