            <div class='col-md body'><strong>HARRY KEWELL IS BACK</strong><br><br>Rafael Benitez has called on Harry Kewell to show his 'hunger' to play for Liverpool while pleading with fans to give the Aussie a fresh start.<br><br>Kewell, who has not kicked a ball for Liverpool's first team since the Champions League final in Istanbul in May when he limped out of the game in the first half, will play for Australia at the weekend with Benitez's blessing.<br><br>The attacking midfielder has managed just 25 minutes of a reserve run-out since his recovery from two summer operations relating to groin and hernia problems.<br><br>Now the chance for Kewell to get vital match fitness has been welcomed by boss Benitez who is more than happy to see his much-maligned player involved in Australia's friendly with Jamaica at Craven Cottage on Sunday.<br><br>That could see the beginning of the Â£5million signing's return to senior action in the Champions League against Anderlecht and the Carling Cup tie at Crystal Palace later this month.<br><br>But the fact that Liverpool fans have fallen out of love with Kewell over the last year is of concern to Benitez, who says he wants to fans 'to give him a fresh start.'<br><br>'He could feature in the Champions League or in the Carling Cup. We can use him then. If we use him little by little he can find his way back, but he must also be hungry to succeed. That's important, too.'<br><br>Even Benitez became exasperated with Kewell's constant injuries last season, but said: 'Harry is a fantastic player and we need him.<br><br>'I want to see Harry doing what he's capable of, beating defenders and getting plenty of crosses into the box.<br><br>'When he's back with us it'll be like signing a new player because he has a lot of quality. He is a different kind of player to what we have.<br><br>'Maybe we'll need to be a bit more patient with him when he's back into the team if he's not completely match fit, but we will give him a couple of games before he plays in the Premiership.'<br><br>Benitez added: 'Every day he is feeling a bit better. He's away with Australia this weekend and then we'll have to see if he can be involved against Blackburn. It may be too soon but we'll have to wait and see.<br><br>'He will bring ability, experience and energy to our team and I'm looking forward to having him available again.'<br><br>Kewell's return would certainly solve one of Liverpool's major problems, the lack of crosses from the flanks.<br><br>But Benitez has been quick to deny that he is chasing another winger, Real Betis star Joaquin.<br><br>And he has gone to extreme lengths to distance himself from a reported interest, by suggesting that 'people in Spain are trying to move the player out of Betis.'<br><br>A Spanish newspaper claimed the player's agent attended the Chelsea game at the weekend as a guest of Liverpool chief scout Paco Herrera.<br><br>However, Benitez said: 'These stories are false. I keep reading in the Spanish press that we are trying to take Joaquin to England. The agent did not come to the Chelsea game and we have never made any offer or suggested other players as part of a transfer deal.<br><br>'Our position is clear. We are not interested in bringing the player to Anfield and I can only assume that people in Spain are trying to move the player out of Betis.'[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool look ready to test the resolve of Ajax in January with a move for their midfielder Steven Pienaar.<br><br>The 23-year-old has come through the Dutch giants' youth academy firstly with their South African branch, before moving to Holland in 2001.<br><br>Pienaar has become an integral part of the Ajax side, with his ability to play anywhere in midfield proving invaluable.<br><br>However, Pienaar's abilities have not gone unnoticed and a clutch of Europe's biggest clubs have been alerted to the fact that he is now in the final year of his contract.<br><br>Ajax are desperate for him to sign a new deal, but they would appear to be facing an uphill battle to get him signed on before January - when Pienaar will be allowed to talk to any interested clubs.<br><br>"It is our intention to attach him longer to our team," said Ajax technical director Martin van Geel.<br><br>"With this offer we show our confidence, not just personally but financially."<br><br>Pienaar's agent Rob Moore is due to meet with Ajax's management.<br><br>"At this moment the player has not made up his mind on any decision," Moore told skysports.com.<br><br>"We have a meeting with Ajax later this month and after that we should know what is happening."<br><br>Liverpool are known to have taken close interest in Pienaar over the past few weeks and they like the idea of his versatility - particularly his ability to play on the right side of midfield where they currently have few options.<br><br>Manchester City are also keeping tabs on the player, although the club with the longest standing interest - Arsenal - cannot be discounted from making a move.<br><br>German giants Werder Bremen, Hamburg and Borussia Dortmund are also monitoring the situation.<br><br>Of all the clubs currently keeping abreast of Pienaar - Liverpool are probably one of the few that would like a deal done in January.<br><br>If Pienaar still has not signed a new deal by that point - then Ajax may well sell for a reduced fee, rather than see him leave for nothing in June.<br><br>Looks like joaquin is too ex and they are aiming for another..Since Benitez denied the moves for joaquin...But den again clubs like to deny den oneday pop the player move liao..We'll wait and see..If benitez wants immediate results joaquin better,cause pienaar still abit young though he has lots of experience.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
