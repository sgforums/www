              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez</span></span></a> has cast further doubt on his chances of remaining at Liverpool ahead of Sunday's potential title-decider against Chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0502/rafaelbenitez20100428_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Rafael Benitez" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p>Widespread speculation on Friday and Saturday suggested Benitez was on the verge of confirming his move to Juventus after Liverpool's Europa League exit, and he appeared to hint at an imminent move when he said: "Hopefully I will still be here on Sunday against Chelsea."</p>
              <p>Benitez signed a new five-year contract last year, but has now likened his current situation to 2004, when he walked out of Valencia after the club failed to sign the players he requested.</p>
              <p>"I decided to sign an extension because the squad was good and the money could be there," Benitez said. "At the end, things changed.</p>
              <p>"We've had a bad season and hopefully things will be different in the future, but at the moment I can't talk about the future because I don't know what's going on.</p>
              <p>"It's not a question of money. I said no to massive offers. I decided to stay under some conditions which have changed."</p>
              <p>He added: "I left Valencia because the conditions changed."</p>
              <p>Benitez did hint, however, that he could remain if there is a change of ownership.</p>
              <p>"The players share the same frustrations," he said. "I know how they feel because I've been talking to them all season. The season has not been good. That is clear. We know why and what has to change."</p>

              <p>What he promised at the beginning of the season, he never delivered.</p>
              <p>I am not blaming him but he have made Liverpool what they are today.</p>
              <p>It is time for him to go for some saving grace and save his ego at Italy.</p>
              <p>Bring his pet lucas with him also.</p>
              <p>If he want to go, he can just go.</p>
              <p>Only guys that worshipped like the almighty will want he to stay and do more harm to the club.</p>
              <p>I have never seen Liverpool in such a bad shape.</p>
              <p>Ah Hou left Liverpool in better shape and pride.</p>

              <p>His biggest mistake this season could be the infamous 4th place guarantee.  A manager who fails to deliver what he promises to deliver must take responsibility, regardless of circumstances.  Although Liverpool have had limited budget for players in the past few seasons, and injuries to key players have ruined the season, any professional who cannot live up to his promises has to pay the price.</p>
              <p>The players also appear to be starting to lose faith in Benitez.</p>

              <p>By the look of things so far, he is again playing mind games with the director to determine he get the money that he requested and the respect that he want.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is the only manager that play this mind game of leaving and staying for the past three seasons.</p>
              <p>The fans and directors are sick of this nagging game.</p>
