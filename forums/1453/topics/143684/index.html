There was a point when I thought that maybe I would not be coming back.<br><br>"But I have always been in contact with the club and always been in negotiations during the period. I am happy that at the end we have reached an agreement because this is what I wanted from the beginning."<br><br>He told www.evertonfc.co.uk: "I said last season that this is where I wanted to stay because I have found a good club with good people and I was happy here.<br><br>"It is good to be involved in a competition like the Champions League. I cannot wait, I am sure it is going to be a good season."</blockquote>Why don't Liverpool just save the money and sign him for free? They already spent so much. I believe that he's quite good and very suitable to be a back-up central defender.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
