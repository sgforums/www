They only had to worry about the remaining 4 away , which includes us , Newcastle , Fulham  ? All are capable of reaching 4th !

Sadly, our day dun happen very often.<br><br>The run-in is interesting in tat the 3 teams most likely to end up 4th - LFC, Toons &amp; Charlton - will be playing agst each other.  The team which takes most pts out of these matches will be favourite.<br><br>We have an advantage in tat we will be both of them at home.  H/r, our other matches are also tougher...notably agst Gunners and MU, both away.<br><br>How I see it is we're capable of getting there... all we need is to play more like we did agst P'mouth - with passion and with fire - for the rest of the season.
