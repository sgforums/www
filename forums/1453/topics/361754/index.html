              Football FanCast guest columnist Darren Myers will be sad to see Babel leave, but given circumstances and need to raise transfer funds is ultimately the right decision. 
              
              There are few players that have split the Anfield faithful quite like Ryan Babel. Liked by some, disappointing for others, whatever your feelings are of the guy it has to be said that he hasn't perhaps been given the necessary opportunity to prove his worth. 
              
              I have to confess that I have a lot of sympathy for the kid and he seems like the kind of player who just needs faith and belief from his manager in order to bring the best out of him. The odd 10 or 15mins here and there isn't ideal and hasn't really done him or the club any favours. I appreciate that others will feel that during the times he has been given his chance he has flattered to deceive, but I will counter that by mentioning that on the times he has performed he was more often than not left out the next game. 
              
              I often feel with Babel that we have another Robbie Keane episode, where I wonder how much Rafa Benitez wanted him at the football club in the first place. I mean on the times we needed someone desperately to fill in for Torres upfront, he would be continually overlooked in favour of Kuyt or more worrying the inexperienced Ngog. Even out on the left hand side his speed and skill would be invaluable in stretching defences; however the more disciplined Riera was always preferred. Perhaps his tactical discipline on the field is the reason why Benitez has decided against playing Babel at times as Rafa has claimed on various occasions that this was a particular area that the Dutchman needed to improve on. 
              
              It appears, according to this morning's reports that Rafa is seemingly prepared to let Babel go this summer. Whether it is simply because he has lost faith in the player, or the fact that his sale is just to bolster the transfer coffers is not known, but I will be sorry to see the Dutchman leave. Despite my liking of Babel I'm not blinkered enough not to realise that he also one of the few players that isn't a first team regular at present, but still carries a huge fee, therefore with us in the financial predicament it is understandable why Rafa may sacrifice him to strengthen elsewhere. In my opinion it will be a grave shame to see such raw potential leave, but given Babel's time at Anfield and the unlikelihood of him being given the opportunity under Benitez, it is arguably the right decision.
