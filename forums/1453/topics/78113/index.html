            <div class='col-md body'>this is why i dont rate david o'leary highly. to me, he's the main cause of the leeds downfall. he's a good tactician of the game, but definitely not as good a manager. he needs $$$ to rebuild his team, and lots of that mind you. i think this is a good example of what european places actually mean to clubs. i think bobby is being wise in that he waits till the club is guaranteed a place in champs league before spending the cash, which is why he didnt bring anybody other than free transfers this season. the fans always want to see new faces in the squad, but the fact is that without champs league, it would be suicidal to spend on new players. i dont think even uefa cup can match the revenue from champs league's games. we'll see what villa turns out to be should they qualify for europe. i bet dave will spend on another 3-5 players, and the start of the decline is when the squad doesnt produce anymore. there've been one season wonders in recent years, look at the likes of ipswich, everton and even kaiserslautern.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uncle poolman.. dave is definitely a good tactician, but villa is not one of the top teams in previous seasons. and if you realized, he kept bugging the chairman for more and more money and he definitely has spent way more than graham taylor had. well, it's good for him since his bet paid off this season now that they are in europe. but i think it's still a huge gamble to spend such amount for a mid table club (5M for peter crouch, 2.5M for mccann, 2.5M for sorensen) if it were a club that is regularly in the europe, it wouldnt be as big a gamble. anyway, money to a certain extent buys success nowadays. but it'll be disaster if villa doesnt keep their form next season. i'm sure you know what i mean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">I'm so sure Villa will be in Europe next season ! UEFA Cup i.e !<br><br>Peter Crouch went to Villa all "credit" to Graham Taylor ! And I thought he was useless until O'Leary used him effectively !<br><br>Sorenson and Neil Mccann is definitely a good buy at less then 3 million pounds !<br><br>Doug Ellis is a relief man I think !<br><br>Not forgetting he bought a "new" striker - Juan Pablo Angel ! O'Leary certainly has his ways to motivate one player ! Angel is on his way out from the EPL until O'Leary came ....  the rst is history !<br><br>And i thought Nolberto Solano settle down fast at Villa ?<br><br>In fact I saw more things since O'Leary took over , Villa becoming a fast running team , players gets fitter , more hardworking , more gel as a team !<br><br>Val , with Europe in sight for O'Leary , I think he will bark for more  , but "sensefully" this time !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></span></span></div>
