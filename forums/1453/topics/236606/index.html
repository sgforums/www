It's now just up to the Premier League to authorise me to play, something I believe should happen because it was they who made the appeal to FIFA to allow me to move clubs. I hope the situation is resolved as soon as possible."<br><br>Mascherano's stay at West Ham turned into a nightmare as he only managed 235 minutes of Premiership action for the struggling London outfit.<br><br>And he's now hoping that the move to Merseyside will kickstart his career once again.<br><br>He said: "Rafa Benitez asked me if I wanted to stay in England or if I'd prefer to go elsewhere. When I told him I wanted to play this football and prove that I can adapt to it, he fought to sign me."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><a href="http://www.sportinglife.com/football/transfer_centre/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/07/02/09/manual_084427.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportinglife.com/football/transfer_centre/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/07/02/09/manual_084427.html</a></div>

He walked back, filled the petrol can up, walked to his car put the petrol in and set off back home. Then half a mile up the road a taxi crashed into the back of him.
