In the third of a special series of features, we spoke to members of the Singapore Supporters Club.<br><br>Just how big a club are Liverpool in your part of the world?</strong><br><br>In Singapore, there is no bigger club than Liverpool FC. Other clubs like Chelsea and Man U may have the greater profile in the media due to their active commercial activities but in terms of passion and loyal following, the number of Singaporeans who are Liverpool fans would easily outnumber the combined following of all the EPL clubs in Singapore. It is common for the Blues, Devils and Gunners to share the same set of fans over here.<br><br><strong>Tell us a bit about your club, ie how many members, where you gather to watch matches and how many of you will be in Hong Kong to support the Reds?</strong><br><br>The Singapore Branch was established in 1999, and since 2001 our club has registered as a society in Singapore. We have about 3000 members and many are in family units. It is common to find a family of Liverpool fans among our members. Our live match gathering has been at Hard Rock CafÃ© for a year now and we will continue that partnership for the upcoming season as well. I have no idea how many of us would be in Hong Kong. Many of our members had not been able to secure tickets through the fan club, and as such they would have made the trip on their own.<br><br><strong>How excited are you by LFC's visit to Hong Kong?</strong><br><br>I am happy that the team is coming to Asia but there needs to be more coordination in our Liverpool community.<br><br><strong>Which players are you looking forward to seeing in action most?</strong><br><br>The team excites me the most. We have retained most of our core players and the addition of Benayoun, Babel and Torres has certainly strengthened the squad for the upcoming season.<br><br><strong>What are your hopes and expectations for the new season?</strong><br><br>I just want to see us more competitive in the EPL. It would be a dream to get that elusive 19th title. </blockquote><a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N156498070726-0558.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N156498070726-0558.htm</a><br><br>Pretty nice of them to interview us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
