It's should with Josemi... he kept playing him even though he sucks untill he was about to pull Liverpool into the relagation zone then he decides that 'Josimi' have to be rested. Now he kept playing his new spanish loves..... can't he wait? why break up the Carra and Hyyia center defence when they show that they played better together than anyone else. Is Ah Ben blind or what? wait he DID wear his glasses. mayb its the brain thats blind.<br><br>Did you guys realise that Garcia can't hold the ball for more than 1 minute?<br>He either lose it to opponent or shoot it into the hands of the keeper, the fans etc except goal. He is a TOTAL DISGRACE to the no 10 jersey... usless looking like a ah soh with that stupid hair band.<br><br>What position is Pellegrino playing center back or center forward?<br><br>I thought I was watching Siants vs Malaysia...<br>Players are not organised... players look damn farking lost. Riise on the right??? hhhhmmm...... thought the GH age is over.<br><br>Midfield lost the battle to Jamie Redknapp, a player I truely love to watch but he just got injuried too often else he could have been the best England midfield. Stevie G, he look tired... really tired. Was it his injuries? or he is losing heart. Where's that Stevie G that cover every single inch of the field, made every single tackle on the opponent. Garcia is a joke playing midfield, he should join josemi on the bench.<br><br>We lost... cos we dont even play simple football. We lost not to a better team but to a team playing simple football.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The performance between both teams were so different. Southampton look more like a team fighting for Champions league and Liverpool fighting for relegation. There was no spirit in Liverpool's play, passes went astrayed and defence were caught many times and punished twice ! We were luckily not to be 3 or 4 nil down which is possible. Southampton should have a penalty , luckily the referee didnt catch the push from Raven. Morienties must have left his shooting boots in Madrid, he had one decent chance to at least shoot the target but he ballooned way way to high !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyo. Before the game started I already know the outcome. Asian handicap Liverpool 'give' 0.5 ball to Saints. Meaning before the game starts, Saints is leading 1-up. Ok, back to the this 0.5 kind of thing.<br><br>Many ppl maybe thinking Saints so lousy, sure relegate at the end of this season and Pool so good and strong, sure no problem winning at least a goal or two. If this is the case, Pool should be giving 0.75 to 1 ball mah. So when half an hour to go before the match starts, the odds still Pool -0.5 ball.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I 'eat' of course.
