              <h1 class="titlestory">Fulham players question whether Hodgson can 
              handle Liverpool demands</h1>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> players believe Roy Hodgson's move to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> could all end in tears.</p>
              <p>The 62-year-old, who joined the London club in 2007 and guided them 
              to the Europa League final last season, is even being tipped to fail at 
              Anfield by some players at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Others claim that, although Hodgson is widely respected in the game, his
               brand of management and style of football will have to change radically
               if he is going to succeed at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>“I’m not entirely sure this is the right move for Roy,” one senior 
              player at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>. “He’s a 
              lovely bloke and I wish him all the success in the world but I suspect 
              he might have taken on more than he can handle going to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>“He loathes confrontation and can’t handle egos and troublesome 
              personalities.</p>
              <p>“He certainly bit off more than he could chew with Jimmy Bullard at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr>, so can you imagine him dealing with players
               at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> like <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Steven Gerrard</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Jamie Carragher</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> who have enormous power in and out 
              the dressing room?</p>
              <p>“He can also be rigid and inflexible as well. Certain players hit a bad 
              run of form at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> but Roy refused to make changes even though 
              their performances on the field were deteriorating.”</p>
              <p>Another player said: “Roy likes to surround himself with a certain type 
              of player. Foreign players are less likely to come and smash down the 
              manager’s door complaining about not playing.</p>
              <p>“He doesn’t want troublemakers at the club, he wants players who are 
              happy to sit patiently biding their time waiting to play.</p>
              <p>“If there are problems he will promise you the world, fail to deliver 
              but leave his coaching staff to deal with the fall-out.</p>
              <p>“Personally, I think he has made a big mistake going to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>“Steve McClaren is a good example of what can happen when you step out 
              of your comfort zone. Didn’t he lead <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Middlesbrough</span></abbr> to a major European final? Look what 
              happened to him when he left and took over England. It’s a big gamble.”</p>

              <p>The dis-satisfaction of the players under Ah Ben can be seen during the last quarter of last season.</p>
              <p>It will get worse if he stay for one more season.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Roy, there is no guarantee that he will manage to overturn the situation in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>So, the change will be evident in the results.</p>
              <p>As for expecting Ah Roy to win any cup or league, it is a bit far stretched as he have limited players, funds and experience.</p>
              <p>Start by staying in top four would be a good results by the end of the season.</p>
