            <div class='col-md body'>I would not want Rafa to go. With all due respect to all other opinions, has Rafa done very badly to warrant a sacking? I do not think so. The team has just lost twice all season. Yes, we have drawn too many matches we should have won but shouldnt the players take alot of the blame too?<br><br>Although Torres is firing away, there are still many players who fall into the "WASTEFUL" category. We do have chances to kill games but we are always too wasteful in front of goal. Like the Derby match, we nearly drew it because we wasted so many chances. Like the Wigan game, we drew it again becos we were too wasteful.<br><br>I do not think sacking Rafa is the best thing to do. How many out there can claim to be better than Rafa? Jose? Well he won the Premier League twice but won nothing in Europe with Chelsea. Is he better? Nah, I think he is equally good but not better. Klinsmann? Just because he had a good outing with Germany and everyone is raving his better than Rafa? I should not think so.<br><br>I think the least the american owners could do is to persist with Rafa till the end of this season, give him one more chance to buy the players he need to build a team he wants and if he fails again, its not too late to sack him.<br><br>Dun forget, Alex Ferguson took FOUR seasons before HE won anything with MAN U. Rafa already won the FA CUP, CHAMPS LEAGUE.....is he really that bad?<br><br>Anyway, with all their finance problems, it would not be wise to incur extra burdens by sacking a manager which means:<br><br>you need to 1) pay off his contract which may come to millions because most likely the backroom staff may go too.<br>2) employ a new manager which may come to millions because he will also bring in new backroom staff<br>3) most likely new manager will demand a substantial transfer kitty if he were to take over<br><br></div>
