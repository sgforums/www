            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Rafa Benitez resigned as Valencia coach on Tuesday just weeks after leading them to a first ever domestic and European double and amid furious media speculation that he is poised to join Liverpool.<br>'This had been possibly one of the most difficult decisions I have had to take in my sporting career,' a tearful Benitez told a new conference at Valencia's Paterna training ground.<br><br>'I am not going to continue as Valencia coach. I want to see it as positive that the club has tried to keep me on, but after the events of this season which have undermined my personal morale I have decided to reconsider my situation at the club.<br><br>'With regards to my professional future I'm going to take a few days out to analyse the options that are open to me and I will choose the one that suits me best.'<br><br>Spanish media reported that the 44-year-old, who speaks English, had been offered a five-year deal by premier league club Liverpool who sacked French coach Gerard Houllier last month after six years at the helm.<br><br>Liverpool, though, said they would not be making an immediate announcement about the appointment of a new coach.<br><br>'There will be an announcement about our new manager in two weeks, further to which I do not wish to comment on speculation,' Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry told the club's website.<br><br>Benitez has steered Valencia to two Spanish titles and the UEFA Cup in his three seasons since joining the club from second division Tenerife.<br><br>Valencia president Jaime Orti insisted the club had done all it could to persuade Benitez to remain with the Primera Liga champions and that the coach's decision to leave had come as a shock.<br><br>'Valencia not only did everything possible to ensure Rafa Benitez stayed on for the remaining year of his contract but also tried to get him to extend his deal with the club,' he said.<br><br>'It was his decision, not ours,' said Orti. 'But he felt his cycle at the club had come to an end. There is no better way to end than on a high and we have to congratulate him for that.<br><br>'It took us all by surprise. I don't like the fact that he is leaving and neither will the fans, but this is now the reality.'<br><br>Benitez is known to have had his differences with the board and in particular with the club's sporting director Jesus Garcia Pitarch.<br><br>The two clashed at the start of the season over the control of possible new signings and Benitez expressed his dissatisfaction over the club's failure to reinforce the squad with players he had recommended.<br><br>In-fighting on the club's board and financial problems may also have influenced his decision to quit.<br><br>'I want to thank all the players, the employees at Valencia, the press and especially the fans for their support over the past three years,' said Benitez, who was unable to complete his statement and left the press room in tears without making any further comments.<br><br>Midfielder David Albelda, who is preparing for Euro 2004 with the Spanish national squad, said Benitez would be remembered at the club for his achievements but that the team would look to continue its success without him.<br><br>'He will go down in history for the trophies he has brought to the club and for the work he has done,' he said. 'I knew this might happen but now the players should use the arrival of a new coach as a stimulus. Sometimes a change of coach can be a good thing.'</blockquote>pool next...</div>
