              <p>A goal in each half from Ian Rush and John Aldridge put Kenny Dalglish's side into a commanding lead. <br>  <br>Teddy Sheringham pulled a goal back for the All Stars, but Dalglish put the seal on a fine win for the Legends with a late strike in front of the Kop. <br>  <br>Over 20,000 turned up in support of the game, which was staged in aid of the Marina Dalglish Appeal, with monies raised going towards the building of a new radiotherapy centre at Aintree hospital. <br>  <br>The Legends started the match with many a Kopite's dream attacking trio - Dalglish, Aldridge and Rush. <br>  <br>Meanwhile, for the All Stars - who were managed by Ricky Tomlinson, Kop icon Phil Thompson and Reds' current vice-captain <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/carragher/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jamie Carragher</span></span></a> - Nigel Clough partnered Sheringham in attack, while interim Newcastle United boss Alan Shearer was named amongst the substitutes. <br>  <br>Before kick-off, members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group were introduced to the two teams as they lined-up, as well as the evening's Guest of Honour, and newly crowned Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Steven Gerrard</span></span></a>. <br>  <br>The game got off to a cagey start, but, after five minutes, Rush fired an early effort over the bar. At the other end, Sheringham saw a free-kick deflected over before Alan Hansen out-witted former Coronation Street actor Bradley Walsh on the edge of his own box. <br>  <br>It was a moment of sheer class, but things could have quickly turned pear-shaped for Jockey as he nodded Sheringham's centre narrowly wide of his own goal moments after. <br>  <br>Unsurprisingly, the former Manchester United striker was greeted by a chorus of boos each time he touched the ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Legends nearly opened up their opponents after a quarter of an hour when a slick passing move involving Aldridge and Dalglish almost created a chance for Rush, but the All Stars were able to scramble clear. <br>  <br>Ricky Tomlinson's men made an early change on 19 minutes, with Shearer and Reds fan DJ Spooney replacing Walsh and Clough. <br>  <br>Shearer was afforded a warm reception by the Kop, but, as it did just under two weeks ago when Liverpool demolished Newcastle, the chant of 'You should have stayed on the telly' rang out around the stadium in the direction of the former Match of the Day pundit. <br>  <br>The Legends almost opened the scoring shortly after as Steve McMahon released Aldridge in the area, however his effort was blocked by the on-rushing goalkeeper Bobby Mimms, and Rush was unable to turn the rebound over the line. <br>  <br>Four substitutions were made by the Kop idols as Mark Lawrenson, Michael Thomas, Jan Molby and Peter Beardsley took over from Hansen, Gillespie, Dalglish and McMahon. <br>  <br>Thomas was in the thick of the action instantly and his low cross to the edge of the area saw Ray Houghton drill a snap-volley over the crossbar. <br>  <br>Then, another cross, this time from Staunton, picked out Rush in the centre. Liverpool's all-time record goalscorer hooked the ball into the path of Aldridge, who was only just off target with a first time strike. <br>  <br>The deadlock was finally broken on 28 minutes as Aldridge met Beardsley's searching centre with a powerful downward header. Mimms was able to claw the ball away, but Rush proved his predatory instincts have not diminished over time as he typically arrived dead on cue to tap home from close-range. <br>  <br>The All Stars should have cancelled the goal out seconds later as Spoony swung in an inviting ball that Sheringham somehow managed to head wide from inches out, much to the Kop's pleasure. <br>  <br>Tomlinson and co. brought on singer Craig David and former Everton centre-back Alan Stubbs, who, again, was given a jeer or two from those gathered inside Anfield. <br>  <br>The defender was millimetres from drawing the All Stars level with his first touch, however, with a low drive from the edge of the box. <br>  <br>The rain then began to sweep across the stadium, bringing Beardsley's jinking run to an abrupt halt as he skidded across the turf. <br>  <br>The Geordie playmaker clipped a cheeky chipped effort wide on 38 minutes as Jamie Redknapp and Gary McAllister were introduced to the action by Dalglish, and given a rapturous ovation. <br>  <br>The same could not be said, however, for former Soccer AM presenter Tim Lovejoy and boos soon turned to cheers as Craig David's audacious shot from 25-yards sailed into the Kop. <br>  <br>Profligacy continued to reign for the All Stars and Shearer glanced a header the wrong side of the post when he perhaps should have scored three minutes prior to half-time, before an efficient move presented Lovejoy with a golden opportunity, but he somehow managed to shoot wide with the goal gaping. <br>  <br>Both sides made changes during the interval and, five minutes after the re-start, Redknapp called Mimms into action with a ranging 20-yard strike that the former Blackburn stopper repelled at full-stretch. <br>  <br>The Legends did not have to wait much longer to double their advantage though, as Aldridge nodded home on 53 minutes.</p>
              <p>A sweeping move saw Don Hutchison release McAllister into space on the right hand side of the box. The Scot's cross to the back post was, as you'd expect, expertly delivered and Aldridge turned the ball over the line from three-yards. <br>  <br>Almost instantly, Mike Newell spurned a great chance to pull one back as he side-footed wide from the penalty spot. <br>  <br>Then, Lawrenson cleared Stuart Barlow's effort away from goal following a corner and Craig David drifted an attempt harmlessly wide. <br>  <br>The subs continued to come and comedian John Bishop was handed a run out by Dalglish soon after. It's fair to say the Liverpool fan is used to making large audiences laugh, but he probably never expected to have the entire Kop in stitches. <br>  <br>That he did, though, with a blatant display of simulation, or dive if you prefer, that saw him issued a yellow card by referee Chris Foy. <br>  <br>With twenty minutes remaining on the Anfield scoreboard, Westlife songster Nicky Byrne clipped a long-range free-kick just over before the All Stars pulled a goal back through Sheringham. <br>  <br>Collecting Barlow's pass just inside the box, the ex-England man looped a trademark attempt over Bob Boulder and made a beeline towards the Kop to celebrate. <br>  <br>The cry of 'Stand up for the 96' soon went up around the ground, with even those in the directors' box showing their support. <br>  <br>The legends reunited Dalglish and Rush for the dying moments and the evening was capped in perfect fashion as the former was gifted possession by Stubbs inside the area before slipping the ball into the net at the Kop end. <br>  <br>Echo and the Bunnymen singer Ian McCulloch took to the field at the end for an emotional rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone in tribute to those who lost their lives at the Hillsborough disaster, to bring an memorable occasion to a close. <br>  <br><strong>Liverpool legends:</strong> Paul Harrison, Gary Ablett, Steve Staunton, Gary Gillespie, Ronnie Whelan, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, John Aldridge, Ian Rush, Ray Houghton, Steve McMahon. <br>  <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Jan Molby, Bob Bolder, Mark Lawrenson, Don Hutchison, Nicky Byrne, Peter Beardsley, Jamie Redknapp, Steve McManaman, Gary McAllister, Gethin Jones, Michael Thomas, Dean Lennox Kelly, John Bishop. <br>  <br><strong>All Stars:</strong> Bobby Mimms, Viv Anderson, Steve Hodge, Des Walker, Dave Watson, Paul Bracewell, Trevor Steven, Graham Stuart, Nigel Clough, Teddy Sheringham, Bradley Walsh. <br>  <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Alan Irvine, Mike Newell, Stuart Barlow, Alan Stubbs, Craig David, Tim Lovejoy, Alan Shearer, Spoony, Craig Lennox Kelly, Jonathan Wilkes. <br> </p>
