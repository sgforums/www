              <p>Liverpool forward <span style="color: #000000;">Dirk Kuyt</span> has apologised to the club's fans after the shock home defeat to Blackpool on Sunday, a result that has left <span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span>'s side in the relegation zone.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/1004/dirkkuytliverpoolvblackpool20101004_275x155.gif" border="0" alt="Dirk Kuyt Liverpool v Blackpool" width="275" height="155"><br></div>
              <p>Kuyt played the full 90 minutes as Blackpool stunned the most successful club in English football history,<span style="color: #000000;"> emerging from Anfield with a 2-1 victory</span> courtesy of goals from <span style="color: #000000;">Charlie Adam</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Luke Varney</span>.</p>
              <p>And the Dutchman has admitted that it was one of the worst days he has experienced since moving to Merseyside from Feyenoord in 2006, though he promised that Liverpool's players would do their best to reverse the club's appalling recent fortunes.</p>
              <p>"It was really, really disappointing - probably one of the hardest defeats I've had to take since I've been here and we're sorry for the fans," Kuyt said. "The first thing we have got to do is make sure we start winning games again and then we can begin to take things from there.</p>
              <p>"It is still early days for the manager and we have to keep working but one thing I do know is that we will come back stronger for this experience."</p>
              <p>The upcoming international break means the Reds will have to wait until at least October 17, and a mouth-watering Merseyside derby at Everton, before they have the opportunity to climb up from 18th place, and Kuyt says the wait to play again is an exasperating one.</p>
              <p>"It's frustrating that we have got the international break now because we will have this result hanging over us and everyone in the dressing room wants to put it behind us as quickly as possible," he added. "We know this result has not helped but we just have to try and focus on the spirit we showed in the second half. We have got to make sure we show it in the next game."</p>
