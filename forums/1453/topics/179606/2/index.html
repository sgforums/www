Seriously, they shall focus on getting second and performing better in ECL next season.<br><br>Chelsea has the League Title virtually won. Can't you get what I'm trying to say?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I remember Jose Moan-in-a-hole saying they'll go for the quadruple this season.
