              <h1>Dead and buried: High Court judge crushes Hicks and Gillett to clear way for Red Sox takeover<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden"></div>
              <p><span>Liverpool</span><span>'s
               discredited owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett were on the receiving 
              end of a crushing and humiliating condemnation in the High Court on 
              Thursday as a buy-out by John W Henry edged closer.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Attempts
               by Hicks and Gillett to use a Texas court to block the sale of 
              Liverpool to the Boston Red Sox owner were witheringly dismissed by Mr 
              Justice Floyd. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The 
              club should now be sold to Henry’s New England Sports Ventures for 
              £300million either on Friday or after the weekend, depending on when 
              Hicks and Gillett respond to Thursday’s judgement. On Thursday night 
              they were accused of clinging to power on Merseyside by any means 
              possible.<br></span></p>

              <p><span>David Chivers QC, acting for NESV ,
              said: 'We are the owners now. The (old) owners are, from beyond the
              grave, seeking to exercise with their dead hand a continuing grip on
              this company. That is simply not acceptable.’<br> </span></p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/14/article-1320499-0B9E36AE000005DC-225_306x440.jpg" alt="Lord Grabiner QC (left)" width="306" height="440">

              </div>
              <p><span>Details of Judge Floyd’s decision
              effectively to dismiss a restraining order imposed on the takeover by a
              Dallas court on Wednesday were emailed to Hicks and Gillett’s lawyers
              on Thursday night. </span></p>
              <p><span>They have until 4pm Friday to agree
              and back down. If they do not, they will be held in contempt of court
              and arrested if they enter the country. If the duo leave it until close
              to the deadline, however, the takeover will not go through until after
              the weekend. <br> </span></p>
              <p><span>The latest NESV feel they could
              transfer the money pledged to secure the deal is 3pm. On Thursday
              night, Liverpool sources suggested the case could be resolved by 2pm,
              even though that would require a breakfast court sitting in Texas.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span>Asked if the takeover could yet take place on Friday, Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton said: ‘I hope so.’ <br> </span></p>
              <p><span>Hicks and Gillett were not represented during a four-hour hearing that saw them vilified from all sides. <br> </span></p>
              <p><span>Central to the case was a suggestion
              that, in applying to the court in Texas, the Americans failed properly
              to disclose that they had already had a similar case thrown out in
              London the day before. <br> </span></p>

              <p><span>Counsel for Liverpool, NESV and
              creditors RBS also ridiculed suggestions that members of the club’s
              board had connections to the Lone Star State. <br> </span></p>
              <p><span>‘They concealed this from the Texas
              judge because they were determined to get a second bite of the cherry,’
              said Lord Grabiner QC, acting for Liverpool. ‘It is all poppycock.’</span></p>
              <p><span>On Thursday night, legal opinion
              seemed to side with Liverpool. Thomas Kruse, head of complex commercial
              litigation at the Houston, Texas, offices of USA -wide law firm Baker
              Hostetler, said: ‘A ruling from the High Court is one that the judge
              here would respect.’<br> </span></p>
              <p><span>The deadline to repay £237m owed by
              Liverpool to RBS passes on Friday but the bank are not expected to call
              the debt in and place the club in administration. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, NES V chief John Henry may be at Goodison Park for Sunday’s derby against Everton. <br> </span></p>
              <p><span>Fernando Torres will be fit after
              recovering from a groin injury. Manager Roy Hodgson said: ‘Fernando has
              made a good recovery, as has Paul Konchesky.’<br> </span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson was frustrated by Daniel
              Agger’s latest injury, for Denmark against Cyprus. The centre-back will
              miss the derby and Hodgson said: ‘Agger made a miraculous recovery to
              play for Denmark, where he got injured again. I don’t know what the
              state of play is for him yet.’ </span></p>
