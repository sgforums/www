              Rafael Benitez today insisted Lucas has his "100 per cent support" as the young midfielder reflects on the most difficult week of his career.  
              After conceding the penalty which gifted Wigan a point at the JJB Stadium, the 22-year old was sent off for two bookable offences against Everton in midweek, ruling him out of today's trip to Portsmouth. 
                
              Despite enduring a torrid few days in his Anfield career, Lucas retains the full backing of his manager. 
                
              "We will miss him. We have some problems and he is a player who could have been really important for us," said Benitez. 
                
              "I can't speak for every single fan, but every member of staff knows he is a very good player and his teammates know he is a good player. 
                
              "Against Wigan, for me, Lucas was the best player on the pitch. Then the other day at Everton he was also playing well and the ref made three mistakes. He gave one foul against him which wasn't, showed one yellow card which was wrong - and then the second yellow could be, but the player went over easily. 
                
              "I will support Lucas 100 per cent, always. He is a fantastic player, he is a nice boy and a very good professional. He has quality, he is learning and is improving all the time. 
                
              "It is not difficult for me to say that I support him 100 per cent."

              <p>i think all of you are missing the point, he is purely doing the right thing as a supervisor/ boss to the players and pledging support to them, just as he would expect of his players.</p>
              <p>this is a common situation in any work situation; if you are a people manager, you will want to show support to your subordinates, especially externally. in return, you  would expect that he/she will give the best to you everytime, regardless his/her talent level. it is also making the best use of any resources. no one is perfect. if there is any area that is lacking, the solution is to plug the gap and improve. this should be the way until there is no meaningful solution left, as in the case of keane.</p>
              <p>as a player/worker/subordinate, you would also appreciate the show of support from your boss becos it will only make you want to work harder so as not to disappoint your supervisor/boss. imagine you have a boss who criticise your fault publically. not only will you be demoralized, your productivity level drop and it will affect the team in general.</p>
              <p>so, there is no surprise rafa pledge his support to lucas. but it is not blind support. if lucas is surplus requirement and does not fit into the grander scheme of things, lucas will make way, amicably.</p>
              <p>however, if he tries hard and have great work attitude, one cannot fault him.</p>
              <p>good managers (not just football) protect, support and help their subordinate improve and so they can give their best.</p>
              <p>this is pretty basic stuff.</p>
