            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We're starting to panic, says Curbishley</span></strong></span><br><br>LONDON, (AFP) - <span style="color: red;">West Ham manager Alan Curbishley admitted his players are starting to panic as their season goes from bad to worse.<br><br>Curbishley's side crashed out of the FA Cup on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat by Watford at Upton Park that raised questions about their ability to avoid relegation from the Premiership.<br><br>West Ham are currently third bottom of the table and will be destined for the drop if they reproduce many more displays as poor as the one that handed struggling Watford a place in the fifth round.<br><br>Anthony McNamee's 42nd minute overhead kick clinched the win for Watford and Curbishley conceded the presure of West Ham's predicament has started to affect his players.<br><br>"We are frustrated and only results can change that," Curbishley said.<br><br>"We are in a position now where if we go 1-0 up we start to panic and if we go 1-0 down we start to panic.<br><br>"I don't think the season is slipping away but we are out of the cup and we desperately need some wins."<br><br>Liverpool visit Upton Park on Tuesday and Curbishley is already focusing on a crucial match for both clubs.<br><br>He said: "They tried their hardest but it is a confidence situation. You need the confidence for the results, but the results bring a bit of confidence.<br><br>"We move on and I've got to be thinking about the Liverpool game on Tuesday night."<br><br>West Ham were jeered off the pitch by furious fans at full-time, but Curbishley told them they will have to lower their expectations.<br><br>"The last few weeks have been tough for us," he said. "Everyone is in a difficult time at the moment and the frustration is there for everyone to see.<br><br>"What West Ham did last year, the expectations of last year, are causing us a problem. The second year in the Premiership is always difficult.<br><br>"The expectations now for this season are to stay up. I got here and we were third from bottom and we are third from bottom now.<br><br>"The fans have got to appreciate the injuries we have got. It is not the side from last year."<br><br>As if another dismal defeat wasn't bad enough for Curbishley he also had to suffer the misery of watching new signing Lucas Neill limp out of the action three minutes into the second half.<br><br>The Australian defender, who was making his debut after his 1.5 million pounds move from Blackburn, had sustained an ankle injury that could rule him out of Tuesday's clash against Liverpool.<br><br>Watford boss Adrian Boothroyd believes his side's second win in a week is further proof that they can still climb off the bottom of the Premiership and avoid relegation.<br><br>Success at West Ham followed a home league win against Blackburn and Boothroyd knows the benefit of a cup run could be improved morale for the fight for Premiership survival.<br><br>Boothroyd said: "You have got to ask the question, would you prefer a cup run or three points?<br><br>"Both is the answer. We have only done half a job and we must come and put in as good a performance, if not better, next time.<br><br>"This win gives us a big lift. We have not won as consistently as we would have liked and doubts might creep in to one or two individuals."<br><br></span><br></div>
