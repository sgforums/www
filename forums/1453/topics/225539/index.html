            <div class='col-md body'>A word from Rafa:<br><br><blockquote><strong>RAFA: WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE</strong><br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez is already licking his lips in anticipation of facing Barcelona in the last sixteen of the Champions League early next year.<br>Benitez admits today's draw in Nyon could have been kinder to his side, but he is confident his players will be fully prepared to face the defending champions when the games come around.<br><br>He told Liverpoolfc.tv: "We know they are a good team. At the moment they are playing in Japan in the World Club Championships and everybody is saying really good things about them.<br><br>"They won the Champions League last season and so it is a difficult draw for us but we have two months to prepare for these games and we have nothing to lose.<br><br>"Everybody says Barcelona are one of the best sides in the world so we have to upset the situation. We have to be mentally ready to play against very good players.<br><br>"It is too soon to start talking about individual battles. We are looking forward to the games and we will play them with confidence.<br><br>"I have experience of playing at the Nou Camp with Valencia and we did quite well there. Hopefully we'll do well again."<br><br>Liverpool will travel to Spain for the first leg before welcoming Barcelona to Merseyside two weeks later and Benitez believes playing the second leg at a packed Anfield could work to his side's advantage.<br><br>"The main thing for us is we know we'll play the second game at Anfield. This could be an important factor for us," he added.<br><br>"It's an amazing atmosphere in our stadium when we play in Europe, and we know how good our fans are at putting pressure on other teams.<br><br>"But I know it will be the first game which can make things possible for us. Last season we paid because we lost a late goal in Benfica and that cost us in the second leg."</blockquote>Liverpoolfc.tv.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we won the Champions League two seasons ago, we beat Juventus, Chelsea and AC Milan.  AC Milan being the defending champions that year.  All Liverpool fans proudly say this to highlight that we deserved to be champions of Europe with these victories against big teams.<br><br>Last season we were defending champions.  We were full of confidence with the easiest draw again Benfica, were favoured to progress to the next round, but got knocked out instead.<br><br>The whole idea of the Champions League is to play against the big teams of Europe so I am happy with the draw.  It doesn't get any bigger than this.  If Liverpool were to win the Champions League again, I would rather see them beating the big teams along the way.  If we were to get knocked out, I would also rather we lose to Barca than Benfica!  So this is game on for me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

They lifted two titles and won twice in Barcelona in three games.<br><br>Benitez warned: "Over the last six or eight years Valencia have a good record against them, especially in the Nou Camp.<br><br>"The scores have usually gone in Valencia's favour and they were something of a bogey team for them.

Lyon are the most difficult today," said Messi. "I expect an open game because the English play without defensive caution and with a style similar to Barcelona.<br><br>"Sincerely, I believe Liverpool are worried about playing against us because we are the champions of Europe and that strikes fear in any rivals.<br><br>"I desire to travel to Liverpool with much work done and holding an advantage to qualify for the next round.<br><br>"A 2-0 or 3-0 score will be perfect for Barca.<br><br>"Always, we need to not concede a goal in Camp Nou to avoid problems at Anfield."<br><br>The Argentinean admits having a Spanish contingent could work in Liverpool's favour.<br><br>He said: "The Reds are a peculiar team.

Cameroon are scheduled to play their next African Nations Cup qualifying game against Liberia in March.<br><br>Eto'o injured his right knee during Barcelona's Champions League match against Werder Bremen last September.<br><br>A Barcelona doctor initially estimated the injury would keep him out for two to three months but after an operation he extended the estimate to five months.<br><br>Eto'o said: 'I am determined to be the leading scorer this season in Spain. The gap between me and others is not much. With hard work, personal sacrifice, I can catch up. I will catch up.'<br><br>He has four league goals, 10 behind leader Frederic Kanoute of Sevilla.<br><br>Eto'o was voted African Footballer of the Year three times in a row and is in line for an unprecedented fourth successive award after being named as a finalist for 2006. </span></div>
