            <div class='col-md body'>With Gerrard on the wings, thecentre of the park loses it's dynamitism and thrust when the lads are poised for attack. Clearly, we have seen some pretty neat passes from Alonso but it's not his game to be more of a physical player.<br><br>It looks pretty clear to me that Gerrard and Alonso will make a dynamic pair in the center of the park than the Hamann and Alonso pairing we saw yesterday. Thou Alonso was positioned on the right wing but soon we saw him drifted from the right to center and he started making neat passes from the center.<br><br>It's probably right to say that we still need a proper right winger to add into the squad.</div>

I seriously lost count.<br><br>If I were to compare Arsenal and Liverpool.. I felt like when ever Arsenal goes forward with the ball it gets me up on the edge of my seat cos I goal is likely or at least the keeper will have to make a save... when liverpool goes forward... sad to say... a lost of possession or an off target shot is what I see.<br><br>Nevertheless, its a team in the building... still a lot to do to gel the team together and hopefully... a much exciting Liverpool can been seen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I dun miss much of Murphy. A industrious player perhaps but when it comes to the final pass to the attacking third... it end up somewhere in the park.<br><br>I gave credit to Alonso and Garcia cos I tght they did pretty decent on their very first match. The match was pretty much on the physical side with The Bolton players throwing the dirt most of the time. Hyypia for example got the first blow.<br><br>Alonso must had realized that he needs to pass the ball much faster cos the game is definitely more pacy than la liga.<br><br>Overall, it's not easy for the new players to come in and to settle in so easily. That's quite a bit of team changes against Bolton and surely they knew they have to maintain shape so players get organise and know their task ahead.<br><br>Looks like for the fist Season with Bennie in charge, a Top three placing and a Champions League placing is top of LFC's priority. Realistically, to beat the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea is still a distant away.</div>

He had just get the season started !<br><br>It's true from the way we seen from the play , Liverpool is playing only their 60% potential , without the other 40% , we are not in the position to judge Liverpool now .<br><br>Later la , give them a chance to gel , the team needs some time to grip , three games is not enuf , that's for sure !<br><br>We just need a <strong>BIG</strong> win to kick start our winning habit !<br><br>Let's start off with WBA next game !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been disappointed for so long, i am starting to get immuned to Liverpool losing. I found a way to sooth my anger every time they fail to win. I just bet against them, if they win i happy, if they lose or fail to overcome the asian handicap, i get paid! And believe me i have been making money for the past few seasons.</div>
