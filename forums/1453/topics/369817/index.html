              <p>Liverpool have moved to quash rumours that an agreement has been reached with Real Madrid for Xabi Alonso after the midfielder was left out of the side that drew 1-1 with Thailand at the start of the club's pre-season tour of the Far East.<br><br>A club spokesman said: "Xabi is with us in Singapore, and will train with the rest of the squad. He was injured ahead of the Thailand game, people can say what they like about that. There has been no deal agreed with anyone for his transfer to anyone."<br><br>The 28-year-old took part in training yesterday at Singapore's National Stadium. Liverpool insist his absence against Thailand was due to an ankle injury.</p>

              <p>It's really nice Rafa played the game as we wanted .... £30m , take it or leave it .</p>
              <p>It's true we dun want him to leave , he has a contract in Liverpool for another couple of years , fulfill it .</p>
              <p>Even if Alonso submitted a transfer request , Real still must table us a good offer , or Alonso will stay with us , even on the bench until he completed his contract with LFC .</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Liverpool have reached an agreement to sell midfielder Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid, subject to a medical.</strong></p>
              <p class="first">The fee for the Spanish international is reported to be<span style="color: #ff0000;"> in the region of £30m</span> but Liverpool said the terms of the deal would remain confidential.</p>
              <p class="first">The 27-year-old joined Liverpool from Real Sociedad in August 2004.</p>
              <p class="first">A statement on Real's website confirmed the news and added that Alonso will arrive in Madrid on Wednesday "to undergo the required medical".</p>
              <p class="first">If the deal goes through Alonso will become the second Liverpool player to join the Spanish giants after full-back Alvaro Arbeloa's switch to the Bernabeu last week.</p>
              <p class="first">Real, under the guidance of returning president Florentino Perez, have embarked on an ambitious rebuilding programme this summer and Alonso's arrival will push their spending beyond the £200m mark.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo arrived from Manchester United in a world record £80m deal, Brazilian playmaker Kaka was bought from AC Milan for £56m and they have also spent £30m to sign France striker Karim Benzema from Lyon.</p>
              <p>In addition defender Raul Albiol was signed from Valencia as Real looked to build a squad capable of challenging for honours at both home and abroad.</p>
              <p>Rivals Barcelona completed a clean-sweep of domestic trophies in Spain last season, while Real have failed to progress beyond the last 16 of the Champions League for the past five seasons.</p>
              <p>When the deal for Alonso is completed it will bring to an end Real's long pursuit of the Spanish international.</p>
              <p>In July Real sporting director Miguel Pardeza was quoted as saying "Madrid don't discard an option until it is truly impossible", after reports suggested Liverpool wanted £50m for the midfielder.</p>
              <p>It is believed Real returned with an offer of £30m that could rise to £34m depending on Alonso's success in Spain.</p>
              <p>He will join former Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek at the Bernabeu, leaving only Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher from Liverpool's 18-man squad that won the Champions League in 2005.</p>
              <p>Alonso and Dudek were both part of the side that dramatically fought back from 3-0 down against AC Milan to win the trophy in a penalty shoot-out, Alonso scoring Liverpool's third and equalising goal on 59 minutes.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez had tried to sell the Spanish international last summer as he looked to fund a move for midfielder Gareth Barry from Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>However, Alonso did not want to move and a deal for Barry eventually fell through, with Alonso going on to play a key role as Liverpool finished second in the Premier League.</p>
