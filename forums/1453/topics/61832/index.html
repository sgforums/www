            <div class='col-md body'>Something fresh out of planetfootball.com.<br><br>Rivaldo has revealed that he is undergoing discussions with LFC in a possible move to Anfield over the New Year. LFC Official site on the other hand has played down the speculations.<br><br>Given his skills, visions and technique on the ball, can he tahan the playing style of the EPL... noting the fact that his 31 now. But with his playing skills, LFC will definitely improved in the attacking area. But the problem is that he is one player who is unlikely to track back and help out in the defensive duties when called upon.<br><br>Question is, will the Samba star really sign for the Reds and likely to accept a lower wages in a effort to play more football?</div>

Get what I mean here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Remember Gary McAllister ? He steadied the boat when the team is shaking ! And score some crucial goals and create some magical free-kicks that won us a little bit of consolations that season ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Rivaldo must reduce his demand , to something like 20,000 -30,000 pounds a week ! That should be alright for Liverpool !<br>Even if he fail to deliver , it's alright too ! 'Cos he's not the first to flop and will not be the last !<br><br>Apparently , there's a number of <strong>BIG NAMES</strong> currently taking salary and relax one corner , so , it's alright if he failed !<br>At least Liverpool had tried something risky !<br><br><strong>No risk no gain la , for short ! </strong><br><br>Tactically , our team need someone that is better than Smicer and Murphy ! Both this player  played the role of a supporting midfielder behind the striker , so do Rivaldo ! The difference ? This Samba fella can score goals from nowhere !<br><br>Cheers !</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the opinion the Bear and Poolman.<br><br>Personally, I dun think he would happily sit at the bench and see the first eleven winning games w/o him. I'm pretty sure he would prove himself and the critics that he still has the hunger to win trophies.<br><br>If he does wanna go EPL, LFC is the club to go to. So does LFC. We need his experience, visions and skills to win bigger things. We sorely missed the creativity from the centre. And to carve out chances for the strikers to score.<br><br>That is, if he can lower his wage demands.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think Rivaldo will want to lower his wage. If Liverpool can give what he want, he will definitely become a pool legend and one of the fan favourite. Rivaldo possess star quality but he must change his KPKB attitude.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Will see how persuasive GH is to bring him to Anfield despite the potentially massive wages he demands.<br><br>Besides being speculative abt his revelation with the Reds, he'll definitely bring life to the often dour in the centre of things. Gerrard/Hamann  in the middle wif Rivaldo operating just behind the strikers... exciting!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=red][size=large]Rivaldo has been getting quite sick with life at Milan and in fact , he's the one that makes the approach to a switch to Anfield , this could turn out as well , be a "bargaining" point for GH !<br><br>Second point is , at 31 , although on a free , his peak seemed to be over , he can't demand too much like when he's 27 , right ?<br><br>The plus point is , a point to prove everybody wrong seems to be his chief motivation to come to Anfield ! And it not a bad thing for Liverpool too !<br><br>A special guts tell me he could be a "Cantona" for Liverpool  ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah liu..not another ah bei to liverpool. I thought GH said Rivaldo is not one for the future. If he do come, it will make Liverpool looks like as if we are second choice club.<br><br>With his wage, I think can invest in young player like Reyes and Rafael Van Der Vaart (dun know spell correctly). Rafael is extremely good, he's in action tonite against Scotland, go watch him. He's suppose to be a target by of GH but he is darn costly.<br><br>If Owen goes (most probably), the money can be used to but them lah..but if Rivaldo comes alone and settle in Liverpool as a bed of roses for retirement then he spoils all the fun liao...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's good if Rivaldo decides to come to Liverpool.It won't be difficult for Rivaldo to fit into the starting lineup.Rivaldo over Heskey anyday.Or else he can fit in behind the 2 strikers.<br><br>Question should be whether or not GH wants him at Anfield.</div>
