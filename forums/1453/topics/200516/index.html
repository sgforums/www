            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>KOPTALK</strong></span> understands that Liverpool have made an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">official approach</span> to Juventus to discuss the availability of <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">David Trezeguet.</span></strong><br><br>Several Juve players have been linked with the Reds but Trezeguet is the main one that Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez would like to bring in. Sadly though, the club are initially only looking at loan deals due to a lack of finances at the club.<br><br>Chief executive Rick Parry is rumoured to have already been in Italy recently and there's speculation that he could fly over there again later in the week.<br><br>As things currently stand, Rafa would like to sign at least two players that many fans would class as 'big'. Then we're talking one or two 'squad additions'.<br><br>We know that the boss wants Daniel Alves but the board are currently refusing to sanction an increased offer for the player.  Dirk Kuyt is another confirmed target but Feyenoord are reportedly asking for a sizeable fee.<br><br>Because of these setbacks, the boss is now looking for some Italian bargains and loan deals are looking the most likely option.<br><br>It is claimed that the manager only has around Â£10million left to spend in the market. Whether or not that is true though we simply do not know.<br><br>What we do know is that there can be dramatic changes where money is involved so we advise you to wait and see what happens rather than feeling a bit down when you hear about the likes of Manchester United and Spurs throwing millions around.<br><br>Considering various Italian raids make sense but if we're only looking at a quick fix, some fans are likely to be concerned.<br><br>Long-term rather than short-term please .<br><br><img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/36/36_1_46.gif"></div>

That will be in weeks rather than months," said Parry. "Every year is important and we are happy with who we have brought in but we haven't finished yet."<br><br></div>
