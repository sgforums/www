              <p>According to the surgeon treating <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></span></a>, the Liverpool striker could recover from his latest knee problem in as little as a week, calming fears he could miss the remainder of the season for his club and Spain's World Cup campaign.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0413/fernandotorres20100407train_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Fernando Torres " width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p>Torres was unable to play in Liverpool's 0-0 draw with Fulham at the weekend and has travelled to Barcelona for treatment, but Dr Ramon Cugat has delivered a positive update on the fitness of Liverpool's top scorer.</p>
              <p>Torres was absent for a month in January due to his previous knee injury and has been treated by Cugat in the past for hamstring problems. He has only been able to start 20 of 34 league games, scoring 18 times.</p>
              <p>"The problem is not serious but he needs to stop and rest to avoid more risk because it's the same knee on which he had surgery in January," Dr Cugat told the <em>Liverpool Echo</em>.</p>
              <p>"But in normal circumstances, he could be ready to play next week, depending on how it settles down. The decision is now up to Liverpool's medical staff and the manager."</p>
              <p>Liverpool are yet to confirm their own prognosis, with a club statement on Monday reading: "Fernando Torres was examined by a knee specialist this afternoon in Spain. He received treatment and will continue to do so over the next few days, with the injury being reassessed later this week."</p>
              <p>If Cugat's best-case scenario proves to be correct then Torres could even feature on Monday night when Liverpool play West Ham in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Liverpool then face his former club Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals of the Europa League, with the first leg coming at Vicente Calderon on April 22.</p>
              <p>Injury forced Torres to miss both Champions League games against Atleti in the 2008-09 season and he will be desperate to play a part against the club where he is still idolised after becoming their youngest ever player and captain.</p>
