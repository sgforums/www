              <p>good to see that the reds not struggling against smaller team, well, almost. they were nervous till benayoun get the engine running.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, redknapp still doesnt have the balls to win his good friend, even when they were down to ten men. how sweet of him.</p>

              <p>When they gets into the attacking rhythm , very difficult to contain .</p>
              <p>The best is to control the match , keep possessions , slow the pace down .</p>

              <p><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/benayoun/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Yossi Benayoun</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> believes his match-winning display in Saturday's 4-0 rout of Burnley was his best in a red shirt.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Israeli star netted a superb hat-trick to lead Rafael Benitez's men to their third win of the new campaign and later admitted it was the highlight of his Reds career so far. <br>  <br>"It was a good day for me and it was great to score three goals," he said. "But the most important thing is the three points. We played a lot of good football at times and won the match - that is more important to me than scoring goals." <br>  <br>With </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/mascherano/"><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> out injured, Benayoun was given a more offensive role just off the striker, a position he feels brought out the best in him. <br>  <br>"I started on the right but Rafa told me to move around and try and get in between the lines," he said. "Every time I did that I found space so I could turn and go forward. <br>  <br>"I was lucky because the rest of the team provided me with good passes to score. <br>  <br>"It was the perfect day for me." <br>  <br>The win over Owen Coyle's side means Liverpool have now won back-to-back Barclays Premier League matches for the first time this season. <br>Benayoun acknowledges that the Reds were not at their best during the opening month of the campaign but is hopeful they are now back on the right track. <br>  <br>"We didn't start the season too well," he said. "We didn't expect to lose two matches so early on, but I think the international break came at the right time for us. <br>  <br>"We came back stronger and hopefully we will now go on a winning run and boost our confidence even more." <br>  <br>Asked what he thought about those who have already written off Liverpool's title chances, he added: "Maybe it's better for us. <br>  <br>"There will be less pressure. We can build our confidence slowly and when we win games like this, I think everyone can see we have the quality to be up there in the race. <br>  <br>"We need to take it a game at a time and hopefully at the end of the season we will be up there."</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafa Benitez labelled </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/benayoun/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Yossi Benayoun</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> an example to the rest of his squad after the Israeli struck a hat-trick to sink Burnley on Saturday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dirk Kuyt was the other scorer in a deserved 4-0 win - but it was Benayoun who Benitez singled out as an example of how those on the fringes can go on to play a crucial role. <br>  <br>The No.15 spent the first half of last season on the peripheries but is now a central figure at Anfield. <br>  <br>Benitez said: "We know he's a player with quality. We have seen how good he is coming from the bench and we were talking about whether he could start or not. <br>  <br>"Today he was very, very good and his movement was fantastic for the team. <br>  <br>"During the internationals I was talking with some players about how they could change things, and it was just to work hard. <br>  <br>"Yossi was away but he wanted to play, and when a player wants to play it's very easy: you have to prove these things in every training session and in a game if you get the opportunity. <br>  <br>"Yossi is someone with experience and he knows the best way to fight for your position is doing something well on the pitch." <br>  <br>Despite Benayoun walking away with the match ball, Benitez believes another player was key to the 4-0 victory. <br>  <br>"Lucas supported and managed in the middle and kept everyone else going forward," said the Spaniard. <br>  <br>"For me he was the key player today. We can talk about Yossi but it was thanks to Lucas. One thing everyone told me when I came here was that if you work hard the fans are with you. <br>  <br>"They could see again today that Lucas is a worker who has quality. He can challenge in the air, tackle and pass the ball. <br>  <br>"He worked so hard in different positions and allowed the other players more freedom. For me he was a very important player for us today." <br>  <br>On why </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/mascherano/"><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> was not in the squad, Benitez revealed the midfielder was still in South America after representing Argentina this week. <br>  <br>He explained: "Mascherano was not available. He still hasn't arrived. He is coming back on Sunday. He had some problems, and our doctor was talking to their doctor. <br>  <br>"Now I think he's okay but he's coming back later because he had to do some tests over there. <br>  <br>"Don't be worried, it's not serious!" <br>  <br>Burnley boss Owen Coyle reserved his praise for </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, who operated in a deeper role alongside Lucas. <br>  <br>"Steven Gerrard could play at right-back and still be effective because he is a world-class player," said Coyle. <br>  <br>"You see it on the international stage and the club stage every week. He's a real Liverpool player, I would say - though I would prefer it if he did play at right-back!"</span></p>
