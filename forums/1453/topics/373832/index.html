              <p>Rafa Benitez says Liverpool should be able to welcome back Fabio Aurelio to the first-team squad for the home clash with Burnley.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian has missed the start of the new season after suffering a knee problem during the summer, but the left-back is expected to be back in contention for a start for the visit of the Clarets.</p>
              <p>The international break has come at a good time for Aurelio and Benitez is delighted at the prospect of his squad being strengthened with players returning from injury.</p>
              <p>The Reds boss revealed: “Fabio is back training and playing football.</p>
              <p>“After the end of the international break I don’t think he will have any problems and he will be able to be involved in normal training sessions and be in the squad.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Benitez says Daniel Agger is walking again after his back operation and that Nabil El Zhar’s knee injury is also improving so that is ‘very positive’.</p>

              <p><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/kuyt/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Dirk Kuyt</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> insists he and his teammates are not losing any sleep over the league table just yet - claiming every top four side will have a blip at some stage this season.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Reds head into the international break six points behind pace-setters Chelsea after two defeats in their opening four games. <br>  <br>However, Kuyt believes it is far too early to start looking at the table. <br>  <br>He said: "At the moment it's not important to look at where teams like Chelsea, Man United and Arsenal are because we've got to think about ourselves. That is the priority and I'm sure if we keep winning games, we'll be up there soon. <br>  <br>"We will see where we are in a couple of months. Chelsea are a top side. We knew that at the start of the season and we've seen that so far. But every team will struggle this season. We have to focus on ourselves and keep winning our own games. <br>  <br>"It will be more interesting if there are more teams up there, taking points off each other, challenging the top four positions. Spurs have spent a lot of money and had a really good start. Manchester City are up there and will take points off teams." <br>  <br>Liverpool got back to winning ways at the Reebok on Saturday with a 3-2 victory over Bolton. <br>  <br>Kuyt knows the challenge now is to create momentum once the international players return. <br>  <br>"Everyone knows we have lost two games early in the season and the only medicine there is to put that right is to win games," he said. <br>  <br>"We worked hard against Bolton and came back twice to win. Now we have to keep working hard in our next game. This is a really positive result for us. We have to take this win into the next game because we want to show we are a top team and belong at the top of the Premier League." <br>  <br>The Reds had </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> to thank for sealing the three points with a sweetly-struck volley late in the game. <br>  <br>"We fight for each other," added Kuyt. "We've got some world-class quality with the likes of </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and Stevie so we know if we work hard we will always be up there. <br>  <br>"Stevie's winning goal against Bolton showed why he's the captain and, for me, the best midfielder in the world. Everybody expects that from him. <br>  <br>"If the team is in a difficult position, we expect something from him. He brings something special to the team. We're all really happy to have him."</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Reds finished as runners-up last season after drawing 11 of their 38 matches and the Spaniard feels they may have to accept defeat on a more regular basis if it means they can turn some of those draws into victories. <br>  <br>"People say we have lost as many games this season as we did in the whole of last season. But last season our biggest problem was drawing games," he told LFC Magazine. <br>  <br>"Those draws meant that we could have drawn the two games, went the season unbeaten in the league, but still not won it. I would rather have lost six of those 11 games and won the other five. Then we'd have finished level on points with United and maybe have won it on goal difference. <br>  <br>"People can point to defeats, but I feel it's draws that make it more difficult. One thing that became clear to everyone at the club before this season started was that we must take more risks if we want to win the league. Even if it means losing a few more games, particularly at home. <br>  <br>"In the short-term that may disappoint a few people but in the long term, it's better to cut out the draws. <br>  <br>"In a league where there is three points for a win, for teams trying to win the title, it's definitely draws that make it more difficult."</span></p>

              <p><strong>Sammy Lee is confident Liverpool will soon be firing on all cylinders despite enduring a 'mixed start' to the new campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez's side have collected six points from their opening four matches of the campaign, having both won and lost twice. <br>  <br>However, Lee feels with the season still in its infancy, it would be unwise for anyone to be writing off Liverpool's title challenge. <br>  <br>"We knew it was always going to be a difficult start with the games we had," the Reds' assistant manager told Liverpoolfc.tv. <br>  <br>"I think you'd have to say it's been a mixed start - the results tell you that with two wins and two losses. <br>  <br>"But we've said on many occasions there are no easy games because the Premier League is one of, if not the, most difficult leagues in the world. <br>  <br>"If there is an easy fixture out there then you'll have to point it out to me because I haven't seen one yet. <br>  <br>"We're fully prepared for that and know what to expect, and we hope everybody else does too. <br>  <br>"We know full well that it is a long campaign and it is important that nobody gets carried away or too down about any given moment. We'll look to keep improving and I'm sure we'll do that because we have a fantastic squad." <br>  <br>After an opening day setback at Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool bounced back with a resounding 4-0 success over Stoke City at home – but the recent Anfield defeat to Aston Villa prompted Benitez to call for his players to take more responsibility on the pitch. <br>  <br>Lee said: "A lot has been made of what was said, sometimes taken out of context, but what Rafa said was that we all have to take responsibility. <br>  <br>"We all have to look at ourselves and make sure that when we have a bad result we analyse it and try and put it right. <br>  <br>"One thing about this football club is that we never get carried away - we're always looking at our own strengths and weaknesses to make sure we can improve." <br>  <br>The manager's words had the desired effect as Liverpool responded in emphatic fashion with a 3-2 triumph over Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium on Saturday to ensure they entered into the two-week international break on a positive note. <br>  <br>"Bolton is never an easy place to go to, as has been proven over the years, so to get a win there was excellent," added Lee. "A win at anytime is good, but particularly going into a lengthy break."</p>

              <p>Rafa Benitez says Liverpool should be able to welcome back Fabio Aurelio to the first-team squad for the home clash with Burnley.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian has missed the start of the new season after suffering a knee problem during the summer, but the left-back is expected to be back in contention for a start for the visit of the Clarets.</p>
              <p>The international break has come at a good time for Aurelio and Benitez is delighted at the prospect of his squad being strengthened with players returning from injury.</p>
              <p>The Reds boss revealed: “Fabio is back training and playing football.</p>
              <p>“After the end of the international break I don’t think he will have any problems and he will be able to be involved in normal training sessions and be in the squad.”</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Benitez says Daniel Agger is walking again after his back operation and that Nabil El Zhar’s knee injury is also improving so that is ‘very positive’.</p>

              <p><strong>Sammy Lee today paid tribute to<span style="color: #000000;"> </span></strong><a class="red" href="/team/squad/johnson/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> following the defender's excellent start to his Liverpool career. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has made a seamless transition from Portsmouth to the Reds - helping himself to two goals from his right-back position in four appearances. <br>  <br>"Glen is a quality player in a quality team and I think he has added something to us," Lee told Liverpoolfc.tv. <br>  <br>"What we try to do in each and every area and department is recruit quality and we feel we have done with Glen. <br>  <br>"He has come here and has been willing to listen and learn. For someone who is already an established England international that's great and long may it continue." <br>  <br><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, Lee believes the impending return of </span><a class="red" href="/team/squad/aurelio/"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Aurelio</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> to full fitness will be like a 'new signing' for Liverpool. <br>  <br>The Brazilian full-back recently resumed training at Melwood</span> after missing the start of the 2009-10 campaign due to a knee injury he sustained over the course of the summer. <br>  <br>"Fabio will be like a new signing for us," said the Reds' assistant manager. <br>  <br>"He wasn't available for pre-season, but he's coming back and hopefully we'll have him chomping at the bit and competing for a place very shortly. <br>  <br>"Any team likes to have all of their players available. That brings its own problems of course because you have to pick a team from them, but we would prefer to have that problem than a situation where players are out injured <br>  <br>"Rafa has said on many occasions he is confident with the squad we have and we feel we can mount a challenge on all fronts."</p>

              <p><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/aurelio/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Aurelio</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> is hoping to give Rafa Benitez a major boost by proving his fitness and returning to the squad in time for Saturday's Anfield meeting with Burnley. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The left-back has been on the treatment table since injuring his knee while in his native Brazil during the close season, but he has worked hard at Melwood during the international break to get himself back to fitness. <br>  <br>"I'm feeling good and I am working hard to try and get back into the squad for Saturday," Aurelio told Liverpoolfc.tv. <br>  <br>"The international break came at a good time for me because I've been able to work hard and not miss too many more games. I'm going to play in a practice game on Thursday and I hope to prove my fitness and be involved against Burnley. <br>  <br>"I've been training for two or three weeks now and I can't wait to get back." <br>  <br>The knee injury couldn't have come at a worse time for Aurelio as it happened on a family holiday back in his homeland. <br>  <br>"I was with my brother in law and some friends playing football and joking around and suddenly I felt something strange in my knee," he explained. <br>  <br>"Straight away I called my old team Sao Paulo and they examined the knee and found there was a cartilage injury. <br>  <br>"I then phoned Liverpool and spoke to the boss and Dr Waller and he gave me permission to get the knee operated on. The Doctor was in full contact with their medical team. <br>  <br>"It wasn't good news because it was my holiday and I spent the rest of the time recovering. <br>  <br>"The good thing is it feels fine now and I am now back and hoping to help the team. I played in a practice game last week and I felt good." <br>  <br>In his absence, Argentine youngster </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/insua/"><span style="color: #000000;">Emiliano Insua</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> has taken the left-back berth - and Aurelio knows he faces tough competition for a place in the team. <br>  <br>"He is playing really well and he was good last season as well so he has a lot of confidence," said Aurelio. <br>  <br>"Seeing how well he is doing is not a surprise to me or my teammates, as working with him every day you can see he is a player with quality and can do a very good job for the team. <br>  <br>"We have three left-backs with Emiliano, myself and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/dossena/"><span style="color: #000000;">Andrea Dossena</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> so we all have to keep working hard and make it a difficult decision for the manager. I think this is very good for the team because if everyone is working hard then the team will win more games." <br>  <br>Last season Rafael Benitez deployed Aurelio in central midfield during a 3-2 win at Portsmouth - a game in which he scored - and it's a position the No.12 also played for the manager during their time at Valencia. <br>  <br>He said: "I enjoyed that experience but it wasn't new to me. If the manager wants to use me in different positions then I've got to be ready to show him that I can do my best for the team at all times." <br>  <br>Burnley are Liverpool's next opponents and will arrive at Anfield on Saturday having already beaten Manchester United and Everton this campaign. <br>  <br>Last season, Liverpool dropped points at home against promoted sides Stoke City and Hull City, but Aurelio insists lessons have been learned ahead of the clash. <br>  <br>"We have to learn from the mistakes last season at home that cost us points," he said. <br>  <br>"Hopefully that won't be the case this season and we can get the three points which is very important for us. <br>  <br>"Burnley have surprised everyone and have done really well. We know it will be a hard game because when teams come here they play deep and narrow and it's always difficult to break them down. <br>  <br>"We have to work hard and score as soon as we can and take control of the game. We are playing at home and we have to show we are stronger than them. <br>  <br>"It can be difficult playing against a side who put 11 players behind the ball but we have been working hard in training on this. We have to move the ball quicker and create more opportunities to score. <br>  <br>"We have to concentrate on our own job and do the best we can and get a good run of victories going. <br>  <br>"We lost some points last season which cost us the title in the end. Hopefully this season we can fight for the title again." <br>  <br>During his rehabilitation, Aurelio has become acquainted with Italian summer signing </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/aquilani/"><span style="color: #000000;">Alberto Aquilani</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and revealed our new number four can't wait to get started. <br>  <br>"We have been working in the gym together and he has settled in well," added the defender. <br>  <br>"He is working hard to get fit which will be soon and that will be good for the team. Agger will also be back soon and that is great for us."</span></p>

              <p>The same teams – Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea – have hogged the Champions League spots for the last four seasons. <br>  <br>Carragher, though, thinks there is potential for that to change this term. <br>  <br>"I think Man City are looking very strong - Tottenham as well. Aston Villa and Everton are always up there too, so I think it will make it a little bit more exciting this year," said the vice-captain. <br>  <br>"The top four places will certainly be up for grabs, but we want to make sure we are up there. <br>  <br>"I think with the other teams becoming involved hopefully they will take points off the other big sides as well." <br>  <br>Asked if he felt City could maintain their challenge throughout the season, Carragher said: "Yes. They have got some great players, world-class players and I am sure they will be buying more in January, so they are going to be a massive threat."</p>

              <p>Two weeks ago at Chelsea, Burnley realised the gulf in class that there is, but as long as they learn from experiences like that, they'll be fine.</p>
              <p>These are fantastic fixtures for the newly promoted teams, but they've got to remember that these are not the games which will decide the season.</p>
              <p>Even though they won at Bolton last time out, Liverpool weren't convincing and they really need a good win. I think they'll create enough chances to do it here.</p>

              <p><strong>Masch blow!!!</strong></p>
              <p>JAVIER MASCHERANO is a major doubt for Liverpool's Premier League clash with Burnley at Anfield tomorrow.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old midfielder picked up a knock in Argentina's 1-0 defeat to Paraguay on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Mascherano is having treatment but after playing two full 90 minutes for his country over the past week he is unlikely to be risked against the Clarets.</p>
              <p>However, Lucas Leiva is expected to play after making the 6,000 mile trip home from South America.</p>
              <p>Lucas was due back at Melwood today and having not featured in either of Brazil's World Cup qualifiers he is set to face Owen Coyle's side.</p>
              <p>If Mascherano misses out, skipper Steven Gerrard is expected to drop into a central midfield role alongside Lucas.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Rafa Benitez admits he faces a selection dilemma at left-back ahead of Liverpool's first league meeting with Burnley for 33 years.</p>
              <p>Emiliano Insua has got the nod ahead of Andrea Dossena in the opening four matches but Fabio Aurelio is pressing for a recall.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian has proved his fitness following knee surgery and Benitez believes the Reds have missed the 29-year-old.</p>
              <p>"Fabio is a player with quality," he said. "His delivery into the box, especially when we play at home, is excellent. He provides good passes and crosses which is really important.</p>
              <p>"He has no match fitness but he is much better and he hasn't been away with his country so he has been training hard. Fabio knows exactly what we expect from him.</p>
              <p>"Insua has been doing really well. He impressed last season when we needed him and it's the same this season.</p>
              <p>"We have really good competition now on the left with Insua, Aurelio and Dossena.</p>
              <p>"That means a headache for me but that's good. It’s up to me to pick the right player."</p>
              <p>Benitez also has a decision to make further forward with Yossi Benayoun, Albert Riera and Ryan Babel all vying for the left wing role.</p>
