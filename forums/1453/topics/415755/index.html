            <div class='col-md body'><p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><strong>Reds Looking For A Rebound<br></strong><br>After a poor start to the season, Liverpool had finally begun to show some semblance of form by going on an unbeaten run of six games in all competitions. But a trip to Stoke City saw them relinquish their undefeated run by falling to a 2-0 defeat at the Britannia Stadium.<br><br>That game was reminiscent of the Reds’ inconsistency, as it was only a week before that they were celebrating a well-earned victory over Chelsea.<br><br>But Hodgson will know that he is one positive run of games away from resurrection, as six points separate the Merseysiders from fourth placed Manchester City.<br><br>And playing the bottom placed team in the standings at home can only prove to be a confidence booster in the quest to restore lost pride and reclaim what almost used to be a rightful place in the Champions League.<br><br>But for all that to happen, the home side will have to first overcome a few problems in their line-up, as talismanic captain Steven Gerrard has been ruled out for up to four weeks after picking up a hamstring injury whilst on international duty. To add to Hodgson’s woes, Lucas is suspended for this game, and Joe Cole remains a doubt.<br><br>This should give Christian Poulsen a chance to shine and redeem himself in the eyes of the fans, after experiencing a poor start to his career on Merseyside.<br><br><strong>Hammers Still At The Bottom<br></strong><br>Thirteen games gone, and West Ham have registered only one victory against their name and are currently at the very bottom of the Premier League - albeit on goal difference. Still, a tally of nine points from 13 games is an underachievement by any standards.<br><br>They won’t be able to get out of the drop zone by registering a victory over their opponents, but three points would be a massive step in the right direction.<br><br>Avram Grant’s head appeared to be on the chopping block some time back, but vice-chairman Karren Brady has maintained that the gaffer continues to have the owners’ blessing at the moment.<br><br>"When you make a very big and important decision to replace a manager you have to take a lot of things into account. We thought very carefully when we appointed Avram and I can assure you there is no finger on the button," she said recently.<br><br>"We are not getting results and the table does not lie but we will do everything in our power to support him. "<br><br>But having the favor of the upper echelon at Upton Park is far from what the Israeli boss needs at the moment, though it must certainly help in knowing that he is in no danger at the moment.<br><br>However, it also means that he has the future of the Hammers in his hands, as a continued inability to register a victory could see the club having to play a deadly catch-up just to secure survival – since they are already four points behind an 18th placed Birmingham City.<br><br><strong>TEAM NEWS<br></strong><br><strong>Liverpool</strong><br><br><img style="margin: 1px; float: left; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/110600/110613_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80">Steven Gerrard (hamstring) is sidelined for up to four weeks after suffering an injury during the recent international friendly against France.<br><br>Worries abound in the engine room, as Lucas is suspended for this game. This means that the Reds will have two different central midfielders for this game.<br><br>Joe Cole (hamstring) is unlikely to return in time for this clash, while Daniel Agger (calf) will be unavailable through injury.<br><br>But manager Roy Hodgson is booster by the availability of Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt, Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson for this encounter. Fabio Aurelio has also declared himself fit to face the Hammers, after playing 75 minutes in a reserve game against Blackpool.<br><br><em>Possible starting line-up: Reina; Carragher, Kyrgiakos, Skrtel, Konchesky; Meireles, Poulsen, Spearing, Maxi; Kuyt, Torres.</em><br><br><strong>West Ham United</strong><br><br><img style="margin: 1px; float: left; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/64600/64681_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80">Julien Faubert is back in contention, but is unlikely to make the cut into the starting line-up.

              <h2>Reds ease past woeful Hammers</h2>
              It was hardly a proper test of being able to cope without Steven Gerrard but Liverpool did more than enough to dispose of a woeful West Ham at Anfield.
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the captain out for a month with a hamstring tear manager Roy Hodgson called for his players to step up to fill the void and the Barclays Premier League's bottom side provide the perfect opposition.</p>
              <p>First-half goals from Glen Johnson and Maxi Rodriguez, either side of a Dirk Kuyt penalty, were enough to wrap up the points in the first half.</p>
              <p>The visiting fans were less than impressed and directed their anger at manager Avram Grant with chants of 'You're getting sacked in the morning'.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely Liverpool will have an easier game this season and it was the ideal tonic for them after two poor performances in a 1-1 draw at Wigan and last Saturday's defeat at Stoke which ended a six-game unbeaten run.</p>
              <p>Raul Meireles looked better in a more accustomed central position, filling Gerrard's place, while Johnson and Rodriguez also did well and even the much-criticised Christian Poulsen had his best game since joining in the summer.</p>
              <p>If there was one criticism it was that Hodgson's side eased up so much after the break they lost all the momentum and rhythm built up in the first half.</p>
              <p>But they never looked in danger of conceding and the clean sheet was Jose Reina's 134th in all competitions, taking him past Tommy Lawrence into fourth on the club's all-time list.</p>
              <p>West Ham's league record at Anfield is woeful, as they have not won this fixture for 47 years and scored just four Premier League goals in 16 attempts.</p>
              <p>The writing was on wall early on as David Ngog forced Robert Green into a low save to his left before Rodriguez and Fernando Torres both fired wide.</p>
              <p>Green's goal was being peppered even if the goalkeeper was not being properly extended but that changed in the 18th minute when Raul Meireles' long-range effort was tipped over by the England international.</p>
              <p>Meireles swung over the corner and Johnson chested it down before drilling a low shot straight down the middle of the goal with the goalkeeper unsighted by Danny Gabbidon.</p>
              <p>It was the first time since the opening weekend of the season a Liverpool goal had not been scored or created by Torres or Gerrard.</p>
              <p>England full-back Johnson, criticised by manager Roy Hodgson earlier this month for his poor form, appeared to have got the message on his comeback from a three-match injury absence.</p>
              <p>He was a major force down the right in the first half and his cross set up Torres but he uncharacteristically fluff his first-time shot.</p>
              <p>But the Spain international contributed to the second goal as it was his flick into the penalty area which bounced off Matthew Upson on to the arm of Gabbidon, allowing Kuyt to roll home a 27th-minute penalty.</p>
              <p>Gabbidon was better placed to hook Torres' volley away from an empty net after Green failed to properly clear a Meireles free-kick.</p>
              <p>The goalkeeper did better in blocking Torres' shot with his legs but was powerless to stop Paul Konchesky whipping in the rebound to the unmarked Rodriguez, the smallest man in the penalty area, who guided the ball inside the far post with his head.</p>
              <p>When Victor Obinna blasted a shot from close range into the top tier of the Anfield Road stand despondent Hammers fans replied with 'That's why we're going down'.</p>
              <p>The second half had much less to offer than the first as both teams knew the game was over and while West Ham continued to fail to pose a threat Liverpool were content to coast safe in the knowledge the three points were already wrapped up.</p>
              <p>Had it not been for Green the score would have been double as he tipped Torres' fierce shot onto the crossbar at full stretch and, in the same move, then turned Poulsen's long-range effort around his left-hand post.</p>
              <p>Substitute Fabio Aurelio, making only his second appearance since the end of August, also drove just over.</p>
              <p>Liverpool missed the chance to claw back another position or two in the table by failing to improve their goal difference but that was the least of their worries after some indifferent recent performances.</p>
              <p>For West Ham and Grant the problems continue to mount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <li id="quotes"><strong>Hodgson plays down Johnson rift</strong>
              <p> </p>
              Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson played down talk of a rift with Glen Johnson after the full-back returned to form in the 3-0 win over West Ham.
              <p> </p>
              ''I think it's more correct to say people made mischief about a conversational comment that was no way directed at Glen,'' Hodgson told <em>ESPN</em> afterwards. ''People in his camp have tried to hit back in a childish manner. Talk about a storm in a teacup, this was the original storm in a teacup.
              <p> </p>
              ''I've always had a good relationship with him, he's a good player and I know what he can do. He was more than fit and raring to go.''
              <p> </p>
              Johnson was also happy to be back in the groove and added: ''I didn't need to hear it from the boss, I knew I wasn't playing the best. It was nice to do well today.
              <p> </p>
              ''It was nice to play, I've missed six out of seven and wanted to come back and it's nice to come back well.''
              <p> </p>
              The win increased the pressure on Hammers boss Avram Grant, with a number of the disgruntled visiting fans leaving before the final whistle.
              <p> </p>
              ''Today we played poor,'' said the Israeli. ''In the last weeks we've played well. We didn't come into the game in the first half, in the second I was happy with the response of the players.
              <p> </p>
              ''The players looked like they wanted to succeed in this game, but something's not going well.
              <p> </p>
              ''We didn't play well like we did in the last weeks. The fans were great and supported the team. But they must know it is not easy to play with so many players that couldn't play. We take the second-half performance and I'm sure we can win the next game because they are games we can win.'' </li>
