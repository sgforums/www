            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Rafael Benitez has warned Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard he cannot expect to get his own way by claiming a central midfield berth for the Reds.<br><br>Although Gerrard has made it clear he would prefer to be in the heart of the Liverpool midfield, so far this season Benitez has played him on the right, and then on the left, where he appeared against Chelsea on Sunday.<br><br>With Xabi Alonso and Mohamed Sissoko forging an impressive partnership in the Liverpool engine room and Jermaine Pennant supplying pace down the right, Gerrard may be stuck out wide again when Newcastle visit Anfield in the Barclays Premiership on Wednesday night.<br><br>But Benitez has pointed to the examples of Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldinho as evidence Gerrard is not the only talented player to be asked to sacrifice himself for the good of the team.<br><br>"Steven is happier playing in the middle and we know that but I cannot put Xabi or Momo on the wing," observed Benitez.<br><br>"If they are playing well, we know Steven has a lot of quality and we can use him in another position, on the right, the left or behind the main striker, that will benefit the team.<br><br>"Zinedine Zidane played on the left many times even though he preferred to play just behind the strikers and Ronaldinho plays on the right, even though he would prefer to be behind the strikers too.<br><br>"That's how it is with good players. They can play in any position. Steven is our captain and he knows that."<br><br>With no fresh injuries from the unlucky defeat at Stamford Bridge, Benitez is pondering whether to field an unchanged team for the first time in 92 games.<br><br>No matter what side he chooses though, the Spaniard will be desperate to pick up three points after a poor start which has seen Liverpool slump to 15th spot in the Premiership.<br><br>Having begun the campaign with high hopes of mounting a sustained challenge to Chelsea, Liverpool's title aspirations are already being written off in some quarters.<br><br>Yet Benitez is refusing to be deflected from the bigger picture and insists his side will eventually come good.<br><br>"Yes, we would have liked more points but there is no sense of panic," he said.<br><br>"I know the qualities in this squad and I know we need to remain calm.<br><br>"We all want to win every game and be at the top of the table from the beginning until the end.<br><br>"But we also have to look at the big picture. We want to win trophies and you cannot win the league in the first week of the season, you need to wait until the end."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Ben have a niche for being extremely stubborn when he is commiting a mistake.<br><br>His initial plan of deploying 4-5-1 formation with Bean Pole have failed after insisting of deploying the formation for half a season.<br><br>It is evident that Liverpool midfield is leaking due to absence of Stevie.<br><br>I dun agree Sissoko and Alonso have formed an impressive formation.<br><br>Ah Ben is just siding his spanish flop. (Alonso was HARDLY involved in the Chelsea and Everton)<br><br>Alonso just spray his missile from the half way line and remain at that position.<br><br>Sissiko cannot link up his crosses with the striker.<br><br>He is just like a headless train.<br><br>As for the Absence of Gonzales, even the fans in England dunno WHY Ah Ben is keeping him in the cool after fighting so hard to bring him to Anfield.<br><br>Kromkamp have not really been tested before he was booted off to PSV.</div>
