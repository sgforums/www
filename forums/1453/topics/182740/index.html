On Wednesday, the speculation came full circle when rumours began to emerge in Spain that the Reds chief had already put pen to paper on a new deal tying him to the club until 2010.<br><br>Today however, Benitez insisted that while he hasn't yet signed any new deal at Anfield, he definitely won't be going anywhere.<br><br>"It's clear that I'm staying at Liverpool," Rafa told liverpoolfc.tv. "I want to thank the fans, the chief executive and the board for their support. I'm happy here and I'm staying.<br><br>"I am very happy here and I want to win a lot more trophies with Liverpool. My relationship with the fans and the people at the club is fantastic.<br><br>"We will try to finish second this season then look to try and win the Premiership next season. It won't be easy but we will try to sign the best players and continue to work hard with a clear idea of winning more trophies.<br><br>"The board have the same ideas as me and I haven't made any demands. They know we need to improve and we will continue to work hard. Can we win the Premiership next season? Well, it depends on Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and maybe Tottenham but we will try.<br><br>"When I decided to come to Liverpool I knew it was a big club, one of the biggest in the world that was capable of fighting for trophies."  </span></span></div>
