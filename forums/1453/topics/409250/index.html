              <span id="divAdnetKeyword">An own-goal by<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Giray Kacar</span> and a late goal by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dirk Kuyt</span>  ensured <span style="color: #ff0000;">Liverpool</span> progressed to the Europa League group stages after a close game against <span style="color: #ff0000;">Trabzonspor</span> of Turkey.<br><br>Liverpool were without club captain Steven Gerrard, who is believed to be suffering from a back problem, whilst star-striker Fernando Torres didn’t feature in order to ensure his fitness for Sunday’s Premier League clash against West Bromwich Albion at Anfield. <br><br>Midfielder Javier Mascherano was also omitted from the squad due to the ongoing saga surrounding his future at Anfield, whilst fellow Argentine Maxi Rodriguez missed the game due to illness.
              
              <br><br>Jamie Carragher stepped in to captain Liverpool in the absence of Steven Gerrard whilst Joe Cole returned the starting eleven after not featuring in the Reds defeat at Eastlands due to being suspended following a red card picked up in the opening game of the season against Arsenal. <br><br>Trabzonspor made two changes to the side which lost one-nil at Anfield last week, bringing in striker Ibrahima Yattara and defender Giray Kacar to replace Umut Bult and Arkadiusz Glowacki.<br><br>A mistake after just three minutes from Dirk Kuyt allowed the home side to break forward and following a shot across goal from Gustavo Colman the ball fell to <strong>Teofilo Gutierrez</strong> who fired it past Reina and into the back of the net to bring Trabzonspor level in the tie. <br><br>The Turkish side continued to look calm and confident on the ball, looking to push forward and further trouble the Liverpool back four whilst also ensuring lone-striker David N’gog was allowed little room to manoeuvre in and around the box. <br><br>With fifteen minutes gone the home side once again broke on the counter after a disappointing corner for Fabio Aurelio, with Jamie Carragher forced to concede a corner in order to block a shot from Yattara. <br><br>The hosts continued to press with Carragher once again in the firing line, this time from a shot taken by Colman which was closely followed by a good save by Reina, denying Remzi Giray Kacar the chance to double Trabzonspor’s lead. <br><br>With half an hour played Glen Johnson broke free of the trabzonspor defence and slotted the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of Kivrak’s goal, but the England international was judged to be offside by the linesman and the goal was disallowed. <br><br>As the first-half came to a close Liverpool looked to be controlling the game more, having considerably more possession than earlier in the game when the hosts dominated. Still Liverpool failed to create any substantial chances, primarily due to a rigid and well organised Trabzonspor back four. <br><br>Trabzonspor boss Senol Gunes made one change to his side at half time, taking off Yattara and replacing him with Gomes da Costa Alanzinho.<br><br>Within minutes of start of the second-half kick-off the home side had a goal disallowed, with Burak Yilmaz being flagged for offside despite looking to be level with stand-in Liverpool captain Carragher. <br><br>Liverpool had their first real chance of the game five minutes into the second period, with Joe Cole finding space on the right and playing an inch perfect ball on to the head of N’gog who failed to direct the ball towards goal. <br><br>N’gog had another good chance within minutes, showing great skill to skip round a number of Trabzonspor defenders before firing a shot from outside of the box just wide of Kivrak’s right-hand post.<br><br>With 25 minutes left to go Trabzonspor made their second substitution of the evening, bringing on Baris Atas to replace Ceyhun Gulselam. <br><br>As the second-half progressed both teams looked to push for another goal, with Liverpool coming close from a Fabio Aurelio free-kick which was deflected wide whilst Trabzonspor nearly scored another after breaking on the counter, with Pepe Reina acting quickly to keep the score at one-nil. <br><br>Roy Hodgson made his first substitution of the evening with just over ten minutes to go, bringing on Spanish youngster Daniel Pacheco and taking off Fabio Aurelio. <br><br>With just eight minutes to go Glen Johnson made a run into the box and played it across goal which led to<strong> Kacar</strong> turning the ball into his own net, giving Liverpool a vital goal which would see the Reds win the overall tie and progress to the Europa League proper. <br><br>Liverpool made their second substitution with just minutes to go, taking off David N’gog and replacing the young Frenchman with Ryan Babel. <br><br>Shortly after the substitution<strong> Dirk Kuyt </strong>gave Liverpool a second, tapping the ball into the net after Trabzonspor keeper parried the shot directly to the Dutchman. <br><br>Liverpool's final act of the game was to replace Christian Poulsen with Martin Skrtel. <br></span></div>
