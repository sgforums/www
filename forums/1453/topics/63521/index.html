            <div class='col-md body'>I was totally astounded with what I saw in the second half. Heskey playing on the left midfield and smicer playing as a forward. There was no stirkers in almost the entire second half.<br><br>I do not play soccer, am not a good tactician, but can somebody enlighten me on this weird formation? I was glad that Liverpool survived this match with a point. If the reds are going to play like this for the next half of the campaign, we'll not even be able to get into the UEFA cup. How sad.<br><br>Yeah, it's true the manager and the players share the burden of non-performance, but the manager choses the players isn't it? He should be answerable for the team's plight. I really don't know for how long the Liverpool Board can tahan this rubbish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"> 1st half was not that great. pretty monotonous. a kamikaze in the nufc defence allowed murphy to capitalise.<br><br>guess bobby said something to the players during the half and positively (thank god) brought on solano. pool didnt trouble much the crappy bramble. based on the way nufc played, it was more like 2 points lost than 1 point gained. chances after chances were squandered, esp the 2 golden ones frm ameobi.<br><br>i think houllier's tactic in the 2nd half was a mistake. although they got the single pt, they could hv had 3 if they had a more attacking minded tactic. although pool was the visiting team, they could have taken their chances to go for the win. i mean they had the 1-0 lead, who knows they would add to that goal and go away w. the 3 pts. they have a gd defence so attacking players dont have to worry abt defending, unlike nufc. and newcastle had the blunder-full bramble in the defence.<br><br>this coming frm a toonie. cheers </span></div>

If u ask me he's like fowler combinrd with Hesky (of cos not the goal drought).<br><br>Though I'm no Liverpool fan but I must say he's difinitely too expensive for the "purse" Liverpool could offered compares with the Big Boys....<br><br>That however though if Liverppol succed then I think they will have a near perfect pairing of strike force with Owen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the new tactics propsed by GH is to convert Heskey to GK. Retrained Biscan and Hyypia as central strikers, Baros, Owen, Diouf, Kewell, Smicer as full backs.<br><br>As what Sun Tze had said in his famous Art of War: a battle is fought on grounds of deceit and reality. I think GH is moving towards this direction.<br><br>No midfielders in this new tactics, because no need wat. The converted fullbacks all got good passing skills and the converted strikers are good header of the ball so need midfielder for wat. As what GH always believe in: build from the back.</div>

Makes sense to me. After all, GH wasn't planning on attacking. All out defence was the agenda, and I'd take Heskey's defence over Smicer's any day.<br><br>What I don't understand is why do we pack our midfield and still send long balls for Smicer alone to chase whenever we win the ball back in our half.<br><br>Trust me, things are looking up... with Didi back in his defensive midfield role (which I believe Gerrard was unable to do well because he tends to roam too much), we will definitely be more steady defensively.<br><br>I hate to admit it, but I didn't realise how important Carragher was to us until his broken leg......</div>
