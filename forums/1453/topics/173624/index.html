            <div class='col-md body'>errrrr.... sorry to disappoint everyone but realistically, you are looking at Chelsea losing at least 6 games in the remaining 17 games. This is taking into consideration that Liverpool will drop points in 2 or 3 games. Don't see that happen.<br><br>See the Chelsea's remaining matches.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Home Games</span><br>Charlton<br>Liverpool<br>Portsmouth<br>Spurs<br>Man City<br>West Ham<br>Everton<br>ManU<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Away Games</span><br>Sunderland<br>Aston Villa<br>Middlesborough<br>West Brom<br>Fulham<br>Birmingham<br>Bolton<br>Blackburn<br>Newcastle<br><br>Not easy to pick 6 teams that will beat Chelsea especially when they are playing at home.<br><br>The problem is that Chelsea will grind out win after win and the time will come when other teams will not have enough games to catch up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>relax relax,poolman does have a point in the mathematical ability,and benitez doesn't concede cause firstly he's the fighting sort and he believes anything can happen..<br><br>fergie conceding the title is just part of his mind games..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whether they concede or not has no bearing on the final results.  mathematically it is still possible that chelsea might lose the title.  but chances are damn low.<br><br>fans of other clubs can continue dreaming.<br><br></div>
