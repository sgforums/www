            <div class='col-md body'><p>Jamie Carragher today revealed how he congratulated a former teammate for the part he played in helping to boost Liverpool's title hopes.<br><br>Ex-Reds star Danny Murphy found the back of the net as Fulham secured a stunning 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the last round of league fixtures before the international break.<br> <br>It's a scoreline that allowed Rafa Benitez's side to go within a point of table toppers United, courtesy of the 5-0 victory over Aston Villa at Anfield the following day, and Carragher was thankful for the assistance of his one-time club-mate.<br> <br>"I sent Danny a text before the game to wish him luck and another one afterwards to say thank you," the Reds' vice-captain revealed to Liverpoolfc.tv.<br> <br>"He did us a favour, but it's up to us to capitalise now."<br> <br>Having won nine games at home this season, United aren't the only scalp Fulham have taken at Craven Cottage, with Arsenal and Chelsea also failing to record victories there.<br> <br>Carragher is well aware of the danger posed by Roy Hodgson's men and, in particular, the menace of former Kop idol Murphy.<br> <br>"Danny has probably been Fulham's best player this season along with Brede Hangeland at the back," said Carragher.<br> <br>"I think with Danny being captain and playing more of a holding role now, he's organising the people around him.<br> <br>"He's got great experience, so we know it will be difficult, but it's up to us to try and pin him down and stop him playing because I think he makes Fulham tick.<br> <br>"Chelsea only drew at Craven Cottage, they defeated Arsenal there earlier on in the season and we couldn't beat them at Anfield so we're talking about a very tough game for us, but we've got to make sure we're not another big team to drop points there."<br> <br>United's defeat at Fulham came on the back of Liverpool's 4-1 demolition job at Old Trafford, but Alex Ferguson's charges still have a game in hand over the chasing pack.<br> <br>However, with United not in action until Sunday against Villa, a win in South London for the Reds will see them go top of the league on Saturday evening.<br> <br>"We've got an opportunity to go top of the league with United playing Sunday and it's one we've got to take," added the defender.<br> <br>"We've got to try and pick up three points in every game and try to catch United. A draw is probably not a great result, even though we can go top with a point because of the goal difference.<br> <br>"When the game is finished on Saturday, we want to be top of the league."<br> <br>The 31-year-old believes it's vital the Reds try to take maximum points from their remaining fixtures and attempt render United's extra game meaningless.<br> <br>He said: "You wouldn't have expected United to lose two games on the bounce. That's the way the title race is in England, though.<br> <br>"Every game is very difficult and it just goes to show how well we've done this season when United loose two games in a week, but we've only lost two league games all season.<br> <br>"United still have game in hand, but between now and then our aim is to try and win every game so their extra game doesn't count."</p></div>
