              <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Stoke stand in way of Reds' revival</h2>
              <p> </p>
              Liverpool's train of revival rolls into Stoke on Saturday as Roy Hodgson looks to keep the momentum going in their Premier League campaign.
              <p> </p>
              Recent results have been a real boost since the disgrace of losing the Merseyside derby to Everton. Wins over Blackburn, Bolton and Chelsea (before a draw with Wigan) have the side playing with confidence again and Fernando Torres' return to form with a brace against the Blues and one against Wigan puts him back among the continent's top strikers.
              <p> </p>
              But, in Stoke, Liverpool face a side who can always upset the form book. A thrilling 3-2 win over Birmingham has them back on the right road again after five straight defeats and with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kenwyne Jones</span></span> up front feeding off the inimitable Rory Delap's throw-ins, they have the power and determination to cause an upset.
              <p> </p>
              Boss Tony Pulis has been railing against officials of late, claiming that "six or seven" games have been directly affected by dubious decisions against his team already this season, but Liverpool will certainly need more than luck if they are to continue their ascent up the table.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Stoke City player to watch: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ricardo Fuller</span></span></strong>. Fuller has been left playing second fiddle to record signing Kenwyne Jones since his arrival this summer, but the Jamaican is more than a match for many Premier League defenders. Now that he has not become the sole focus of Stoke's aerial bombardment, Fuller can use his pace to get in behind the defenders and worry them with strength and speed. A wonderful goal in midweek against Spurs has his confidence flowing and he will certainly be a danger.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Liverpool player to watch: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dirk Kuyt</span></span></strong>. The Dutchman has become famous for his work-rate since switching from a central striking role to a wide position, but against Chelsea he showed more of his attacking skills. A hugely important player in both attack and defence, Kuyt can chase, hurry and annoy the opposition defence, while also proving a threat when he gets the ball at his feet in the final third. His incisive pass opened the door for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></span> last week and the Reds will hope that Kuyt has a similar impact against Stoke.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Key battle: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Jermaine Pennant</span></span> v <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Paul Konchesky</span></span></strong>. The two players are not the most popular to the neutral, but are very evenly matched down the flank. Both slight of build, pace is their main weapon and they will be chasing each other up and down the touchline all evening. Konchesky likes to get forward for Liverpool, but must be aware that Pennant has the ability to get in behind him and deliver dangerous crosses if he is caught too far upfield. While he has not enjoyed a particularly successful career since moving to Arsenal as a 16-year-old, Pennant's fortunes have certainly improved since he moved to Stoke on loan from Real Zaragoza and he will be keen to prove that he is worth a permanent deal.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Trivia: </strong>The biggest scoreline in recent times in this fixture came in 2000 when Liverpool ran out 8-0 winners in the League Cup. Robbie Fowler scored a hat-trick.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Stats: </strong>Stoke haven't beaten Liverpool since 1984, when a 2-0 home win saw them seal a victory over the Reds for the first time in nine years.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Odds: </strong>Stoke (4.00), Liverpool (1.90) and the draw (3.50) are on offer at <strong>Bet365</strong> but if there are under two goals in the game they will give you 3.25.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Prediction: </strong>Liverpool's recent revival has the confidence flowing back at Anfield and Stoke could be the next to suffer from their new-found belief. If the referee is too involved, you can bank on Pulis losing his cool.</div>

              <p>Depend on the lineup by Ah Roy, he may rest a few key players and change his formation for this evening.</p>
              <p>Hope he dun dive into ultra defensive system against the stoke city players.</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether the revival of Liverpool is still on.</p>

              <p>The Midfield was missing its core and not much of wing play.</p>

              <p>Liverpool need to have a crisis meeting this weekend.</p>
              <p>No one is playing properly and as a team.</p>
              <p>Torres, Reina and Stevie cannot be expected to play 120% every match.</p>
              <p>I dunno how Liverpool can improve suddenly at this stage of the season.</p>
              <p>Is sacking Ah Roy the solution when there are so many sub-standard players who cannot string a pass properly or maintain possession ?</p>
              <p>Man U was good enough to recover from 2 goals behind in the final 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>That is what a champion is about.</p>
              <p>Liverpool is getting painful to watch when team like stoke city play and control possession where Liverpool keep losing the balls.</p>

              <h2>Stoke halt Liverpool's mini-revival</h2>
              <h2>Liverpool's stuttering mini-revival petered out in dismal fashion as they lost 2-0 to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A six-match unbeaten run came to end as they were outfought, outplayed and outmanoeuvred by Tony Pulis' side.</p>
              <p>Ricardo Fuller opened the scoring just after half-time and Kenwyne Jones completed a comprehensive victory in the final minute before Lucas Leiva was sent off for a second bookable offence.</p>
              <p>The Potters were more than worth their win against a team who appear to have lost their way as quickly as they found it.</p>
              <p>They have won away from home only once this season and only three times since last November.</p>
              <p>Their first 45 minutes appeared to be a direct continuation of the second half at Wigan, where they had found themselves under almost constant pressure and were lucky to come away with a draw.</p>
              <p>Only the returning Sotirios Kyrgiakos had not played in the previous two matches so there may have been an element of fatigue, especially as Stoke played a day earlier on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>But no team in the Premier League, let alone a club like Liverpool, can expect to use that as an excuse for an abject and disjointed first-half display.</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson's side appeared unprepared and unable to deal with their hosts' brash, energetic approach which allowed them to dominate the game from first to last.</p>
              <p>Stoke were appealing unsuccessfully for a penalty in only the second minute when Maxi Rodriguez leant heavily on Ricardo Fuller as they challenged for Rory Delap's long throw.</p>
              <p>It was a sign of things to come as the visitors found themselves being forced back, looking worrying susceptible to Delap's trademark set-piece.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Dean Whitehead benefited from weak headed clearances to fire in a low shot which Jose Reina turned around a post and then drill a similar 30-yard effort just past the angle of upright and crossbar.</p>
              <p>Jones and former Reds winger Jermaine Pennant also had chances before Steven Gerrard registered Liverpool's first shot in the 29th minute, forcing Asmir Begovic to tip the low effort behind, although the goalkeeper dealt more comfortably with Raul Meireles strike from the resulting corner.</p>
              <p>It was a brief retort which was soon forgotten when Jones rounded Paul Konchesky to cross low into the six-yard box, forcing Jamie Carragher to dive in front of Matthew Etherington to prevent the opening goal.</p>
              <p>Less than two minutes into the second half Fernando Torres, who had been anonymous previously, was booked for tackling Pennant from behind.</p>
              <p>But the real threat was still coming from Delap and Liverpool's inability to cope with his party trick finally cost them in the 56th minute.</p>
              <p>A scramble saw the ball break to Etherington at the far post and his cross-shot bounced back off Konchesky to Fuller, whose had his first effort blocked but stabbed home the second from close range.</p>
              <p>Despite the stereotype, it was Stoke's first goal from a Delap party-piece in 23 league matches.</p>
              <p>Jones almost made it two when Martin Skrtel mistimed his jump but his left-footed effort beat both Reina and the far post.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, as they did in the first half, had two chances in quick succession with Rodriguez shooting straight at Begovic from Dirk Kuyt's cut-back and Skrtel firing wide from Kyrgiakos' knockdown of Gerrard's free-kick.</p>
              <p>David Ngog and Ryan Babel replaced Meireles and Rodriguez but with Liverpool still unable to gain decent possession of the ball it made little difference they effectively had four strikers on the pitch.</p>
              <p>Their embarrassment was completed in the 90th minute when Gerrard gave the ball away and Jones was able to skip past Skrtel to fire home.</p>
              <p>The dismissal of Lucas just compounded matters.</p>
              <p>In terms of territory and control Liverpool have now lost the last five halves they have played in.</p>
              <p>The 45 minutes prior to that had been the electrifying first-half display against Chelsea but team now appear to be on a downward spiral again.</p>
              <p>It is a descent Hodgson has to arrest quickly. He left the Britannia Stadium with chants of "Dalglish'' - a reference to former player and manager Kenny - ringing in his ears.</p>
