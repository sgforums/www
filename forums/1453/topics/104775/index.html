            <div class='col-md body'>It worth every seconds of me lossing my precious seconds of my sleep and stayed awake to watch the game till the 92min + the Final Score report.<br><br>Liverpool start so brightly.... cutting the supply from midfield... great tactics from Ah Ben to play 4-5-1. Look at the half time stats... ZERO goal, ZERO corners, ZERO shots on target, ZERO shots off target... all ZEROs for Arsenal which means they dont even come close in scoring and Kirkland has nothing much to do in the first half.<br>We look so good without Josemi and Garcia or was it the return of our wonder stevie wonder captain.<br><br>Great movment to create the goal.. Mellor was smart to draw draw Campbell with him and created the open space for Alonso to score. Overall I think Mellor has a good game. Being the lone striker up front... endless runnings.. he should have done better with the strike on the cross bar, if it went in it should have stand cos he is NOT offside. He deserved to score the winner, a half chance.. and he made it count.<br><br>Only player which I felt looks not as good is Kewell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> He look like he lost the touch for football, lost the fitness. Second half he is catching his breathe. Blasting 2 good chances into the stands when he should have done better with better crosses from the left in the second half.<br><br>From soccernet : "Vieira then went down with Hamann not even having made contact - an act worthy of a booking, and thus a sending-off, but he escaped."<br><br>I can't believe player like him have to use such dirty tricks. He should have been sent off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Arsenal should play in the English Diving League. Why do they have to use such dirty means to win??<br><br>We beat Arsenal... and we did it unlike how Man U did it. (Man U played rough... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> and all most took out Reyes's legs) we made Reyes look useless till he have to be taken off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope this will be the turning point for the Reds</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I nearly cried when I saw Mellor scored with the last kick of the match... At least my eyes were a bit wet...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I thought Liverpool had turned on tradition and always becoming complacent after the break and thus conceding our lead to ARSEnal.<br><br>I believe this game will be remembered for a long time to come.<br><br>I think this defence is my prefered one. Finnan in place of the super-cmi Josemi and Risse in place of the improved-but-still-not-good-enough Traore. Hope Ah-Ben will keep this defence after the match. We neutralise the ARSEnal attacking force totally! Except for one moment of brilliance from them.<br><br>Kewell should be made to rest and let him discover his old form before giving him a first-team place. Alonso, Stevie G and Hamman were outstanding.<br><br>Mellor was hardworking in chasing down and pressing the defenders but Sinama looked out-of-depth at times.<br><br>Nunez looked good.<br><br>I can only Ah-Ben keeps this defence... I got to kok his head for always selecting Josemi!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool must be the most kelong team in the EPL.<br><br>As the world expect them to lose or draw, they win the game. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I guess I would be very happy for a draw.<br><br>The goal from Mellor was a lucky goal but it is the most beautiful curve ball that I have ever seen.<br><br>Another nagging worry is that Sinama is injured and now Liverpool have only Mellor to play.<br><br>Due to the injury to a certain player, Ah Ben have actually plugged the weakness at right back.<br><br>Every single Liverpool players played hard last night.<br><br>I agreed with the commentator that Kewell is not playing his best and he may have something in his mind.<br><br>It have something to do with his fitness as he keep losing the ball to the opponents.<br><br>But, to beat Arsenal without any key strikers is a really an achievement !!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OMG i m goin nuts!!!<br><br>when Alonso n Mellor score i shout until like siao liddat... especially when Mellor score... i havent felt so happy in a long long time... not even beating teams like Norwich n watever makes me feel like this... i still cant believe it... makes me sacrificing my slp all worth it! well done Liverpool! i m so lost 4 words now!<br><br>Gerrard's return was the key to the victory... but! Finnan in for Josemi is even more imp! juz look how many times Henry n Pires n Cole actually managed to get pass Finnan! he was brilliant... if it was Josemi, we may juz lose ppl... hope Benitez keep this same defence.. n erm Kewell... sry pal, i like u as a player but u need some time off man n mayb some counselling..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>can u imagine Morientes coming in Jan, we would b unstoppable! only if Josemi stitches nv heal</div>
