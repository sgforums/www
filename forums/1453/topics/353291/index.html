              <p>Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar would not be surprised to see Jose Reina add a goalscoring threat to his list of attributes.</p>
              <p>Former goalkeeper Grobbelaar, who was a member of Liverpool's 1990 championship-winning squad, has been so impressed by Spanish shot-stopper</p>
              <p>Reina he considers him an attacking weapon for Rafael Benitez.<br>It was Reina's long kick which set up Albert Riera to score against Aston Villa on Sunday, and Grobbelaar claims opposition goalkeepers need to be aware of his potential menace.</p>
              <p>''I've always said Reina has the best distribution out of the continental 'keepers,''</p>
              <p>Grobbelaar told BBC Radio Five Live.<br>''His kicking out and throwing is absolutely superb. He might actually score from a kick one day, either out of his hands or he'll come 35 yards out and have a go at goal.''</p>
              <p>Grobbelaar has been thrilled to see Liverpool revive their Premier League title challenge, as they attempt to end a 19-year wait to be champions of England again.</p>
              <p>The 5-0 home victory over Villa took Liverpool to just one point behind leaders Manchester United, who have a game in hand but have lost back-to-back league games.</p>
              <p>''It's brilliant,'' said Grobbelaar. ''It's come at a great time. We know we have got to win every single game we play.</p>
              <p>''Our away form has been better than our home form, despite the Villa match, so we know what we have got to do. United, on the other hand, have had this little hiccup.</p>
              <p>''They've got to go away on international duty and come back and regroup. Believe me, this is not over by a long way.''</p>
              <p>Liverpool will go top before United play their next game if they win at Fulham on April 4, 24 hours before the Red Devils face Villa at Old Trafford.<br>Manager Benitez has stressed there is ''real belief'' among his squad that they ''can beat anyone''.</p>
              <p>Benitez added: ''But we must be calm, win the next game, get the points and keep going until the end. Otherwise everything will be wasted.</p>
              <p>''Clearly we have confidence and the team is playing well. But we must just wait to see what happens next to United, while we must keep going and keep the team playing at this level.''</p>
