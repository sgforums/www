              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"Bob's knowledge of players and the game in general is unsurpassed. Football has known no equal in management or prize-winning, but his modesty and dignity were overwhelming as he led this club from one triumph to another. His name will always be synonymous with Liverpool." Liverpool chairman David Moores on Bob Paisley</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the Kop. I would die if that were to happen. When they start singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' my eyes start to water. There have been times when I've actually been crying while I've been playing". Kevin Keegan</p>

Two people can never share the exact opinions. It was the little things: what time does the bus leave? One says 2pm and the other wants it to go at 2.15pm. It started to erode team spirit because the lads didn't know who was boss." Roy Evans on joint managers.</p>
