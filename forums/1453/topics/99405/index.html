            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From Liverpool website:<br>Rafael Benitez said he was very satisfied with the performance of his team during the 2-0 win over Charlton but said he was disappointed Liverpool didn't score more goals.<br><br>Liverpool gave another outstanding home performance to maintain their 100 per cent home record in the Premiership and could have scored seven or eight goals had the finishing been better.<br><br>Benitez said: "I am not sure if this was our best performance of the season because we played very well in the first half against Deportivo, very well in the second half at Fulham, and very well in other home games this season.<br><br>"I am happy with the win but we had many opportunities and needed to score more goals. We had at least 10 clear opportunities to score besides the two goals and you need to score.<br><br>"The problem can be when if you have so many opportunities and don't score then sometimes it can only take one mistake to let the opposition score."  </strong><br><br>I think Baros and Cisse should work together and stop trying to out do each other for the good of the team.<br><br>Baros is too selfish and too eager to prove himself. He have to learn that a player can be considered good if he can create chances for team mates to score.<br><br>I think Traore had a good game. providing support in attack (he could have scored one from Cisse's cross  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and defencing well.<br><br>Kewell still sleeping?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> WAKE UP KEWELL!!! what happened to the Kewell we saw in Leeds colours?<br><br>Riise is back!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> how we miss his thunder bolt shots...<br><br>Gracia's goal was amazing too.. and he was so close to adding a second one... if that went in.. it could be up for the goal of the season contest.<br><br>Well done Reds.. keep it up. Don't play well one game..and went to sleep the next.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah. The free flowing attacking style once famous at Anfield is slowing creeping its way back.<br><br>Once again,I was very impressed with Traore.He looked dependable,not shy of going forward and I must say he's an asset in the air with his height.<br><br>Risse scored a good goal but his apart from the goal,his overall contribution to the game was quite pathetic.I still think he's TOO one legged. This fella cant play with his right leg.Sometimes, it can be painful to watch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think Benitez is trying to charge up Kewell.Prior to Traore's emergence at left back,Kewell was pretty assured of a starting position week in week out, but now its no longer the case.Aussie must up his game.<br><br>Cisse is a terrific striker of the ball.And his pace is priceless.Baros's workrate is phenomenal. The problem with this pairing is that both have rather similar playing styles.Both like the ball given to them in space while they use their pace. To make matters worse, Baros plays with his head down on the ground.<br><br>But nonetheless, there are small but sure improvements in the partnership and Im sure with games,which Benitez has rightfully promised both players together, this pairing will improve. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Next game is away against Blackburn.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Lets see if LFC can continue this fine run of performances.</div>

Not to mention he scored a beautiful screamer on sat and almost scored a goal of the season.
