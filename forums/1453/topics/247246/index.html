            <div class='col-md body'>Rafael Benitez has revealed how Steve Finnan has surpassed all expectations the Liverpool boss had of the Republic of Ireland international when he first arrived at Anfield in 2004.<br><br>Finnan had only been at the club for a season when Benitez moved to Merseyside and despite a solid debut campaign, the Liverpool manager admits he didn't know what to expect from the former Fulham defender when he took charge at Anfield.<br><br>"When I first arrived I did not know too much about Finnan," claims Benitez. "I'd had reports but the season before I arrived he was not playing well, or at least not at this level but he has improved, and for three years now he has been playing well.<br><br>"Maybe he has had to win me over but Gerard Houllier told me he was a very good player, even though he is not the sort of player people talk too much about. He has quality and understands the game. I have seen that all in these last few years."<br><br>While Finnan currently stands second behind Jamie Carragher in the voting for Liverpool's Player of the Season award, Benitez believes the recent arrival of Saturday's goalscorer Alvaro Arbeloa from Deportivo la Coruna can only further improve the Irishman's game.<br><br>"My aim is to have two good players for every position. We now have Arbeloa to push Finnan. It is something Steve has not had of late because we have not had top-level competition in his position.<br><br>"Finnan is a good player, he is very positive and the quality of his crosses is very good, as you saw in Eindhoven. He is a very professional person and a fine trainer but maybe now we will see the best from him with Arbeloa arriving to give him more competition.<br><br>"But that does not apply only to Finnan. I want us to have two good players for every position. It is the same to have Mascherano now to out pressure on Alonso. If you want to play four competitions at the maximum level, you need two good players for every position."<br></div>
