            <div class='col-md body'>I think he is just holding the club to ransom. Complaining about the club delaying the talks on his contract is rubbish. Anyway he is the one who delayed the talks. I believe talks began early last season except that he doesn't want to discuss.<br><br>He really thinks that Liverpool cannot survive without him. Well, we don't need players like him. I think he needs to look at Carragher and feel ashamed of himself. Carragher was by far the best player last season. Yet he immediately signed an improved contract without hesitation. This is the player we want.<br><br>I really hate players who jumped ship just to win trophies, like Owen and maybe Gerrard, especially when they are already in a club who has the potential to win it. They just want it easy by going to another club that more or less guaranteed to win it. These players are losers in my opinion. Imagine LFC fans who decided to support Chelsea just because Liverpool cannot win the title. These are not true Reds fans. They are just glory hunters like Owen. Loyal fans like me go from the glory 80s days to the worst periods and now a better period. We watched Man U, Arsenal and Chelsea win almost everything. But did I ever once think that I may have supported the wrong club? No. I have faith in Liverpool that we can turn it around and be strong again.<br><br>So Gerrard, sign it with your heart. Otherwise please do us a favour and ask for a transfer now. At least we still have time to delve into the market and buy some new players.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely. This shows that Gerrard is not so loyal to Liverpool after all, even though we do have a chance of winning the title. So are we going to keep him then? No. Because this issue will resurface again and again until we really win the title, which may be 2-3 years down the road.

This shows that Gerrard is not so loyal to Liverpool after all, even though we do have a chance of winning the title. So are we going to keep him then? No. Because this issue will resurface again and again until we really win the title, which may be 2-3 years down the road. These talks and speculations will only disrupt the club, which is not healthy and create disharmony within the club.<br><br>Personally, I don't see any point in persuading him to stay. If he doesn't want to stay, then just go. </div></blockquote>your emotions aside, do you really believe liverpool can win the league title in 2-3 years?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes. With the right players and togetherness, we can. Of course I must admit that losing Gerrard will be a blow. But that should not be an excuse and I am sure Rafa will not make that as an excuse.<br><br>We can see what he is trying to do. He just bought a good goalkeeper (hopefully), which we have lack for many years, he has bought a couple of good wingers, which is again what we lack in recent years. Losing Owen was a blow as we are now without a 20 goal getter. But I am sure Rafa knows that and he will be working hard on that.  But other than that, I believe we are in a pretty good shape. The only thing now is to get this team playing together for a couple of years and I am sure they can achieve great things.</div>
