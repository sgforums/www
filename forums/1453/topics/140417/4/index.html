But in Liverpool, we can do it if everyone plays their part. By going to Madrid or Chelsea is to take the easy way out. That is a loser. Just look at Shearer. He is a fantastic player. But what medals and trophies he has? None. But he still remain at Newcastle even though he could have gone to Man U. Why? Because he is a Geordie through and through and Newcastle does have a realistic chance, albeit a small one, to win the title and he will fight for it at Newcastle. These are the players I admire. They don't quit and say that they are great players and they need to win things. If all great players simply go to Chelsea, Arsenal or Man U just to win medals, then what's the future hold for other clubs, especially those potential clubs like Spurs, Liverpool and Newcastle?</div></blockquote>Fellow Magpie just like me, aren't you?</div>
