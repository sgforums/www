              <div><strong>IT'S been a case of déjà vu all over again for Liverpool fans in the last 
              seven days. </strong></div>
              </div>

              <p>The 'will he, won't he?' quit rumours regarding Rafa Benitez and Juventus are 
              familiar to The Kop, who have seen their manager flirt with rival clubs 
              during every season of his reign.</p>
              <p>Having been linked with a move to Juve, Real Madrid or Inter Milan, the 
              Anfield manager usually allows the speculation to continue for long enough 
              to provoke an hysterical appeal from his supporters to stay, before 
              announcing he's committed to the Mersey cause.</p>
              <p>Will the Old Lady of Turin finally lure the boy who keeps crying wolf?</p>
              <p>Or will this week's events follow the same pattern? Here are Rafa's X Files...</p>
              <p><strong>March 16, 2005</strong></p>
              <p>BENITEZ is the prime target for Real Madrid, who are about to sack Vanderlei 
              Luxemburgo.</p>
              <p>When asked in a Melwood Press Conference to deny claims he may leave Anfield 
              after just nine months, Benitez replies: "Real Madrid is just another 
              rumour. All I am thinking about is a win against Blackburn. I want to win. 
              That is my only idea."</p>
              <p><strong>March 24, 2005</strong></p>
              <p>AFTER a week of speculation and clear-the-air talks with his board, Benitez 
              confirms the Real stories were right but eases the worst fears of The Kop.</p>
              <p>"It is very nice that every so often my name is being mentioned with several 
              different clubs in Spain," said Benitez.</p>
              <p>"But I can tell the Liverpool fans I have no intention of leaving.</p>
              <p>"I have a five-year contract and intend to stay for it.</p>
              <p>"The board and everyone have been totally supportive of me and not put any 
              extra pressure on me.</p>
              <p>"The club have not given me any targets this season, even though deep down I 
              know what my own are - and that is a Champions League spot."</p>
              <p><strong>March 5, 2006</strong></p>
              <p>SPORT OF THE WORLD reveal that Inter Milan and Real Madrid want the Liverpool 
              manager. We report how Benitez is frustrated with his board's lack of 
              spending power and wants around £30million a season to recruit world-class 
              players for his Anfield squad.</p>
              <p>Real's new president, Fernando Martin Alvarez, praises Benitez's credentials 
              and says he could be the man to bring stability to the Spanish Galacticos.</p>
              <p><strong>March 8, 2006</strong></p>
              <p>BENITEZ is asked ahead of the Champions League last-16 showdown with Benfica 
              if there is any truth in the weekend reports linking him with Madrid and 
              Inter.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager says: "I am really focused on the Champions League clash 
              and am not worried about other things.</p>
              <p>"All I am doing now is preparing my team for the game and talking to the 
              players about the match.</p>
              <p>"I have no problems with the board, with the Chairman or with the chief 
              executive."</p>
              <p><strong>March 17, 2006</strong></p>
              <p>TWELVE days after reports of an offer from Real Madrid are revealed - and 
              following more talks with his board, Benitez makes a more emphatic statement.</p>
              <p>"It's clear that I'm staying at Liverpool," he says.</p>
              <p>"I want to thank the fans, the chief executive and the board for their 
              support."</p>
              <p>"I'm happy here and I'm staying. I am very happy here and I want to win a lot 
              more trophies with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"My relationship with the fans and the people at the club is fantastic."</p>
              <p><strong>March 14, 2007</strong></p>
              <p>BENITEZ requests an urgent meeting with the club's new American owners 
              following another approach from Real Madrid for his services.</p>
              <p>He says: "There are always a lot of rumours in the newspapers and a lot of 
              people have been talking about Madrid.</p>
              <p>"We have new people taking over and it's important I talk to the American 
              owners.</p>
              <p>"I have spoken to them once, when they first came to the club, but now I would 
              like to see them again as soon as possible and talk about the future."</p>
              <p><strong>March 22, 2007</strong></p>
              <p>AFTER eight days of cryptic responses, Benitez ends speculation with an 
              unambiguous statement.</p>
              <p>"It's clear I have always wanted to stay and now I'm even more determined to 
              stay," he says. "The news I have after speaking to the new owners was really 
              positive.</p>
              <p>"I'm very excited about what we can achieve this season but also about what we 
              can do next season.</p>
              <p>"It's important the fans know I am completely committed to Liverpool Football 
              Club and I'm going nowhere.</p>
              <p>"I know there's been a lot of speculation in the Spanish media linking me with 
              Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"Any manager would be honoured to be associated with such a famous club, 
              especially as Madrid is my home city and also my former club.</p>
              <p>"However, I want to make it clear I am very happy at Anfield and very happy in 
              England and I'm genuinely excited by what the future holds for Liverpool."</p>
              <p><strong>November 23, 2007</strong></p>
              <p>IT emerges Benitez has had a major falling out with new owners Tom Hicks and 
              George Gillett Jr.</p>
              <p>Reports claim he has become a target for Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>When asked a series of questions about his future, he replies stating he is 
              focused only on 'coaching and training' his team.</p>
              <p>However, when asked if the England job is of interest, he states: "You never 
              know what will happen in football."</p>
              <p><strong>November 26, 2007</strong></p>
              <p>WITH Benitez on the verge of losing his job due to his 'coaching and training' 
              Press briefing, a 'source close to him' pleads for his future: "Rafa loves 
              it at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"He loves the people of the city, he loves the fans and he loves the club.</p>
              <p>"All he wants is what's best for the fans - he gets frustrated when he feels 
              he's not able to do that."</p>
              <p><strong>January 16, 2009</strong></p>
              <p>BENITEZ rejects the first of four</p>
              <p>drafts of a new contract which are offered to him.</p>
              <p>It is claimed Real Madrid and Manchester City are in contact with his 
              representatives.</p>
              <p>Benitez says: "The owners feel that the manager's decisions need to be subject 
              to the chief executive. But I know that I am subject to results and to our 
              fans and they are the best judges I will ever have."</p>
              <p><strong>February 22, 2009</strong></p>
              <p>A MONTH into the contract saga and amid rumours he's about to quit, Benitez 
              says: "I only want to concentrate on football."</p>
              <p><strong>March 18, 2009</strong></p>
              <p>BENITEZ signs a new five-year deal and issues the following statement: "My 
              heart is with Liverpool Football Club.</p>
              <p>"I love the club, the fans and the</p>
              <p>city and with a club like this and supporters like this, I could never say no 
              to staying.</p>
              <p>"I always made clear I wanted to be here for a long time and when I complete 
              my new contract it will mean I have spent over a decade in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Throughout this process, I would like to thank the owners for their hard work 
              in finalising the deal."</p>
              <p><strong>January 26, 2010</strong></p>
              <p>REPORTS claim Juventus want Benitez to be their manager at the end of the 
              season.</p>
              <p>The Italian outfit are poised to sack boss Ciro Ferrara after a dismal run of 
              form and are said to be looking to lure Benitez to Turin in the summer.</p>
              <p>It is suggested there has been direct contact between Juventus officials and 
              the Liverpool boss.</p>
              <p>When asked if there is any truth in the story Benitez says: "I know they are 
              interested, that is part of the game now in football.</p>
              <p>"But I am not ready to talk too much because I don't want to lose my focus.</p>
              <p>"When you are a manager and you have clubs asking, you have to be proud 
              because they are a top side in Europe."</p>
