            <div class='col-md body'>I find it unfortunate that Liverpool have never seen the best side of Fernando Morientes. Frankly speaking, his form at the club was downright awful for a striker of his reputed calibre ; the stats do not lie. And I am sure that he knows it all too well.<br><br>Morientes and Traore are the players I am pretty certain will be offloaded by Rafael Benitez. Liverpool are aiming to be serious title challengers next season and with the form that these two are in they can only be qualified  as dead-weight. We must make way for other possible replacements to come in. Whether Djibril Cisse would leave remains yet to be seen - there is alot of speculation concerning his possible departure but I feel that he has tried his best to fit in and the manager may yet have plans for him.<br><br>Still, I wish all the best for you, Nando.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
