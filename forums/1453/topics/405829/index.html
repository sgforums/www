              <h1>Signing Joe Cole lifts Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson into the big 
              league</h1>

              <p>It is a signing which not only puts Liverpool
               firmly back on the Premier League map but establishes Roy Hodgson as a 
              manager with serious intent and pulling power at Anfield.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/19/article-0-0A7F1242000005DC-87_306x423.jpg" alt="On the move: Cole chose Liverpool over Spurs and Arsenal " width="306" height="423">

               Arsenal </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres take note. Free agent Joe Cole's 
              decision to turn his back on Arsenal and Tottenham is about more than 
              money.</p>
              <p>Those two London clubs, both Champions League qualifiers, 
              are working within the same wage budget as the Merseyside club, who will
               become the first English team to kick off their season when they start 
              their Europa Cup campaign against minnows from Macedonia or Armenia next
               week. </p>
              <p>Having agreed an £80,000-a-week deal, with lucrative 
              top-up bonuses,
              Cole's mind was made up by the fact that he was virtually guaranteed
              regular first-team football at Anfield.</p>
              <p>As if to emphasise the point, the 28-year-old Londoner has been
              handed Liverpool's coveted No 7 shirt, which has the same aura as the
              No 10 of Brazil or No 9 at St James's Park.</p>
              <p>Worn with distinction by title and European Cup winners Kevin Keegan
              and Kenny Dalglish in the 70s and 80s, it has been known to make or
              break lesser mortals since.</p>
              <p>For every Steve McManaman, Nigel Clough or Peter Beardsley, there is
               a Robbie Keane, Harry Kewell or Vladimir Smicer.</p>

              against Manchester United in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford before lifting 
              the Premier League trophy at the end of last season</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>As a football fan who knows his history, Cole will be well aware of
              the significance of Hodgson's act, even though he was nine when
              Liverpool last won the league title.</p>
              <p>Former striker Ian Rush, the man who partnered Dalglish, believes
              Cole's signing sends out a positive message to Liverpool supporters,
              just when they needed it most and is also proof that Hodgson has
              quickly started to erase the memory of Rafael Benitez.</p>
              <p>He can now be taken seriously as a Liverpool manager who will entice
              internationals to his club as well as persuade the existing ones to
              stay.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/19/article-1296089-0A7FF78A000005DC-855_306x677.jpg" alt="Joe cole by numbers" width="306" height="677">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Joe cole by numbers</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Rush said: 'Roy Hodgson knows what he wants, and he can talk these
              players into signing. To get Joe to come out of London is a coup for
              Hodgson. A lot of people were expecting him to stay in London.</p>
              <p>'This is the signing supporters wanted and it's a big boost for
              them. You look at last season when we went into it not hoping but
              thinking we were going to win the league. 'This season people are
              thinking, "Are we going to finish in the top four?" I think this sends
              a sign out to Liverpool supporters that the club do mean business.</p>
              <p>'Joe could play just behind Torres. People don't know his position
              because he can play on the left, right and just off the striker, and I
              think it's a wonderful signing. Skill wise, he is the best in England,
              and maybe getting regular football is a reason why he has come to
              Liverpool.'</p>
              <p>He has joined the five-time European champions after Yossi Benayoun 
              headed in the opposite direction to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>The Israel midfielder was also regarded with affectionate by
              Liverpool fans, but former assistant boss Phil Thompson believes the
              club have the better end of the deal. And, after clinching the 
              £1.7million signing of Charlton's Jonjo Shelvey before Benitez's
              departure, Liverpool's addition of Cole continues a much-needed policy
              of acquiring English talent, says Thompson.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I would have liked Benayoun to have stayed. He was a
              really good player and I'm shocked he went for £5million. But I'd have
              Cole every time of the day.</p>
              <p>'It's something I've been stressing with Roy Hodgson that we should
              start heading back to signing British players. Cole is the one who can
              ignite it and can show the right players will come to Anfield despite
              not having Champions League football.</p>
              <p>'The arrival of Joe Cole will show all is not lost and Liverpool are 
              still a good football club.'</p>
              <p>Now Cole has to show he is the player everyone thought he could be.</p>
