            <div class='col-md body'>I have not wasted my precious sleep to catch the match this morning though I almost die of heart attack... till the last second... Chelsea almost scored... well ALMOST. Way too close a game  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>One of the best performance I saw apart from the unsung heros of Liverpool... Riise... Hamman... Carragher...Traore... Finnan.<br><br>I think Traore did a good job this morning. Carragher is to me the BEST Liverpool player of this season.<br><br>To win the Cup I seriously think we need to get the strikers firing..... Baros and Cisse dont seems to be very threatening to the opponents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Anyway, Istanbul here we come!!!</div>

Liverpool was also counter-attacking &amp; defending at the same time. Just that our players were always slow to latch the ball into the penalty box</div>
