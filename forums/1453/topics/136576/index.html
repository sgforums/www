            <div class='col-md body'>lol, dont think there's a need for the team to perform in the EPL also....just make sure you win the Champion's league every season and you can play in it for as long as you like. You only need to play less than 20 matches instead of the 38 matches in the EPL. You can even get relegated and get to play in the Champion's league since you were champion the season before. Nice right??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
