              <p><strong>MCATEER: THIS IS A MASSIVE SIGNING<br></strong></p>
              <p>Jason McAteer believes Glen Johnson will prove to be a 'massive signing' for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The England defender completed his transfer from Portsmouth by putting pen to paper on a four-year Anfield deal last week, and former Reds right-back McAteer is delighted with the acquisition.<br> <br>"Glen is the kind of player I'm really happy the club have brought in," McAteer told LFC Magazine.<br> <br>"He looks like he's nailed down the England right-back position now and from what I hear he's a great lad off the pitch as well.<br> <br>"He'll be good to have in the dressing room, plus he already knows the Premier League inside out.<br> <br>"Johnson is young and is exactly the kind of player Liverpool needed to sign.<br> <br>"I think he will be a massive signing."<br> <br>McAteer, who was recently appointed assistant manager to John Barnes at Tranmere Rovers, feels Johnson's versatility was one of several qualities that caught the eye of Rafa Benitez.<br> <br>"Johnson is very attack-minded and is also versatile," he said.<br> <br>"He can play in midfield and I'm sure he could slot in at centre-half or left-back if required.<br> <br>"At this level of the game, a right-back needs to have those strings to his bow.<br> <br>"They have to be able to play wing-back, centre-half or as a conventional right-back to fit into various systems. That's why they don't come cheap.<br> <br>"What Rafa's doing with Johnson is he's buying versatility. He's getting a player who can play in a variety of positions.<br> <br>"That can be of particular use when you go into Europe where he's pitting his wits against some of the world's top managers. It gives him that flexibility to mix it up and throw different kinds of systems at them."<br> <br>McAteer believes the deal sends out a clear statement of intent to Liverpool's title rivals after the Reds beat off stiff competition from Chelsea and Manchester City to land the 24-year-old.<br> <br>"That's all credit to Rafa. He's put himself in a very, very strong position in the transfer market," added McAteer.<br> <br>"Whereas last season or the season before Johnson might have gone to Chelsea, Arsenal or Manchester United, it's a different story now when Liverpool start making enquiries.<br> <br>"Players are getting enticed and it's whetting their appetites again. They know Liverpool are knocking on the door when it comes to the title and winning things.<br> <br>"Liverpool signing Johnson under the noses of other clubs with Champions League ambitions is sending out a clear message that the Reds mean business again.<br> <br>"That is certainly what Rafa will want to be telling everyone."</p>
