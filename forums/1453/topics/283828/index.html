            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from All Football &amp; EPL:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Liverpool chief Rafa Benitez has warned Peter Crouch that he must fight for his place at Anfield.<br><br>Crouch has dropped down the pecking order at Liverpool this season with Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt and Andrei Voronin all ahead of him in Benitez's plans.<br><br>The England international has spoken of his frustration at his lack of first-team opportunities, but Benitez has told the giant forward to do his talking on the pitch.<br><br>Character<br>"In a top side every player needs to prove his character, quality and mentality.<br><br>"The strikers need to be ready and the responsibility is on the player. When I talk about a good mentality I mean a winning one, trying to fight for your position and show you're good enough.<br><br>"We're hopefully going to play 60 games so that's enough for all to have their opportunity.<br><br>"If they say they are not ready, in a top side we don't want excuses. We want players who are ready to play every game the best they can.<br><br>"It doesn't just apply to Crouch but to all of them. For me it's better if a player plays 50 per cent of the games working at 100 per cent and not 90 per cent in all games and not win anything."<br><br>No problem<br>Benitez also called on Crouch to use the example of Yossi Benayoun by playing his way into his plans<br><br>"Benayoun showed what can happen if you work hard and you're ready. But I don't have a problem with Crouch - he's learning," added Benitez.<br><br>"It's frustrating for them but when they are left out they must be ready for the next game.<br><br>"Sides do evolve and you do lose players along the way. That is inevitable.<br><br>"It isn't easy to find players like Jamie Carragher, who stay at one club and retain a winning mentality. But Crouch will score goals and must be ready when he gets a chance." </span><br><br>personally i feel crouch will not do any better becos of less playing in pool. for the sake of his career, england and liverpool, i feel liverpool should loan him off to spanish club to make him gain some oversea explosure to sharpen his skills.<br><br>speaking of which, i realise dat this season there r NONE england players playing in oversea (forget about gay beck aka gonecase). even owen hargrevas choosen to be in comfort zone to come back to mama land. i feel the future of england squad is not very good as no one is going to assist them on opponents' statistic. they r going to suffer in euro 2008 if they themselves r not practice gloralisation comparing to their foreign players.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With more crosses coming in from the flank... why should Crouch go? Who can beat him in the air? He don't even need to jump to reach high crosses... defenders will have nightmare guarding him when comes to high crosses and he falls easily.. who knows we might get lucky penalties just like the one against Fulham  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
