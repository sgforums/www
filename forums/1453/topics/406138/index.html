They also have an idea about how much work they need to do physically before you can start throwing them into competitive matches," he explained.<br><br>"They tell me it would be wrong if I look into using these players that early if we want to use them throughout the season.<br><br>"If we don't throw them in then we don't have the players with experience to play the games, so it is a cleft stick at the end of the day.<br><br>"You lose if you don't play them and you lose if you do play them."</span><br></span></div>
