He's had the operation done and everything has gone in a very straightforward fashion.<br><br>"The fracture has been repaired with some metalwork in his leg in a similar way to what he had when he broke the other leg in 2004. This fracture is not as severe as the previous one.<br><br>"The last time he broke his leg, it took him just 164 days to recover completely - which was just over five months - but this time we're expecting him to recover even quicker. When we talk about him being back, we mean back playing first team football.<br><br>"He'll be flying back to England on Monday and we would expect to see him back training at Melwood in around four months. His recovery last time was so quick because Djibril himself remained positive and worked really hard and obviously he had appropriate management throughout the recovery process.<br><br>"Knowing Djibril, he'll show the same willingness to fight back from this new injury and I wouldn't be surprised to seeing him playing as early as November."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just hope for the best that when he comes back from injury...he will prove to us that he can make it as a Liverpool player just like kewell is beginning to show in this past season.... I like Cisse as a player really though I must admit he really did not play up to his potential in a RED shirt. He plays real well for Auxerre and he is lethal for France but just could not understand his failure to excel in a RED shirt..... well its a terrible injury to have and whether he deserves to be in a RED shirt or not, that is not as important as wishing him a good recovery...... seeing a leg twisted that way, the transfer activities just are not so important for the time being... its really cruel to wish and lament that Cisse disrupts our transfer plans and blame him for it.....no players in a RED shirt deserves that.</div>
