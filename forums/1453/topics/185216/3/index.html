            <div class='col-md body'>Wenger surprised by Arsenal's miserly Euro defence<br><br>Arsene Wenger admits the watertight defence which has taken Arsenal to the brink of European glory has come as a shock to him.<br><br>The Gunners are looking for their 10th European clean sheet in a row when they face Villarreal in tonight's Champions League semi-final second leg.<br><br>They are normally famed for attacking football under Wenger but have shattered AC Milan's previous record of seven games without conceding a goal.<br><br>Another shut-out in Villarreal and the Londoners, 1-0 up after the first leg, will be in their first European Cup final against Milan or Barcelona.<br><br>Wenger said: 'Our defensive record is a bit of a surprise to me but I'm happy we have it because it is something that can give the team confidence.<br><br>'We know we are solid defensively and every inch of confidence you can get before a game like this is important.'<br><br>Arsenal have knocked Real Madrid and Juventus out of this season's competition but Wenger expects Villarreal's little El Madrigal arena to generate a fiery atmosphere.<br><br>Wenger said: 'We have shown character against Juventus and Real Madrid and we need it again.<br><br>'It will be a more intimidating atmosphere because it is a small stadium and therefore I feel the heat will be higher.<br><br>'They will play the same way but will be less timid and (Argentinian playmaker Juan Roman) Riquelme will be more influential. He shows more personality, character and decisiveness at home.<br><br>'We must play to win the game. I don't think they will score three. Let's try and score and that will be a big blow to them.<br><br>'You cannot go into a game 1-0 up thinking you can just rely on that.'<br><br>Wenger criticised Villarreal players for play-acting in last week's first leg and expects more of the same tactics.<br><br>The Arsenal manager said: 'What can we do about it? We are responsible for our own behaviour. When it's not right we have to stand up and say we were wrong.<br><br>'They behaved like they did and the referee has a job to make the game respectable.<br><br>'I didn't think we did anything wrong and we were fair in our behaviour, like we were on Saturday.'<br><br>Wenger was locked in an angry row with Tottenham head coach Martin Jol during Saturday's north London derby at Highbury, which ended 1-1.<br><br>He was furious because Jol's Spurs players refused to kick the ball out of play when two Arsenal players were on the floor, apparently injured after colliding.<br><br>Wenger said: 'I feel quite relaxed, contrary to the impression I gave on Saturday because I believe my team is up for it.<br><br>'I trust this team completely and what happened was nothing to do with the pressure of getting results.'<br><br>Sol Campbell will return to the centre of Arsenal's defence with Philippe Senderos out with a knee injury. Full-back Gael Clichy is back in the squad after injury but will not start.<br><br>Wenger admits he is gambling on Campbell, who has played only an hour of competitive football since walking out of a game against West Ham at half-time, on February 1.<br><br>Campbell was said to be under mental strain and then injuries delayed his return.<br><br>Wenger said: 'There's no better opportunity for him to come back and show his strengths than in a semi-final where you know you will have to defend well.<br><br>'I trust his quality and his strengths. The players trust him as well.<br><br>'Sol was our central defender when we went 49 games unbeaten and that's why everybody still has complete confidence in Sol.<br><br>'I agree that he has shown a weakness in his life on that day - but that can happen to anybody and everybody in our team is capable of understanding that.'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Why isnt he surprised by the goals conceded by Arsenal in the EPL?<br>Tsk tsk tsk</div>

We almost conceded 2 goals, if not for poor finishing from the submarine. Fabregas having poor game. Henry disappear. I wonder thats the logic for resting them.. backfired...<br><br></div>
