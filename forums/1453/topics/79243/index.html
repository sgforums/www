            <div class='col-md body'>I cannot think of a worse signing than El Hadji Diouf under Gerard HoullierÂ’s reign as Liverpool manager.<br><br>Diouf is a player of talent. He is strong, quick and has skill on the ball. He can be a handful for opposing defences and he is the kind of player who will draw defenders out and as a consequence create more space in the middle.<br><br>What an enormous error of judgement though for Houllier to sign a player who has so openly demonstrated that he has no respect or regard for the famous red shirt. He turned up late returning from the African Nations Cup (along with Diao) and his priorities seem to lie in extra curricula activities just before match day. He has shown that he has no regard for the supporters of this club or the team. His temper tantrums verge on the ridiculous at times and he obviously has deep rooted problems concerning self control (the spitting incident at Celtic is a case in point).<br><br>He is one of the worst cheats in the Premiership and spends far too much time rolling around on the ground after the most minimal of contact, if any at all. I, for one, do not want to see that from a Liverpool player. His decent performances have at best been sporadic. It only seems that Diouf is Â‘on fireÂ’ when he has the inclination.<br><br>Houllier has shown many errors of judgement in the transfer market and he has signed some of the most average or talent less players to ever wear the Liver Bird, but Diouf is something different. He isnÂ’t average or talent less. He is the ultimate in wasted talent and wasted big money. He is a player who doesnÂ’t care. He is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the prima donna Premiership.<br><br>In my opinion, the signing of El Hadji Diouf has been HoullierÂ’s biggest single mistake.<br><br><a href="http://www.kopcd.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.kopcd.co.uk</a></div>

WHY ???? they are wasted in Liverpool.)<br><br>Cheyrou - where and when (where can he play and when ?)<br><br>Biscan - 3.5 million (play defender, give free penalty)<br><br>Diouf - Ah Beng turn Gentleman, you wish !<br><br>This is not the END.<br><br>GH is STAYING and more teeth-gritting actions for the fans for the struggle for 4th position next season.<br><br>"We did not play well to qualify, it is just that others plain unlucky"<br><br>- French Medicated Oil<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Worst signing?!  Based on ur points I can't agree more.  But if we're only looking at on-field performances, then he's definitely not alone; I think even Kewell has got 1 more season to prove his real worth...yeah, tat's how dissappointing our recent signings have been.<br><br>Some may argue tat Diouf was played out-of-position.  But if u see the few strikes at goal he had made (excluding those stray ones pls), I'm not sure how effective he can be as an all-out striker.<br><br>Then again, as a winger he has shown tat he can dance n dive...but his crosses were mostly pathetic.  And no, I wun place him in any other positions.  So at the end of the day, I'm not sure whether he's suitable to play at all?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Ok, I've exaggerated...but surely, he has made a mickey out of the money we've paid.<br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">I always say Diouf as a centre forward , not a winger , didn't I ?<br><br>Yet time and time again , we see Diouf in that right hand side without much impact , not his fault actually , he only wanted to play football !<br><br>I wonder you agree with me on this ? Let's make Diouf play centre forward on a lesser Cup games , like Worthington Cup ! And see what he can do , and at the same time , rest the likes of Owen and Co !<br><br>So what we lose ? We'll lose eventually ! It's not an important competition afterall !  Win or lose , at least this is the chance to see the true of him !</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">I'm not sure if it's too harsh to say GH hasn't got the guts to experiment!?  Yet time n again, we see him doing so with the likes of Biscan, Traore, Heskey n even Kewell - playing them in "new" roles.<br><br>I'm really not sure how good Diouf is as a centre forward...if not wrong, he din score for Senegal during the last World Cup finals.  And basing on the few attempts he made in the Reds' shirt, he looks like a very poor striker - either way off-targets or very lame.<br><br>It might be too late for him already - dun think he's in GH's good book anymore...so dun be surprise if he leaves during summer.<br></span></span></div>
