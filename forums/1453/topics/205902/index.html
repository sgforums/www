            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>KOPTALK understands that Peter Harrison - the agent that represents Blackburn Rovers defender Lucas Neill - is heading to Merseyside in the hope of securing his client a move to Anfield.<br><br>The 28-year-old Australian international is out of contract in the summer of 2007 and so far he's rejected the new offers put to him by his present employers.<br><br>Neill's agent Peter Harrison is expected to attend the Portsmouth-Rovers game today. Afterwards he will hold a mini-conference with his client to discuss their options, one of which could be a move to Anfield.<br><br>The player can negotiate a pre-contract with another club in January. He could then leave Ewood Park on a free at the end of the season. However, Rovers may opt to cash in now or in January rather than letting him go for nothing.<br><br>Liverpool fans will recall the nasty incident when he broke Jamie Carragher's leg in the 2003-04 season which sparked a bitter feud between Gerard Houllier and Graeme Souness. Weeks later Neill saw red again against Liverpool when the two sides met in the Carling Cup.<br><br>Although he was public enemy number one back then, it would appear he's been promoted to Rafa's list of 'possibles'.</blockquote><a href="http://www.koptalk.com/detail_subtitle_listing.php?link_id=4094&amp;subid=2&amp;sticky=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.koptalk.com/detail_subtitle_listing.php?link_id=4094&amp;subid=2&amp;sticky=0</a><br><br>Interesting....</div>

'Buy Rick, buy!')<br><br>Neill's contract is up next summer so even if Rovers play hard to get, under new FIFA rules, players aged 28 or over can buy out their contract in the final year of their deal.</blockquote>Come to think of it, instead of having him around breaking Liverpool players' legs, why not buy him to break other players' legs. I loved to see players like Robben, Drogba, Henry having their legs off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
