            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Feb. 6, 2006<br>Robben reaction has Reds fuming<br><br>Former Liverpool skipper Jamie Redknapp has joined Reds boss Rafael Benitez in accusing Arjen Robben of play-acting in the incident which saw Jose Reina sent off during Sunday's 2-0 loss at Chelsea.<br><br>A goal in each half, from French defender William Gallas and Argentina striker Hernan Crespo, restored Chelsea's 15-point lead at the top of the Premiership and increased the gap between them and third-placed Liverpool to an awesome 21 points.<br><br>But it was the dismissal of Liverpool goalkeeper Reina for pushing Robben in the face nine minutes from time which dominated the post-match inquest.<br><br>Benitez accused Chelsea's Dutch winger of making the most of Reina's push and the club plans to appeal against the decision.<br><br>Redknapp, speaking on Sky Sports, sympathised with that view and said: 'For something so silly, I think I'd have booked Arjen Robben, to be honest.<br><br>'For me that's nothing. To go down like that is wrong and I'm sure he'll be embarrassed when he sees it. He'll be embarrassed by his behaviour.<br><br>'At times he illuminates the match and does some great things, that's what we want to see from Arjen Robben because he's a lovely player to watch.<br><br>'Certainly that isn't what I want to see.'<br><br>Liverpool will be allowed to appeal against Reina's red card after referee Alan Wiley confirmed he was booked for a disgraceful lunge at Chelsea substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen and then dismissed for raising his hand to Robben.<br><br>But Benitez could not resist a cheeky jibe at Robben's expense when he mocked: 'I must go to the hospital because the injury was so serious that maybe he will be there for one week.<br><br>'Reina has made a mistake because Robben was talking with him and he turns and touches his face, but has he broken his neck?<br><br>'He has dived, it is so clear. I don't understand why you can kick everyone in a game, then you touch one player and you are sent off.<br><br>'What kind of professional can you be against another professional if you leave the other player not playing for three games?'<br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho kept his cool and preferred to dwell on the eight more victories they need to become champions for the second successive year.<br><br>The Blues would have to lose five more games to give the chasing pack a chance and Mourinho insisted that wasn't going to happen.<br><br>'I am not interested in what Benitez has said,' declared Mourinho. 'I have just finished a big game, a game that we won and played very well. A game that we should have won three or four to zero.<br><br>'We need eight victories, it is as simple as that, as soon as we can. But if it doesn't come to the last match it is not important. We just want to be champions again and we are not far from it.'<br><br>'This is the kind of result and performance that I think everybody understands why we are champions and why we are so close to being champions again. I don't think we will lose five matches.'<br><br></div>
