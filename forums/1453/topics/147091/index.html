            <div class='col-md body'>Milan Baros today put pen-to-paper on a four-year Villa deal and immediately set his sights on Europe.<br><br>The Czech international striker, set for a Claret and Blue bow at home to Blackburn on Saturday, cannot wait to start banging in the goals for Villa.<br><br>And he revealed compatriot Patrik Berger and David O'Leary played a major part in his decision to quit the European champions for Villa Park.<br><br>Baros told www.avfc.co.uk: "Of course I am very pleased to join Villa. It is not easy to leave Liverpool, but Villa are also a big club, so I am happy to come here.<br><br>"It is nice to be here and I am looking forward to making my debut on Saturday against Blackburn at Villa Park, when I will do my very best to open with a goal.<br><br>"I spoke to David O'Leary at length and he was a big factor in my deciding to come here. It was a big decision for me, but if the manager wants you it is easier and David's influence was one of the reasons I am here.<br><br>"I used to play alongside Patrik Berger at Liverpool and also with the CzechRepublic. So I spoke to him and he said so many good things about Villa to encourage me to join."<br><br>He continued: "Hopefully my best years are still to come. I am still young and very ambitious. I want to achieve things here with Aston Villa.<br><br>"I think there are some quality players here and hopefully we can qualify to play in Europe next season. That would be great for the club, the players and the fans.<br><br>"I am impressed with this club. There is lots of quality here and together I think we can go forward this season. I just can't wait to play and start scoring."</div>
