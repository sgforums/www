            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">L'Pool improve alot on their passing and control capabilities . No doubt !<br><br>Still a need of improvement in those long-balls habits .... no point playing long ball if there's Baros and Garcia upfront , they're not natural aerial fella !<br><br>Unless Rafa signed Morientes ! </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>think kewell is unfit and off form. Against blackburn his first touch was lousy and he seem contented to let the ball come to him instead of chasing for the ball. warnock is a much better left winger compared to kewell and i hope kewell would start to improve.</div>
