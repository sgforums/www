              <p>Liverpool
              manager Rafael Benitez has warned of the danger of getting carried away
              with his team's impressive start to the season ahead of his 250th game
              in charge against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>The Reds are unbeaten in the Premier League and are only behind
              leaders Chelsea on goal difference having followed up a notable victory
              over Manchester United at Anfield with a 2-0 win over Everton in the
              Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Saturday.</p>
              <p>After initially scraping past a resilient and impressive
              Standard Liege side in a difficult qualification tie, Liverpool began
              their Group D campaign with victory in Marseille.</p>
              <p>Now they face PSV at Anfield on Wednesday knowing that another
              three points will put them well on the way to qualification for the
              knock-out stages.</p>
              <p>It is a major change from their position at this point last
              season when Liverpool were seemingly doing all they could to be knocked
              out of the tournament with some dreadful, sloppy performances.</p>
              <p>But with just two defeats in their last 29 games in all
              competitions - and one in their last 12 - the Reds are beginning to
              show signs that they could be serious contenders on several fronts and
              Benitez admitted that is a situation which slightly concerns him.</p>
              <p>"When you are playing well and winning games, with everyone
              talking about how good you are, it is important to calm down and get
              people talking only about the next game," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is a dangerous when you hear people talking well about your
              team, then we have to make sure we do not listen to what is being said
              but just concentrate on the future.</p>
              <p>"But it is better to manage expectations, like we are, than be bottom of the table and trying to motivate players."</p>
              <p>Benitez will have key midfielder Javier Mascherano back from a
              calf injury to face the Eredivisie champions and has no other worries
              as he attempts to score another European victory, which would be the
              first time they have ever won their opening two group fixtures.</p>
              <p>The problem now for the Spaniard is the rampant expectation that leads many to assume they will beat sides like PSV at home.</p>
              <p>It does not help the Anfield coach's call for calm and concentration when Liverpool have such a good record against Eindhoven.</p>
              <p>In 2006/07, on the way to the Athens final against AC Milan, Liverpool met the Dutch club four times in the competition.</p>
              <p>The sides played out a goalless draw in Holland in the group
              stages with Liverpool winning the return 2-0, and they met again in the
              quarter-final with the Reds winning 3-0 away and by a one-goal margin
              at Anfield.</p>
              <p>"PSV are a different side with a different manager and many
              players since the last time we played them in Europe," Benitez
              explained.</p>
              <p>"Yes, we have beaten them at Anfield twice, but that is when things can be dangerous. People expect things to happen.</p>
              <p>"The fact that PSV lost their opening group match to Atletico Madrid is also a problem for us.</p>
              <p>"They have to get something here now and they will sit and defend and try to catch us on the counter-attack.</p>
              <p>"Technically they are very good and they are equally impressive using such tactics. We must be very careful.</p>
              <p>"Now when we are in a good situation, people are really happy,
              and everybody is expecting to see the team playing well and scoring
              goals. But I think it's more important to be concentrated to be focused
              and keep on winning."</p>
              <p>Benitez continued: "We had plenty of critics earlier in the
              season who said we were winning but not playing well. That is true, and
              we have plenty of room for improvement still.</p>
              <p>"We are still suffering from players who have come back to us after a hard summer playing in the Euro 2008 finals.</p>
              <p>"If we can continue to improve physically, I would be happier.
              Tactically the team is well organised and the players understand what
              they are doing.</p>
              <p>"We just have to keep going this way and make sure that we do
              not experience what happened last season when we started out group
              matches badly.</p>
              <p>"If we can win this one and then next in Madrid, we will be
              almost there. But you are always almost there until you finally achieve
              it, nobody can relax."</p>
