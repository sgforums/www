He is more willing to get stuck in, get into tackles and challenges. Basically he has toughen up which is a good thing. But if I need someone who can tackle, I rather throw in Momo.<br><br>What makes Ah Bi valuable are his crosses from deep. Last year I was watching the Liverpool against Spurs game. After watching his 1997th inch perfect cross to the flank during the game, I explained to my friend that we have bought a robot designed to cross.<br><br>This year I noticed quite a lot of his crosses went hay-wire. I hope he hits form as soon as possible. We need him to be at his best for Sunday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's what so good about L'pool midfield , we have so many capable midfielders , cater for different situation .<br><br>Look at Momo , he's currently one of the LFC's best midfielder , yet he's on the bench , that well said about our selection .<br><br>And Did , what can i say , before the start of the season , some said he's off his peak ...... but hey hey ..... saw what Didi did on Lampard and Essien ? Yeah , Didi shut their "water-supply" down .<br><br></div>
