            <div class='col-md body'>though its another goalless draw from liverpool (what's new?), i applaud their adventurous effort. they chose not to sit back in their half against an in-form chelsea team.<br><br>most importantly, they show that they need not have to spend multi-multi-millions to match against a team that does.<br><br>all credits to the defenders who were outstanding tonight, closing down all advances and made so many vital interceptions.<br><br>a pity liverpool didnt get the penalty decisions in their favour on both occasions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some personal conclusion 4 the match (which i lost $$$  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> )<br><br>1) Chelsea seems 2 have penalty immunity at Anfield, no matter how many times they commit an offence in the penalty area, the ref will shoot bird 4 a  few seconds... WTF!<br><br>2) Benitez again place Cisse on right wing. i think result would have much diff if he n crouch were 2 partner each other upfront. mayb its jus a temp solution will Jan when they will buy right MF?? i dunno...<br><br>3) Luis Garcia last night was a nobody, except giving possession away. he is always trying 2 b too fanciful, it is so ez 4 chelsea players 2 take the ball off him. aint he suppose 2 start the attacks goin?? (scratch head)<br><br>4) chelsea players r jus like porto players in the past. the motto is "we dive n get the opponents booked, we commit fouls but in a way will not get booked somehow"<br><br><span style="color: red;">HOPE THIS SUNDAY LIVERPOOL CAN BEAT CHELSEA PLEASE!!!</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I felt that we controlled the game better, especially in the second half...<br><br>Observations during the game:<br><br>1) Sinama Pongolle is the best option for the right midfield position, at least he can dribble a bit<br><br>2) For a change, Djibril Cisse did not moan and sulk at his own team mates during the game, this is probably the first time I've seen something like that. Nice to see that his attitude is finally changing.<br><br>3) Traore is a clown sometimes (due to his lack of concentration)...but he has proven himself to be one of the best defender to have in a one-on-one situation. He managed to mark Duff and Shuan Wright Philips out of the game. In the last encounter against Betis. I thought he did well against Joaquin as well.<br><br>Negatives about the game:<br><br>1) Alonso had the worst game I've ever seen him played since his transfer last year. Moanino probably knew that Alonso can turn the game around with his deep crosses and decides to give him some special attention...Essien was breathing down Alonso's neck everytime he gets the ball. Xabi will need to learn to be more composed on the ball.<br><br>2) Reina and little Luis had their usual game...brilliant one moment, absolute shite the next. If only they can be more consistent.<br><br>3) I'm a big fan of Peter Crouch...but I have to admit he is looking less and less like a striker. A striker first and foremost must get us some goals! What we need now are good wingers who can actually cross the ball...<br><br>Man of the Match (Liverpool) : Stevie G - Center of everything positive during the game. We only looked dangerous when he has the ball. But I hope he finds his scoring boots soon.<br><br>Man of the Match (Chelsea) : Moanino. I give him 10 out of 10 for his pouting and sulking during the game.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the handball or ball to hand is debatable but the sliding tackle on Sami Hypia was clearly a Peantly and Liverpool was the better side during the game internally in my heart I felt that Liverpool won this match even though this game go down in history as a draw !</div>
