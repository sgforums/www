To be at the bottom of the table and then get promoted is really good.<br><br>"He needs time to prove how good he is but I think he did something really special.<br><br>"Hopefully they will still be in the league next season. I think he is a good manager now but I think he could be great in the future."<br><br>The Liverpool boss believes his players will have to be on top form to return to Merseyside with all three points this weekend.<br><br>Benitez is wary of feeling the backlash from Sunderland's 3-0 defeat to Wigan last Saturday.<br><br>"After losing 3-0 they will be desperate to win, especially at home. They have good supporters and it will be a tough game for us." </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Roy Keane has responded to praise from Rafa Benitez with a prediction that Liverpool could win the Barclays Premier League this season. </strong><br><br>Benitez claimed at a press conference on Thursday that the Sunderland boss could one day join the legion of great managers.<br><br>As his side prepares to welcome the Reds to the Stadium of Light, Keane replied: "I really rate Liverpool and I think that with the signings they have made and the way the club has developed, they are stronger this season than they were last.<br><br>"Liverpool are a very good team and I watched them play brilliant football last week. The fact is, they will believe that with the squad they have they can win the title this season.<br><br>"I don't think you can look further than the established top four when you're looking at who will win the league. People talk about Tottenham breaking into that group but I'm not so sure." </blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
