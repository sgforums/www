            <div class='col-md body'>Although GH have done badly this season, but let us not forget that he brought us some trophies in recent years.<br><br>GH finally got it rite with his line-up. He has been experimenting with his new signings in the first half of the season and end up much worse. This current formation is the best we have seen so far.<br>Carragher, being a no-nonsense defender, is a excellent centreback much faster than henchoz. With Murphy, Gerrard and Kewell providing the creative sparks, finally Owen and Heskey is getting their shots in.I believe he will keep his lineup for the final match unless any injuries.<br></div>
