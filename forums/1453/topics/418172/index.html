              <span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="color: #800080;">Liverpool</span> qualified for the next stage of the Europa League after a drab draw with <span style="color: #0066cc;">FC Utrecht</span> saw the Reds finish top of Group K. <span style="color: #0066cc;">Roy Hodgson</span>'s men had qualification wrapped up before kick off and this was reflected in the game that ensued.<br><br>The match was never going to be an advert for the glamour and sheer entertainment that the Europa League can bring. Liverpool had all but won the group and with no reason to risk the big guns, Roy Hodgson didn’t. To the bench went Fernando Torres, Dirk Kuyt and Raul Meireles, and in came Nathan Eccleston, Jonjo Shelvey and Bradley Jones to make a rare start.  <br><br>Not only was Hodgson not really interested but neither were the Merseyside public as a generous admission offer was put in place to try and encourage the Reds’ faithful to turn up. At times, the majority would have wished they’d stayed at home and watched it for free.<br><br>FC Utrecht were never going to seriously threaten Liverpool and this allowed Hodgson’s side to play the game at their own, lethargic pace. One would assume that in a situation like this Liverpool would have made nominated Joe Cole as primary playmaker and supplied him with the ball at every chance. Strangely, this was not the case as the England man was anonymous for large portions of the game.  <br><br>What attacking effort there was came mainly from Liverpool and they took the early initiative. The most noteworthy moment of a turgid, tepid first half was courtesy of Milan Jovanovic, who made the Utrecht ‘keeper, Michel Vorm work as he hit a thunderbolt of a shot from 30 yards out which clattered off the crossbar after the lightest of touches from the ‘keeper.<br><br>The first half will be quickly forgotten for the distinct lack of interest save for the horrible injury to Ricky van Wolfswinkel. The young Dutchman was jumping for a header with Martin Kelly when he landed squarely on his right shoulder and failed to get up.  <br><br>The game was stopped as treatment was given. It became clear that the injury was serious and the stretcher was called for. Initial reports from the tunnel were that he had broken his collarbone and he was taken to hospital for further care. A sad end to a dismal half.<br><br>The second half continued in similar fashion to the first with little attacking from either side. As the hour mark approached Liverpool carved open the Utrecht defence with excellent wide play.  <br><br>Full-back Martin Kelly got forward to get involved in an attacking phase and his run down the right wing produced a low cross from the byline which beat the defender yet as flew across the face of the goal, Ryan Babel’s late run into the box came up a little short and the first clean cut chance of the night was squandered.<br><br>With that chance, Anfield woke from its slumber and the atmosphere, so lacking earlier, was back.  It must be noted however it was the Utrecht fans who were making the most noise. A Dutch rendition of Yellow Submarine was the song of choice, but on their trip to Liverpool it was the clear choice.<br><br>The most popular decision of the night was the replacement of Milan Jovanovic with Kuyt. Kuyt received as good a reception from the Dutch visitors as The Kop, as he spent the first five years of his career with Utrecht.<br><br>As the game staggered to the end, Joe Cole could have erased the poor performance which had come before when a free kick was awarded outside the Utrecht box. Cole, who earned the kick, stepped up and smashed it into the wall. A crystallising moment to sum up a poor game, but one which ensures Liverpool will be in the draw on Friday. <br><br></span></div>
