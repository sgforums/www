            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool looked better with 2 strikers up front, even though Crouch should have done better.<br><br>Cisse is a good player. All he needs is a regular run out in the team. Its no use playing him today and resting him next weekend. He needs to find his momentum. Once he does that, he will get the goals.<br><br>Morientes needs to find form. All players do. You cannot expect Nando to come back from a long layoff and start to score goals. Same with Cisse, he needs a regular run out.<br><br>Crouch. I don't know, but he seems to be crappy thus far. I know he is tall. But He ought to do more than knock down balls and flick balls over defenders. As a striker, he needs to start scoring goals or at least create chances. He's not doing both now and he needs to start soon.<br><br>Liverpool were lucky to beat Blackburn. For a while, a draw looked the likely result.<br><br>Now, Rafa shd give Cisse and Morientes a regular run up front. These 2 can play together and can get LFC plenty of goals. All they need is time and momentum. Crouch can be a useful option on the bench.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion:<br><br>Liverpool were a bunched of "san sa" (scattered sand). There's totally no coordination in their play. You can see players screaming at each other where the ball shall have been played.<br><br>This is where Jose Mourinho did very well with Chelsea. He managed to make them into a cohesive team in a very short time. Rafa seems to be more concerned with tactics rather than player management and team building.<br><br>Again, same problem, they need to get more crosses in for Crouch to capitalise instead of using him as a "Heskey". He'll end up like Heskey again soon enough.<br><br>Cisse, as usual, was simply off-form or no form at all. I now ironically look forward to his "shoot the ball to Row Z" routine. He does that every few times in a match. That's not what a striker is stupposed to be doing.<br><br>Nando needs a few more matches to really get on fire. He has the talent, like many others in the Liverpool team. It's a matter of whether Rafa can be like Didier Deschamps and bring out his hot goalscoring form.<br><br>My 2 cents.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that Liverpool is playing like a team of scattered sand.<br><br>Some of the players that were injured last season - Alonso ? Cisse ? was playing this season.<br><br>They dun quite fit into the game.<br><br>The reason why Liverpool does not play well is that Ah Ben like to change his formation during the match.<br><br>So, 4-4-2 formation can suddenly change to 4-5-1 formation.<br><br>I am sad to say that the present team end up not playing well in any formation at all.<br><br>The player seem to be playing out of position.<br><br>Chelsea play well due to the coach giving what the player is good at.<br><br>Like Beckham as a right winger.</div>
