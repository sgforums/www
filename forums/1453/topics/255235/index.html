            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Milan Coach Carlo Ancelotti does not know whether Alberto Gilardino or Pippo Inzaghi will play the Champions League Final against Liverpool.<br><br>The Rossoneri travel to Athens next week for the decider with Liverpool and the tactician has yet to make the final decisions on his team selection.<br><br>Â“I will see their condition, our game plan doesnÂ’t really change with one or the other,Â” said Ancelotti to the Press on Friday.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s the most difficult choice to make. They have both done great things to deserve the Final. Inzaghi was very important in the preliminary round and quarter-final while Gilardino was decisive in the semi-final.<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s more pressure in the Champions League and Gilardino doesnÂ’t have the experience yet to control that pressure. Having said that, I cannot rule out a shared role.<br><br>Â“In any case, I hope the players understand my final choice. I havenÂ’t decided yet, I will do that before Wednesday evening.Â”<br><br>In the meantime, Milan prepare their Serie A match with Udinese, which will be Alessandro CostacurtaÂ’s swansong.<br><br>Â“Costacurta will play tomorrow, the day is dedicated to him, he deserves it,Â” said Ancelotti, his former teammate.<br><br>Â“He is a great champion and a great professional. He is closing his playing career but his experience will be useful for all of us, as he becomes a member of the technical staff.<br><br>Â“I have to thank him and Paolo Maldini for representing the consistency of the Milan philosophy, which is key to the clubÂ’s results.Â”<br><br>Costacurta will wear a special jersey initialled with the letter M for Milan and the shirt will go up for auction, with all proceeds going to charity.<br><br>Ancelotti also commented on Liverpool, after the controversy following his suggestion that Liverpool were the poorest of the four semi-finalists.<br><br>Â“I think Liverpool are the most difficult side to play against. When it comes to quality Manchester United and Chelsea are better. If the tabloid misinterpreted these words I can only confirm that the English are bottom of the media<br></blockquote>doesn't matter which striker they use , not a serious threat to our defense .<br><br>Dangerous man still is Kaka .<br><br>Seedorf will be under our tight control .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>From Skysports : <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zenden injury leaves Kewell in line for Athens</strong></span></span><br><br>The door has been opened for Harry Kewell to make a remarkable comeback in the Champions League final due to an unlucky training ground injury to Bolo Zenden.<br><br>The Dutch midfielder is on crutches after sustaining the injury at Liverpool's La Manga training camp in Spain, ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League final against AC Milan in Athens.<br><br>Zenden - out of contract this summer - played in both legs of the semi-final against Chelsea, and was ahead of Kewell in the race for the left-wing spot.<br><br>Kewell has only just returned to action after a year out recovering from groin operations and boss Rafael Benitez - although happy with the Australian's progress - was sceptical that he would have enough match fitness under his belt to play the whole 90 minutes of the final.<br><br>But with Zenden's injury, the Spanish coach may have to seriously consider Kewell, or move full-back John Arne Riise into a midfield role with Alvaro Arbeloa coming in at left-back.<br><br>Chile winger Mark Gonzalez, talking this week about the prospect of leaving the club in the summer after a disappointing season, could also find himself in contention for the left-wing role.<br><br>Liverpool fly back from Spain tomorrow afternoon, and Benitez will give Zenden every chance to prove his fitness.<br><br>Benitez says: 'Bolo has injured his ankle. He's been treated by the doctor and the good news is the swelling is not that bad. We will need to see how it is after more checks.<br><br>'It will be difficult to say he will be fit for the final now, but I won't say no yet. He is strong and determined and it may recover quickly. I still hope he will be okay.<br><br>'It will be a big disappointment for him and for us if it's not possible. Bolo can bring character, experience and tactical knowledge to the team.<br><br>'He is one of the good options for the left side, but now we must see how he recovers and decide what to do.'<br><br>Benitez has confirmed that goalkeeper Jose Reina is, as expected, fit for the final.<br><br>Reina picked up a shoulder injury at Fulham, and was left out of the final home league game against Charlton as a precaution.<br><br>But the Spanish star has trained normally all week in La Manga to dispel any fears that he would struggle to face Milan. Benitez also has number two 'keeper Jerzy Dudek back from a groin injury.<br><br>Benitez must also decide whether Pennant plays on the right, but he has no intention of giving any indication on that position because it would instantly confirm that Steven Gerrard will play in his favoured central midfield role.<br><br>Benitez only has Luis Garcia and Fabio Aurelio on the long-term injured list, although Mohamed Sissoko's chances of playing have been handicapped by injury.<br></blockquote>Not fancy Kewell to feature for the whole match , like to see him in latter part of the game , when the aging men from Milan gets tired off .</div>

Â“To play a final fills you with pride and to do so as the captain for a third time really makes me proud.<br><br>Â“The fact we are playing Liverpool again could be seen as our vendetta, but we have nothing personal against them.<br><br>Â“I think we have got to not think about the opponent too much but concentrate on what Milan know how to do and then accept the result at the end of it.Â”<br><br>Maldini added: Â“I think we have to watch out for (Steven) Gerrard and (Peter) Crouch.<br><br>Â“Gerrard because of the way he gets into good positions and Crouch because of his height, but then danger could come from anybody.<br><br>Â“I would say we are two teams with winning traditions.Â”<br><br>Of his own fitness, Maldini said: Â“I am feeling well. I am preparing myself well physically and I think in that department, Milan lead the way.Â”<br></div>
