              <p>Steven Gerrard has spoken of his pride at captaining Liverpool FC as the Reds chase glory on the domestic and European front this season.</p>
              <p><br>The inspirational number eight has also saluted his teammates and paid tribute to the unsung heroes in the side.<br> <br>"It's an absolute privilege to captain this football club at any time but especially when the team is playing the way it is," said Gerrard.<br> <br>"It makes my job an awful lot easier when you don't have to talk too much to players because they are just doing their jobs without that being needed.<br> <br>"Confidence is really high right now and we're certainly enjoying playing together. We are playing without fear and without anxiety and I think you're seeing some superb football from us in the last couple of weeks.<br> <br>"From front to back everyone is pulling in the right direction for the team.<br> <br>"The goals are coming and I'm certainly enjoying my football at the moment.<br> <br>"I'm playing with magnificent players. Torres and myself have had a lot of pats on the back of late but it's important to acknowledge our teammates who have been fantastic.<br> <br>"That's from the goalkeeper and the defence right through to the front.<br>"The two full backs have been magnificent lately, the centre backs have been the same. I could go right through the team and everyone is doing their job properly long may that continue and hopefully it will right up until the end of the season.<br> <br>"If we keep playing the way we have been over the last three games then it's going to be an exciting finish."<br> <br>The skipper believes the 5-0 thrashing of Aston Villa was so crucial to take into the international break and admits the result has given the team a lot of belief.<br> <br>"It was a perfect result, a great performance and another massive three points," he said.<br> <br>"Before the game we would've taken 1-0 but we ended up scoring five and it could even have been more.<br> <br>"When you play in front of our supporters the expectations are really high. We are expected to blow teams away at Anfield every week but it doesn't work like that<br> <br>"Throughout the season there are going to be times when it is difficult because you are not at your best and you have to grind out results.<br> <br>"But against Villa we were magnificent from start to finish and we got our rewards in front of goal.<br> <br>"It's wide open but I think Man United are still favourites. Obviously the position they are in is better than ours and Chelsea's but we have closed the gap and hopefully they will have another wobble in the future and we will pounce."</p>
