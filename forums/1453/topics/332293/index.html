              </span></p><p>Javier Mascherano aims to emulate his friend Carlos Tevez and win the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Mascherano, 24, admits that he was delighted for his fellow
              Argentina international when he claimed a winner's medal in last
              season's final for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The midfielder was perhaps oblivious to the fact that he was
              probably the only person of a Liverpool persuasion who felt that way
              watching the final in Moscow last May, when the Red Devils beat Chelsea
              on penalties.</p>
              <p>But having arrived in England alongside his friend Tevez at West Ham, he can probably be forgiven for such sentiment.</p>
              <p>Mascherano said: "I have a good relationship with Carlos. He is
              playing for Manchester United and me for Liverpool, but it does not
              matter because we are friends.</p>
              <p>"I am happy for him that he has done well, that he has won the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"When we play against each other, of course, I want to win, to
              beat him. But he is my friend and I am happy for him when he is
              successful.</p>
              <p>"He had the chance to win the Champions League, and when he was
              in Argentina he won the Libertadores Cup. So he has many winner's
              medals now.</p>
              <p>"But we need to separate things. On one side there is football
              where we are rivals, but on the other in our private lives we are
              friends.</p>
              <p>"I have a good friendship with him and his family, football will not change that.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to Carlos after the Champions League final and I told him I was happy for him, but now I want to win it like him."</p>
              <p>Mascherano has recovered from a calf injury to be in Liverpool's
              squad to face PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday in their second Champions
              League Group D match, having won their first at Marseille.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, still unbeaten this season and with only two defeats
              in their last 29 games in all competitions, have hit the sort of form
              that gives their fans belief that the Premier League title can be
              claimed.</p>
              <p>Mascherano said: "I am fit, I can play if the manager wants. I
              have had a short rest with the injury, which coming after the Olympics
              and my busy schedule was good. Now I feel ready to play.</p>
              <p>"Now we want to fight for every competition, we want to compete for the league and in Europe, so we must maintain this level.</p>
              <p>"There will be many difficult games but we must make sure that we keep playing the way we are.</p>
              <p>"I want to win everything, and I know the Champions League and
              the Premier League together are difficult. But let us see where we are
              at the end.</p>
              <p>"As long as we keep going, keep doing the right things, we will see where that takes us."</p>
              <p>Mascherano warned his team-mates, still buoyant from Saturday's
              derby victory over Everton, that they cannot ease off against their
              Dutch opponents on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>He added: "But we must not lose our concentration. PSV have
              lost their first game in this group, so they will be dangerous. They
              will want to surprise us so we must not allow our level to drop.</p>
              <p>"We are stronger than last season, we have more and more
              options. We have players who can perform just as well in several
              positions, so that is good for the manager and the team.</p>
              <p>"We have more mental strength than last season, and we are able
              to recover from poor results much better. We have reached a certain
              level now and the aim is to keep it going all season.</p>
              <p>"We have improved and we can fight for the title and Champions League."</p>
