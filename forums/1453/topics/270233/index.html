            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Jose Mourinho believes Rafael Benitez will be under more pressure than ever to bring the Barclays Premier League title to Liverpool next season.<br><br>The Chelsea manager, who has had a fractious relationship with his opposite number at Anfield since arriving at their respective clubs, has highlighted Benitez's summer spending spree as evidence he will be expected to end the Reds' 17-year championship drought.<br><br>"Everybody wants that pressure because, when you have, it means you have real chances of succeeding," Mourinho said.<br><br>"But you could say the pressure is a bit higher [on Liverpool] because, at this moment, they cannot point at other people.<br><br>"In other years, they could say: 'Oh, these guys, they've spent a lot of money so they have to win'. This season, they have to talk differently. They have high responsibilities and high expectations.<br><br>"In the last three years, it's been Chelsea and Manchester United in the league, and it's been a long time since Liverpool won the Premiership. So they really want it.<br><br>"I heard something earlier this summer - [Steven] Gerrard, [Jamie] Carragher and [John Arne] Riise saying it has to be this season. That's normal, and positive. I cannot complain about that. Everybody wants to achieve it.<br><br>"We want it too, no problem. But it's been four years with Benitez and they want the Premiership. They don't hide it - Benitez, the players, they all speak about winning the title.<br><br>"I think winning nothing last season was frustrating for them, but they've got a good squad and good players, so they'll be better."<br><br>Liverpool have spent around Â£40million this summer, while Manchester United's outlay could top Â£70million if they finally capture West Ham striker Carlos Tevez.<br><br>After an unprecedented four-year spending spree under billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, Chelsea have paid out around Â£16million in the close season. </span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he is just trying to add more pressure on Rafa, by pointing out in public what everyone would have and can see with their own eyes, Jose would be able to make everyone including the fans and the US owner to take a closer look on Liverpool so that any slightly below standard will be felt in full force hence making Rafa job even harder.. but Liverpool fans of today after having witness what Rafa had did for them probably wouldn't turn on him when the chips are down but just that whether the owners will take a different view when things are not going smooth is another thing.</div>
