              <p><strong>Roy Hodgson has been appointed the new manager
                                      of Liverpool FC.</strong></p>

              <div style="display: block;">
              <p>The 62-year-old former Fulham, Inter Milan and Switzerland
                                      manager has agreed terms with the club on a 
              three-year contract and
                                      becomes the 18<sup>th</sup> manager in our 
              history.</p>
              <p>He will be unveiled to the world's media this
               afternoon after
                                      overseeing the first day of pre-season training 
              at Melwood.</p>
              <p>Hodgson joins us from Fulham, where he guided
               the Cottagers
                                      to the Europa League final in May and was voted 
              Manager of the Year
                                      by the League Managers' Association.</p>
              <p>He exclusively told Liverpoolfc.tv: "This is 
              the biggest job in
                                      club football and I'm honoured to be taking on 
              the role of manager
                                      of Britain's most successful football club. I 
              look forward to
                                      meeting the players and the supporters and 
              getting down to work at

               Hodgson was today confirmed as Liverpool's 18th manager - but what do 
              you really know about our new gaffer? Here are 10 facts we've dug up...</p>
              <div class="ArticleRight">
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;"><img src="http://assets1.liverpoolfc.tv/uploads/misc/managers/royhodgson/art_roy_hodgson_1.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;"><br></div>
              </div>
              
              <p>1. Roy's 34-year livelihood in management has taken him to 12 clubs 
              in six countries, as well as three spells in charge of national teams. 
              He likens his career to Russian expressionist painter Wassily Kandinsky.
               "I've gone sideways, backwards and then upwards again. If you did a 
              graph of my career it would look like a Kandinsky painting."</p>
              <p>2. When it comes to literature, Hodgson admits to being a fan of 
              Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Philip Roth, whose titles include 'The 
              Ghost Writer' and 'American Pastoral'. He is also an admirer of the work
               of Milan Kunder and John Updike.</p>
              <p>3. Roy shouldn't have much trouble getting his views across to 
              Liverpool's cosmopolitan squad - he is fluent in several languages 
              including Italian, Swedish and Norwegian. He is also known to speak good
               German and some Danish, Japanese, French and Finnish.</p>
              <p>4. Hodgson has participated in four UEFA Technical Study Groups and 
              one with FIFA. He was invited to Euro 2008 as a member of UEFA's 
              Technical Team.</p>
              <p>5. Prior to his achievements in leading Fulham to the Europa League 
              final, Hodgson had previously described his first job in Sweden as his 
              finest moment. He said: "My greatest achievement would have to be the 
              water-into-wine job at Halmstads."</p>
              <p>6. Any new signing declaring his 'love' of Liverpool FC should 
              beware. Hodgson once told the Telegraph newspaper: "We get all these 
              agents saying their man would 'love to play for you, he's always loved 
              Fulham Football Club'. What they are really saying is his wife wants to 
              do a bit of shopping in Harrods. Once you've seen past that the next 
              question is what sort of wages do you want. They umm and arr until you 
              press them. Then you just say 'Don't bother ringing, don't waste our 
              time or yours'."</p>
              <p>7. If it wasn't already obvious from the vast number of countries he 
              has managed in, Hodgson admits to having a love of travelling. "I'm 
              lucky in that my job has taken me places and I always try to get out of 
              the hotel and see the churches and sights."</p>
              <p>8. Such was Hodgson's impact at Fulham that one of the Cottagers' 
              celebrity fans, Hugh Grant, famously quipped at a film premiere: "I want
               to sleep with Roy Hodgson!"</p>
              <p>9. Hodgson is a bit of a culture vulture. Not only does he enjoy 
              literature but he is also a connoisseur of foreign film. Gerard 
              Depardieu's recent French hit 'The Singer' is amongst his favourites.</p>
              <p>10. Roy is a qualified PE teacher and is already well-informed when 
              it comes to Liverpool culture as his wife Sheila hails from the city.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">STEVEN GERRARD has hailed new Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson as the right 
              man to 
              bring back the glory days.</h2>
              <p>Hodgson was named as the successor to Rafa Benitez on Thursday morning 
              after a 
              four-week search by the club.</p>
              <p>The former Fulham manager agreed a three-year deal and will be aiming to
               get 
              Liverpool back among the Champions League elite.</p>
              <p>And Reds captain Gerrard, 30, is confident Hodgson will lead the club 
              back 
              from last season's disappointing seventh-place finish in the Premier 
              League.</p>
              <p>He said: "The club have made a good appointment in Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>"Rafa left a few weeks ago and I know the club were determined to take 
              their 
              time and get the right man for the job.</p>
              <p>"Roy is hugely experienced and I believe he is the right man for 
              Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"I think it's been worth the wait and I'm sure he's just keen now to get
               
              on with it and start to quickly put in place his plans for the new 
              season."</p>
              <p>Gerrard's backing for Hodgson will come as a relief to Kop fans, who 
              have been 
              concerned with stories linking their inspirational skipper with a move 
              to 
              Real Madrid this summer.</p>

              <p>there you go again, for not appointing a top notch manager who can win trophies. appointing the wrong manager can be expensive, wasting of time, not to mention frustration to the fans. liverpool haphazardly appointed managers like souness and roy evans after daglish resigned in 1991, who basically ruined liverpool in the early to mid 90s. basically a lost decade, and from a decade to 2 decades.</p>
              <p>Although Houllier and Rafa won trophies like CL, Uefa Cup and FA cups, but they could not deliver on the bread and butter of the league title, as these are cup competitions. their brand of football is also bland and defensive, a throwback to the cavaliar liverpool of the 70s and 80s.</p>

              <p>I agree with Roo on getting the right manager.</p>
              <p>At this moment, Liverpool will need some one with the experience and bring back the fighting spirit back and regroup the team.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is good for tactics and sucks at his people and player management.</p>
              <p>Ah Roy should be able to motivate the players and bring out the best from fringe players like Babel.</p>
              <p>He is the down to earth manager that Liverpool would need.</p>
              <p>I am not mounting unrealistic expectations on Ah Roy as he is brought in to build the foundation for the team.</p>
              <p>But, he will be faced with the unpopular decision of letting go some key players and not winning for the tough games.</p>
              <p>So, I guess there is nothing to blame as he need time and resource to re-build his new baby.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Roy's target is top 4 finishing and qualify for CL and win cup competitions like Europa League, FA/League Cup. so the wait for liverpool's first title since 1990, I am afraid will continue. I am not sure if the fans are willing to put up with not winning the league title any longer.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>so who is the world class managers who can win trophies at liverpool? Mourinho just joined RM. dun think Wenger is interested to manage liverpool. Ferguson, hell no lol, even if he is 20 years younger. Pepe Guardiola, young and swashbuckling manager of Barcelona, dun think he will. not to mention with the 2 yankees still the owner of liverpool, dun tink any top notch manager will want to manager liverpool, given the lack of funds and the debt amount. the problem at liverpool is manifold I am afraid.</p></div>
