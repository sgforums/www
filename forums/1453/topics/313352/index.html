              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Liverpool star Kuyt: I know the ref but he didn't do me a favour against Arsenal.</strong></span></p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/088arslivDM_468x452.jpg"><strong><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/088arslivDM_468x452.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="278"></strong></a></p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt, the man at the centre of the penalty controversy in the Champions League quarter-final first leg at Emirates Stadium, denied referee and fellow Dutchman Pieter Vink had done him a favour by rejecting what looked like a blatant spot-kick. Kuyt, who capped an outstanding display by scoring Liverpool's equaliser in a 1-1 first leg draw, admitted that he knew Vink and came from the same area of Holland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The official hails from a town just outside Amsterdam called Noordwijkerhout, which is only 5km from the striker's home town of Katwijk aan Zee. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was strongly critical of Vink after Kuyt appeared to pull Alexander Hleb back in the box in the second half but Liverpool's Dutch striker believes the official was correct with his decision to wave play on.</p>
              <p>"I think the referee got the decision right," said Kuyt. "I did touch Hleb but I didn't pull his shirt or hold him. It was close to be fair but he didn't deserve a penalty. "I do know the referee. I played in Holland lots of times where he was the referee and he was the official when we played Feyenoord earlier this season. We both come from the same area. He comes from Leiden and that is the place where I grew up also.</p>
              <p>"It is wrong, though, to say that, because I know the referee, he made decisions in my favour. He made a good decision against Arsenal with the penalty. There were no favours."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/wengerDM0304_468x532.jpg"><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/wengerDM0304_468x532.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="327"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Can't look: Arsene Wenger was upset by Arsenal's luck</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wenger understandably, though, disagreed. "There was a blatant penalty," said the Arsenal manager. "It was not given - and just under the eye of the referee. This sort of thing has happened to us frequently and with the referee that close, it should have been given. If he is in a bad position we can see why it wasn't given but he was so close to Kuyt and still didn't give the penalty. It is difficult to understand why it wasn't given."</strong></p>
              <p>Kuyt believes his team now have the edge but expects a tough second leg against an Arsenal side he described as "playing the best football in Europe". He added: "I wouldn't say we are favourites. Champions League matches are very close and you never know what is going to happen in them."</p>
              <p>Arsenal had taken a 23rd minute lead through an Emmanuel Adebayor header but Liverpool were back on level terms three minutes later when Kuyt slid home Steven Gerrard's cross from the left. Arsenal's Robin Van Persie, who went off at half-time with a thigh injury, is a doubt for Saturday's Premier League match between the two sides.</p>
