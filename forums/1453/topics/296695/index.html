            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capello set for England talks</span><br>The Football Association are ready to make Fabio Capello the new England manager.<br><br>Confirmation of Jose Mourinho's withdrawal from the race to succeed Steve McClaren has paved the way for Capello to take the job, providing he backs up a publicly-stated desire to lead England back to the pinnacle of the international game in face-to-face meetings with FA chief executive Brian Barwick.<br><br>While the pair, and FA director of football development Sir Trevor Brooking, have yet to meet, talks have taken place with Capello's advisors.<br><br>It is anticipated the 61-year-old will fly into London at some point within the next 48 hours and, although Martin O'Neill, Marcello Lippi and Jurgen Klinsmann continue to be discussed, it now appears inevitable Capello will get the job.<br><br>A veteran of nine title wins during an illustrious career which has encompassed spells at Juventus, AC Milan and Real Madrid, Capello certainly fits the 'world-class' tag Barwick insisted was the minimum criteria required to replace McClaren, who was axed in the wake of England's failure to reach Euro 2008.<br><br>Capello's name immediately cropped up once McClaren's dismissal was confirmed and, with FA insiders quickly stating the Italian's inability to speak English would not prevent him getting the job, was always one of the favourites.<br><br>Mourinho's knowledge of the English game - and popularity among the fans - would have made him a better bet but now that option has been ruled out, Capello has arguably the most impressive CV among the remaining plausible candidates, even though fellow countryman Marcello Lippi steered Italy to World Cup glory last summer.<br><br>Although Capello has been out of work since leaving Real Madrid in June, he is one of the most respected coaches in the game, allying a mental toughness which saw him axe - and then restore - David Beckham from the Spanish giants' starting line-up last term, with an indisputed capability of building successful teams.<br><br>It has already been suggested former Chelsea favourite Gianfranco Zola could be brought into his coaching team, a move that would win favour with English fans, as well as aiding Capello in his battle against the language barrier.<br><br>Former England skipper Alan Shearer and current under-21 coach Stuart Pearce may also be heavily involved if, as appears increasingly likely, Capello is installed.<br><br>Ironically, given the prominence Beckham played in his last job, Capello's first game in charge would be against Switzerland at Wembley on February 6, when the LA Galaxy midfielder is likely to win his 100th cap.<br><br>Pierfilippo Capello, son and adviser of Fabio Capello, has admitted he is waiting for a call from the FA.<br><br>He told Sky Sports: 'The England job is really special.<br><br>'When the FA wants to speak to you, you have to listen. No contact has been made yet, but we are waiting.'</blockquote>Then England will have hope .... I always like Capello .<br><br>How i wish England has got his calibre of candidate .<br><br>Anyway , a world class coach for some world class players .</div>

Beckhma will be the first one to be axed .<br><br>He might changed the skipper too .... not likely , he always like a centre-half to be Captain .<br><br>Not a surprised if he elect Gerrard as first capt , ahead of Terry , cos Gerrard has got more International experiences , more UCL experience and winning one of Europe's biggest prize of UCL . Terry has not won any major International , England need to find a experience skipper that can mananage the team on the pitch .<br><br>Gerrard fits the bill better than Terry .<br><br>Gerrard faced plenty of "Cup-Final " experience , Terry no la .<br><br>Franco Baresi was his captain ...

'I am a proud English manager and would have loved an Englishman to have been in charge.<br><br>'You look at the list of contenders and what he (Capello) has done ticks all the boxes but I just wish he was English. We have now created a situation where it is very hard for an English manager to get to the top of the tree.'<br><br>Hughes, who was in charge of his native Wales before taking the helm at Blackburn Rovers in September 2004, said things were starting to look grim for British managers.<br><br>'The longer it goes on that the top jobs go to foreign coaches, the more difficult it will become for English and British coaches to get the big jobs in the future,' said Hughes.<br><br>'I am disappointed for British coaches because another huge opportunity has been given to a foreign manager.'</div>

Does Steven Gerrard need coaching? Of course not. Or Ashley Cole, John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Micah Richards, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney?<br><br>'You get them for three days before a game, what will you coach them? Would I get Gerrard and coach him on passing a football or Lampard on running on to the ball and hitting it in the top corner from 30 yards?<br><br>'It's not about coaching! It's about picking the players, getting them organised, giving them belief, giving them a platform to play without fear and getting the best out of them.<br><br>'It doesn't need Jurgen Klinsmann or Fabio Capello. Top coaches? It's a fallacy. I've seen one, maybe two in my lifetime, no more.<br><br>'Football is about the management of players. To be manager of England, you don't have to be a great coach - they don't exist - you have to be a manager.'<br><br>He added of Capello: 'I'm not unhappy with his appointment. I just think the manager of England should be English.'<br><br>Redknapp is upset his opinion was not canvassed by Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick, who consulted a number of top managers prior to Capello's appointment.<br><br>However, following his recent high-profile arrest by police investigating corruption in football, the Pompey chief gave up on getting the job itself.<br><br>Redknapp, who insists the probe has nothing to do with him personally, said: 'Yeah, I'd like to have spoken to Brian. I know I was never going to get it, but I'm obviously not important. I've only managed for more than 1,000 games, 13 seasons in the Premier League, fifth in the Premier League.<br><br>'Great, talk to Sir Alex Ferguson. Then talk to the others. Great, but why not talk to me? I have plenty to say to him.'<br><br>Despite being snubbed, Redknapp would never turn down England.<br><br>'If England asked, you couldn't say no,' he said.<br><br></div>
