It's going to be a gamble taking in African players. We've seen many African flops at Liverpool over the past 5 years, Rigobert Song, Salif Diao, Diouf. Of course there are the good ones like Titi Camara.But still, Im not so sure. Brazillian players will inject natural flair and flamboyance. But then again, a big gamble as to whether they can adjust to the English way of play. Work permit issues could become a deterrent factor. Same for Argentinians.<br><br>I guess the best kind of players are the proven ones at EPL level. Sometimes, you don't have to look far. Think along the likes of Scott Parker,Stewart Downing,Kevin Davies, Steed Malbranque.</div>
