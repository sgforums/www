              <h1>Roy Hodgson swoops to steal Standard Liege's Steven Defour from under the nose of Sir Alex Ferguson<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>As Inter Milan prepare their first bid for unsettled Liverpool 
              midfielder Javier Mascherano, manager Roy Hodgson has stepped up the 
              search for his replacement.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss was due to watch 
              Standard Liege midfielder Steven Defour in Belgium last night and is 
              considering a £10million bid for a player who is also a target for 
              Manchester United.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/30/article-0-0AA15AD1000005DC-815_468x365.jpg" alt="Old acquaintances: Defour (L) tussles with Gerrard during Champions League clash in 2008" width="468" height="365">

              <p>So keen are United on the 22-year-old Belgium international that
              manager Sir Alex Ferguson wrote him a letter of encouragement when he
              broke his foot last year and has since kept an eye on his year-long
              recovery.</p>
              <p>With Mascherano expressing his desire to leave Anfield, 
              Hodgson and the Liverpool board will not stand in his way but they are 
              determined not to sell him on the cheap to former boss Rafael Benitez.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/30/article-1299064-0AA155FC000005DC-5_468x179.jpg" alt="Injury boost: Sir Alex sent this letter to Defour last year" width="468" height="179">

              <p>The Spaniard and his new employers are prepare for a long fight for 
              the Argentina captain, valued at £25m by Liverpool, and are ready to 
              offer former Portsmouth midfielder Sulley Muntari as part of their first
               offer this week.</p>
              <p>But the Ghana international, a virtual 
              ever-present at Inter under Jose Mourinho, is unlikely to want to quit 
              the San Siro, while Hodgson has his eyes on other options in any case.</p>
              <p>Aston Villa’s Stiliyan Petrov is on his radar, along with Juventus midfielder Christian Poulsen.</p>
              <p>Another
               option for Hodgson is to redeploy Brazil midfielder Lucas Leiva, who 
              was recalled for his country this week by new coach Mano Menezes.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/30/article-0-0A9F5A1C000005DC-629_233x423.jpg" alt="Head and shoulders above: Leiva has impressed during Liverpool's pre-season" width="233" height="423">

              </div>
              <p>He has been captain in Steven Gerrard’s absence for all three games 
              of Hodgson’s tenure, including Thursday’s Europa League triumph in 
              Macedonia.</p>
              <p>While Hodgson looks at alternatives to Mascherano, 
              Lucas says he is ready to step into his shoes and fight for the right to
               keep the position over the coming season.</p>
              <p>Lucas said: ‘Of course we all hope Javier stays because he is such a good player but we’ll just have to wait and see over that.</p>
              <p>‘I’m
               not the same player as Javier, we have different styles, but I am ready
               to play and to impress and do whatever job the manager needs from me.</p>
              <p>‘I
               think I did well last season but I think in this one I can do even 
              better wherever I play. I know I am able to play the role Javier does 
              because last season I played a few games when he was at right back.</p>
              <p>‘I’ve got no problem with doing that job - I know I can do it if that is what the manager wants.’</p>
              <p>Lucas
               will hand over the armband when Gerrard returns to the side. England’s 
              World Cup skipper is expected to play at least 45 minutes in a friendly 
              against Borussia Moenchengladbach in Germany tomorrow, along with Joe 
              Cole, Jamie Carragher and Glen Johnson.</p>
              <p>It has taken Lucas some 
              time to be accepted at Anfield but his solid start to preseason has not 
              gone unnoticed by Hodgson, who has only worked with a threadbare squad 
              so far.</p>
              <p>Lucas added: ‘I know there are a lot of senior players in 
              front of me but I hope I did a good job and that I can stay in the team 
              as well.</p>
              <p>‘If everyone’s back for the second leg I’m sure we will 
              be even better. There is a lot of competition for places, but that can 
              only be good for Liverpool and what we want to do this season.</p>
              <p>‘We
               are expecting positive things this season. We’ve got good players who 
              have come, others who are to come back, and hopefully this year will be a
               lot better than last.’</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, UEFA have confirmed they are to
               investigate claims of racist chants against Liverpool players in 
              Thursday’s 2-0 win over FK Rabotnicki.</p>
