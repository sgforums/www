            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">Gerard Houllier played a major part  , if not all part, in the downhill of LFC !<br><br>We had a decent winning team when he took over , but for whatever reason , he dismantled the whole team ! And got those unknown French from his continent , and start playing like mid-table team !<br><br>We had David Thompson , which he sold to Rovers !<br><br>We had Dominic Matteo , which he sold to Leeds !<br><br>We had Patrick Berger , which he sold to Portsmouth !<br><br>We had Jari Litmanen , which he gave to Ajax !<br><br>We had Robbie Fowler , which he sold to Leeds !<br><br>We had J.Redknapp , which he free to Spurs !<br><br>This is the example of  players , anytime , to name it , can be crucial to LFC Champions' League ambition !<br><br>Let's not forget Robbie Fowler , who scored an over-head kick against Charlton that season and sent Pool into UEFA Champions' League ! This is the example I'm saying ! These are the players that in one game , can perform miracle !<br><br>But GH prefers to kick out the old players , and rely on those French kids , that do not know what's the meaning 'winning' is for - for a Kop follower !<br><br></span></span></div>

GH is not suitable for this hot seat !<br><br>IF Stevie Gerrard wants to resign to LFC all because of GH , let it be ! We can afford without him !<br><br>Anyway , we are used to be ransomed by players ! Stevie is not the first !<br><br>Who knows , there's 10 of Stevie Gerrard at the LFC academy waiting by the wings , standing by for a call-up , who knows ?<br><br>Conclusion : <strong> Sack this french a_s and expect SG to go and see what happen ! I can assure the fans , It'll not be the end of Liverpool Football Club !</strong></span></span></div>
