            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is how it might work out for next season.<br><br><strong>Strikers</strong><br>Cisse out (I know he scored 2 last night, but he's still too inconsistent and I think he doesn't fit into Benitez's game plan most of the time)<br>Pongolle back from loan<br>Fowler contract extended<br>So Strikers would be from the quartet of Crouch, Fowler, Morientes and Pongolle<br>Doesn't seem like Liverpool is gonna be able to sign the right strikers for the right price and knowing Benitez he'll say "Don't sign any then"<br><br><strong>Right midfield</strong><br>Gonzales in<br>Simao in<br>Simao would be first choice for right midfield. Gonzales would be back up to both Simao and Kewell in injuries or rotation<br>I still think area is still a bit short so I won't be surprised if another right midfielder (maybe Giuly on a free?) would be signed as well.<br><br><strong>Left Midfield</strong><br>Kewell is first choice of course.<br>Zenden when fit again would be the other option for injuries and rotation.<br>Riise would also be another option if we have the luxury of fit left backs and the game needs Riise in left midfield<br><br><strong>Central Midfield</strong><br>Sissoko first pick for holding role<br>Hamman as back up for holding role with perhaps Jack Hobbs being groomed as replacement in that position<br>Gerrard-Alonso first pick central partnership<br>Zenden may also be another option as an attacking central midfielder should anyone be injured<br><br>Now for the defence. One thing to note is that any good manager does not rotate the defence unless he has the luxury of great players to rotate amongst which also means he has spent money on them which is a DAMN LUXURY to have that probably only Chelsea can afford! Also defenders don't get injured as often and as likely as attacking players in midfield or strikers by nature that the other players don't tackle defenders!  All this means that you don't need to have that many defenders as there is little variation and less injuries.<br><br><strong>Right back</strong><br>Finnan first choice<br>Kromkamp second choice<br>Antonio Barragan to make his debut at some stage next season<br><br><strong>Left back</strong><br>Riise first choice<br>Fabio Aurelio in from Valencia on a free transfer 2nd choice<br>Stephen Warnock 3rd choice back up. If he doesn't like it, he'll be sold<br>Traore to be sold in the summer<br><br><strong>Centre backs</strong><br>Carragher-Hyppia partnership to start next season and see if Hyppia still has it in him<br>Agger to be back up for Hyppia and for any injuries.<br>Paletta signing in from Argentina will be another prospect. To be groomed as replacement for Carragher.<br><br><strong>Goalkeeper</strong><br>Who else? Reina DA MAN!<br>Carson to be reserve keeper.<br>Dudek to be sold after World Cup<br><br>If this really happens, and there are no major injuries to key players I think Liverpool would be challenging for EPL championship and CL finals at the end of next season.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I pretty much agree with what you think of Cisse's situation. I also agree that Fowler will probably get a 1 yr extension. What i don't think will happen is Sinama Pongolle staying at Anfield. I think he's on the way out as well and I won't be surprised if Morientes leaves too. Rafa will probably bring in 2 new faces upfront to partner Crouch and Fowler.<br><br>Gonzales is coming but the problem is that his preferered position is on the left wing. I don't think Simao is a good idea. After the transfer fiasco, I doubt he is the right player for the club. The right wing pretty much will be LFC's trouble position and I still feel pity that Rafa pulled the plug on Luis Figo at the last minute.<br><br>No problems with the left. Kewell's coming back on song. We've got Zenden. Gonzalez. Risse does a good job there. So there's plenty of choices.<br><br>Same thing with the central of midfield.<br><br>I expect another defender to join. Possibly Gabriel Paletta. That'll make it 4 CBs. A healthy number.<br><br>As for keepers, yeah, I agree that Dudek could be sold after the world cup. We've got Carson and David Martin on healthy standby.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After that injury , Zenden could well be on the way out , and the new inclusion ? Victor free from Deportivo ....... free , why not ?<br><br>Since some claimed we have some striker crisis , why Fowler out ?<br><br>Morientes ? Trust me , his UCL experiences can scared off many of our new players , he will stay , unless he's French !<br><br>Cisse could well be on the most doubtful choice to go out , anyway , we shall see , again , we have a striker crisis , why not keep him ? Unless we have a ready made striker that can perform automatically at this highest level ? Who ?<br><br>Why Traore out ? Who can do a similiar job both at centre of defense and left side of defense and tall ? That new Argentine ? Mind you , we haven't seen him play , how sure are we ?<br><br>One man sure to go - Dudek ! And i am sorry to see him go .<br><br></div>

But from the way the market looks, it doesn't even look like we have any suitable players as targets! And then there's always the question of price. Unless Benitez has some relatively unknown who he sees great potential in.....but again is next season the one to gamble on potential?<br><br>Also a new striker would need time to settle especially if they are not from the EPL. So all signs point to Benitez signing a suitable centre foward from the EPL. But who? I'm not convinced Defoe is the best choice and there is the issue of the fiasco with Tottenham Chairman Daniel Levy.<br><br>Craig Bellamy has a lot of problems in the dressing room and off the field, although he seems the right choice on the field.<br><br>So will Liverpool sign any new strikers? Maybe not. It might be better on the balance of things to stick with the strikers we have and hope they have a better turn of luck or something. I still think Morientes can succeed in the EPL. Cisse needs to accept he will only play in certain matches and not in most as he does not fit into Benitez's starting game plan in most matches. Fowler is a good option with his experience and intelligence. And frankly if Crouch can avoid injury and new right midfielders like Simao and Giuly come to Liverpool, I think Benitez will start with 4-1-4-1 a lot more next season.</div>

The only time he did this often enough was when Gerrard was played as an outright right midfielder.<br><br>Cisse's ball control is terrible. Garcia does stupid things and tends to lose the ball a lot.<br><br>So that's the problem with the RM position and the players we currently have in the team.<br><br>I always wondered why doesn't Rafa play Kromkamp more in the right Midfield position? I suspect he doesn't seem Kromkamp having enough attacking nous for that position.</div>
