              <h2>CARRAGHER - RETURN A ONE-OFF</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Jamie Carragher insists his return to the England squad was a 
              'one-off' and believes Fabio Capello deserves to stay on as coach.</p>
              <p>Liverpool defender Carragher was brought out of international 
              retirement to take up a place in Capello's World Cup squad and made two 
              appearances in South Africa.</p>
              <p>He missed the vital win over Slovenia through suspension and was 
              unable to reclaim his spot in the team for the disastrous 4-1 defeat by 
              Germany which sent England crashing out at the last 16 stage.</p>
              <p>Carragher was delighted to be involved in the tournament, but the
               32-year-old has confirmed he is not planning to be available for 
              national team duty next season.</p>
              <p>"This was a one-off thing," he said. "The manager said he had a 
              few injuries and I came into the squad and helped.</p>
              <p>"I was delighted with the opportunity to play in a World Cup and 
              work with Capello, but I have always said the most important thing for 
              me is Liverpool Football Club."</p>
              <p>England's early demise in South Africa led to calls for Capello 
              to be replaced as coach, but the Football Association has given its 
              backing to the Italian - a decision which finds favour with Carragher.</p>
              <p>He added: "Obviously I wasn't involved in the qualifying stages, 
              but that went great. The World Cup hasn't gone as well - so maybe I'm 
              the problem, not Capello!</p>
              <p>"Bobby Robson went out on a high in 1990, but a few tournaments 
              didn't go too well for him.</p>
              <p>"That's part of the game and I am sure with the experience of 
              this tournament, hopefully the lads will get to the next one and be a 
              lot better for it.</p>
              <p>"I don't think there are many managers out there with the record 
              he has got. I think with that itself he certainly deserves another crack
               at the England job."</p>
              <p>Carragher admits England were poor, but has rubbished suggestions
               that there were divisions within the camp during their time in South 
              Africa.</p>
              <p>He continued: "I have not been in the squad for a while so it was
               new to me in terms of the manager and different things.</p>
              <p>"But I do think with England when things don't go well people are
               always looking for things.</p>
              <p>"People are looking for different reasons why it went wrong, but 
              the bottom line is we just didn't perform well as a football team rather
               than anything else."</p>
