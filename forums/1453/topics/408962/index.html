              <p><br><br>Javier Mascherano is refusing to play for Liverpool against Manchester 
              City on Monday night as he seeks to negotiate a transfer away from the 
              club.<br></p>
              <p>Mascherano is effectively going on strike and doubts will be raised 
              whether he will ever turn out for the club again.</p>
              <p>The player has 
              previously said that he wants out of Anfield this summer, although 
              Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson has remained confident of keeping his star 
              midfielder. However, despite Inter Milan dropping their interest in the 
              Argentine, Barcelona are reported to have made a bid for his services.</p>
              <p><em>The
               Guardian</em> claim that the bid is €15 million (£12.2 million) and 
              includes former Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb and Uruguayan defender
               Martin Caceres as makeweights.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are understood to have 
              rejected the offer as they want €30 million (£24.4 million) up front 
              with no player exchanges as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Mascherano was 
              excellent in the opening draw against Arsenal, but missed the Europa 
              League tie through Trabzonspor through injury - thus allowing him to 
              play in European club competitions if he secures a move before the end 
              of the transfer window next week.</p>
              <p>"He is not here tonight because 
              there is some speculation about his future and his mind is not right, so
               it was not correct to select him," Hodgson told <em>Sky Sports</em> ahead
               of the game.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has not given up hope of getting the chance 
              to select Mascherano again, as the club will not shift from their 
              valuation of the player.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully it will be resolved before the
               end of the transfer window and I will get the chance to select him 
              again, but it was not right tonight," Hodgson added. "The club has got a
               position. We are under pressure from other clubs who want to sign him. 
              There may come a time when the offer matches our valuation, but until 
              that day he stays with us." <br><br><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=816976&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=816976&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=4716</a></p>

              <p>Ah Roy should try out his new players and used his fringe players more instead of begging mascherano to stay.</p>
              <p>Mascherano is a gone case and have a negative effect on the game play.</p>
              <p>It is strange that Liverpool is stuck with lots of soft minded people who dare not make any hard decision to improve the club.</p>
