For all of Rafa's usage of ProZone, I'm surprised he has not see this trend yet. Either he doesn't see it or he chose to ignore it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tactical wise , when Momo is in the team , we played more like a two defensive midfielder formation .... we can't let him go ....<br><br>His role when he's playing is like a "Destroyer" , someone deployed to destroy opposition's rhythm .....<br><br>When Momo is in the team , we saw Alonso playing as protector in front of the defense , and Momo protector of the midfield , and Gerrard manipulating the play alongside the frontmen ...<br><br>Do u think Benitez will let him go to Barcelona ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually think otherwise.<br><br>Whether or not to keep momo would be quite a gamble rather, as he's still young &amp; has time on his side to see whether he further blossoms/deteriorates  as a player.<br><br>Don't think we've seen the best of him yet.<br><br>Either way , it won't hurt to keep him anyway, thats of course unless a some club comes in with a big money offer.. then i'd say we sell him.</div>
