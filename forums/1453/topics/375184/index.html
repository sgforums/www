              Liverpool are set to announce a new shirt sponsorship deal worth Â£80m over four years â€“ the most lucrative in football history and equal to that of Manchester United.
              
              The London-based international bank, Standard Chartered, are believed to be behind the deal starting in mid-2010 which should give the manager, Rafael BenÃ­tez, some much-needed funds for the transfer market.
              
              Liverpool co-owner George Gillet had earlier stated that a new deal was in the offing and that supporters woiuld be impressed by the new sponsor.
              
              "I think people will be pleased and surprised," Gillett told a Canadian radio station. "It will be one of the great, worldwide corporations. And I think it will be a sponsor people will be pleased and surprised to be associated with."
              
              Gillett, who has just agreed a deal to sell his Montreal Canadiens ice hockey franchise in a deal that could be worth as much as $600m (Â£360m), said that Liverpool are in excellent financial condition.
              
              The club is in outstanding shape," Gillett said. "Economically, it's never been stronger. We just paid down our debt very substantially. We have less debt per dollar than any club in the league."

              happy with the deal....if not wrong, stanchart is partly owned by Sg company.
              
              h/r, gillet's words left me perplexed - who are we racing agst for debt-per-dollar?!  wat we want is to top the league!  and tat only happens if we balance the nice financials with quality on the field. 
              
              his words make me worried - does he know anything running a successful football club?  so far, i see his actions n words only show much short-sightedly!!!

              <p><strong>Liverpool FC and Standard Chartered Bank announced today they had agreed a four year deal for the bank to become the club's main sponsor - the largest commercial agreement in Liverpool's history.</strong></p>
              <p>The agreement, which starts in July 2010 and runs through to the end of the 2013-14 season, will see the bank's name and logo appear on the Liverpool shirt. <br>  <br>Liverpool FC is the most successful club in English football, enjoying a global following most recently evidenced in its highly successful pre-season tour of Singapore and Thailand. As official club sponsors, Standard Chartered will enjoy a major rights package which will provide the platform to significantly step up the Bank's brand awareness across its core markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. <br>  <br>Standard Chartered PLC, listed on both London and Hong Kong stock exchanges, ranks among the top 25 companies in the FTSE-100 by market capitalisation. The Bank has more than doubled its revenue and profits over the last five years and has performed consistently well, delivering record results throughout the recent financial crisis. <br>  <br>Christian Purslow, Managing Director of Liverpool Football Club, pictured above signing the contract alongside Standard Chartered chairman John Peace, commented: "This partnership brings together two highly successful organisations with a really strong cultural and strategic fit. The sponsorship opportunity attracted a huge level of interest from a wide array of globally recognised brands and in Standard Chartered we believe we have the ideal partner to move forward and help develop our global ambitions for the club. It is a real sign of the progress we have made at Liverpool that we have been able to secure the largest ever commercial deal in our history." <br>  <br>Peter Sands, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered PLC, said: "This is a great partnership. We are excited to be working with such a famous global brand as Liverpool Football Club for the next four years. This is an outstanding opportunity for Standard Chartered, our customers and shareholders, and for Liverpool, its players and fans <br>  <br>"We see many opportunities to continue growing our business, particularly as Asia, Africa and the Middle East are emerging from the global downturn more quickly than the West. This sponsorship will drive a step change in brand recognition in our key markets and will provide an additional catalyst for our business growth</p>

              <p><strong>Big things expected after Liverpool’s new sponsorship deal</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After securing the biggest sponsorship deal in British football history, <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a> are destined to be bigger and better.</abbr></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Reds have begun a partnership with London-based investment bank Standard Chartered and are now ready to mix it with the big-spenders according to managing director Christian Purslow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This is a statement of intent about our desire to improve and invest in our football team - we want to be the best in the world, and that is what we are about," Purslow explained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I want us to be the best football team in the world and there is a pretty clear link between being the best team and having the best performance off the field. That has not been our position, historically, but there is no reason why, going forward we cannot be the biggest, best-run and most commercially successful football club in the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The fans will be right to ask where the money will go from this deal, and they'll be pleased and relieved to know that <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a>'s revenues, profits and income is the club's.</abbr></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It stays in the club, it doesn't go out of the club, it's job is to support our football team and so I can assure you, as we drive forward our turnover, we will invest a sensible element of that in our wage bill and we will invest a sensible level of our profits in our transfers and none of those monies go anywhere other than into the development of the club."</p>

              <p><strong>Kenny Dalglish believes the club's new sponsorship deal will aid Rafa Benitez in his quest to bring silverware to Anfield. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool today announced the biggest commercial contract in its history, with Standard Chartered set to appear on our shirts for four years from 2010-11. <br>  <br>New club ambassador Dalglish claims the deal is another example of how the Reds are evolving on and off the pitch. <br>  <br>"Like every other Liverpool fan, I want the best assets of this club to be on the pitch - and this deal will help that," Dalglish told Liverpoolfc.tv. <br>  <br>"If it can help Rafa and increase his budget - well that's what everyone wants. <br>  <br>"Success on the pitch leads to success off it and vice versa. It all leads to the same thing - a lot of happy Liverpool supporters. This is a fantastic deal for everybody." <br>  <br>Dalglish met executives at Standard Chartered prior to today's announcement and believes our new partners fit perfectly with the traditions of the club. <br>  <br>"The size of this deal commercially is very important, but equally as important are the people involved," he said. "Standard Chartered are good, solid people. I've met them before and they're very good." <br>  <br>Dalglish thinks Liverpool's global support was a major attraction for our new sponsors. <br>  <br>"The importance of the support Liverpool have in the Far East is very important for them because they have their base there as well as the Middle East and Africa," he added. <br>  <br>"Our support out there was highlighted during our pre-season tour, and I think that time helped make up both minds that this would be a fantastic opportunity. <br>  <br>"This only endorses what a lot of people already knew - that this is one of the most important clubs in world football."</p>

              <p><strong>Standard Chartered explain....</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Standard Chartered, the bank that has signed a world record sponsorship deal with English soccer club Liverpool, has moved to explain the reasoning behind its move into soccer.</p>
              <p>The bank will pay Liverpool more than US$130 million over the next four years as it seeks to increase its business. Its sponsorship of Liverpool, who have been English champions 18 times and European champions five times, is tailored not at either of those regions, but at Asia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"From a Standard Chartered perspective, Asia is our home," senior group brand manager Nicola Apostolis told Asia Sponsorship News. "We opened our first branches in 1858 in Shanghai and Mumbai; and in Hong Kong and Singapore in 1859. Today, 80 per cent of our business is done in Asia.</p>
              <p>"The Liverpool sponsorship is a perfect match in terms of geographic footprint, as the club has a huge following in many of our markets, particularly across Asia."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool claim to have 58 million fans in China, the country identified by many analysts as the nexy key market for the English Premier League. Asia Sponsorship News quotes a study reporting that 90 per cent of Asian sports fans identified the Premier League as the sports competition they follow most closely.</p>
