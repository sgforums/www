              <p>Fabio Aurelio will leave Liverpool
               after failing to agree terms on a new deal.</p>
              <p>The 
              Brazilian defender is out of contract next week and was offered 
              pay-as-you-play terms after suffering with injuries during his four 
              years at the club.</p>
              <p>But Aurelio wanted more security and Rafa 
              Benitez will, reluctantly, show the 30-year-old the door.</p>
              <p>'Fabio's
               contract is nearly finished and he is going to leave us,' said Benitez,
               who signed Aurelio on a Bosman in June 2006 after working with him at 
              Valencia.</p>
              <p>'We had been trying to work something out with regards 
              an extension but it was a pity that we couldn't. He has given us 
              absolutely fantastic service.</p>
              <p>'Fabio is a top professional, a 
              great player and a really good lad. I mean every single word I say about
               him.</p>
              <p>'It has been a pleasure having him here and we really will 
              miss him.'</p>
              <p>Aurelio missed the start of the season with a knee
               injury and his campaign ended in February when he picked up a thigh 
              problem.</p>
              <div id="ext-gen1780" class="moduleHalf"></div>
              <p>Benitez added: 'The one problem we had with Fabio was that he 
              suffered too many injuries and it was such a pity because he has great 
              quality.</p>
              <p>'When he was in the team, we were always to play the
               ball out from the back and keep it because he uses possession so well.</p>
              <p>'With
               Fabio being out so much, it meant that we had to use (Emiliano) Insua 
              more than we would have liked and that was not easy for him.</p>
              <p>'You
               can say things about players. But with Fabio, you are talking about an 
              amazing person who gave 100 per cent all the time. We wish him all the 
              best.'Â </p>
