            <div class='col-md body'>I sure miss that guy..it just seems that with him around last time, we were more robust in attacking and then he was the undisputed penalty taker too.. converting almost 100% of LFC penalties..<br><br>since we sold him, it seems that we've lost alot of our bite..<br>me feels that jari litamen &amp; smicer shouldn't have left as well.. both of them were indeed getting on age , but still, they would have given us more options when it came to rotating the squad.. just like what we're doing now.. esp now that we're having so much games to play..<br><br>although biscan was a nightmare in defence... i though he was alright in midfield no?..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Biscan and Murphy have done what Gerrard have done and what Alonso cannot do.<br><br>Moving forward from Midfield to assist the strikers.<br><br>Score penalty and Free Kick (Murphy only)<br><br>Alonso is a good player but I dun see him moving forward or getting possession of the ball (Only 1st Half of chelsea). (Campbell Soup II)<br><br>Sissoko is in-experienced in commanding the midfield and always seem to be a misfit when played in the central midfield role.<br><br>So, I think Ah Ben have make a wrong choice in discarding Murphy.<br><br>Murphy is Jinx to Man Utd and plugs the hole behind the strikers.<br><br>And the most important of all, willingness to challenge and fight for possession.<br><br>Only one person do that in Liverpool midfield now - Steven Gerrard.<br><br>For the rest of the midfielders, as long as they dun lose possession, I am very happy liao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Selling Murphy is not Benitez's decision , it's Murphy's !<br><br>Benitez told Murphy he is still in his plan that time , but one thing , Murphy has to be contend in the bench sometimes , cos he's bringing in Alonso .<br><br>Murphy openly said he prefer to play for a English manager than a Spanish , his choice la .<br><br>If Liverpool isn't doing well after Murphy left , then that's a regret , but no leh , we won at istanbul ... and most important , we improve , and still improving . That's what matters most .<br><br>Jari Litmanen ? This Finnish legend is a Legend in Holland , not in England la .<br><br>Smicer ? If he's younger , maybe Benitez will keep him . Reason that Benitez has a job to maintain a team of averagely 26 years old .<br><br>Biscan ? He wanted more first team action , Benitez cannot promise him , cos he has plan in midfield for Gerrard &amp; Alonso only .<br><br>Regret overall ? Certainly not at all .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why Liverpool won the champion league is that Ah Ben was lucky enough to change his midfield due to unforeseen injury and the players playing their last match for Liverpool.<br><br>I dun agree that Liverpool have a strong midfield now.<br><br>We dun have an hard midfielders that can hold the ball.<br><br>Only Steven Gerrard and Riise can do that.<br><br>The rest are losing possession more than gaining.<br><br>The reason why they cannot overcome Man Utd or Chelsea is that their midfield is not strong enough and not enough reserve or depth.</div>
