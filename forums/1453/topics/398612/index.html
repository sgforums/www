              <h1>Fernando Torres: If Rafa Benitez is too slow, I'll leave Liverpool 
              (for £70million)<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fernando Torres was anxiously awaiting news of Rafa Benitez’s meeting
               with<br>Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton last night after deciding 
              he wants his uncertain Anfield future resolved in the next week.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s
               record £21million signing is in demand after it became clear Anfield 
              bosses may have to cash in on him, with Chelsea, Manchester City and 
              Barcelona all waiting for any encouragement to open a bidding war that 
              could send the fee soaring to £70m.</p>
              <p>While Benitez presented 
              his argument to Broughton over why any proceeds should go towards 
              strengthening his squad, rather than servicing the club’s debt, Torres 
              was agonising over his next move.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Deadline set: Torres (left) wants no distraction
               as he gets ready for the World Cup</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Alarmed at the way Liverpool’s campaign has petered out and left them
               lagging behind their main rivals, he wants answers on whether Benitez 
              is staying and evidence of a strategy to guard against any repeat of 
              this season’s failings.</p>
              <p>Eager to avoid any unwanted 
              distractions ahead of next month’s World Cup, he has made it clear he 
              needs to know Liverpool’s intentions before he leaves Merseyside next 
              week, in readiness for linking up with the Spain squad. He may be 
              prepared to tolerate one more season without Champions League football 
              but is ready to move on, should Liverpool deem a £70m offer too good to 
              turn down.</p>
              <p>Chelsea remain keen, as revealed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>earlier this week, though 
              City’s hopes appear to have been dashed by the 1-0 defeat by Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
               issued a statement last night that appeared to cast further doubt on 
              the prospects of Benitez leaving to take over at Juventus. It claimed 
              the talks, attended by managing director Christian Purslow as well as 
              Broughton and Benitez, had been ‘constructive’ but added it was only the
               first of a series of planned meetings.</p>

              season?</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>With Juventus wanting an answer from the Liverpool boss by the start 
              of next week, they may finally abandon their pursuit of him and turn to 
              alternative targets, such as Fiorentina’s Cesare Prandelli.</p>
              <p>Jamie
               Carragher, meanwhile, explained why he was happy to shelve negotiations
               over his future until the start of next season, even though, by then, 
              he will have less than a year to run on his contract.</p>
              <p>The 
              32-year-old defender said: ‘I understand that, at my age, you can only 
              make decisions season on season.’</p>

              <p>Liverpool will struggle to even get a Europa place next season if Torres leaves.  Gerrard looks like he's given up, Carragher is getting old, and many of the squad players are already eyeing a way out of this mess.  The young players are quite frankly, not up to speed.</p>
              <p>And worse, the manager seems to like average players like Lucas, plus the pile of players bought from cash converters.</p>
              <p>Worst of all, the finance of the club is in a mess.  The owners have screwed the club up big time and despite that, are seeking to pocket a handsome profit, presumably out of some rich suckers who would believe the yanks have done a good job.</p>
