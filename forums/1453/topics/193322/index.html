            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think Carragher did very well in the DMC position. At times, he was caught out and Hungary seemed just happy to sit back and let Carra have the ball to test his distribution ability which was limited....That holding position is a serious problem for Sven.<br><br>Carrick distributes the ball better than Carra...but Carra is more agrressive at winning the ball back..<br><br>I think Scott Parker will have been ideal for the holding role...Pity he's not in the running..<br><br>Gerrard did well upfront, playing behind Owen..But I don't think this is the ideal partnership for Owen. He looked lost playing as the targetman..<br><br>Somehow, I just feel that the balance is just not there yet in the English lineup.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jamie Carragher wants another opportunity to prove he can be England's holding midfielder at the World Cup.<br><br>The Liverpool defender occupied the anchor man role during the first half of Tuesday's 3-1 friendly win over Hungary.<br><br>He had to switch to right back at half time, following an injury to Gary Neville, but enjoyed his stint in midfield.<br><br>Carragher is now hoping that Sven Goran Eriksson will name the same team for Saturday's game against Jamaica - England's last friendly before their opening World Cup game against Paraguay a week later.<br><br>"I would love to play there on Saturday," admitted Carragher. "I enjoy that type of role.<br><br>"It is a good position to play because you get on the ball a lot more and you are always involved.<br><br>"I was a bit disappointed I didn't get the chance to play the full 90 minutes. It would have been nice to have at least another 20 or 30 minutes in there to get used to the role.<br><br>"Now, it is up to Sven what he wants to do. If I get the chance to play there again, then great, but he also has to try things before the World Cup."<br><br>Michael Carrick and Owen Hargreaves are also contenders for the job in Germany and Carragher was mildly surprised to be given a chance against Hungary.<br><br>He added: "It was a bit of a surprise, although I had an idea because I was moved there towards the end of the B international against Belarus.<br><br>"Sven just asked me whether I fancied playing there. I was hardly going to say no.<br><br>"The good thing was he gave me a day to get my head around it, rather than just finding out an hour or two before the game."<br><br>Meanwhile, Eriksson has reiterated that Neville, who picked up a slight hamstring complaint against Hungary, was withdrawn merely as a precaution.<br><br>The Swede said: "It's important we don't take any risks with Gary Neville because we need him and we need him very much."</div>
