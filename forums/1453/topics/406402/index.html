              <h2>MASCHERANO SET FOR HODGSON TALKS</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano met up with new manager Roy 
              Hodgson for the first time this morning after returning to pre-season 
              training.</p>
              <p>The Argentina captain has been uncontactable since going on 
              holiday after the World Cup but was back at Melwood on schedule along 
              with compatriot Maxi Rodriguez.</p>
              <p>Hodgson tried to speak to the 26-year-old, who has been heavily 
              linked with a summer reunion with former Reds boss Rafael Benitez at 
              Inter Milan, following the end of the player's involvement in South 
              Africa.</p>
              <p>However, the 62-year-old Englishman was only able to leave 
              messages for Mascherano telling him he was looking forward to meeting 
              him back on Merseyside as his calls were not returned.</p>
              <p>Hodgson will outline his plans to Mascherano in much the same way
               as he has already done to senior players Steven Gerrard, Jamie 
              Carragher and Fernando Torres in an attempt to persuade him he has a 
              future at Anfield.</p>
              <p>But there still remains a nagging doubt that the combative 
              midfielder, who was offered a new contract in the latter stages of last 
              season, has set his sights on a move to the continent.</p>
              <p>Neither Mascherano nor Rodriguez will be available for 
              Thursday's Europa League third qualifying round first leg tie against 
              Rabotnicki in Macedonia.</p>
              <p>However, Hodgson admits he may have to field a number of his other World Cup stars earlier than he would have liked.</p>
              <p>The club's medical staff have warned their manager bringing the 
              likes of Gerrard, Carragher, Glen Johnson, new signing Jole Cole and 
              Daniel Agger back too soon may have dire effects later in the season.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, a largely reserve side has failed to score in two 
              pre-season friendlies and Hodgson admits he may not be able to afford to
               take the risk of not using senior players.</p>
              <p>"I don't know what to do at this stage," he said.</p>
              <p>"I will have to liaise with them and (head of sports science) 
              Peter Brukner and make a decision by Tuesday on what sort of team I can 
              put out.</p>
              <p>"I can promise the Liverpool fans we will put out the best possible team, without compromising the future.</p>
              <p>"It is going to be a difficult discussion between myself and 
              Peter because his feeling is we shouldn't use any of them and I am going
               to be tempted to say I want to use quite a few of them.</p>
              <p>"The only players I will take will be the ones that I definitely think will play a valuable part in the game.</p>
              <p>"If we are talking about senior players, it would be players prepared to start the game.</p>
              <p>"I would not take Steven Gerrard there to play for the last 10 minutes as a substitute."</p>
              <p>One senior player who will be available is midfielder Alberto 
              Aquilani, who sat out Saturday's friendly defeat to Kaiserslautern with a
               knee problem.</p>
              <p>"Peter Brukner told me he ran for the first time on Saturday so I would expect him to be fit for Thursday," added Hodgson.</p>
              <p></p>
