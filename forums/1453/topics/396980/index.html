We’ve had seven, nine or 11 players out at the same time in different months, players who would normally be starters.<br><br>“We can talk about mistakes, but when you have so many players injured, especially key players, it is not easy to sustain a level of performance every week.”<br><br>The most important injury casualty has been Fernando Torres, who had already missed significant time before recent surgery has confirmed that the Spanish international star’s season is over.</span><br></span></div>

              <p>they were so close last season.</p>
              <p>all he needed to do was make a few good signings and fine tune the squad.</p>
              <p>i hope he leaves.  maybe spanish coaches arent suitable for the BPL.  it may explain why liverpool performed better in the CL.</p>

              <p>The other top teams have all had injuries to key players.  The difference was that they had the squad depth to deal with the injuries, Liverpool don't.  And the manager has to take part of the blame for that.  Players who can't step up and play like title contenders should not be bought in the first place.</p>
              <p>Some will point to a lack of funds that resulted in a thin squad.  Arsenal has a thinner budget to work with, and frankly a thinner squad, and they have consistently been in the top 4, even while building a new stadium.  If you look at the situation with Arsenal, you'll see that Liverpool does not have good reason to miss out on a top 4 finish.</p>
              <p>Sure, we'd been unlucky with injuries, owners and even beach balls, but one cannot entirely pin the blame on bad luck for a season this poor.  The players and the manager have to take some of that blame.</p>
