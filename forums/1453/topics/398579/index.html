              <p>According the Spaniards agent, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> is more likely to stay at Anfield than 
              take over at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> this summer.</p>
              <p>Benitez has been repeatedly linked with a move to Italy throughout 
              the course of a disappointing season when the Reds have again failed to 
              win a trophy and have not qualified for the 2010/11 UEFA Champions 
              League.</p>
              <p>On-field disappointments, boardroom unrest and mountains of debt have 
              led to co-owners George Gillett  and Tom Hicks  putting the club up for 
              sale and Martin Broughton  has been appointed as a new chairman to 
              facilitate any deal.</p>
              <p>However, the 50-year-old's representative, Manuel Garcai Quilon, does 
              not believe his client is ready to leave, telling <em>calciomercato.it</em>:
               "At the moment it is more likely that Rafa will remain in England.</p>
              <p>"I do not know if he has met, or will meet in the next few days, with 
              the new chairman."</p>
              <p>Quilon, though, has reiterated that Benitez's mind may be made up by the
               amount of money that is made available in the close-season.</p>
              <p>"The aspect of investment on the team is important because <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> need reinforcements," added Quilon.</p>

              <p>Benitez is a good manager , he himself is trying to figure out other option gameplay for liverpool and have fail, but remember he do improve liverpool when he handle liverpool from the pervious manager.</p>
              <p>we dont just fail a man when he fail to prove himself in a season. surly i hope liverpool will do better in the next season</p>

              <p>Benitez "won" the UCL with the players he inherited from Houllier.. and after that, he started the construction of a sub-mediocre team</p>

              <p>I believe Benitez did a poor job this season.  Halfway through the season, he came out to guarantee 4th place, but failed to live up to his promises.  Of course, we all know he has not been given a lot of financial support, and he had always been forced to resort to cheap players from cash converters.  Even when he bought expensive players, it was using money from players sold.</p>
              <p>Under such circumstances, it's true that it's unrealistic to expect Liverpool to win the title, especially with many other teams gaining wealth.  But a promise is a promise.  If he fails to deliver, he has to take responsibility.  He should leave Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Although Rafa did buy a lot of sub-standard players, he did explain that he had no choice because of the lack of transfer funds.  His transfer strategy was to buy a huge pile of cash converter players, then hopefully uncover a few gems.  And meanwhile, do some sideline business and sell those players 1-2 seasons on for a small profit.</p>
              <p>I think his failure is not in the transfer market, but a failure to guide the team to success.  He had maybe lost the respect of the players.</p>

              <p>surely you need to read beyond the headlines.....</p>
              <p>if you go thru' the entire list, how many &gt;20m pound players did rafa managed to sign during his entire tenure? his ability to sign proven players is marginalized greatly by the unavailability of funds (blame the yanks, we all know that story). in fact, he has to be astute and sign players of unknown qualities and hope to integrate them into the team and hopefully bring out the best in them.</p>
              <p>in that department, he hasn't done too badly. there will be hit and miss; but alonso, reina, maschy and some others are really good buys in my book.</p>
              <p>and there are others which are not his picks; most notable is robbie keane. and that lucas guy, for all his lack of ability, is only loose change in man city's books. </p>
              <p>man u, on the other hand, in one broad stroke, took in a certain rooney in for 25m pounds in 2004. why, 2 years back, man u, despite a 700m pound debts, even could afford 30m pounds for berbatov.  the likes of chelski with laundered rubles have even more buying power. liverpool were never in that league of buyer. not then, not now.  </p>
              <p>the liverpool squad today pales in comparison i to the top 4 teams in terms of back-ups. take away liverpool spine of reina, carragher, maschy, gerrard and torres, you have a very ordinary team. the fact remains that rafa's track record @ liverpool based on his win/loss records is one of the best. a forumer here has pointed out that fact.</p>
              <p>you single out rafa and take pot shots here without substantiating. rafa, like many others, may not got have got his tactics rights, maybe more so this season, but it is irrefutable that he is a UCL winner, fa cup winner and came close last season. how many managers in the last 5 years can claim that credit? only a handful, and the great arsene wenger is not one of them.</p>
              <p>btw, which is your team or are you one of those who likes to sit on the side and growl?</p>
