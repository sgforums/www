The motivation comes from where we want to be, not who we want to prove wrong."<br><br>He added: "I really don't care about all the stuff that is supposed to be happening. I used to be upset because it upset my team but not any more.<br><br>"We will live with that, they are not upset now or bothered about what is written or said about the future."<br></div>

That's a very obvious hint that if GH fails , GH too , has to give up the post ?<br><br>We shall see !</span></span></div>
