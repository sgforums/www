They dropped points again.<br><br>Teams to look out for this season after the first 2 weekends..<br><br>1.   Liverpool - team looking stronger in all departments than in previous years.<br><br>2.   Chelsea - Depth in strength and ability to fight back. Down in their last 3 games but managed to either win or draw.<br><br>3.   ManC - What more can I say. They beat manU and they have Bahts backing plus a certain Schmeichel between the post. Not a single goal conceded yet.</div>

I have left a message with Rafael Benitez to apologise.<br><br>"Having looked at a video and seen a better angle and a better view, clearly he (Styles) now recognises that he got it wrong and he's deeply apologetic for that. I think, in fact, he too will be making contact with Liverpool in order to offer his apologies."</strong><br><br>Asked about the confusion when Essien appeared to be booked for a second time, Hackett said: "I'm informed by both the fourth official and Rob he retained the card shown to John Terry then held the card to indicate a direct free-kick, and failed to put the card away. So it was a basic, if you like, admin error as against an error in application of law.<br><br>"We'll look at the video to ensure we don't get a repeat of that."<br><br>Hackett also confirmed Gosling, who wrongly ruled Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer prevented Healy's effort from crossing the line, will also be without a game this weekend.<br><br>"Clearly the assistant referee has made an error, so he won't be operating next week for us either."<br></div>
