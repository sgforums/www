            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><strong>Blackburn set to seal Warnock switch</strong></span><br><br>Blackburn manager Mark Hughes is hoping to complete the signing of Stephen Warnock from Liverpool later on Monday.<br><br>Click here<br>The full-back arrived at the club's training ground for a medical this morning as the squad prepared for tomorrow's Premiership trip to Watford.<br><br>Hughes has marked him down as a replacement for Lucas Neill, who is set to join West Ham.<br><br>The Blackburn boss said: 'The deal is not done yet. We will see how day goes. I hope there are no complications.'<br><br>'Stephen is a guy who has got decent experience for someone of his age, ' said the Blackburn boss. 'He has played in the Champions League and in the Premiership.<br><br>'I just like his attitude to the game. He wants to get up to people, he wants to put pressure on people. He is naturally left footed as well.<br><br>'Stephen would be a very good acquisition as I am trying to get a balance to the squad.'<br><br>Hughes is coming to terms with the loss of central defender Andre Ooijer for the remainder of the season.<br><br>The Holland international had a successful operation after suffering a broken leg and damaging ankle ligaments in Saturday's 3-0 victory at Manchester City.<br><br>Hughes said: 'It is a blow to us all. We are all disappointed for Andre.<br><br>'He has been a real influence for us both on and off the field.<br><br>He has brought a winning mentality to the club and is a guy of great experience. We have been benefited from that.<br><br>'His day-to-day work has been excellent. He doesn't allow his standards or those around him to drop.<br><br>'The operation went well and, once his body heals, he will back.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Hughes has tied up young strikers Matt Derbyshire and Paul Gallagher on new deals until 2010.<br><br>The Rovers boss said: 'It is important to keep them at the club. They have shown a real desire to be part of the first-team squad.<br><br>'They have done exceptionally well when called upon.<br><br>'I want the young players pushing the more senior members and I hope they continue to have the impact they are making at the moment.'<br></div>
