Already, some very exciting ideas are emerging and we are working closely with the city council on the best way forward.<br><br>'We are all endeavouring to ensure that the plans can be implemented, as soon as possible while at the same time ensuring there is no delay in the regeneration process.<br><br>'We are delighted with the working relationship we have with the city council. Our goals are the same: to create an incredible facility the whole city can be proud of.'<br><br>Council leader Bradley spoke of the dream of a 'new Anfield'.<br><br>'It has long been the dream of fans, and the ambition of the club, to build a fantastic stadium to rival the best anywhere in the world.<br><br>'Today, the decisions are now on place to turn the dream of a new Anfield into a reality.<br><br>'We have worked tirelessly with the club and its new owners, and the final agreements are now almost in place to allow the work to start in a matter of weeks. A world-class stadium, fit for a world-class club and a word-class city, is now a real prospect.<br><br>'The benefits will reach out much further than football. Our agreement will secure the massive regeneration of the Anfield area and the transformation of Stanley Park. Today will go down as a significant date in the history of the club and the city.'<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have mixed feelings about this. While having a new stadium isn't a bad thing, but Anfield will be so missed. It's got all the history of the club itself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
