            <div class='col-md body'>Before the game , MC boss Mr.Pearce were interviewed , this is the content  .....<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Manchester City visit Anfield on Sunday with their manager Stuart Pearce labelling Liverpool as the best side in the Premiership and the main title contenders to Chelsea.<br><br>Pearce is a great admirer of Rafael Benitez and the job he has done at Anfield and believes the Reds will win the Premiership title under the Spaniard.<br><br>"Liverpool are Chelsea's biggest rivals now," reasoned Pearce. "In fact, on form, they are currently the best side in the Premiership, and I include Chelsea in that.<br><br>"Eighteen months ago, people would have said United and Arsenal were nearest but Liverpool have now catapulted themselves into that category.<br><br>"People talk about the standards Liverpool set in the past but they are not too far away from that now. They are the European champions for a start and you can't do much better than that."<br><br>The former England hero likes the way Liverpool defend and believes his players can learn a lot from the likes of Sami Hyypia and Jamie Carragher.<br><br>"You have to admire how their back four works together," added Pearce. "I watched the Manchester United game and they were so well organised defensively it was untrue. The tightness of that unit is incredible.<br><br>"It would be fantastic to be able to take some of my young defenders to a game at Anfield and show them how the two centre-halves in particular work together. It is a fantastic example for any young player.<br><br>"Anfield has traditionally been a difficult ground for anyone to go to, not just us.<br><br>"If we did get a result it would galvanise us, give some of the young lads a big lift in confidence and an extra sense of belief about what we have to come.<br><br>"There is a good feeling in our squad. We have our tails up a little bit and we are getting one or two of our senior players coming back to full fitness, which will help us.<br><br>"Hopefully we can put a decent run together between now and the summer and win as many games as we can."  </span><br></div>
