            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.koptalk.com/detail_subtitle_listing.php?link_id=1299&amp;subid=2&amp;sticky=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.koptalk.com/detail_subtitle_listing.php?link_id=1299&amp;subid=2&amp;sticky=0</a><br><br><blockquote>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez will walk out on the Reds in the summer unless he is given proper financial backing, claim numerous newspapers today.<br><br>It is widely suggested that the boss has had enough of scrimping and scraping in the transfer market and is looking for a transfer kitty of Â£30million in the summer to mount a serious title challenge next season. That figure though is just a stab in the dark by the press.<br><br>The reports are based (in our opinion) on comments made by top Spanish writer Guillem Balague - a close friend of Rafa - who revealed yesterday that both Real Madrid and Inter Milan have got a foot in the door having made contact with the Benitez camp.<br><br>Because of Balague's comments, that's why the press has gone crazy today. It isn't just one paper that's making the claims, there's a handful right here on our desks at KOPTALK HQ and we haven't even checked them all yet.<br><br>Inter Milan would normally be a club not to be too concerned about but they're in the money at the moment and they could offer Rafa real financial clout. However, we don't see them as having much pulling power but never say never in football.<br><br>Real Madrid are a club that Rafa has made no secret of wanting to manage and now that Perez has gone, they become a real option. The latest link with the Spanish giants is certainly the strongest since Rafa's been at Anfield.<br><br>With reports of a rift higher up the chain at Anfield (Insider update pending), there are genuine concerns for the first time that Liverpool could lose Rafa. Previously we've suggested you ignore the claims, this time we're advising you not to sit too comfortably.<br><br>Rafa is likely to come out and look angry about the speculation and he may even provide the obligatory quotes that he is happy at Anfield. But while he's settled, it's no secret that he's become concerned at the way he has had to pull out of several high profile transfers because of the board's reluctance to cough up an extra million or two here and there.<br><br>We're aware of further developments behind the scenes at Anfield in the run-up to the AGM but it would be wrong to speculate about them openly at this time. However, we are awaiting further information and hope to be able to publish an exclusive update on our secure Insider website before Tuesday.<br><br>The only positive we can take at this time is that Rafa appears to be a man of his word. Now we don't usually consider that because money talks, but we must point out that although Rafa could easily engage in contact between other clubs, to date he hasn't (directly). What his agent is up to though is another matter.<br><br>No matter how nice someone is and no matter how down to earth they are, if they can't work to their full capacity, then at some time it is likely that they will walk.<br><br>We're confident that this latest round of speculation will calm down, even when we publish our next Insider update, but what happens between now and next season will be critical to the future of the club.<br><br>If Rafa did leave, it would purely be because of having his hands tied. A new manager would come in but would he be better and could he work within the same constraints? We doubt it.<br><br>We don't like to panic because we know how the press work. We know why today's reports are so widespread as they are (Balague comments). But we're not naive and we can see - whether you accept to or not - that there is a problem brewing.</blockquote>It will be a sad day for Liverpool if Rafa does leave due to the reasons stated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
