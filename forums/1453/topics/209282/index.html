It's really disappointing to lose a derby. It was my first derby for Liverpool, and when you lose it's not funny.<br><br>"It's good when you have another game a few days later.

            <div class='col-md body'>OFFERING a welcome vote of confidence to Jose Manuel Reina yesterday, Rafael BenÃ­tez suggested that it was reasonable to give the goalkeeper 10 games to find his form, but, for Liverpool's strikers, there are no such luxuries.<br><br>Theirs is a world of constant rotation and, after they were left out of the starting line-up for the miserable defeat by Everton, opportunity may knock this evening for Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy against PSV Eindhoven.<br><br>It was the promise of occasions such as this that led Kuyt and Bellamy to move on from being big fish in far smaller ponds at Feyenoord and Blackburn Rovers in the summer, but the step up in class comes with certain strings attached.<br><br>Bellamy, as a boyhood Liverpool fan, is certain to have found it hard to stomach his omission from the squad to face Everton on Saturday but, while such decisions may have proved unacceptable to the Wales forward during his outspoken days at Newcastle United, he was reminded by BenÃ­tez yesterday that rotation is a fact of life at Anfield, where the idea is to have a squad capable of challenging on all fronts.<br><br>"At smaller clubs, they play maybe one game a week and sometimes the FA Cup or Carling Cup, but it's different at the top level," BenÃ­tez said. "Here you need to manage for now, but, if you want to win trophies and play all the games at 100 per cent, maybe with 60 games in the season, you need to select different players for different games. Sometimes you will change three, sometimes seven, sometimes one."<br><br>And sometimes, inevitably, you will get it wrong. Benitez appeared to do so at Goodison Park on Saturday, but he was more concerned by errors by those players he entrusted, rather than the feelings of those he left out.<br><br>Asked about Reina's indifferent recent contribution, he said that "if he keeps training well and playing well, I will stick with him", citing the Spaniard's record of 29 clean sheets in his debut season at Anfield and pointing out that Steve Finnan and Jamie Carragher, among numerous others, were also guilty of lapses in concentration last time out.<br><br>In an attempt to rectify the problem, BenÃ­tez may revert to using three central defenders, a tactic that served him well on occasions during their triumphant European campaign in 2004-05. That is not guaranteed, but, with PSV boasting the pace of Jefferson FarfÃ¡n and Arouna KonÃ© in attack, it is an idea to which he has given some consideration, with Daniel Agger returning alongside Carragher and Sami Hyypia. In midfield there may be a recall for Boudewijn Zenden against his former club, possibly in place of Xabi Alonso, who has looked jaded so far this season.<br><br>Benitez suggested that this could be his team's most difficult game in group C, but PSV have been weakened by the departure of several of their best players since reaching the semi-finals in 2005.<br><br>Those recalling Jan Kromkamp's contribution during his brief spell at Anfield might put forward his presence in the PSV ranks as another source of comfort for Liverpool, but it is to another Dutchman, Kuyt, and Bellamy that Benitez will look to score the goals that will give his team a little margin for error at the back. On recent evidence, they will need it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dirk Kuyt is hoping to continue his good scoring form against PSV when Liverpool open their Champions League group campaign in the Philips Stadion on Tuesday night.<br>Kuyt netted the winning goal for his former club Feyenoord against the reigning Eredivisie Champions in Rotterdam last December.<br><br>And having scored at this venue for Holland last week, the Reds' most recent signing is setting his sights on a repeat performance.<br><br>As he prepares for a first return to his homeland in Liverpool colours Kuyt admits he's eagerly anticipating the opening Group C encounter.<br><br>"It's extra special to have my Champions League debut for Liverpool in Holland. PSV is a great club and I'm looking forward to the game," said the striker who registered 71 goals in 101 League appearances while plying his trade in Holland's top-flight with Feyenoord.<br><br>"My record for Feyenoord against PSV wasn't too bad. I missed the last game but think I scored three goals in two games against them.<br><br>"I also scored in this stadium for Holland last week. That gave me a good feeling and if I can score against PSV again it will give me another good feeling.<br><br>"Even though I played for Feyenoord I'm sure the PSV fans don't hate me and I'm sure the reception I'll receive will be fine."<br><br>Reflecting on the disappointing weekend loss to Everton, Kuyt was philosophical and stressed the importance of bouncing back.<br><br>The Dutch Player of the Year added: "We want to make a good performance. After Saturday it is very important for us to get a good result. It's our first Champions League match of the season and we want to win.<br><br>"Losing a derby match is not a good feeling. It was my first derby as a Liverpool player and it wasn't fun to lose.<br><br>"It's good that we have another important match just a few days later and if we can win it will give us a big boost.<br><br>"We have good players but we have to work more like a team. If we do that weÂ’ll have a better chance to win these games."<br></div>
