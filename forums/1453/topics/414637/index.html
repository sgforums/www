              <div><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="color: #333332;">Liverpool and owners NESV have today announced the appointment of Damien Comolli as their director of football strategy.<br><br>Comolli, who is fluent in English, Spanish and French, held the postion of director of football at Tottenham from 2005 to 2008, bringing in many of the players who form the core of Tottenham's current squad. Gareth Bale and Luka Modric were just two players to be signed under the Frenchman's watch, although there were a number of less successful purchases — including David Bentley, Gilberto and Ricardo Rocha.<br><br>Prior to that, Comolli was the European scout for Arsenal for a broad stretch of seven years, being widely acclaimed for the discovery of a number of Arsenal's future stars including Emmanuel Eboue, Gael Clichy and Manchester City defender Kolo Toure.<br><br>He most recently occupied a director of football position at Ligue 1 side Saint Etienne, a position he took on in 2008 but left earlier this week, ostensibly to clear the way for his move to Anfield.<br><br>NESV principal owner John Henry outlined the decison to bring in Comolli, citing his excellent record for scouting and developing players at other clubs in Europe and detailing his role at the club.<br><br>Speaking to the club's official website, Henry said: "Damien has a proven track-record of identifying exciting young footballing talent and we are delighted that he has agreed to join Liverpool. <br><br>"Working closely with Roy Hodgson and the coaching staff, I know he will make a valuable contribution to strengthening the Club and the squad as we move forward," he added. </span></span></div>
              </div>
              <p>"Today's announcement is just the first step in creating a leadership group and structure designed to develop, enhance and implement our long-term philosophy of scouting, recruitment, player development and all of the other aspects necessary to build and sustain a club able to consistently compete at the highest level in European football. <br><br>"We intend to be bold and innovative. We will not rest until we have restored Liverpool Football Club to the greatness Liverpool fans expect."</p>
              
              <p>Comolli, born in Belziers and holder of a law degree as well as his coaching license, spoke of his satisfaction in joining the Merseyisde club but admitted that "a big job" is needed to "rebuild" Liverpool to the status the club once held in European football:</p>
              <p>"I am delighted to be joining Liverpool and look forward to working with John and Roy," Comolli said.</p>
              <p>I think we all realise there is a big job ahead, but we all share the vision that John has for rebuilding the club and bringing back the success that the supporters deserve."</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson, much maligned in recent weeks for his side's position in the Premier League table, spoke of his delight to work with Comolli and impressed the unity between himself and owner Henry in wanting to take Liverpool to the pinnacle of European football.</p>
              <p>"I am looking forward to working with Damien whom I have known for many years," Hodgson said.</p>
              <p>"We are engaged in an exciting project here and he will bring a lot to the table. We all want to see moves to strengthen the squad and support player development over the next few years.</p>
              <p>"John Henry and I are totally united in delivering on that ambition."</p>
