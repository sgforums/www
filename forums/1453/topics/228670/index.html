Now he has to decide.<br><br>"All of us would like to see him continue at our club and extend his contract."</blockquote><a href="http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_1808189,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_1808189,00.html</a><br><br>Where the @%@% did they get this from?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is more obvious that we have not settle the right sided area despite Gerrard deputizing occasionally with positive effect.<br><br>Despite the fact that he is not that pacy for a winger but his range of passing and accuracy is still very much cultured and revered. Makes up for his pace on the ball by spraying deep balls accurately to the front men.<br><br>I dunno abt u all but I hv seen both Kuyt and Bellamy working too hard sometimes and din get much sniff at goals cos the wingers are not supplying much ammo. Beckhams's much revered right crosses will provide much relief and services to them.<br><br>But, are there other alternatives?</div>
