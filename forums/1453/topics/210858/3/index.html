            <div class='col-md body'>Alonso out to repeat trick<br>By Lewis Rutledge -  Created on 21 Sep 2006<br>STEVEN GERRARD AUTOBIOGRAPHY<br>This is the intimate story of Liverpool and England legend, Steven Gerrard. Available now.<br><br>Related links<br>Team Pages:<br>Liverpool<br>Player Pages:<br>Xabi Alonso<br>Rafa on Reds win video<br><br>Xabi Alonso revelled in the spotlight after scoring from inside in his own half in Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Newcastle, and vowed to try and repeat the trick in future.<br><br>Eleven minutes from time the Spaniard spotted Steve Harper off his line and launched an outrageous effort from 60 yards, which flew into the net as the Magpies keeper slipped in his haste to back up.<br><br>"At the beginning I was looking for the pass but the ref was in the way of me getting it to Stevie (Gerrard) properly so I looked up and saw the keeper off his line and so I thought I'd have a go for it," he told Sky Sports.<br><br>Alonso scored a similar goal in Liverpool's thrilling FA Cup clash against Luton in January, when he placed a shot from inside his own half into an open goal after The Hatters goalkeeper had come up for a late corner.<br><br>To score twice from such long range gives the 24-year-old enormous pleasure, and he believes that his latest strike trumps the Luton goal.<br><br>"I think that it was better because the Luton goal bounced a few times and this went straight," he explained.<br><br>"It was different but I was very happy to score this goal.<br><br>"It was vital that he slipped and without that maybe he would have saved the ball.<br><br>"I practice all the time in training and sometimes the coaches shout at me for losing a lot of balls but it's something I like doing and I'll always try to keep on doing it.<br><br>"I've not professionally scored one like this in Spain and I'm delighted to have done it twice in England."<br><br>Alonso also insisted that it was crucial for Liverpool to get their season back on track following a stuttering start in The Premiership.<br><br>"We wanted a solid performance and to score some goals which is what we did, so it was important we got a good performance," he remarked.<br><br>"It will give us a lot of confidence for the next games to come."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BENITEZ PRAISES ALONSO WONDER GOAL<br>Steve Hunter 20 September 2006<br><br>Rafael Benitez couldn't hide his admiration for the wonder goal scored by Xabi Alonso in the 2-0 win over Newcastle but revealed that just before the Spaniard took aim he was about to criticise him for not passing the ball.<br>The Liverpool manager said he had spotted a good run made by Steven Gerrard but his frustration turned to joy as he saw the ball hit the net for the vital second goal.<br><br>"It was funny because before Xabi decided to shoot for goal I was ready to shout at him because Gerrard had made a good run down the right side," revealed Benitez.<br><br>"Xabi has got great vision and it was a great goal. It didn't surprise me because he practices that in training a lot.<br><br>"It was good for me and the supporters to see the team playing well, creating chances and scoring goals. It was good to keep a clean sheet and if we keep clean sheets and continue to play good offensive football then we will win a lot of games.<br><br>"I thought we deserved to win by more goals but to win 2-0 as well as a very good performance was a good night for us.<br><br>The Liverpool manager also spoke of his delight for Dirk Kuyt after the Dutchman registered his first goal in a red shirt.<br><br>"It is always important for a new striker in a new country to score his first goal and that will give him and the team a lot of confidence," added Benitez.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>XABI: THIS GOAL WAS BETTER THAN LUTON<br>Mark Platt 21 September 2006<br>Xabi Alonso believes his latest long-range stunner in the 2-0 win over Newcastle on Wednesday night was better than the one he scored in January's FA Cup third round tie at Luton.<br>Both goals were very similar, struck from inside his own half, but a delighted Alonso is in no doubt which was the best.<br><br>He says: "Yes, I think this was better. The Luton goal bounced a few times, this one went quite straight. The Luton one was left-footed - it was different - but I am quite happy to score the goal"<br><br>The Spanish playmaker adds: "At the beginning I was looking for the pass but the ref was in the way of me getting it to Stevie (Gerrard) properly so I looked up and saw the keeper off his line and so I thought I'd have a go for it. It was vital that he slipped, maybe if he hadn't he would have saved it."<br><br>And he's vowed to try and score more goals from inside his own half, commenting: "I love to practise it with the trainers. Many times they shout at me because I throw a lot of balls away but it is something I like and I will keep trying."<br></div>
