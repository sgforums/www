            <div class='col-md body'>GUEST COLUMN : DAVID FAIRCLOUGH<br>FAIRCLOUGH ON GOALS, NEWCASTLE AND SPURS<br>David Fairclough 19 September 2006<br>Goals win games and the Reds are having a problem turning possession and created opportunities into real returns. After three games on the road perhaps they'll find the Anfield nets more receptive to friendly fire.<br><br>Liverpool's inability to get off to a flying start in the Premiership is a self-inflicted handicap they can ill afford, but they get the chance to turn things around with two home games this week. After just four points from a possible twelve, there's a sense of frustration surrounding the Reds but the help of the twelfth man will play a vital role over the next few days.<br><br>It's hard to remember when we've had such a feeling of optimism about a Premiership season as the one Reds fans felt on the way to Bramall Lane for the first game of the season. We shouldn't allow that to disappear, not yet.<br><br>The mixed fortunes of the so-called big four at the start of this Premiership campaign has led to the thought that this is set to be one of the more open races for the big prize, but consistency - as always - will determine the eventual winners. That's something the Reds managed last year but not until after another slow start.<br><br>One thing that won't change is Rafa's philosophy of doing things - he remains convinced the best way of getting results over a long season is to make use of his whole squad. The same methods at Valencia, protecting the fitness of the players through out along season, were significant in bringing about success over the Spanish powerhouses of Real Madrid and Barcelona.<br><br>But the fear that exists here is the thought of giving up too much ground to our main rivals and at the moment we are guilty of making things hard for ourselves by dropping points early on.<br><br>Having spent all my years at Anfield at a time when the first team squad was usually around 16-17 players, changes in the line up weren't frequent but the Reds now have probably the largest of squads in the Premiership. Despite the size of squad, the one area which keeps coming under the spotlight more than any other is the job of putting the ball in the net but the Reds current lack of goals doesn't yet represent a crisis.<br><br>Perhaps losing two key games and spurning a number of good chances in the process have highlighted the concern but there will be no let up in addressing the issue. One thing which is crucial when the big teams come up against each other is that chances are at a premium and you have to make them count. Chelsea had one clear opportunity against the Reds and the ball ended up in the back of the net. Over at Old Trafford on Sunday, though Arsenal missed an early penalty, they were clinical with the only other chance they created to take the points.<br><br>The Reds, in recent seasons, have managed to outplay their major opponents but we still lack the same deadly attitude. Last year the spotlight fell on Peter Crouch but once he scored his first goal, he was off and running and I have to believe the same will happen with Dirk Kuyt.<br><br>I'm sure, unless football these days has changed dramatically, all the Liverpool strikers will be putting in extra time in front of goal on the training ground at the moment. All forwards will go through a drought of sorts at some time or another but the best way to get that feeling back of putting the ball in the net is at Melwood. I remember having spells without scoring a goal but the advice I received was just concentrate on one thing and even if that was only in a 5-aside game on the training ground, 'remember scoring goals is a habit'.<br><br>Much of the training at Liverpool in my day was based around small sided games and we didn't do a lot of shooting practice. Sometimes though, particularly before European games, we did the simplest of practices. The coaches would pack the penalty box with six or seven players in front of the goal with just a goalkeeper and then would cross balls for us to put in - it doesn't come much easier.<br><br>On another occasion, desperate for some shooting practice, I decided to go back to the training ground in the afternoon for some extra training with one or two of the other young lads without permission from the coaching staff. Though it wasn't encouraged, we thought nobody would find out as we had the co-operation of the groundsman. The training went well until we tried carrying the portable goal back to its original location. As someone dropped it, the post rebounded into my face and I had to go to Broadgreen Hospital to have six stitches in a head wound. The next morning I got a right telling off from Ronnie Moran and the boss. Despite the cut I was still able to make the weekend game with Norwich City and the extra training paid off as I scored my first senior hat trick in 5-3 win.<br><br>With the emphasis this week surely on how to start taking advantage of the amount of possession the Reds are currently having in games, I fully expect to see the Reds start to turn their luck around.<br><br>Both the Reds opponents this week are clubs eager to break the domination of the top teams. Both are great traditional clubs with big support and neither are guilty of not investing in trying to achieve that breakthrough. Both are having a testing time at the moment and both will pose the Reds different problems.<br><br>We've enjoyed some great victories over the Geordies in recent times - none more so than the two memorable 4-3 wins in 1996 and 1997. The Magpies can't boast a line up of the same quality these days but will still provide a stiff test on the back of good away win at the weekend.<br><br>If a lack of goals is currently our main concern, then we have something in common with Spurs, who also haven't scored in their last three games. After looking like a club who were investing for a rich future, with the sale of Michael Carrick they currently don't look to have replaced his range of passing (though they could hardly have refused the fee offered by Manchester United). The Londoners provided us with one of stiffest tests at Anfield last season and I can't see it being much different this time around.<br><br>Despite two bad losses over the last week, I'm sure the need and importance of a good result tomorrow night will be obvious to everyone and it's a time for remembering the optimism of a month ago.<br><br></div>

The higher you get up the table at this time of the year it will help you throughout the year as you don't want to be playing catch up."<br><br>Roeder also spoke of his surprise of the reaction he received from West Ham fans for waving at the Newcastle supporters near the end of last Sunday's clash.<br><br>Roeder's gesture towards the visiting fans caused outrage among the home supporters and the St James' Park chief admits he was surprised his actions provoked such fury.<br><br>"I was surprised by the reaction at the end when I waved to the fans," added Roeder.<br><br>"I can understand maybe at the beginning of the game that maybe there was a little bit of unhappiness - but the majority wasn't like that but it is always the case that you don't hear the silent majority but you the hear loud minority.<br><br>"Overall I thought those at the club were very good but they took offence at me waving at our own fans which was a shock."<br></div>
