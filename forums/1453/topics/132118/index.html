            <div class='col-md body'>1)Mauricio Pellegrino<br>This lanky defender supposed to add competition n cover for thr reds defence<br>but premier league just don't suits him. being out in the cold in valencia before coming to liverpool don't do gd to him too. He's slow and not soccer-wised. Maybe we are lucky he's in for free.<br><br>2)Salif Diao<br>Suppose to add solidness in midfield and was compared last time to Vieira. Barely making starts for liverpool and was given several chances to play at the back but still fails to impressed. Maybe had we bought Papa Diop (fulham) it would have been different<br><br>3)Chris Kirkland<br>Kirkland who?He was suppose to be the best goalkeeping propects during his time at coventry. Injury plagued has caused him games. He was given chances to displaced dudek before christmas. During his time as gk for liverpool, most of the opposing team's on target shots become goals this season. Time is running out for him as we had signed Carson.<br><br>4)Antonio Nunez<br>He was bought to play on the right midfield. He was supposr to terrorised defences and slpit open them. But all we have seen are crosses that are always gone into the orbit. Definitely one of the worst buys by RB. Maybe he can do well in southampton but just not at liverpool.<br><br>5)Josemi<br>Showed promising touches on his 1st start but soon he was dicovered to be out of positioned and leave gaps behind at right position. Stil not mature on soccer-wise as hs horrible tackle earn him a red card. In my opinion He will not be able to disposed the ever reliable Finnan will be hard to disposed. Maybe try convert him to right midfield next season? =X<br><br>Just some thoughts abt the top flopers, some might argue otherwise but i do welcome other opinions, i know there's still luzi,medjani, diouf and co but they just won't worth mentioning as they are either not in first team or on loan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Steven Gerrard<br>- As he is the captain of the team, he would automatically be in the 1st team. Sad to say, when he is having his off day, Liverpool is playing with 10 men and one passenger.<br><br>Luis Garcia<br>- Although he have scored 13 goals for Liverpool, he loses possession easily and alway leave a big hole on the right for left winger to attack.<br><br>Traore<br>- Thanks to him, Liverpool is out of the FA Cup.<br><br>Harry Kewell<br>- He paying for money and have not really "improved" on the "next" match. Hope he will do that for the "next" team that he will be heading.<br><br>Ah Ben<br>- I still think that Ah Ben is as stubborn as GH in sticking to his 1-5-4 tactics for EPL season. Some of his spanish imports are also hopeless. He is saying that he will clear Baros, Dudek, Mellor, Josemi, Kewell and Diouf before the villa match.<br><br>I am not sure that the players will not sabo him by losing the last anfield match.<br><br>For the Champion League Final, it is the swan song for most of the Liverpool players.<br><br>Striker - Baros, Mellor, Diouf, La Tallec<br>Midfield - Kewell, Smicer, Nunez, Diao, Hamann, Biscan<br>Defender - Josemi, Pellegrino,<br>Goalkeeper - Dudek<br><br>Hope these thirteen players can get their CL medals for their memories.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Steven Gerrard<br><br>He just seems to lost the fire to play especially after his daughter was born and rumours of him leaving for Chelsea. To me, he don't seems to be pushing his team mates like what Keane with Man U.<br><br>His inconsistancy on the pitch also plays a part in Liverpool's performance. I don't know if you guys realise, his tackles are not as fierce as it used to be... why? Has he lost his fire for Liverpool??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
