              <p>A Saudi prince wants to buy half of debt-saddled Liverpool, in a deal worth up to £350m (€382m)that would mark the latest buy-in by Gulf investors in an English team, according to reports.<br><br>Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah al-Saud – who chairs Saudi holding company Fama Group and the F6 sports investment firm – was quoted by the Saudi Al-Riyadh newspaper today as saying that “we are seeking, at present, to own a 50% stake in the club”.<br><br>“The value of the transaction, which is nearing resolution, will be between £200m and £350m,” Mr al-Saud was quoted as saying.<br><br>The comments come on the heels of an F6 statement released yesterday that said Prince Faisal had signed a memorandum of understanding with one of Liverpool’s American co-owners, George Gillett Jr, as well as Richard Petty Motorsports. That deal envisions in part setting up sports academies in the kingdom and the broader Gulf region.<br><br>Liverpool, which is owned by Mr Gillett and Tom Hicks, is about £245m (€267m) in debt.<br><br>The American co-owners have been working to bring down Liverpool’s debt, and the club’s managing director said earlier this month that the US duo had paid £60m (€65m) of the debt burden when the loan used to buy the club in 2007 expired in July.<br><br>Calls for comment from Fama Group were referred to F6, which sent a general statement about the investment deal with Mr Gillett.<br><br>If the deal with Prince Faisal goes through, it would mark the latest investment in British football by investors from the oil-rich Gulf region.<br><br>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, bought Manchester City for an undisclosed sum a year ago, ending former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s control of the club.<br><br>The team has splashed out on new players since Sheikh Mansour took over, raising hopes that the long underachieving club could move up in the Premiership and grab a spot in the Champions League.<br><br>Sulaiman al-Fahim, the Emirati businessman who helped broker the Manchester City takeover for Sheikh Mansour, has also taken control of his own Premier League team – Portsmouth.<br><br>Mr al-Fahim said he completed his takeover of the club last month, though not before the team was forced to sell several players to meet debt payments. Mr al-Fahim formerly headed an Abu Dhabi property company and hosted an Apprentice-style reality show in the Middle East.<br><br>The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also rumoured to be interested in purchasing a top-tier European team, although no specific deal has surfaced.<br><br>Also, Dubai’s Emirates airline significantly boosted its name recognition in Britain by negotiating a multiyear deal in 2004 worth more than £100m (€109m) to attach its name to Arsenal’s stadium.<br><br>The company’s ties with the club were strengthened earlier this year when Arsenal opened a football academy in Dubai.</p>

              <p>F6 chairman Prince Faisal bin Fahad bin Abdulla Al Saud has confirmed the Saudi investment firm is closing in on a 50% share of <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a> for a price of between £200m and £350m.</abbr></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"At the moment we are looking forward to acquiring 50 per cent of the club's stake," said the Prince, who is also an honorary member of Saudi football giants Al Hilal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The deal will be concluded soon and its value will be between £200m and £350m.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If we finalise the deal, it will be something marvellous because <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a> is one of the best and most famous clubs in England and the whole world."</abbr></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the Saudi prince does indeed manage to acquire half the club, it will undoubtedly bolster manager Rafael Benitez's spending power during the January transfer window.</p>

              <p>Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah says his F6 investment firm is close to buying into <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a>.</abbr></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kop co-owner George Gillett has been in Riyadh this week and held further talks over selling his shares.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Prince Faisal said: "Our negotiations to buy shares in <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Liverpool</span></span></a> are ongoing, meetings are taking place.</abbr></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We might be in the final stages in the coming days."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But sources close to Gillett's co-owner, fellow American Tom Hicks, insist they are still a long way off coming to an agreement with the Saudis, says <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gillett and Hicks, who took over at Anfield in February 2007, have been seeking new investment at the club since refinancing some of its £290million debt in the summer.</p>
