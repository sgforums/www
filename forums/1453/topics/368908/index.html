"By that stage my decision was made and people should move on. There was genuine interest from Liverpool and I think he's probably just upset I chose City.<br><br>"I've been in the Premier League for 10 years, more, and the money I've been paid is phenomenal compared to your average, everyday working man. You live and work away from normal life anyway, so money's not a big factor.<br><br>"The difference was that City made me feel wanted. Liverpool had a chance to buy me last season but failed to pay the money, and only found it this year when they knew someone else had reached an agreement."<br><br>Barry admitted the collapse of his proposed move to Anfield last summer made his return to Villa Park a trying time and accused the Reds of making 'excuses' over their failure to complete the deal.<br><br>He added: "There was a feeling of being let down. Excuses were made about things going on behind the scenes and in the boardroom, but I came out of it looking like a bad person.<br><br>"It took a long time for me to get back into the squad at Villa afterwards. It was tough to deal with.<br><br>"That's why there's nothing better than a club making you feel wanted and getting a deal done in days.<br><br>"It's not about money, it's about the chance to be part of something big from the very beginning at a club who really want you."</p></div>
