              <p>Liverpool did not do Rovers any favour when they promptly beat them 3-1 in 1995. luckily Man Utd could not win their match against Westham and Rovers were champions then.</p>
              <p>so don't expect Rovers to do Liverpudlians any favour this time round.</p>

              <div class="byLine">
              <p class="author">By Soccernet staff</p>
              </div>
              <p>  </p>

              <p>  </p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has admitted he faces a tough decision over the selection of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7935">Steven Gerrard</a> for Saturday's game against Blackburn Rovers.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/Gerrard275e.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200">
              <div style="width: 275px;">
              <p class="photoCredit">GettyImages</p>
              <p class="photoDesc">Gerrard has a abductor problem</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez
              has revealed that his skipper has been struggling with an abductor
              problem for a number of weeks which makes it difficult for him to play
              two matches in a short period of time.</p>
              <p>Should Gerrard face Rovers
              in what is a must-win game at Anfield it will place his participation
              at Chelsea in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on
              Tuesday in serious doubt.</p>
              <p>Benitez was quick to insist that it
              would not be a case of prioritising the league over Europe, but simply
              looking after the player's interests.</p>
              <p>It seems most likely that
              Gerrard will be named on the bench against Blackburn and will then
              start against Chelsea, with a week's break before the next Premier
              League encounter. Thereafter he will have to be nursed through the
              remainder of the season.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "We were aware of the
              injury before the first leg against Chelsea. It is not easy for him to
              play two games in four days with the injury he has.</p>
              <p>"The decision
              I have to make is whether I use him against Blackburn or Chelsea. If we
              do play him against Blackburn it does not mean we are writing off the
              Champions League. But we must approach each game on its merits.</p>
              <p>"If
              he feels he can play, then he will and we will assess the situation
              afterwards. Anything more could be a risk. Maybe we could keep him on
              the bench and use him if we need to?</p>
              <p>"After Chelsea we have a
              complete week before our next game because the Arsenal home game is the
              following Tuesday. If he gets injured again he could need more than a
              week to recover; it is tough call but we will consider all the risks.</p>
              <p>"We
              have been talking about the fitness of players like Steven for a long
              time, do we have rotation or do we keep our key players on the pitch?</p>
              <p>"We have had that problem with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257">Fernando Torres</a> and now Gerrard. We have two games in four days, both very important to our ambitions.</p>
              <p>"After
              that, even if we qualify and have a Champions League semi-final, that
              is only two more games. We will be playing virtually one game a week
              and that makes it easier to manage the situation regarding Steven's
              fitness.</p>
              <p>"I have spoken with Steven today and we will do the same
              tomorrow [Saturday] along with
              the doctor. If he breaks down now we could lose him for two or three
              weeks and that would be a serious blow. It depends on him and how he
              feels.</p>
              <p>"There
              is no priority but we play Blackburn first and that obviously is what
              we are concentrating on. After that it will be Chelsea. We will try our
              best at Chelsea, it is not over yet, but we want to be top of the table
              after our game with Blackburn because that will put pressure on
              Manchester United.''</p>
              <p>Benitez's concerns over Gerrard's long-term
              involvement in Liverpool's title chase overshadowed any annoyance he
              may have felt with Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce's claims "he loves a
              moan and a whinge''.</p>
              <p>Benitez would only say: "I would expect to
              play the game tomorrow and afterwards just talk about football. I will
              shake his hand, no problem there.</p>
              <p>"Blackburn are in a difficult
              position but they have won some games recently and they have improved.
              They, too, will have to win against us, it is as massive for them as us.</p>
              <p>"But we know they are a physical team. We will try to play football but, if we have to fight for the ball, then we will do that.</p>
              <p>"I
              have seen Sam Allardyce's teams at Bolton and now at Blackburn. I do
              not expect the style to change very much but I believe it is more
              difficult to manage at the bottom of the table because every defeat is
              very negative.</p>
              <p>"The pressures there are so much different, losing games there is not the same as losing games in the top half of the table.</p>
              <p>"But we will have our confidence back, the team are ready and looking forward to this game.''</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7941">Jamie Carragher</a> believes the clash with Blackburn at Anfield is the most important league game he has ever played in.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "The Blackburn game is the biggest league match of my career
              right now. I'm not just saying that because of what happened against
              Chelsea, but the league has always been the priority of everyone at
              this club.</p>
              <p>"In the 13 years I have been involved in the first
              team, this will be the biggest league game I have been involved in, it
              really is that important.</p>
              <p>"If we win we can go top of the league
              with just six games to go, and if anyone had told us at the beginning
              of the season we would be in this position now, we would have been
              delighted.</p>
              <p>"This is a massive chance for everyone at the club and
              I am sure the fans will create a great atmosphere because they know
              what is at stake.''</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=13842">Xabi Alonso</a> agrees with Carragher's viewpoint.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "The Blackburn game is very important for us. I hope it won't be
              a problem to forget about Chelsea because we are professionals and this
              is another competition. We still have a chance to fight for the Premier
              League.</p>
              <p>"At home this season we have dropped too many points,
              this time it has to be different. We have to start very well and play
              very well to win the game. It's important to do our job and that is to
              win this game.''</p>
              <p>He added: "Of course, there is no doubt
              Manchester United are still favourites. They have the advantage and we
              respect that but our job is to try to go for it and fight.''</p>

              <p>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has called on
              his players to show their mental strength and return to winning ways in
              the Premier League on Saturday.</p>

              <p class="photoDesc">Rafa Benitez: Wants three points from Rovers</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The
              Reds face Blackburn Rovers at Anfield on Saturday lunchtime knowing a
              point would, for two hours at least, put them back above Manchester
              United in the table. And Benitez is eager to heal the scars of the 3-1
              Champions League defeat at home at Chelsea on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Benitez said : "We have an important league game next so we have to
              be ready. We have two full days to think and plan for the Blackburn game. That
              is the first priority now.</p>
              <p>"Only after that will Chelsea be the priority in the Champions League second
              leg on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"We will have Javier Mascherano back from now on for both these games and the
              rest of the season. He is very important to us now.</p>
              <p>"We have to believe anything can happen. Firstly we must do the right things
              against Blackburn and then go to Chelsea with confidence. If we score first
              there we will be in the game.</p>
              <p>"But at Anfield this weekend I know our fans will be behind us again, that is
              always the case. They will know what the first priority is, and that is to win a
              league game.</p>
              <p>"They know people make mistakes. But they will be determined to help us
              through this situation.</p>
              <p>"To stop the result against Chelsea having a damaging effect on us, we must
              keep working really hard and prepare properly for the next game.</p>
              <p>"We must find the form that we were showing in the recent weeks. We know we
              can do that.''</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Jose Reina has also called for a positive reaction to the midweek
              mauling by Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Reina could do little about any of Chelsea's goals at Anfield as Liverpool's
              zonal marking system was twice exploited by Branislav Ivanovic.</p>
              <p>"It is Blackburn next, another competition, and we are very much alive in the
              title race,'' said Reina.</p>
              <p>"It is an important game, and early kick-offs are never easy against a rested
              team so we have to be ready.</p>
              <p>"It is our job to be ready. Whenever we lose games you have to come in the
              next day and forget about what happened so we can try to move forward and
              improve.</p>
              <p>"We now have to prove to ourselves and our fans that we're still there in the
              league.''</p>
              <p>Mascherano will return to the side and there could be a place for central
              defender Daniel Agger, while full-back Andrea Dossena is also in line for a
              recall.</p>

              <p>Liverpool seem likely to be without skipper Steven Gerrard for the clash with Blackburn at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The
              midfielder had a scan this week that confirmed a groin problem and he
              could also miss the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final
              against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Javier Mascherano returns after serving a
              suspension in midweek but boss Rafael Benitez may well rest some of his
              stars ahead of the Chelsea game, with defenders Daniel Agger, Sami
              Hyypia and Andrea Dossena likely to be involved against Blackburn,
              along with Yossi Benayoun and Ryan Babel.</p>
              <p>"Blackburn are in a
              difficult position but they have won some games recently and they have
              improved. They, too, will have to win against us, it is as massive for
              them as us,'' said Benitez.</p>
              <p>"But we know they are a physical team. We will try to play football but, if we have to fight for the ball, then we will do that.</p>
              <p>"I
              have seen Sam Allardyce's teams at Bolton and now at Blackburn. I do
              not expect the style to change very much but I believe it is more
              difficult to manage at the bottom of the table because every defeat is
              very negative.</p>
              <p>"The pressures there are so much different, losing games there is not the same as losing games in the top half of the table.</p>
              <p>"But we will have our confidence back, the team are ready and looking forward to this game.''</p>
              <p>Allardyce faces a headache in attack with Roque Santa Cruz (knee) a serious doubt and Jason Roberts (foot) definitely out.</p>
              <p>Centre-back
              Chris Samba may be called upon again to play an emergency striker's
              role, at least for some of the match, as Benni McCarthy is the only
              recognised forward available.</p>
              <p>Morten Gamst Pedersen is also struggling with a calf strain but Vince Grella is available again.</p>
              <p>Midfielder
              David Dunn believes Blackburn's Premier League survival will depend
              more on their matches against teams in the lower half of the table.</p>
              <p>"All
              the games are big, but without sounding too negative about this
              weekend, games against the likes of Liverpool aren't going to be the
              ones that keep us up,'' said the 29-year-old.</p>
              <p>"It is going to be
              games like the one against Stoke the week after. They are going to be
              the games that decide which league we are going to be playing in.''</p>

              <td class="med" colspan="2" width="487" valign="top"> Liverpool could go two points clear on Saturday lunchtime ahead of Manchester United's visit to the Stadium of Light at 3pm. 
              <br> 
              <br>It is the first time since 2002 that Carragher has still been involved in the title race at this stage. 
              <br> 
              <br>Back then, Liverpool stayed on the tail of Arsenal until defeat against Tottenham on April 27. 
              <br> 
              <br>Carragher knows victory over Sam Allardyce's men is vital if the charge is to last even longer this time around. 
              <br> 
              <br>"I'm not just saying this because of what happened against Chelsea
              the other night but the league has always been the priority for
              everyone at the club," said the 31-year-old. <br> 
              <br>"In the 13 years I have been involved in the first team this will
              be the biggest league game I've played in – it really is that
              important. <br> 
              <br>"If we win we can go top of the league with just six games to go
              and if someone would have told us that we would be in this position
              when the season started we would have all been delighted. <br> 
              <br>"This is a massive chance for everyone at the club and I'm sure the
              fans will create a great atmosphere because they know what is at
              stake." <br> 
              <br>Chelsea's victory in the Champions League on Wednesday was the
              first time the Reds have been beaten by a fellow member of the big four
              this season. <br> 
              <br>Carragher added: "Sometimes you just have to hold your hands up and
              say that the other team played well on the night, and this is one of
              those occasions. <br> 
              <br>"But it's important to remember that we've now played them and Man
              United five times this season and we've won four of those games. <br> 
              <br>"That's a record we can be proud of even though we are obviously disappointed about what happened the other night. 
              <br> 
              <br>"We've played more than 40 games in the Premier League and the
              Champions League – the two biggest competitions – and we've only lost
              three times. One of the most important things is that when we have lost
              we've tended to respond in the right way by going on good runs. <br> 
              <br>"That's what we'll be looking to do again and no-one should be too
              downhearted about what happened against Chelsea because they are a good
              side who did well on the night. We've still got a hell of a lot to play
              for. <br> 
              <br>"The incentive is there for us to go back on top of the league. It
              may only be for a few hours until United play but you never know, it
              could even be for longer than that. <br> 
              <br>"That's how big this game is and that's why I honestly believe it's
              the biggest we've had in the league since I've been at the club - and
              maybe for even longer than that."</td>
