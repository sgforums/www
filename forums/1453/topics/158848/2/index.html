Trophies aside, he got the teams he manged to play his style and its potentially a good style.<br><br>With LFC, he is still in the learning process, he's studying the EPL and I'm confident he will master it in time to come.<br><br>There is great potential in Rafa. Writing him off so early can only be a foolish thing to do.<br><br>Ps. I do feel insulted by the harsh comments' you've made on Rafa. The lad deserves more respect, even from a bystander.<br><br></div></blockquote>dont let your emotions get the better of you.<br><br>what i said is an opinion, not an insult.  of course it is up to you how you want to read it.<br><br></div>
