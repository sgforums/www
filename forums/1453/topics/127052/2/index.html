            <div class='col-md body'>My first half observation was that the short passing game employed by Liverpool cannot work against EPL teams. They need to get players to dribble, attract defenders and release others in the team. That's why they barely tested Robinson until the end of first half.<br><br>In the second half, they had some penetrative passes, but still the pace was slow. Liverpool players ain't running. Until the second Tottenham goal came, then they picked out the pace and had quite a number of chances. When there was a penalty, I was thinking "When was the last time Liverpool had a penalty?"....then I saw Gerrard take, confirm miss, then really miss....shall have let Nando take....remember, only Danny Murphy had 100% record in penalties....Luis Garcia kept trying the first-time shot when it's obvious he cannot do that. His good shots need some touches of the ball beforehand....<br><br>Hyypia was the saviour, knn, played like a striker, scored with a superb volley....<br><br>Two points wasted but the one point gotten was also lucky....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After watching the full game, I did see that the team played reasonably well as compared to previous EPL matches. The team shape is there, better than it was before. Though they should work harder i keeping possession. Credit to Spurs, their defence is rather tight. Man, their first goal is a scorcher! But Hyppia's one was better cos of the angle and technique used.<br><br>Gerrard had a bit of off-day but Alonso had a great match, spraying clever passes from deep. Attacking play from LFC looked more solid and purposeful with Alonso ard.</div>
