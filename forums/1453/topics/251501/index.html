            <div class='col-md body'>Bolo Zenden reckons the power of the Kop can tilt the Champions League semi-final in Liverpool's favour.<br>Having experienced Anfield's unique European match-night atmosphere from the home and away dressing rooms, Zenden knows only too well the contrasting effects it can have on the players of both teams.<br><br>The Dutchman was a member of the Barcelona side beaten by the Reds in the last four of the UEFA Cup in 2001 and has been a key figure in Liverpool's run to the same stage of this season's Champions League.<br><br>"Maybe there are some players who get intimidated by that kind of atmosphere. Everyone reacts differently. Personally, I always consume it and enjoyed those occasions more, but not everyone is the same," he said.<br><br>"Maybe it's the kind of atmosphere which helps the home players as much as if affects the away ones. When you go into any game your focus is always on your job and try to concentrate on what you have to do, no matter what's going on around you.<br><br>"But it helps us because we know the fans will do a fantastic job tomorrow.<br><br>"With the fans behind us it will make a difference. Even those at Stamford Bridge last week made a lot of noise and I'm sure it will be a fantastic European night as it always is when we play at Anfield in this competition."<br><br>He added: "Somebody asked me if we'll go attacking from the first minute. I'm not sure about that.<br><br>"We know Chelsea play on the counter attack so we have to be careful. There's 90 minutes to score a goal and it doesn't matter if that comes in the last minute. If we beat them 1-0 and it's extra-time, so be it.<br><br>"We can't take our league win over them into this game, but at least it's shown what we're capable of doing against them.<br><br>"We're obviously not pleased to be going into the game 1-0 down. We wanted to score at Stamford Bridge and we know if you can score away from home the result is better. We didn't get that, but at least we didn't give much away and we know when we play at Anfield anything is possible.<br><br>"They used the counter attack well to score but I think we can contain them."<br></div>

You cannot say that, I don't think for any club in the world it's imperative.<br><br>"Maybe it's really more imperative for who spends the more money, it always the same, it's normal.<br><br>"Each one (club) has its own problems.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa Benitez believes Liverpool can reach the Champions League final in Athens even if Chelsea score a crucial away goal on Tuesday night.<br>The 1-0 scoreline at Stamford Bridge last week means the Reds will have to net three if Chelsea get a goal at Anfield.<br><br>But Benitez insists he won't panic if this happens Â– because he knows from experience what his players can do when the chips are down.<br><br>"For me, it's better if we don't concede. But we know we can score more than one goal. If we need to score three, okay, we have experience against Olympiacos," the Spaniard told an Anfield press conference on Monday.<br><br>"I know we were not playing at our level last week. That's the key for the second leg. If we play to our level I'm sure we will win."<br><br>Meanwhile, the Liverpool boss believes the Anfield atmosphere will be a problem for Jose Mourinho's men - despite the experience they have from two years ago.<br><br>"Our supporters Â– they are the special ones," said Benitez. "We don't need to talk about our supporters, it's enough just to hear them.<br><br>"At Stamford Bridge, we won in the stands, that was clear. The other supporters were with their flags, but our supporters were with their hearts. We don't need to give flags. It's easy for us.<br><br>"Our fans cannot give red cards or award penalties, but they can score goals. I like this about our supporters because we know they will show they are the best in the world again tomorrow night.<br><br>"I am sure you will see that Anfield is very difficult for Chelsea. They can say they've experienced it before, they can say it's not a problem, but it will be a problem for them.<br><br>"We are playing against a very good team, but we have confidence, and playing with 12 men is easy!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Shevchenko to miss Anfield trip</strong><br><br>Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko has been ruled out of tomorrow's Champions League semi-final second leg at Liverpool.<br><br>The Ukraine international has not travelled with the squad and joins Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Ballack on the sidelines.<br><br>However, Arjen Robben is included in the squad after making a quicker-than-expected recovery from knee ligament damage.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho believes it is 'obvious' Liverpool will hurl giant striker Peter Crouch into the match.<br><br>The Chelsea boss is without key defender Ricardo Carvalho - although opposite number Rafael Benitez insists he will 'wait to see the team sheet first' before believing that - and Mourinho expects to see Crouch leading the Reds attack.<br><br>The England man was left on the bench last week in the first leg, when Chelsea won 1-0, but Liverpool's performance improved considerably when he came on for Craig Bellamy.<br><br>The Portuguese coach said: 'Rafa is a good manager. In Peter Crouch he has a player who is two metres tall and Ricardo Carvalho is not playing. I think he is intelligent if he plays the direct game to Crouch, that is normal, obvious.<br><br>'Yes, we will miss Carvalho. He has been our best defender, one part of the season without Petr Cech behind him, another without John Terry beside him and another without Michael Essien in front of him.<br><br>'He has been the main man, the pillar. So to miss him in such a big game is a big blow. We have other solutions, and do not forget that we are winning and every time we play Liverpool and score before them, we always get the right result.<br><br>'We are leading 1-0, those are good conditions to have self-belief that we can win the tie.'<br><br>Michael Essien, who will be marking Crouch at Anfield said: 'Peter Crouch is the tallest man I have ever played against, but I am ready.'<br><br>'I have never seen a footballer like him - he can beat me in the air but I can beat him to the ball on the ground.<br><br>'I do not mind playing in defence, I will do anything the team wants. I will play anywhere I have been asked to play, I have been doing it all season so it is nothing new for me.<br><br>'The last time we played against Crouch it was me and Paolo, and it was hard. This time John Terry will be alongside me, and I believe we have learned from what happened last time.'<br><br>He added: 'It is good to have John alongside me this time, he has more experience and can teach me. I feel we have learned the lesson from the league game earlier in the season at Anfield.<br><br>'It was difficult for me and Paolo to deal with Peter Crouch then, I feel it will be a different story this time.<br><br>'I think with John around this time, he will be more powerful in the air and can deal with the difficult aerial stuff we may face.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/jose2-1.jpg"><br><br><strong>CHELSEA boss Jose Mourinho was thanked last night for delivering the perfect team talk for Liverpool before tonight's Champions League showdown. Anfield boss Rafa Benitez insisted that his job has already been done for him with the disrespectful jibes hurled at the club by his Blues' counterpart. There is genuine anger within Liverpool at the way Mourinho has attempted to belittle the history and achievements of England's most decorated football club.</strong><br><br>The Chelsea boss suggested that his side's opponents are no longer a big club, and merely a cup team. Mourinho also claimed that had he boasted the same record as the Anfield manager over the past few years, then he would have been sacked.<br><br>That though, according to Benitez, will simply stir up the passion on the Kop a few degrees more to melting point - and sweep Liverpool into the final in Athens on May 23. "It is something so clear we don't need to say anything else... our supporters will have the last word now, after what Mourinho has said," explained Benitez. "He has made my job easier for me. Now our supporters will be even more behind the team than before, because he has gone too far in talking about the history of the club.<br><br>Benitez believes that the power of the Kop is worth a goal tonight, and he clearly expects the Anfield crowd to be roused to fever pitch by the antics of the Chelsea manager. The Spaniard was happy to play a few mind games of his own however and said: "Mourinho talked about us wanting to get Drogba booked, and out of the second leg. "Well, he is playing, but now it will be on his mind that if he is booked he will miss the final, and that could affect him.<br><br>Benitez cheekily anticipated Chelsea protests at the fact that a Spanish referee will be in charge of tonight's tie. He quipped: "Maybe we can change the referee, if they want. "Perhaps we could use a Portuguese referee if they would prefer. It is not a problem to us."<br></div>
