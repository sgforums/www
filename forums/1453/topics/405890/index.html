This potential alerted the Reds to his ability and on Tuesday he did not travel with his Rangers team-mates for their tour of Australia.<br><br>The Scotland youth international is expected to undergo a medical at Liverpool's Melwood training ground tomorrow before he joins up with the rest of the squad for their pre-season preparations in Switzerland. An initial fee of £2 million rising to £5 million has been enough to convince the cash strapped Scottish Premier League champions to sell the starlet.<br><br>Speaking to Rangers' official website, chief executive Martin Bain said: "We have agreed a deal in principle with Liverpool for the transfer of Danny Wilson.<br><br>"Liverpool's offer will see the club receive £2million up front with add-ons linked to games played taking the total value of the deal to £5million.<br><br>"Danny was entering the final year of his contract with the club and had indicated that he felt it was in his interests to move on.<br><br>"Given that and the value of the offer from Liverpool it was deemed appropriate to accept that offer given the player wanted to go.<br><br>"We are aware that with Kevin Thomson and Danny leaving the club in the last week that there is a need to add to the first team squad.<br><br>Speaking to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>Sky Sports News</em>, McCoist confirmed negotiations to bring the teenager south of the border were on-going.<br><br>"I think the first thing you have to accept is that they are signing potential," he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"But, there's a whole load of potential as he came in for us last season and played a lot more games than we thought he would due to Madjid Bougherra not being 100 per cent fit a lot of the time.<br><br>"He came in and handled himself superbly well. Obviously, we had high hopes for Danny, Danny's got high hopes for Danny and Liverpool can see the potential there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"If the deal is a done deal we would wish Danny all the best, but I still think there is a bit of work to be done."</span></span><em><br></em></span></div>
