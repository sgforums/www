But everything builds from the back. If the defence is weak, the team will still struggle. He should have used to money he spent on Luque to get a better centre half.<br><br>Right from the start, it was a dominating performance from Liverpool. I think they were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was against Newcastle. Corressponding fixtures before have always been closely fought affairs.<br><br></div>
