            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea put one foot into the Champions League Final by beating Liverpool 1-0 on Wednesday night but manager Jose Mourinho still managed to embroil himself in another embarrassing refereeing row.<br><br>Mourinho claimed referee Markus MerkÂ’s failure to punish Alvaro ArbeloaÂ’s handball in the 49th minute could cost them the tie. ChelseaÂ’s controversial manager claimed in his post-match television interview that it was cast-iron penalty and would "haunt his team for 24 hours".<br><br>However, TV replays showed the offence was committed outside the area. Mourinho said: "I hope it is not a mistake like the one two years ago at Anfield. It was a handball for sure. I hope in the second leg we are not crying about a big decision like that.<br><br>His comments drew a sarcastic response from Liverpool chief Rafael Benitez Â— "if Mourinho says it was a penalty, it was a penalty" Â— but at least they agreed that the tie is delicately poised.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lord Moaner said it was a penalty... So was it a penalty?</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's just that Newcastle defence isn't as strong as that of Chelsea, Juventus or Italy, hence he has much less clean sheets than the others.<br><br>Given is alert and quick on reflexes, has good positioning and reading of ball movement. And of course he is consistent. Given sometimes doesn't get the credit he's due because his club is not among the top positions.<br><br>But he's been a bit more injured a bit more this season, although one was a horrible freak accident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way I saw the match this morning is that Ah Ben is still a ultra-defensive manager that is why he is deploying the ultra-defensive set-up.<br><br>For Chelsea, they have the two best players in each position and was able to expose Liverpool's weakness on the right back.<br><br>As what the New Paper have highlighted, Ah Ben have screwed up again in important match by deploying picking weird players (Zenden ?) for his task.<br><br>As for the players, they are more like saving their legs every match for the home game, that is not healthy for a champion.<br><br>So, for the next week match, it will depend solely on two factors:<br>- Ah Ben's selection of players (his stubbornness about Stevie)<br>- The fire in each players<br><br>For me,  I feel that Ah Ben will create another screw-up in the second leg team selection and thus throwing the match away. (He is still no match for Jose and Drogba)<br><br>For the players, I dun see the hunger shown during the match against arsenal in the player body language, they seem very tired and want to just draw the match.<br><br>Therefore, on basis of my analysis, chelsea will be through to the final with 1 single goal by Cole.<br><br>They will park the whole squad in front of goal mouth as the Liverpool players cannot and is unable to open up a PACKED defence.<br><br>That is how the team from mid-table are able to hold up the REDS.<br><br>At this moment, luck and hunger favour Chelsea and the Devils.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Ben is known to spring surprises for his opponents.<br><br>Like Mr Keng-well in 2005 CL final.<br><br>But, his plan backfires most of the time as he only got one BEST players.<br><br>The surprise package that he have dropped cannot make the grade or have a hard time to be in sync with the strikers.<br><br>That is Ah Ben for you.<br><br>Always tinker for the wrong reason at the Wrong time.<br><br>He is only lucky a few times due to injury.</div>
