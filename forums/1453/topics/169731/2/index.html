            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON : Arsenal's complaint that they should never have had a goal disallowed before Chelsea opened the scoring in their 2-0 defeat on Sunday has been upheld by the English Referees' chief.<br><br>Keith Hackett, head of the Professional Game Match Officials Board, said Robin van Persie's disallowed effort in Arsenal's defeat should have stood as a goal.<br><br>He also revealed that Arsenal were so incensed by decisions during the game that they rang him for an explanation.<br><br>"Arsenal wanted to know if I had instructed officials to change their style of refereeing," Hackett told BBC radio.<br><br>Referee Rob Styles disallowed a Robin van Persie goal as Thierry Henry was offside - although he was not 'active'.<br><br>Hackett added: "When you examine the video many times you can see Henry is not active."<br><br>"For the offside decision I was able to confirm this was not a correct decision by the assistant referee.<br><br>"Clearly we have a difficult law and interpretations of accuracy on this occasion; in a fraction of a second the assistant referee puts up his flag in the belief Henry becomes active from a passive position."<br><br>Hackett refused to blame Styles for the decision and also would not be drawn on comments from Arsene Wenger - after he appeared to question the impartiality of the officials.<br><br>"Rob Styles is a senior referee, a very competent official," said Hackett.<br><br>"We take on board the criticisms but, in that situation, the assistant got a very much better view and Rob is not going to wave the flag down.<br><br>"In the situation immediately after the match some managers cannot bite their lip.<br><br>"The challenge for me is to improve the standard of refereeing and we are doing that week in, week out.<br><br>"There are some positive comments from managers - and they come from Arsenal and, on a fairly regular basis, from Chelsea."</div>

Their consistent, (and largely unpunished) rule breaking, the 'tapping up' cases up of Gerrard, Cole and Arnesen, the disgraceful false accusations against Anders Frisk and Frank Rijkard, the gesture towards Liverpool fans in Cardiff, the personal attacks on Wenger, UEFA and others.<br><br>I hate their dirty, borderline illegal oil money, their hollow success, their 'blank cheque' philosophy and their 'name your price' mentality. I hate their disregard for loyalty, and the utter failure to appreciate any of the deeper and more 'romantic' side of football and what it means to a very large part of our society.<br><br>I hate Lampard kissing the Chelsea badge (the man's been a f**king West Ham fan since birth for jeepers sake), I hate DrogbaÂ’s and Essien's sly, underhand and unpunished tactics, I hate Joe Cole's consistent diving and I hate incredible young potential like Shaun Wright-Phillips selling themselves for the sake of 10 starts a season and a fat weekly wage.<br><br>I hate Mourinho, his utter contempt, his quasi-religious self-obsession fuelled by the [mostly] London press and fawning sycophantic television media [step forward and take a bow Sky &amp; the Beeb], I hate his general disrespect to all and sundry and his crew of minions mimicking his every movement on and off the bench. I hate his complete lack of grace in defeat [he is STILL moaning about the Champions League semi-final result for peteÂ’s sake] and his act of disdain upon lifting football's biggest prize with Porto, barely raising a smile for the fans or players that had served him so well. I hate his 'fake' adverts (does he really need the cash?), and his vulgar, pulsating vanity.<br><br>I hate the way they play, considering the vast amount of money spent, I hate their 1-0 score lines and 'safe' long ball style, their focus on deliverance and their 'homage' to the corporate dollar rather than the display on the pitch, despite fans paying Â£50 for the honour of seeing them play, including the abhorrent charging of f. They will surely be taught a severe lesson in February by Messi, Ronnie and co in February.<br><br>I hate Kenyon, the hairless goblin, I hate his lack of morals and his ruthless, 'I'd sell my own mother' approach to football.<br><br>I hate and fear the fact that Chelsea are the future of the Â‘beautifulÂ’ game.<br><br>I hate Chelsea football club.<br><br>Phew, that feels better.<br><br><strong>Paul Newman, A Southend United fan</strong>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
