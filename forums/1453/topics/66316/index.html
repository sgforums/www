            <div class='col-md body'>When i saw the starting line up I almost fainted:<br><br>Defence: central defence is ok with Biscan and Hypia. But Henchoz at right back and Traore at left back is hardly the best combination around.<br><br>Midfield: GH played 5 with Murphy and Haaman in the middle while Diouf and Kewell plyed the wings and the other midfielder was Cheyrou whom I tot was such a bad choice for such an impt game.<br><br>Striker: Heskey. What should I say. I love him and i think he is better than what he is being said to be but yet we all can see his inconsistency.<br><br>All in all, everything points to a Liverpool defeat.  But alas, Liverpool once again proves to me why I still love this team for the last 20 years or so: its resilience and passion.<br><br>Traore and Henchoz while not an attacking force to be reckoned with, were frustrating the chelsea's wing attacks and rendered them useless most of the times.  The central pairing of Biscan and Hypia is growing in stature.  Overall, the defence is so tight that Chelsea hardly had a sniff at it albeit a few scares.<br><br>The midfield, well simply put, worked hard.  They do not have Gerrad and Smicer to run but Murphy and Hamann prove to be strongmen in the center.  While Diouf and Kewell, though not with much contributions, ran their hearts out. Sadly though, Diouf was sent off with a hugely controversial second yellow card.  And what can we say about Cheyrou.  Just his first start in the Premiership this season and he scores the winning goal.  It was a beautiful goal, to say the least, with a pass from defence, headed down by Heskey and a pass back to the flanks to Heskey by Cheyrou, who then made the run down the middle.  Heskey put in a wonderful cross and BANG!, Cheyrou scores.<br><br>Heskey played well throughout the game and I dare say he was the man of the match for me.  He showed that other than scoring, he can create, defend as well. Unfortunately, strikers would always be judged on their scoring prowess than any other things.<br><br>It was a wonderful Liverpool performance away from home.  It was even more daunting considering that they never won in Stamford Bridge for 7 consecutive outings.  And with Chelsea such a strong force and for Liverpool, who is without Owen again, Gerrard, Baros, Smicer, Pongolle and Carragher, a win in Liverpool is no short of a trademark game of the resilient and passionate Liverpool Tradition.<br><br>You will never walk alone: I am beginning to believe in it again. I hope it continues.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=red][size=large]<span style="font-style: italic;">Well said ! I nearly fainted too , when I saw no Gerrard , 'cos I thought he's ready for this game ?<br><br>Furthermore , to add salt into the wounds , I saw Heskey ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>And Cheyrou ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>My MOM - <strong> Didi Hamann !</strong> He simply held our midfield in one whole piece ! If not.........<br><br>Okay Performer - <strong> Hyypia , Biscan , Traore , Henchoz </strong> Ya la , all defenders , what you expect ?<br><br>Off-Form performer - <strong> Murphy </strong> ! He can do better with his passes !<br><br>Lousy Performer - <strong>Diouf  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> , Kewell <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  , Cheyrou <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  , Heskey  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></strong> , ironically , the two latter team-up to score the winner ! Our midfielders simply can't link multiple pass together , we escape with some sounding defending , if not......<br><br>Ai ! I finally can sleep well !
