              <p>Rafa was good last season, finishing 2nd and just 1 point or was it 2 below Manu, instead of drawing hull and winning it, the crown would have once again come to Anfield.</p>
              <p>This season is just bad, nevermind the CL, but drawing even Birmingham and even having a player to dive for a draw.</p>
              <p>That's too bad, like many other Liverpool fans, I cannot help but start to lose faith in Rafa and maybe think - It's time for change.</p>
              <p>Rafa like literally dismantled the team from the start of his reign and built his own team, playing players out of positions then whine when they cannot perform. Losing Alonso was 1 thing, but getting a underparred italian with that money?</p>
              <p>I don't think the Yanks are entirely to blame, it's not like they haven't given Rafa the power and money he wants, nevermind the stadium.</p>
              <p>I think Rafa should go by January if there is no change in form, unless one of his flop signings turns into a miracle suddenly.</p>

              <p>i thinkÂ rafa was given a shitload of money.. coz he spent a shitload...</p>
              <p>mostly, he bought a lot of nonsense players and like you said, played a lot of players out of position.. dunno wtf he was doing..</p>
              <p>his idiocy was evident during the Keane-Barry-Xabi affair... he bought a player who he didn't know how to use, courted another by brandishing one of his best player like a lure...</p>
              <p>all his "achievements" would not have happened if not for one insanely driven captain... the UCL, and many other times, his and the club's ass was saved by Gerrard..</p>
              <p>hell, during Houllier's time, Gerrard single-handedly pulled LFC into the UCL...</p>
              <p>is it too much to ask for both to go?</p>
