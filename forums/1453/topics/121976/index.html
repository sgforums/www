            <div class='col-md body'>The following paragraph is an article copied from Liverpool Web Site.<br><br>Please read with some paitence as it have hit the nail on Mr Kewell's coffin. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>THE BEST performance by an Englishman in Europe this week?  </strong><br><br>Liverpool's Stephen Warnock, who only played in Leverkusen because Harry Kewell yet again declared himself unfit to wear a Liverpool shirt. Something most Kopites worked out 18 months ago.<br><br>Warnock is one of those talented youngsters whose progress was blocked by former boss Gerard Houllier's sub-standard foreign legion.<br><br>A lad who has already broken his leg twice but, as he shows when given the chance, would willingly break it again for Liverpool's cause.<br><br>Now look at Australian international Kewell. A player who, despite sucking a quarter-of-a-million pounds out of the club every month, defied the Anfield medical team's assessment of his fitness before Wednesday night's Bayer Leverkusen game and stayed at home nursing a new twinge.<br><br>Which baffled and angered his manager. As did his request to be substituted halfway through the Carling Cup Final against Chelsea.<br><br>I was baffled when he moved to Anfield. Most of Europe's top sides declared an interest in him, yet he opted for a team who were then outside the Champions League simply because a desperate Houllier offered him as much cash as he wanted, plus a veto over where he played, if he would only lower himself to sign.<br><br>No wonder ever since, getting sweat on his shirt looks like the downside of the deal.<br><br>Which is why he wanders around like a man who is made for life, believing he has earned the right to determine when he does and doesn't play.<br><br>So well done Warnock for defining yourself at last as a genuine first-team player at Anfield and Kewell as the waste of space many of us suspected he always was.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something really seems to be wrong with Kewell.<br>He was playing so well and brilliantly for Leeds.Still remember when Leeds was in the top 4?<br>Now when Kewell came to Liverpool,at the beginning was not so bad but just take this season for example.He has disappointed me.I regarded him as one of my fav players.<br>Now?<br>He is just a has-been.</div>
