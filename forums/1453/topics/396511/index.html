              <p>Liverpool midfielder <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=40380"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span></span></a> has revealed he would like to move back to River Plate within the next four years.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0412/javiermascheranokissingbadge20091129_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Javier Mascherano" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p>Mascherano, 25, played for River between 2003 and 2005 before moving to Brazilian side Corinthians, where he played alongside <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=72490"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A brief and unhappy spell at West Ham followed in 2006, but he reignited his career with a move to Liverpool. Mascherano remains grateful to the club and, despite indications he was eager to move to Spain last summer, he has since suggested he would like to extend his stay at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Asked how he has found life at the club, he told <em>FIFA</em>: "It's been fantastic and I don't get tired of saying that. They've treated my family and I superbly right from day one and we don't have any complaints. Liverpool is a lovely little city, too, and it's growing fast."</p>
              <p>Mascherano admits, however, that he misses his native Argentina.</p>
              <p>"I've been away for five years now and you always miss home and feel nostalgic about it when you're away," he said. "I've gradually got used to it, though.</p>
              <p>"Even so, when the fixture list comes out I always check when the season ends so I can start booking flights."</p>
              <p>Asked if he could return to Argentina soon, he said: "You never know and I don't want to be tied down by what I say, but I don't think I'll be staying on forever. Right now, I'm thinking about playing for another three or four years at the highest level and returning home to play at a good level there.</p>
              <p>"I want to enjoy Argentinian football for four or five years and I'd love to do it at River (Plate), the club that gave me everything and treated me so well."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0415/javiermascherano20100411_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Javier Mascherano" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mascherano, 25, had said earlier this week that he was happy at the club but would like to return to his homeland with River Plate in the next three or four years.</p>
              <p>However, he is reported to be close to agreeing a new £90,000-a-week contract at Anfield and has indicated that he would be happy to commit until his early 30s.</p>
              <p>"I will be really proud if I can spend the next six or seven years here," he said in the <em>Sun</em>. "There aren't too many clubs in the world with the history and fans that Liverpool have."</p>
              <p>Recent speculation had suggested Mascherano could join <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez</span></span></a> at Juventus this summer.</p>
