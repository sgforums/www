              <p>Liverpool have announced their new chairman will be Tom Werner, who holds a similar position with club owners New England Sports Ventures.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="WIDTH: 275px; MARGIN-LEFT: 10px"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/1125/johnhenrytomwerner20101017_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="John Henry, Tom Werner" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a widely expected move, Werner will officially start on December 1, although previous chairman Martin Broughton effectively ended his involvement after last weekend's victory over West Ham.</p>
              <p>"I want to pay tribute to Martin Broughton and the magnificent job he has done for Liverpool FC," NESV principal owner John Henry said.</p>
              <p>"He was appointed in difficult circumstances and faced challenging times yet he always focused on doing what was in the best long-term interests of the club. It has been a pleasure for us to work with Martin and we wish him well in all that he does in the future.</p>
              <p>"I am delighted that Tom has agreed to take over as chairman. It is a crucial role as we move forward and no one is better placed than Tom to take up the reins and help provide leadership and vision in the coming years."</p>
              <p>Werner expressed his optimism that, under NESV's ownership, the club could revisit former glories.</p>
              <p>"It is a great honour to be taking over from Martin as chairman of this great club," he said. "We have a tremendous foundation to build on for this season and the long term.</p>
              <p>"Our goal is to work tirelessly for our supporters and deliver the best conditions for a winning team and silverware in the trophy room."</p>
              <p>Broughton always intended to stand down once the sale process, for which he was specifically appointed, was complete.</p>
              <p>Now NESV have started to find their feet after their October purchase of Liverpool he has no qualms about stepping down.</p>
              <p>"I'm happy that Liverpool FC is now in good hands. Everyone associated with the club can look forward to an exciting future with the right owners and the club on a secure financial footing," he said.</p>
              <p>"I've been impressed with the way that NESV have already approached the job ahead and both John and Tom are winners who want to see the club competing again at the top of European football."</p>
              <p>And the self-confessed Chelsea fan added: "I also want to say a big thank you to the Liverpool fans for all their support during the past seven months.</p>
              <p>"This is a very special place with fantastic supporters and through a difficult time they always kept faith in what we were trying to do. I've grown to love the club and it's been a privilege for me to have been here."</p>
