"I'm sure we will talk and they will understand and I will understand their ideas."<br><br>Wednesday night's result against Porto at Anfield means a win in their final group game against Marseille will put Liverpool through to the knockout stages of the Champions League.<br><br>And a relieved Benitez even joked that maybe the breakdown in his relationship with Hicks and Gillett was down to his poor command of English.<br><br>"I know my English is not really good so maybe that's the problem," he told Radio 5 Live.<br><br>If Rafa Benitez thinks he needs more money in January then his managerial skills need reviewing!<br><br>Benitez is keen to strengthen his squad in the January transfer window as Liverpool continue their quest for success in both domestic and European competition.<br><br>But it appears Hicks and Gillett are reluctant to release funds for players, prompting the former Valencia boss to grow increasingly frustrated.<br><br>He has already launched two public verbal assaults on his bosses, but it now seems as though he wants some kind of reconciliation.<br><br>"My relationship with them was good before and now we need to talk about what the problem was," he said.<br><br>It's not my ego, it's my responsibility... I need to take care of my team, my squad and club<br><br>Rafa Benitez<br><br>Benitez has always enjoyed the backing of the fans during the row and before Wednesday's game at Anfield, more than 2,000 marched to the ground from a nearby pub to show their support for the manager.<br><br>"I must thank the Liverpool fans, they are always magnificent," said Benitez.<br><br>The 47-year-old, appointed in June 2004, has made it clear he wants to remain in charge of a club he guided to Champions League glory in 2005.<br><br>"It would be easier for me to stay here and do nothing and wait for the end of the month for my wages, but I prefer to do my best for the club," he said.<br><br>"It's not my ego, it's my responsibility. I need to take care of my team, my squad and club because I need to do it."</div>
