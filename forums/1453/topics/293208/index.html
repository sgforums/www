            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez's controversial media conference yesterday has been printed in full.<br><br>The Sun has broken down Benitez's tetchy performance as it emerges today he's fed-up with the lack of communication from Liverpool's American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett over transfer funds for the January market.<br><br>Benitez, who last week turned down overtures from Bayern Munich, arrived 35 minutes late for his usual media briefing. This is how he dealt with the probing:<br><br>How much will you have to spend in January?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>Are there assurances you'll have what you want?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>So what is the long-term plan?<br>"My plan is training and coaching the team."<br><br>Is there anything upsetting you?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>Do you have anything to say?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>Even off the record?<br>"No."<br><br>It's clear something is up.<br>"You have my answer."<br><br>You're very different from normal.<br>"You have my answer."<br><br>You said after the Bayern story you were happy to stay here a long time. Is that still the case?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>You're not normally late. You were obviously preoccupied by something.<br>"Because as always I was focusing on the training session."<br><br>Is there anything you'd like to say?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>You always say you're focused on that but usually give off-the-record answers to enquiries. How come it's suddenly changed?<br>"No off-the-record stuff. Nothing. I'm just focused on training and coaching as always."<br><br>You suggested you were open to the possibility of the England job. Is that something we should treat seriously?<br>"It's your decision. You never know what will happen in the future."<br><br>Were you serious when you answered it?<br>"I was serious."<br><br>One day you're looking to stay here a long time, the next who knows about the England job. That's a contradiction.<br>"The future is the future. Now, as always, I am focused on training and coaching my team, so I cannot say anything else. Just to keep preparing for the next game."<br><br>So what you're saying suggests perhaps the future here is in question?<br>"I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>So who knows?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>Are you being allowed to do that as you wish?<br>"I am focused on training and coaching my team."<br><br>Does everyone at the club share that opinion?<br>"As always I am focused on training and coaching my team." </blockquote><a href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=66374" rel="nofollow">http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=66374</a><br><br>He gone bonkers??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

I am also very curious about how much was given to him to spend. When Chelsea got their sudden wealth, "Money is no issue" thus top players came and the team went top.<br><br>How much is Liverpool manager given??? "Money is no issue too?" from Benitez's reaction, I certainly don't think so. Seems like he is given a tight budget.</div>

So do I," he said.<br><br>"We have been here for a long time and we know what the passion of football means and what the transfer market in Europe means.<br><br>"It's not a draft system. We have free players available now. I'm not talking about players that cost money.<br><br>"We need to talk to the agents now, if not we will lose targets. In the summer, the players will be more expensive. I have not been talking about spending but doing the opposite. We have brought money back. We brought in Â£26m this year and you can see the value of the squad.<br><br>"We had a meeting on the day of the Arsenal game which was really positive. After this, something changed."<br><br>They told me to be focused on coaching and training because Rick Parry will be looking after signing players."<br><br>Swing<br><br>Benitez won't walk away, adding: "I have passion for this club. The fans who were with me in Istanbul know what it means to me."<br><br>With no resignation on the horizon, Hicks (left) and Gillett are now ready to swing their axe regardless of Liverpool's league placing or Champions League progress.<br></div></blockquote>Ironic,isn't it? Rafa thought he is one of the reason he gets mourinho sacked. Now Rafa going to get sack and his replacement is Jose...
