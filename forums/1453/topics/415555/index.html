              <p>Former Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink claims he was approached by both Liverpool and Manchester City to take over as manager last summer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0309/guushiddink20100305_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Guus Hiddink" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While Liverpool were at that point without a manager due to Rafael Benitez's departure, City had publicly backed Roberto Mancini. City have come out to "strenuously deny" there was any approach for Hiddink, who took over as manager of Turkey in August.</p>
              <p>Hiddink, who had a successful short spell with Chelsea in the second half of the 2008-09 season following Luiz Felipe Scolari's exit, insists he has no intention of returning to club management on a full-time basis - which may come as a relief to Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Both Hodgson and Mancini now find themselves under pressure with very difference circumstances. Liverpool's resurgence suffered a setback in defeat at Stoke on Saturday, while City fans have not seen a home goal for six weeks as they become disillusioned with his tactics in pursuit of a first Champions League qualification.</p>
              <p>Hiddink was quoted as saying by the <em>Daily Mirror</em>: "In the summer City and Liverpool both came to me with an inquiry.</p>
              <p>"But at my age I don't want to manage a club again for seven days a week over three years."</p>
              <p>Vicky Kloss, Man City's chief communications officer, said: "We strenuously deny that we have ever spoken to Guus Hiddink or any other manager about the possibility of succeeding Roberto Mancini."</p>
              <p>City have won just one of their last five League games, taking only five points.</p>
              <p>Reports in last week's press also claimed Mancini had a training ground row with Emmanuel Adebayor, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Wayne Bridge and Joleon Lescott. That was also denied but none of the four were in the matchday squad for the disappointing 0-0 draw at home to Birmingham on Saturday.</p>
