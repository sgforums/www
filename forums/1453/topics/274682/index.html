            <div class='col-md body'>Andriy Voronin has come in for special praise from Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez this week - but that may not secure him a place in the starting line-up against Chelsea on Sunday.<br><br>In week one of the campaign, Benitez has been given the golden opportunity to state the obvious - that his team comes first, and everybody will be rotated.<br><br>Peter Crouch's annoyance at missing out last weekend against Aston Villa was not surprising, but its leak to the media from within the player's camp clearly annoyed Benitez.<br><br>Voronin's spectacular winner against Toulouse in the Champions League will not alter the fact he is just one of four strikers Benitez can use against Chelsea.<br><br>Benitez made six changes in Toulouse from the side that won at Aston Villa - and he is hinting there could be as many again against Chelsea.<br><br>'Last season we did not have a player who could change the game like Andriy does,' said the Reds boss.<br><br>'You can see he is that sort of player. He is the type of player who does things, with his movement and understanding, that can change the course of difficult matches.<br><br>'People maybe didn't know the quality of Voronin, although he has been showing that quality during the pre-season.<br><br>'Now he's scored a fantastic goal and people will start saying `maybe he is a good player'. But we knew that he was a good player.'<br><br>Even so, no one at Liverpool can take his place for granted.<br><br>'We do have a better squad now, more players,' Benitez explained.<br><br>'Now I can change six players, and still everyone does a good job. You can inter-change players - one, two or three of them; it does not matter.<br><br>'The level of the squad now is very good - the quality and depth of ability gives me these options.<br><br>'We changed six players in Toulouse from Saturday - and because of the situation out there with the heat, we could well change more for Sunday.'<br><br>Benitez will no doubt turn to the clutch of players who did not figure at all against Toulouse, and that includes Jermaine Pennant who was left behind on Merseyside.<br><br>Xabi Alonso, Daniel Agger and Dirk Kuyt did not get off the substitutes' bench - while Fernando Torres, John Arne Riise and Mohamed Sissoko figured for only short spells.</div>
