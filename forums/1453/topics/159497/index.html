            <div class='col-md body'>given that in his first season he won the CL and reached the league cup final, its not that bad.<br><br>as for epl (bread &amp; butter), i think rafa needs at least a few more seasons to even challenge chelsea 4 the title. when chelsea keeps buying n buying every players every season, all are fighting for runner-up, third and fourth place to play for CL and hope to win some cup, be it fa cup or CL or league cup.<br><br>to reach the old liverpool heights in the 70's and 80's, you need a few more of gerrard type of players in the squad, like the 80's barnes, rush, beardsley, nicol, hansen, mahon etc. after all, good players make the team great.<br><br>to be successful again, rafa needs to buy correctly and cannot afford to invest in new players and the player didnt live up to expectations as money is tight, unlike chelsea. rafa also needs to build up the youth system from scratch. if there are 3 or 4 good players coming from the ranks in a few years time, that would save money otherwise spent on buying players. he would be advise to start looking for boys in asia, africa, brazil (samba boys)and argentina, holland also.<br><br></div>

They are playing much better and getting the results in europe.<br><br>The domestic corner is a different story altogether.<br><br>I think its quite obvious that playing style is very different in europe and england. It's a lot tougher and more robust domestically. Im not sure if LFC has got the right players to perform in the EPL. A lot of their foreign players lack the steel, physically and mentally. Rafa probably needs some players from the old school.</div>
