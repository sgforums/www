            <div class='col-md body'>Henchoz is over the hill leow lah...have not seem him in action much too. He has not given me the impression that he deserved his place in the squad. Though over the years he has done good for the club.<br><br>Beni judgement concur with mine on Henchoz. Knowing when to let go of the past is important. Sell him off and get some other player is the way forward.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Henchoz is a good defender. BUT, Jamie Carragher is the type of player any manager will want in his first team. He's a local lad with extra ordinary workrate.<br><br>I can understand why he wants Carra in the team.Henchoz's just unlucky because he'll be 3rd choice at centre back as long as carra and hyppia's fit. Reason why he does'nt make it onto the subs bench during games is because benitez wants flexibilty on the bench.Traore beats Henchoz in the aspect. Heck, even Warnock is more versatile than Henchoz.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>carragher has always been liverpool's unsung heros these few seasons. Someone who also gives the extra 110%. His no nonsense defending is certainly what we need. The only weakness i feel is that carragher doesn't offer much while attacking when he was playing as a full back. Centre back definitely suits him better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Swiss defender made just his second Liverpool appearance of the season against Millwall on Tuesday and there has been much debate about his future at the club in recent weeks.<br><br>He acknowledges that it may be in his best interests to leave when the transfer window reopens in January but points out that things could change before then.<br><br>"There is another two months before Christmas but if I don't play in that time I need to seek another option. My contract runs out next June so in January I would probably join another club on a free transfer," says Henchoz.<br><br>"The next two months will be crucial. Players can get injured or lose their form and who knows I might win my place back in the team.<br><br>"You are always disappointed when you are not playing. When you are a footballer you want to start every game. But you have to respect the manager's decision and make sure you give everything in training."<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">I like Henchoz's attitude !
