            <div class='col-md body'>Lampard and Gerrard were disappointing. Lacking in pace and stamina, and when at the moment which mattered most, lost their nerve in the shoot-out.<br><br>Hargreaves was my man-of-the-match. Demonstrated how a defensive midfielder should play and had the legs to carry the ball all the way to the opposition's box. Hopefully McClaren has the sense to see his worth and drop the current prima donna midfielders in the squad.<br><br>One can only hope that Rooney will learn that his silly petulance cost England the game. Stupid git...... an idiot will remain an idiot until he learns.<br><br>On hindsight, perhaps SGE should have played Lennon upfront and persist with Joe Cole. I thought Crouch wasn't too bad. At least he won more balls that Rooney for the same amount of time they were on.<br><br>Heartache sia.......</div>
