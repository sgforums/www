            <div class='col-md body'>This season is not over yet.<br><br>So, Liverpool is not really a failure.<br><br>Even they could not clinch the 4th spot (That seems to be the only target for the past four season) this season, they are already in UEFA Cup tournament.<br><br>Ah Ben is in the process of building up his squad inherited from GH and he himself is getting a grip of the competitiveness of the EPL.<br><br>Actually, this season shows the weakness of the present squad in the depth of all fields - Striker, Midfielders, Defenders and Goal Keeper.<br><br>It is also a good time to show the loyalty of the individual players whether they are after the cash or really playing for the team.<br><br>Therefore, it is a good time for Ah Ben in looking at his team and time to weed out the soul-less players.<br><br>As for Ah Ben, I do agreed that some of his game is LOST due to his blind faith in using his playing system in Valencia.<br><br>Unless he can stop playing 4-5-1 formation, I dun see any goals coming.<br><br>Time will tell whether Ah Ben is suitable for Liverpool.<br><br>He cannot create a miracle overnight, but he can better boost the moracle of his players and change his tactics.<br><br>My nagging worry is that the players seem to be rebelling against Ah Ben by throwing the game away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">For me .......<br><br>It's down to several factors , bad luck is one of them , but not everyone will agree on that . Just look at how many games we lost by late goals ? And odd goals ?<br><br>AH Ben chopped off a few new players is one of them . Murphy should be given a chance in L'pool , so to Henchoz.....Why is Benitez separating the Best  combination of Hyypia &amp; Henchoz , when they contributed the Best defensive results since 1990 ? Carragher did great there with Hyypia , my point is , why did he chose to break up a successful combi , and Carragher can be deploy at right back , in for Josemi for the first few games ? Just lost count how many games we lost precious points because of Josemi's fault !<br><br>Looking at Luis Garcia ...... just makes me wonder , is he better off than Danny Murphy ? Garcia can score goals , so does Murphy...... Garcia can create , so does Murphy.......Garcia can't do a good free kick , Murphy can. Garcia loses possession easily , Murphy don't do that !<br><br>Injuries crisis is no doubt one reason , but so does Arsenal , MU , Chlesea and other EPL team , they can cope with second string players , why can't we ?<br><br>Signing on wrong players at the wrong time.......some new players just can't cope with the pace of the British games ! They need time , we don't have time !<br><br>Anyway , we shall see la .<br><br>Who knows , An Ben is sack by the time the team starts to gel !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with Poolman's comments on the lost on Murphy.<br><br>We lost a commited hard-tackled, penalty, free-kick taker.<br><br>Beside Alonso, Liverpool do not have any good free-kick specialist.<br><br>Although Liverpool is seriously bothered by the injuries, I am just disappointed that the fringe players did not take this opportunity to play well.<br><br>But, the older players are missing a lot in HUNGER and DESIRE.<br><br>I believe Liverpool will stage a ultra-defensive game on Tuesday.<br><br>No wonder no live telecast is shown.<br><br>Ah Ben may have only one more season to show himself before he can pack out of Anfield.</div>
