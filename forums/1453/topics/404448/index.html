              <h1>Fernando Torres set for Liverpool exit as agent admits Premier 
              League big boys are interested<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fernando Torres appeared to be on the verge of leaving Liverpool
               after his agent indicated the striker is bound for another Premier 
              League club.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
               are at the front of the queue to sign the Spaniard and Manchester City 
              also showed interest before moving on to other targets when they got 
              little encouragement from the 26-year-old.</p>
              <p>Agent Jose Antonio 
              Martin said: ‘It is very likely that Fernando Torres will stay in the 
              Premier League, but I cannot say that it will be with Liverpool. We are 
              working on his future but right now you cannot guarantee that he will 
              stay with the English club.’</p>

              </div>
              <p>Barcelona have been linked with a move for Torres, but Martin made it
               clear they will not challenge Chelsea for Torres’ signature.</p>
              <p>‘It
               is ruled out,’ said Martin. ‘Barcelona have signed David Villa and now 
              they want to invest the money they have in other players.’</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> revealed in May that 
              Torres was a £70million target for Chelsea and, despite Roy Hodgson 
              insisting he would do all he could to keep the Spaniard and Steven 
              Gerrard, the new Liverpool manager could offer no guarantees.</p>
              <p>Having
               already sold Yossi Benayoun to Chelsea, Hodgson would prefer to raise 
              funds for his squad rebuilding by selling the likes of Javier Mascherano
               and Albert Riera.</p>
              <p>But Hodgson knows such is the state of 
              Liverpool’s finances — their debt is £472.5m — a big offer from either 
              Chelsea or City for Torres will be almost impossible to turn down.</p>
              <p>Torres
               says talk about his future must wait until Spain’s World Cup campaign 
              is over.</p>
              <p>He said: 'My future is here in South Africa. It is 
              too important to think about what happens after that.</p>
              <p>'I was 
              happy he got the job. He did really well at Fulham and I am sure he can 
              do better for Liverpool. After the World Cup, I'll have time to talk 
              with him. But I have a contract, that's the reality.'</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/05/article-1292004-09E5DD9A000005DC-817_468x354.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="354"><em></em></p>

              <div class="thinCenter"></div>
              <p>Torres - who had ankle surgery in April - has also defended himself 
              after his difficult start to the Word Cup finals, where Spain have 
              reached the semi-finals.</p>
              <p>He added: 'It is a difficult tournament 
              for me. I didn't arrive in the best moment in terms of fitness, 
              especially after two operations but I'm happy with the things I am 
              doing.</p>
              <p>'Hopefully the manager and the team are happy as well. 
              Everyone has to try to give a bit to the team to get the best.'</p>

              </div>
              <p class="art-txt-first">Fernando Torres' agent has 
              denied making the comments published in the English press on Monday 
              regarding the striker's future at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Agent Jose Antonio Martin reportdly refused to 
              commit the Spain forward's long-term future to Anfield and indicated he 
              could move to another Premier League club.</p>
              <p>But Martin insists he 
              did not make the remarks and is adamant 26-year-old Torres, who is 
              contracted at Liverpool until 2013, will remain with the Reds.</p>
              <p>"For
               many months I have not spoken to the England press because their quotes
               are totally false," said Martin.</p>
              <p>"Now is not the moment to speak
               about this issue because Torres is focused completely on his work for 
              Spain.</p>
              <p>"After the World Cup (player-agency company) Bahia 
              Internacional will possibly meet with the player but the truth is that 
              Fernando has signed a deal with Liverpool which is for the present and 
              the future."</p>
              <p>It was also rumoured that Torres was set for a make-or-break 
              meeting with Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson in the coming days to discuss 
              his future, but Bahia Internacional sources have dismissed this claim as
               "simple speculation".</p>
