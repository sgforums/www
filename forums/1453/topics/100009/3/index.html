            <div class='col-md body'>Hur Hur... the idea of having Aimar playing in the hole behind a striker is tantalizing.<br><br>He is a player of some calibre. Great technique, quick feet and footballing brain. He'll adapt well to the rigour of EPL. He's oni a bench warmer at Valencia and it does not do any good to his profile. Renieri insisted he's not for sale but that won't be good enough to make the player unless he is guaranteed a starting eleven.<br><br>Perhaps Liverpool might adopt a player exchange with cash? That would be more practical for the Reds financially bah.<br><br>Benni was reported asking abt Aimar's availability but nevertheless it remains speculation till both parties confirmed any talks taken place. But this is some good speculation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Not-so favourable news:<br><br>Chelsea have become the latest club to inquire about Leeds United's young goalkeeper Scott Carson. Liverpool made a Â£250,000 bid for the 19-year-old this week, aware that he is out of contract in the summer and unlikely to sign a new deal at Elland Road. Chelsea are yet to table a formal offer, though they are being kept abreast of rival bids.<br><br>Carson has made only three appearances for Leeds but has featured in the first-team squad 15 times. This meant he was entitled to negotiate a new deal although he has been unable to reach agreement. Wigan have offered Â£400,000, though Carson would prefer a move to the Premiership. </span><br></span></div>
