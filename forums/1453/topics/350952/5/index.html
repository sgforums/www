              <p>MU's invincibility is exposed and this could affect their self-belief. Under sustained pressure from various teams, they will crack eventually - struggling to regain their decade-long dominance.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex said they always respond, yes true, but how strong can they vary their response, that would undeniably stretch their imagination and coffers. MU has peaked and to sustain peak performance for long duration is a myth. Specimen: AC in early 90s.</p>
              <p>When Giggs and Scholes go, MU will be sorely lacking in reassuring confidence. No Ronaldo or Ferdinand or Rooney can restore that. It's a magic that what Scholes and Gigssy hold them together, even though they have been playing lesser and lesser as Sir Alex try to free the team on their dependencies.</p>
              <p>It's a cycle - nothing new. Look at Liverpool - theirs is like 20-year cycle.</p>

              <p>When you look at the history of English football two clubs stand far and away above the rest as the most successful.</p>
              <p>Of
              course other clubs have had their moments and have played a major part
              in the rich tapestry of the game but when it comes to trophies,
              reputation and international standing, Liverpool and Manchester United
              stand alone.</p>
              <p>At Parkhead to see United's European Cup match
              against Celtic earlier this season, I thought that only the club from
              the east end of Glasgow can compare in British football when it comes
              to the sheer fanaticism and fervour - almost religious at times - that
              the two English giants attract.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><a class="lightboxPopupLink" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/12/article-1160717-001B311400000258-29_468x312_popup.jpg"> <span class="clickToEnlargeTop">Enlarge</span> <span class="clickToEnlargeButton"> </span> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/12/article-1160717-001B311400000258-29_468x312.jpg" alt="Manchester United" width="468" height="312"> </a>
              <p class="imageCaption">Glory nights: Manchester United players and
              manager Sir Alex Ferguson celebrate their treble-clinching European Cup
              triumph in Barcelona in 1999</p>
              </div>
              <p>You only have to recall Liverpool's Champions League semi-final clash with
              Chelsea in 2005, or United's last four showdown with Barcelona last
              season, to see that despite the passion of all supporters being watered
              down in this country over the last couple of decades, the two clubs
              still have something special, and indeed different to all the others.</p>
              <p>The bitterness and anger from one toward the other will always be
              there, you sense: I well recall in the 1980s when Liverpool were cleaning up that many
              of their supporters still had a problem dealing with United.</p>
              <p>I
              think it is the sheer size and glamour of the club from Manchester -
              they were still all over the back pages despite their great rivals
              picking up nearly all the big silver.</p>

              <p>And even to this very day, for United fans of a certain age, nothing
              and no team in the game compare to Liverpool in terms of rivalry.</p>
              <p>It
              doesn’t matter how much you talk about doubles or trebles, or the fact
              that long ago Sir Alex Ferguson knocked Liverpool off their perch –
              that feeling is still there, a hangover from the years of Merseyside
              domination that no amount of Alka Seltzer could totally cure.</p>
              <p>Who am I to wax lyrical at length about the rivalry between the two? Apart from maybe to offer one opinion.</p>
              <p>It’s my belief that underneath all the anger, the bitterness and jealousy, simmers something else – respect.</p>

              <p>Fans of both clubs, those that truly know of the game and its history,
              respect (and yes, fear also) the other for their great achievements –
              United with their incomparable Busby Babes and their long years of dominance
              under Sir Alex Ferguson, Liverpool with their Bill Shankleys and Bob Paisleys,

              <p>Liverpool
              fans for example happily sing ‘You ain't got no history’ to Chelsea
              supporters, but would never dream of singing such a thing about the
              club from the other end of the East Lancs Road.</p>
              <p>United and their
              supporters have enjoyed some right old ding-dongs with Arsenal in the
              last dozen years or so, but those fans truly worth their salt have
              always known that those battles are a mere sideshow when it comes to
              matches against Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Games between the clubs have not always reflected the wider story: in
              the 1980s a constant consolation for United fans was their superb record against
              Liverpool (Hughes and Robson on that electric night at Maine Road in
              the FA Cup semi-final, Norman Whiteside in the last minute at Anfield,
              the Russell Beardsmore inspired New Year's Day win at Old Trafford).</p>
              <p>And
              in the early part of this decade, when United were walking away with
              titles, Liverpool enjoyed a number of victories (Danny Murphy and his
              various winners at Old Trafford, that Steven Gerrard screamer at
              Anfield, the League Cup victory in Cardiff).</p>
              <p>And ahead of the
              latest instalment on Saturday, we look back at four memorable matches
              of the past (I could have picked 24) – I am as aware as anybody of the
              nature of the rivalry, so have carefully chosen a Manchester United
              win, a Liverpool win and two draws .... and you can’t say fairer than
              that.<br></p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1977 FA CUP FINAL: UNITED 2 LIVERPOOL 1</span><br></h2>
              <p>Liverpool were chasing a treble after winning the league title under Paisley .</p>
              <p>Their famous pilgrimage to Rome was only days away, but first they had to beat their old rivals United at Wembley.</p>
              <p>United
              for their part were determined to win the old pot, having lost in
              surprise fashion to second division Southampton in the 1976 final.</p>
              <p>
              
              
              
              
              
              </p>
              <p>Tommy
              Docherty, one of the most charismatic if not the best of United
              managers, had promised the Manchester public as much after that painful
              defeat.</p>
              <p>The first half at Wembley was a largely nondescript
              affair but the match burst into life early in the second period with
              three goals in five minutes.</p>
              <p>Stuart Pearson burst clear from
              Jimmy Greenhoff's clever header to put United in front, smashing a shot
              inside Ray Clemence's near post.</p>
              <p>But Liverpool quickly struck
              back, with Jimmy Case superbly turning just inside the United penalty
              area and firing an equaliser into the top corner.</p>

              </div>
              <p>United's winner had more than a touch of fortune about it, with Lou
              Macari's shot deflecting off Greenhoff and beyond a helpess Clemence.</p>
              <p>As
              an interesting aside compare and contrast the sporting nature of the
              events at the end of the final with the rancour of today.</p>
              <p>Many
              Liverpool supporters offered warm congratulations to their great
              rivals, while many United fans (yes, this happened) sung along to
              'You'll Never Walk Alone'. Different times indeed ..</p>
              <p>Liverpool would pick themselves up the following Wednesday in the Italian capital with a 3-1 victory
              over Borussia Monchengladbach, to claim their first European Cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1983 MILK CUP FINAL: LIVERPOOL 2 UNITED 1</span></h2>
              <p>Liverpool were in their pomp, United under Ron Atkinson were trying in vain to keep up.</p>
              <p>But
              although United were no match for their rivals over a long league
              season, they could always beat anybody on their day. Not this day.</p>
              <p>I
              maintain (but would be happy to have it corrected and put to bed in my
              mind) that this was the last League Cup final not to be covered live on
              television.</p>
              <p>Norman Whiteside gave United an early lead, superbly controlling the ball off his chest<br>and turning to fire home.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Liverpool looked to be running out of time to find an equaliser, but
              what younger supporters may not realise is that long before the days
              that late goals from United would come to characterise the reign of Sir
              Alex, Liverpool made a happy habit themselves of rescuing games late on.</p>
              <p>And so it was that Alan Kennedy fired a shot from distance that evaded the diving Gary Bailey and gave Liverpool their leveller.</p>
              <p>And
              in extra time Ronnie Whelan curled a superb second goal to win the
              League Cup for the Merseysiders for the third year in succession.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Paisley, one of the nice men of the game, went first up the Wembley
              steps to lift the trophy in his final season as Liverpool boss (another
              thing to remember: winning pots mattered more then, even the League
              Cup).</p>
              <p>Both clubs would go on to enjoy celebrations in May, with
              Liverpool successfully defending their league title and United beating
              Brighton to win the FA Cup after a replay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 style="color: #ff0000;">1988 FIRST DIVISION: LIVERPOOL 3 UNITED 3</h2>
              <p>Quite
              simply a different era in the game - with Liverpool still the premier
              force in English football and Alex Ferguson (he was just plain Alex in
              those long ago days) just two years into his extraordinary reign.</p>
              <p>I
              actually put this down as the best Liverpool team of my memory (surely
              a team that would have been strongly fancied to win the European Cup
              were it not for the ban on English clubs).</p>
              <p>But as I mentioned
              earlier, individual clashes rarely bore any resemblance to the wider
              story in this decade and United would storm back to stun Anfield on
              this spring afternoon.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Steve McMahon scored Liverpool's third goal at Anfield</p>
              </div>
              <p>Peter Beardsley, Gary Gillespie and Steve McMahon were all on target
              for the hosts - with John Motson screaming words to the effect that it
              was a magnificent performance 'even by Liverpool standards'.</p>
              <p>Robson,
              who was time and again United's saviour in those years, scored again to
              give United hope but when Colin Gibson was sent off the points looked
              to be heading to Anfield.</p>
              <p>But Gordon Strachan burst through to
              cooly score an equaliser for United, and his celebrations in front of
              the Kop (remember him smoking an imaginary cigar) would be one to
              savour for United supporters.</p>
              <p>The match was memorable enough, but
              the post-match interviews were also explosive, with Ferguson
              complaining on the wireless that decisions had gone against his side.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish held up his baby daughter Lauren to say the press would get more sense out of her.</p>

              <p>Liverpool would go on to win the league title, winning by a distance
              from runners-up United, but they would suffer the shock of a lifetime
              in losing the FA Cup final to Wimbledon.</p>
              <p>Alan Hansen would later joke that Liverpool 'were forever blowing doubles'.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1994 PREMIER LEAGUE: LIVERPOOL 3 UNITED 3</span><br></h2>
              <p>Now here was a match – a feast of a Premier League game that will stay long in the memory.</p>
              <p>United
              had a wonderful side that season (many United fans will always have
              this down as their favourite team under Sir Alex) which enthralled
              football lovers everywhere with their attacking style.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
              were in a largely 'transitional' period under Graeme Souness, with four
              years having passed since their previous title success in 1990.</p>
              <p>And on this cold January night many home fans were fearing an embarrassment after just 24 minutes.</p>

              <p>Dennis Irwin's superb free-kick then put United 3-0 up, to the delight of the travelling supporters.</p>
              <p>Martin
              Tyler, in an echo of Motson's words from my previous choice, shouted
              that 'even by Manchester United's standards it was simply stunning.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>But Nigel Clough pulled a goal back with a fine shot from distance
              and when he scored again before half-time the comeback was on.</p>
              <p>The second half was actually superb, with the action end to end and the drama unrelenting.</p>
              <p>The
              game was always likely to finish 3-3 or 2-4, and it turned out to be
              the former when Neil Ruddock headed home with 11 minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>The
              home support was sent into delirium. It was as if everything had
              reversed: now it was Liverpool fans who had to rely on positive results
              against United for their consolations.</p>
              <p>United would go on to
              win their first league and cup double, seeing off Blackburn in the
              title race and beating Chelsea 4-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley.</p>
              <p>If
              somebody had suggested then that 15 years on Liverpool would still be
              waiting to add to their 18 league titles, you would have dismissed them
              out of sight.</p>
              <p>As it is, of course, United have since gone on to
              dominate football for near enough a generation and have a chance to
              equal Liverpool's record of 18 titles this season.</p>
              <p>Roll on Anfield this Saturday lunchtime and the latest episode of a memorable saga.</p>
