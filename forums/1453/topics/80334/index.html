'Cos we don't know whether he can converse well in English !<br><br>Martin O.Neill ?<br><br>I think he is the most likeliest candidate so far , although Celtic denied any links ! Houllier did denied everything before his sacking , so did Beckham to Real Madrid , so every denial must not take for granted !<br><br>Strachan ?

My bet , but does he wants a return ?<br><br>Capello ? My Outsider bet ! Has tremendous experience in European Competition , a shrew tactician , an eye for good player , a great coach to groom stars , where else can he do that , only at LFC ! Without much re$ource at Roma , he did a good job there , if LFC can offer him a reliable budget for players , plus our original sets fo players , he can do it at Anfield !<br><br>Rainieri ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Read any links ?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Rick Parry is a very shrewd person. He at first assured that Houllier job is safe and he will have 30 millions of transfer funds. This is to motivate Houllier to finish 4th.So as to keep Gerrard and Owen at Anfield. Good move!<br><br>My bet for the new manager is Martin O'Neil.<br><br>Alan and Gordon does not have what it takes.<br><br>Ranieri would be a good choice , provided he is really sacked from chelsea.</div>

The earlier it's known, the sooner (n perhaps cheaper) we can get the players we want/need.<br><br>I think if our priority is domestic honours, then we need to go for "local" as in those with EPL experiences - Martin O'Neil or Alan Curbishley is fine.  But I suspect Strachan name is not mentioned out of the blue...read tat he resigned fm Soton to rest n to be readily available 4 his new job.<br><br>But if we're looking for big-names, then Benitez gotta be a strong favourite at this moment.
