            <div class='col-md body'>Alan Pardew had words of praise for Graham Poll after the referee warned the Charlton boss that Alex Song was in danger of being sent off in Monday's 0-0 draw with Reading.<br><br>Song had already been booked for a nasty tackle on Steve Sidwell in the first half at The Valley, and was promptly substituted by Pardew on 69 minutes after losing his discipline further.<br><br>A red card for the on-loan Arsenal man could have had catastrophic consequences for an Addicks team desperate to avoid relegation from the Premiership.<br><br>Now Pardew has revealed that he hatched a plan to gain advance warning of whether Song was heading for trouble, and has praised Poll for assisting him in keeping a full complement of 11 players on the pitch.<br><br>"I went to see Graham Poll and I said 'I need to have some signal if he is getting close to being sent off'," Pardew revealed in The Sun.<br><br>"He sent me that signal so Alex had to come off.<br><br>"Alex made an undisciplined challenge which put himself under pressure. He needs to learn from that but he was brilliant at times.<br><br>"It was full credit to Graham. That's the sort of refereeing you need. Nobody wants to see a team go down to 10 men and I think he did the right thing.<br><br>"If there was more of that communication between us and the referees, we would see far fewer incidents on the pitch.<br><br>"I knew Graham was under pressure so I said to him 'If Song makes another challenge you are unhappy about - and I can't do nothing if it's a bad one and he's got to go - but if he is making silly ones and the next one is going to be it then let me know'.<br><br>"I think that is within the laws of the game."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would think is unfair, he can warn the player but don't think its fair to warn the manager of his intention. wondering if that will get Poll into trouble?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea i feels it unfair also..you're supposed to know ur own player &amp; limits..<br><br>like when chelsea won liverpool 1-0 at stamford bridge, if i'm not wrong, benitez knew to take sissoko out.. i think its more gotta do with him making silly challenges then a tactical one at that time.<br><br>no offence hor, just stating a example.</div>
