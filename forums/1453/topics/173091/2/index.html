            <div class='col-md body'>Finally woke up. Match not good for the heart. Must rest today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Comments:<br><br>Central defence really getting tired. Instable offside trap. Riise put the Luton player on for the first goal. Carra too tired to track the player for the second goal. Normally, he could have prevented that. Pitch is also a problem. Third Luton goal, oh thank you, Hyypia, I was saying to myself. Daniel Agger better come quick and fit in quickly. All other Premier League clubs are ready to attack Liverpool after this.<br><br>Disappointing players: Sissoko and Crouch. Sissoko looked, again, totally lost at centre midfield. Cannot get a tackle right, couldn't get hold of the loose balls and just let Luton players run around him in circles. Taking him was a good move and a masterstroke.<br><br>Crouch, for all his height, couldn't even get to head the ball at all. I wonder, can he jump? Or is he too lazy to jump?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Dun be surprised if he goes on another 18-game barren streak.<br><br>My MotM: Xabi Alonso. Okay, he didn't do well in the first half but I think he, ironically, stabilised the midfield after Sissoko went off. I was thinking he don't know how to work with Sissoko and hence all that confusion. Liverpool only had that 1 shot on target on the first half. Clearly, that centre midfield pairing doesn't work.<br><br>His passes in the second half were brillant, full of awareness and intelligent play. His goals were awesome, opportunistic and impressive.<br><br>Good job Liverpool for never admitting defeat. Stamina, grit, determination and quality won in the end.<br><br>Onwards to Round 4!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Their fowards exploited the space between our CB and FB and made a lot of diagonal runs to confuse our defence. That seems to be a major weakness in our defence.<br><br>Eg. X is the Luton striker<br><br>-------------Carson----------------<br><br>Finnan--<strong>X</strong>--Sami--Carra--Riise<br><br>And when they attack in numbers, Finnan moves forward to engage their winger. X makes a diagonal run and moves into the space left behind by Finnan. Sami will have no choice but to follow. Sami does not have the pace to handle pacy strikers. That is the point when our defence is most vulnerable.<br><br>-----------------Carson-----------------<br><br>------<strong>X</strong>-- Sami-------------------<br><br>---------------------------Carra----Riise<br><br>--Finnan----<br><br>We usually rely on our offside trap to prevent situations like this. Finnan, Sami and Carra usually employ the offside trap well (evident from the replays).<br><br>Riise/ Traore are poor in positioning and are frequently too slow to stay in line.<br><br>The same situations arose when we play Chelsea at Anfield and against Bolton.<br><br>Solution:<br>1 CB with pace<br>+ 1 new LB who has better positioning.<br><br>Thoughts anyone?</div>
