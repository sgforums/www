              <p>Gerrard, who has led the Reds' challenge to United for the Premier League title, will receive his award at the FWA's gala dinner at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London on May 29.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chairman of the FWA Steve Bates, chief football writer for The People, said: "Steven's performances this season have been of the highest quality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"His drive and desire have underpinned Liverpool's Premier League title challenge and ensured a tight finish to the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Steven is clearly in his prime and quite rightly rated one of the finest midfield players of his generation, and the FWA are delighted to honour his contribution to club and country."</p>

              <p>Terry: Lamps deserved award over Gerrard</p>
              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Chelsea captain John Terry believes team-mate Frank Lampard deserved to win the Football Writers’ Player of the Year award ahead of Steven Gerrard.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Gerrard scooped the prize, voted for by football journalists, with PFA Player of the Year Ryan Giggs coming second and his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney third. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The Liverpool captain has enjoyed a hugely influential season, netting 15 goals in 29 Premier League games to help The Reds sustain a title challenge. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">But Terry feels Lampard would have been a more deserving recipient and was astonished his club team-mate did not even make the top three.  </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">“I can't believe Lamps hasn't won it if I'm honest,” Terry told the official club website. “Nemanja Vidic has done well, but, even with him, one bad game against Liverpool and everyone ruled him out of it. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">“Six years now, I've been playing consistently with 'Lamps' and he scores 20 goals a year, for a midfielder that is unbelievable.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">“Jamie Carragher might tell you Stevie G deserves to win it, but, for me, seeing 'Lamps' day in and day out what he brings to this club is incredible. As a group of players we feel 'Lamps' should be as a minimum in the top three.”</span></p>

              <p><br>if one club , contribute one Player-of-the-season , in England , 92 players for one simple award ....... And simply Gerrard won it .</p>
              <p>Why does SG won it ?</p>
              <p>It's not whether it's a simple or prestigious award .</p>
              <p>It's the significant of the award ?</p>
              <p>I asked again : " Why did SG won it ? Not Tevez or Terry or others ? Why Gerrard ? "</p>
              <p>What did SG did , that those writers voted for him ?</p>
              <p>Cos he handsome ? Cos he model for Armani ? Cos he played for Liverpool ?</p>
              <p>No , cos he's that good , that's all .</p>
              <p>Don't you agree ?</p>

              <p>Same sentiments , why did Giggs won the award last week ?</p>
              <p>If i said , those players voted for him , because he's in his twilight years and yet he won nothing thru out his career ? He won this award out of sympathy for Giggs ,  U not happy , right ?</p>
              <p>Mu fans will always think one side , Liverpool fans always think one side ... there goes the argument .</p>
              <p>And MU fans will rebate : " Giggs is good ."</p>
              <p>That's the story . He's good .</p>
              <p>That's all .</p>
              <p>If Gerrard is good , or Giggs is good , and were voted to win big or small award , pls accept it ! In good faith , what to argue ?</p>

              FULLY DESERVED !!!!
              
              said John Barnes.....
              
              *****************************************
              
              After another exception season, in which he has netted 23 goals so far, the Liverpool captain was announced as the winner of the prestigious prize earlier this week. 
                
              Barnes, who was the last Reds player to win the award in 1990, says the accolade is fully deserved and feels it serves as a clear indication of the progress made by Rafa Benitez's side this season. 
                
              "Steven Gerrard winning the Football Writers Association Player of the Year award was well deserved," said the former Anfield winger, who made 407 appearances for Liverpool. 
                
              "As the last Liverpool player to win this award back in 1990 it has been a long time coming for a player from my old club. 
                
              "The players who usually pick up this award play for the teams who generally win the league so not only is this a testament to Stevenâ€™s performances over the season, it is also a testament to the Liverpool players around him. 
                
              "This is the closest that my old club have come to winning the title for a number of years and this is another sign that they are getting closer to doing just that. 
                
              "Liverpool have improved dramatically this season and Steven has been at the very heart of that so congratulations to him as his form deserved to be recognised. Steven is a team player, a leader in every sense with his goals, performances and selfless work for the team. 
                
              "He has played a big part in Liverpoolâ€™s resurgence and will be driving the team forward again next season as my old club continues to close the gap on Manchester United."
