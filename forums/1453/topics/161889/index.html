He has since trained with Ajax, but was unable to impress enough to gain a contract.<br><br>The former Milan and Barcelona ace, reportedly on Â£40,000 a week while at Stamford Bridge, has now decided the time is right to hang up his boots and concentrate on 'other commitments'.<br><br>At the end of his time at Chelsea, during which he repeatedly refused a transfer away from the Blues, Bogarde said:<br><br>"After four long years of being frozen out by the Chelsea manager I am finally free, after spending such a long period in the wilderness. My time at Chelsea has been extremely unhappy. Throughout my ordeal I have always behaved correctly to the club.<br><br>"I haven't caused any problems for anyone and I have served my time in a professional way. It would have been easy to have been disruptive but I didn't want to behave that way. I've been counting down the days for a long time, so I'm pleased that the final few days flashed by like they were seconds.<br><br>'In my own mind as I left Harlington for the last time, I was very, very happy. Four hard years were behind me. I was so glad it was over.'</blockquote>Won't you ever wish to be like him?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess playing regular football wasn't top of his agenda during his time at Chelsea. Most players would have moved by the 2nd year. Bogarde just stayed on.<br><br>He may have gotten a huge paycheck at the end of it all, but was it really worth it going through all that unhappiness? For his standards, he could have been playing and getting a decent enough wage elsewhere.</div>
