Personally, I also hope the future of GH be made clearer than it is now.<br><br>The following extract makes a good read...written by the editor of Koptalk:-<br><br>********<br><br>I don't care whether you want him sacked or not, the bloke deserves more than this. I've been very critical of the manager many, many times but I will never forget the tears he shed when he delivered the treble in 2001. Then of course the tale about him having a radio sneaked into the hospital when he was critically ill so that he could listen to our games under his sheets. The comparisons to Shankly have ceased but I still have a lot of respect for the man and if he is pushed, it would be a very, very emotional day for me. On one hand I would be relieved but on the other I'd be gutted. It would be a strange day but we all move on because you get nowhere in life by just been nice, just ask Roy Evans.<br><br>We always new that the club were going to review the situation at the end of the season but I just feel it has all been handled wrong. Are they trying to force his hand so the pressure builds up so much so that he cracks and hands in his resignation saving the club a packet in compensation or has this situation been deliberately timed to take us away from the proposed Thai deal? They sack Houllier and the speculation that will follow will be far more exciting and interesting than any investment proposals from Thailand.<br><br>Still, I can't help but think that the boss is getting a bit of his own treatment at the moment that he has dished out to various people associated to the club, be they current players or retired players from decades gone by. It's so ironic that this time he could be the one bombed out with little notice.....<br><br>I don't think it's fair to play with people's lives. It may be football and business but it doesn't mean it's right. I'm going to be controversial but I'd like to see him remain in charge until he sees out his contract. This gives him one final push, especially with Cisse coming in. How can we proceed with a multi-million pound transfer that may not fit in with the plans of the new manager?<br><br>What will be, will be. We'll just have to let the board do what they think is best. But I plead with them to either back him or sack him as quickly as possible.<br><br>**********<br><br></span></span></div>
