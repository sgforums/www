              <p>ever since kenny resigned in 1991, which managers then and now look like challenging for the title? rafa almost won it last season, the closest they came winning the title. rafa also won CL, so he is the most successful manager since kenny. houllier also did not do badly, he won the uefa cup, fa cup and league cup in 2001.</p>

              <p>just for discussion sake, if Rafa is sacked, will a new manager come in and be able to raise the level/quality of the players? cause there seems to be two issues, the inadaptness of Rafa, and the quality of the players.</p>
              <p>Qn -&gt; Will Rafa leaving, improve the latter?Who else is there?</p>
              <p>hmm, there seems to be another issues, the owners. The two Owners are moving around in Middle East, trying to source for rich to buy over the club. However, I read, there seems to be the debt, plus the need for new players, and a new stadium, and that seems to be compilcated compared to the straight forward buy of MCity. hence the bottleneck.</p>
