This news makes me laugh. The only names coming out of the talks between Inter and Real are those of Figo and Samuel,Â” said Tirri.<br><br>The FIFA agent also provided the time-span he believes it will take for all matters to be done and dusted.<br><br>Â“The talks are very advanced. By Tuesday or Wednesday both players will vest the Inter jersey. Real were holding back because they were looking for replacements. But Samuel and Figo will soon be InterÂ’s,Â” he explained.<br><br>Figo is expected to join the Nerazzurri on a two-year contract worth around 3.5/4 million Euros per season.<br><br>Argentine defender Samuel is instead expected to arrive at MorattiÂ’s court on a one-year loan.<br></div>

'I know I'm not the coach's first or even second choice in my position. But I want to see out my contract. I will do all I can for my club.'<br><br>England striker Michael Owen played wide on the right for Real in the first half before Figo's arrival in the second half.<br><br>Figo, a former world player of the year, had been a pre-season target for European champions Liverpool until Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo warned players unhappy about his selection policies that they should leave.<br><br>Figo's penalty gave Real Madrid a hard-fought 3-2 win in the third match of their lucrative pre-season tour on Saturday.<br><br>England captain David Beckham did not play because of a hamstring injury sustained in the United States last week and Real began sluggishly in rain-soaked Beijing.<br><br>'The pitch was very difficult to play on tonight because it was so wet,' Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo told reporters. 'It was hard to play to our real level. If the rain hadn't been so heavy the result might have been different.'<br><br>Real, who twice trailed on a water-logged pitch, were given a wake-up call when a Lu Jiang header gave the Chinese side a shock lead after 32 minutes.<br><br>The Spanish club struck back five minutes later through captain Raul, who dribbled past two defenders before applying a clinical finish.<br><br>Serbian forward Branko Jelic restored the home team's lead with a solo effort in the 73rd minute, only for Guti to equalise from close range with just over 10 minutes left.<br><br>Substitute Figo, who has been linked with a move away from Madrid, secured victory for the visitors from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute.<br><br>The 70,000-capacity Beijing Workers' Stadium was only just over half full for the match despite the enormous hype surrounding Real's visit.<br><br>Real began their six-match pre-season tour with a 3-1 win over Mexico's Chivas Guadalajara in Chicago and a 2-0 victory against the Los Angeles Galaxy in California.<br><br>The Spanish giants play two games in Japan next week before finishing the money-spinning trip with a friendly in Bangkok.<br><br>Sorry liverpool fans..It looks like he won't be coming..But who knows??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rafa won't rule out Figo arrival<br>Rafael Benitez has refused to rule out the prospect of Luis Figo completing a free transfer from Real Madrid while insisting that Â£7million-rated Milan Baros was in his squad for the Champions League qualifier against the Lithuanian champions.<br><br>Liverpool are believed to have turned down a Â£5million bid from Aston Villa for Baros, insisting the offer is way short of their valuation for the Czech star.<br><br>And, although playing Baros in a European game would not only cup tie him in UEFA competitions but also instantly reduce his valuation, Liverpool boss Benitez claimed he will consider playing the striker in the game against Kaunas.<br><br>Benitez was cagey when both players were discussed, with Baros being a target not only of Villa but West Ham and Deportivo La Coruna.<br><br>Only the Spanish side are involved in Europe, Deportivo are in the Intertoto Cup and face Newcastle next week in the semi-finals.<br><br>A decision on their interest could be delayed until they know whether they are in the UEFA Cup or not.<br><br>Baros' advisors are planning talks with Benitez about the player's future but it is unlikely that any move is imminent.<br><br>Figo is returning from pre-season games in China with Madrid, having indicated that he would not be joining Inter Milan and was happy to see out the final season of his contract with Real.<br><br>As far as Liverpool are concerned, the sticking point is believed to be the Portuguese star's wage demands.<br><br>He is on Â£80,000 a week at the Bernabeu and wants more than the Â£65,000 Liverpool are prepared to offer.<br><br>Twice asked if would he like him to come to Anfield, Benitez replied : 'He's a good player.'<br><br>And, given the opportunity to deny his interest, the Liverpool manager pointedly declined to answer.<br><br>On Baros, Benitez refused to rule the striker out of the game having declined to play him in both TNS matches in the last round.<br><br>He said: 'Milan is in the squad and he can play against Kaunas, it is a possibility. He is our player, we will see what the possibilities are, we will see tomorrow.'<br><br>Benitez has injury doubts over Steve Finnan and Djimi Traore, but would not give any indication of Baros' involvement.<br><br>Baros has scored five goals in pre-season friendlies, two in the 4-3 defeat of Olympiacos on Saturday.<br><br>And the Spanish coach said: 'As far as I am concerned he is in my squad. I will see tomorrow if he plays or not.<br><br>'He is here, in the squad and can play. He is happy and training well, he is playing and scoring goals, of course he is happy.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I take it that he won't be coming....<br><br>We still need a right midfield and a back-up centre back.....maybe move Zenden to the right, Traore will be the back-up centre back. Riise will be the left back and that Mark Gonzalez will operate down that left flank....</div>
