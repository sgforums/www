Steven Gerrard: He'd make any team in the PShip, seems to curbed his excesses without having a detrimental effect on his game.<br><br>2. Milan 'The Man' Baros: Starting to bloom - keep it going.<br><br>3. Smicer's not playing :-) At least he's company for Milan<br><br>4. Kewell. Class goal - tough to go back to Elland Road. Can drift in games - but there's always that something extra in him - the ability to do the fantastic and unusual. His star will burn bright next season.<br><br>5. Carragher. The fiery heart of a true Red, will play well as central defender when Risse returns to form.<br><br>6. Finnan. Quiet guy - does the job and more - attacks and defends with skill.<br><br>7. Goalies. Two excellent goal keepers - could be better but could be a hell of a lot worse.<br><br>8. Cisse. Will be a fine replacement for Heskey - looks mental enough to scare defenders and cope with the PShips hard men.<br><br>9. Le Tallec, Pongolle. Nuff said. Someday soon these boys will emerges as Red Giants, pillaging defences, burning down the pitch with vision and Zidane like poise.<br><br>10. Cheyrou. There's gold there if he keeps digging.<br><br>We haven't played well this year, to say the least, but let's get the Anfield fires raging - a bit of spirit and determination can see us through and teach the new boys what it means to wear the shirt. Let's be positive we're going to get nowhere beating ourselves up while the opposition laughs at us.<br><br>*****<br>I agree with most, but sceptical abt some.<br><br></span></span></div>

Maybe those pundits has seen LFC success with SWEEPERS ! I just have to agree with them on this !<br><br>In fact , LFC has always been a Sweeper team , with players like Mark Lawrenson , Jan Molby , Gary Gillespie doing a Beckenbaur style of football with distinction !<br><br>They too were saying our midfield and frontline is alright , i too have to agree with them on this !</span></span></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Surely there are more negatives ...but his thread is supposed to make us feel good - to look on the bright side  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>To me, I may add tat we're definitely playing less defensive than we used to this season.  In some matches, I can proudly say we played well with good attacking football - the problem is consistency as most of us concurred.  The more forward-play may explain why we're also leaking goals at the back.  Is the defence our weakest link?<br><br>I think the SHs p/ship together with Finnan and Carragher are still the the best combination we can have now.  If we must find responsible parties for the goals leaked, then it's the team as a whole...surely we see how the Gunners attack and defend as a unit - tat's the way to go.  Perhaps we're lacking in players of the right quality, but tat is more true with the other departments including the strikers.<br><br></span></span></div>

When someone daubed grafitti on the walls of Melwood and sent a death threat to Gerard Houllier, we were all attacked and a question mark appeared over the heads of each and everyone of us. The majority of football pundits seemed to accept that disgruntled Liverpool fans were behind such terrible acts with only a few saying it was likely to be rival fans tarnishing our good name.<br><br>All of us have at some time expressed frustration about results, performances, selections etc - that is football and that's what gives us something to talk about. Even the fans I know that would have Gerard replaced as manager today if given chance, would never stoop so low at to even call him names never mind threaten the man.<br><br>At KopTalk.com we're lucky to have a fantastic reader base of Liverpool fans from all over the world. It was a proud day yesterday when one of our forum members by the name of 'KingKenny' suggested we also think of Mrs Houllier at this difficult time. He proposed we all chip in with a couple of quid and send some flowers to her. The pledges have started to flood in and today we placed an order totalling Â£121.20 and sent them to Gerard to take home for her. Not only that but the remainder of donations that have been pledged - which could easily exceed Â£1000 if everyone coughs up - will be donated to The Gerard Houllier Charitable Trust - a registered charity.<br><br>**************<br><br></span></span></div>
