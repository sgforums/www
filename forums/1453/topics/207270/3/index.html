            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder why people here are all that shocked when Liverpool FC came away with a good thumping by Everton.<br><br>I am bemused by all the pre-match predictions on here. Some of you are as naive to think that Liverpool will win three nil, four nil and other such differing goal margins. I, on the other hand, thought that a draw would be a good result. A one nil loss was feasible. I was wrong in both accounts, as we not only failed to draw but were trashed three nil.<br><br>But I am not surprised.<br><br>First of all, it was a derby. Pronounced darby. Derbies are totally unpredictable affairs and very ugly. The game was played at a hundred miles per hour with non-stop running and aggression. You have to give credit to the Toffees. They knew how much beating Liverpool would mean to their fans. It is a feeling on par with achieving European qualification. You would expect those Everton players to walk out onto the pitch giving no less than their best. And more. To give nothing but would be criminal for football.<br><br>Did you see the Blue team's reaction when they scored those goals? Pure ecstasy. More importantly, did you see the fans' reactions? As a Red I too could see how much these Everton fans, their players and their manager wanted this victory so badly, and that was the difference.<br><br>Derbies are a sporting event which may be hard for the average Singaporean to understand. Liverpool and Everton share a rivalry so unfathomable that concededly, Singaporean Liverpool fans like us do not fully understand what goes between these two fiercely competitive neighbours because we are simply not 'there'. As Liverpool fans living abroad, we do not really feel that deep-seated rivalry between teams such as Liverpool and Everton, Spurs and Arsenal or Newcastle and Sunderland. We only read about that fierce rivalry in the papers. Most of us tend to ignore the psychological impact it has on the ninety minutes, which is very significant.  The closest thing I can imagine to a sporting derby around these local parts would be a Singapore-Selangor match back in the Malaysia Cup days, where the Kallang Roar would reach to penultimate levels and passion truly boiled over. Those days are long gone.<br><br>If you had listened to what Steve McMahon (a former Liverpool player) on ESPN has to say about derbies, you will get a sense of what I am talking about. In derbies, the fans that heat up the rivalry truly make themselves the twelfth man factor, pushing their players to their very limits of their play. And from what I saw of Goodison park tonight, the whole stadium was blue. Both ends of the stadium, one of which would traditionally be reserved for the away team's fans, were packed with Evertonians.<br><br>Do not take too much heart from this result.<br><br>Man for man, player for player, Liverpool are way better than Everton in the talent department. I am not boasting my club's abilities. It is just a fact many cannot argue with reason.<br><br>We have to know derbies are the exception. I rather we drop points against Everton and make the Liverpool derby virgins taste their baptism of fire before we come up against more important rivals such as United at Old Trafford. Everton are not serious title challengers - clubs like Manchester United, our greatest rivals, are. Now players such as Kuyt, Aurelio and Pennant know what it is like to play in such hostile atmospheres against Liverpool.<br><br>We lost the tactical battle, I believe, in major part due to the psychological impact (or should I say trauma) suffered by our players on this day.<br><br>Lesson learnt. Let's move on with life. We are reminded that the team which brings on the greater passion to the pitch will be justly rewarded.<br><br>Sincere congratulations to Everton for their lion-hearted and lion-jawed display.</div>

He went with Fowler &amp; Crouch from the start... From what i saw, Fowler was totally a waste of one place. Don't know where was Bellamy &amp; Kuyt. And to make matters worst, a unfit Jamie Carragher &amp; Riise was also played. Carragher made a stupid mistakes by trying to flick the ball from the on rushing Johnson and Riise hurt himself again.<br><br>Reina also made big time mistake, first goal the ball went through his legs, second, beaten at the near post... the third, no need to say... looked funny, they should get Scott Carson back i think.</div></blockquote>Dont need Carson lah, Dudek can do the job, tell that stupid Reina go fly kite better.<br><br>Luis Garcia &amp; Fowler and unfit Risse &amp; Carragher shouldn't have played, Ah Ben dont know thinking what..</div>

We all know its a derby, and unless you just became a pool fan just last year you should also know the difference.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with thinking pool could have won by 2, 3 goals... Haven't you notice that pool have been winning the last few years meeting by that margins too, weren't they derby too?<br><br>Of course Everton's players &amp; fans would be happy, as they have not beaten pool for a long time already... If pool player had scored the first goal, i bet he would be just as happy...</div>
