              The five-time European champions face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium tomorrow in a quarter-final first leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              Although the Gunners have dominated their domestic clashes in recent seasons - with Liverpool winning just three times in the last seven years - Gerrard believes European matches are a different prospect.
              <p> </p>
              And he pointed to the Reds' Champions League victory over AC Milan in 2005 and appearance in the final again last season as proof of their credentials.
              <p> </p>
              'We are a good side in Europe and we are always confident whoever we come up against we can qualify,' he said. 'I think other teams are more concerned about us because we have proved over the last two or three years we are one of the best sides in the competition.
              <p> </p>
              'We have nothing to fear - just go there full of confidence and give it our best shot.'
              <p> </p>
              Confidence is high after Sunday's victory in the 207th Merseyside derby, which Gerrard believes was the ideal preparation for facing English opponents in the Champions League.
              <p> </p>
              'A big derby win and the fans are happy and the players are happy,' said the England midfielder. 'It is going to be a really tough game (against Arsenal) but we are looking forward to it now and go into it full of confidence.'
              <p> </p>
              Gerrard would have preferred to be facing less familiar opposition - the teams faced each other four times in the league, FA and Carling Cups last season and will, by a quirk of the fixture list, also play in the Barclays Premier League this weekend.
              <p> </p>
              However, he accepts it is just another hurdle to overcome.
              <p> </p>
              'Before the draw was made you are looking for a team in (continental) Europe but you get what you are given and to win this cup you have to beat the best,' added the 27-year-old.
              <p> </p>
              'When we won it in 2005 we had to beat all the best teams so I'm sure we will have to do it again.
              <p> </p>
              'If you look at our games against Chelsea (they played the Blues three successive seasons in the Champions League) they were slightly different from the league games.
              <p> </p>
              'It is a cup competition and it is different from playing for three points. I'm sure it will be different but we know we are in for two very tough games.'
              <p> </p>
              Gerrard is also hopeful Arsenal's faint Premier League title hopes will mean they are not fully focused on European glory.
              <p> </p>
              The Gunners stayed in the race for the title on Saturday after coming from 2-0 down to beat Bolton 3-2 with 10 men.
              <p> </p>
              'They have one more thing to play for. Had they not won maybe it would have made it more difficult for us. Now they have still got half a chance in the league maybe that will distract them a bit.'

              <p class="lastUpdate">Updated: April 2, 2008, 5:02 PM ET</p>
              <p>Arsenal were left frustrated as Liverpool held on for what could to be a crucial 1-1 draw from the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final clash at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>The Gunners, who have seen their Premier League title hopes fade following a run of just one win in six, had taken an early lead through Emmanuel Adebayor.</p>
              <p>However, the Reds, last season's beaten finalists, hit back quickly through Dirk Kuyt's close-range effort after a fine run from captain Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Arsenal dominated the second half and should have had a penalty when Alexander Hleb was clearly tugged back by Kuyt.</p>
              <p>However, Arsene Wenger's men could not find a way past Liverpool who will now fancy their chances of securing another European Cup semi-final appearance when the two sides meet again at Anfield next Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>Despite the electric atmosphere, it was a cagey opening for what was the 200th meeting of the sides, who will face off once more in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
              <p>After seven minutes, Adebayor raced onto a long through-ball as Jose Reina dashed out of his goal.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool goalkeeper missed his attempted clearance, but was alert enough to recover ground and then block the follow-up cross from the Togo frontman.</p>
              <p>At the other end, Cesc Fabregas had to do some defending in his own six-yard box to deny Sami Hyypia after he had stayed up front following a corner.</p>
              <p>On 21 minutes, the Liverpool defence was split by a fine chipped pass from Mathieu Flamini.</p>
              <p>Robin van Persie got ahead of the two centre-backs and into the penalty area, but as the ball dropped, the Dutchman could only fire a left-footed volley over the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Reina then had to get down quickly to deny the Arsenal striker, who sent in a low shot from the edge of the box.</p>
              <p>From the resulting corner, after 22 minutes, the Gunners took the lead.</p>
              <p>Van Persie knocked the ball short to Fabregas before he whipped it into the area, where Adebayor leapt highest to nod his first goal since scoring in the defeat of AC Milan at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>However, Arsenal's lead was short-lived as the visitors grabbed what could yet prove to be a crucial away goal in the 26th minute.</p>
              <p>Gerrard powered into the left side of the penalty box, charging past three defenders.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool skipper kept his feet to send over a low cross, which Kuyt bundled in ahead of full-back Gael Clichy.</p>
              <p>The visitors were clearly lifted by their goal and enjoyed a decent spell of possession as the half-hour mark passed.</p>
              <p>However, despite plenty of action around both penalty areas, neither side was able to find a penetrating pass.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had a chance just after the restart, and Manuel Almunia needed to get down quickly to smother Kuyt's snapshot.</p>
              <p>Arsenal introduced England squad man Theo Walcott, to replace van Persie, for the second half and the teenager looked lively down the left as Hleb was given more freedom in an advanced role.</p>
              <p>Walcott picked up the ball and let fly from 25 yards, but his shot was always going wide of Reina's right-hand post.</p>
              <p>Again both teams were not scared of going forwards, however once more they lacked a decisive pass in the final third.</p>
              <p>On 65 minutes, there was a double let-off for Liverpool when Martin Skrtel blocked Emmanuel Eboue's effort before Arsenal had what looked a certain penalty turned down by the Dutch referee.</p>
              <p>Hleb weaved into the box, before he clearly had his shirt tugged back by Kuyt. However, referee Pieter Vink was unconvinced and signalled instead only for a corner.</p>
              <p>Wenger sent on Nicklas Bendtner for the final 24 minutes, replacing Eboue as Walcott moved out to the right and Hleb to the left.</p>
              <p>The Danish striker was soon in the thick of the action, somehow managing to keep out Fabregas' goalbound effort while on the line - although he was flagged offside.</p>
              <p>Arsenal continued to press in the closing stages, and in stoppage time Fabregas dived in to meet Adebayor's cross, but his header lacked power and Reina comfortably collected.</p>
              <p>Liverpool - with 10 men behind the ball for long spells - held firm and take the upper hand into next week's second leg at Anfield.</p>

              <p>Arsene Wenger blasted referee Pieter Vink for turning down an Arsenal penalty claim in tonight's 1-1 Champions League quarter-final draw in the first leg at home to Liverpool.</p>

              <p> </p>
              The match was finely balanced in the second period at the Emirates Stadium when Dirk Kuyt appeared to pull back Aleksandr Hleb in the box - only for the Dutch official to wave play on.
              <p> </p>
              Arsenal had scored first through an Emmanuel Adebayor header, Kuyt equalising four minutes later in the first half.
              <p> </p>
              Gunners boss Wenger believes his side have been denied a clear advantage for next Tuesday's second leg at Anfield.
              <p> </p>
              'There was a blatant penalty,' he said. 'It was not given - and just under the eyes of the referee. This sort of thing has happened to us frequently - and with the referee that close, it should have been given.
              <p> </p>
              'If he is in a bad position we can see why it wasn't given. But he was so close to Kuyt and still didn't give the penalty. It is difficult to understand why it wasn't given.'
              <p> </p>
              Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez said: 'I have seen the replay of the penalty appeal. But in England that sort of thing is not given, because it was not clear.'
              <p> </p>
              Wenger believes Arsenal deserved to take a lead to Anfield.
              <p> </p>
              'I feel we were not rewarded for what we produced,' he added. 'To finish that game 1-1 is disappointing. We produced the performances we wanted and we had the chances to win it.
              <p> </p>
              'Liverpool created very little, and the whole second half was played in one half. I cannot fault my players - we were unlucky on several occasions.'
              <p> </p>
              Wenger accepts Arsenal will face a tough task next week.
              <p> </p>
              'It will be a test now for us in the second leg,' he predicted. 'But we should have won. Kuyt played virtually as a second right-back for much of the game, and they defended well all over the pitch.
              <p> </p>
              'But you could see that the players have given a lot recently. In a game like that you do not create 20 chances - you may get four or five. We did manage to make that amount of chances - and just didn't take them.
              <p> </p>
              'We were punished by their one really good opportunity - and we did not take ours.'
              <p> </p>
              Wenger confirmed that Robin van Persie was taken off with a possible recurrence of a thigh injury.
              <p> </p>
              'We were caught on the counter-attack, and credit to Steven Gerrard - because he showed a tough of class by creating that goal,' he pointed out. 'But even then the ball was deflected into the six-yard area. It made it difficult for us to defend.
              <p> </p>
              'Gerrard played well, but they sat deep and just waited for the counter-attack. But he is the ideal player to find when you have won the ball and want to counter. He had a good game, because we threw men forward.
              <p> </p>
              'But if you look at our amount of possession compared to Liverpool, it is frightening that we could only come out of it with a 1-1.
              <p> </p>
              Wenger acknowledged the speed of Liverpool's reaction to going a goal down had a significant bearing on the outcome.
              <p> </p>
              'We were unsettled when they equalised - it was a mental blow,' he said. 'You could see it was a big blow for us to take - because we had scored first and we were playing well.
              <p> </p>
              'It was like a thunderstorm going through our ranks, and we lost composure and our nerve.'
              <p> </p>
              Benitez is confident Liverpool will have an advantage playing in front of their fanatical support at Anfield.
              <p> </p>
              He said: 'I do not think we are favourites now, not against a team like Arsenal. But we will be at Anfield, with our own supporters, and it will be a massive difference.
              <p> </p>
              'We will be playing against a fantastic team who have all the ability to hit us on the break - just like we did.'
              <p> </p>

              <p>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez hailed the character and belief of his side as they stormed into the European Cup semi-finals for the ninth time in their history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="phinline"><img src="http://soccernet-akamai.espn.go.com/design05/images/jb2/adabatyororocess_ge20555.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200"><br>

              <div class="photosubtext">Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fabregas show the pain of bitter defeat.</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              The amazing 4-2 quarter-final second leg victory over Arsenal, for a 5-3 aggregate win, meant Benitez had emerged triumphant and unbeaten from three clashes with the north Londoners in a week.
              <p> </p>
              Liverpool broke the hearts of Arsene Wenger's side, who led early on through Abou Diaby before Sami Hyypia's equaliser, while Emmanuel Adebayor's goal with seven minutes left would have put Arsenal into the last four on away goals when he made it 2-2 after Fernando Torres' strike.
              <p> </p>
              But Steven Gerrard's penalty, won by substitute Ryan Babel, and then a breakaway fourth from the flying Dutchman set the seal on the victory, which many old time Liverpool fans will see as revenge for Arsenal's 1989 injury-time title triumph on this same ground.
              <p> </p>
              Benitez said: 'I was delighted with the belief of my players, particularly in the second half. We had been so poor before the break, but so much better in the second period.
              <p> </p>
              'It was a tremendous game for our fans, there were six goals and we played so well.
              <p> </p>
              'I hear Steven Gerrard has said it was a poor game by him, but I was satisfied. He scored a crucially important penalty for us when it really mattered, that was positive from him to take it so well.
              <p> </p>
              'Now we have Chelsea again in the semi-final. Again it will be a very, very tough game against an excellent side. But like tonight, we have enough experience of such matches and clearly the belief to succeed again.
              <p> </p>
              'And when we went to 2-2 so near the end, my players showed tremendous character and desire to get up off the ground to win the tie.'
              <p> </p>
              Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger considered the penalty that swung the game late on was 'dodgy' and his side had been the victim of bad decisions in both legs.
              <p> </p>
              At the Emirates last week Arsenal were denied a spot-kick when Dirk Kuyt pulled back Alex Hleb, and in this match Liverpool were awarded a spot-kick for a foul on Babel by Kolo Toure.
              <p> </p>
              Wenger said: 'I felt at that stage the game was over at 2-2. Then there was a dodgy penalty and we started to lose concentration.
              <p> </p>
              'Over the two games this is hard to swallow. The big decisions over penalties in both matches have gone against us.
              <p> </p>
              'It is difficult to take, the players in the dressing room are very down because they believe week after week the decisions are going against them.
              <p> </p>
              'It was not a penalty tonight, I have seen the replay. But we were denied a clear penalty last week. That was a real penalty, this one wasn't.'
              <p> </p>
              He added: 'And even at 2-2 we had a great chance to kill the game off. But we lacked experience and made big mistakes.
              <p> </p>
              'We conceded a goal from a corner and gave Fernando Torres too much room when he scored.
              <p> </p>
              'It will be hard now, we have to go to Manchester United next at the weekend, but we will try to finish strongly. But we still feel a great sense of injustice.'
