              <p>omg.seriously lah. ALL the BIG clubs should hire this author to be the talent spotter for their club lah. he determined aquilani as a flop in just two games. can you just imagine how great his 'potential-sighting' powers are? i'm very certain he can spot the next fernando torres/ronaldo/messi/gerrard with just one glance.impressive.</p>
              <p>ok jokes aside. this author is plain retarded. i felt aquilani did quite well. love his passes and was hoping to see him try more long distance shots. i guess what he has to build on now are his confidence and coordination with the team.</p>

              <p>I dun blame the writer.</p>
              <p>When you pay 20 million pound, you are expecting some one to create instant impact.</p>
              <p>Torres is actually a good example.</p>
              <p>Duyt is a example of  a lousy buy who cannot score.</p>
              <p>Aquaman did not really boss the midfield like stevie.</p>
              <p>Although he can string passes, he did not control the pace of the game.</p>
              <p>When he is compared to Lampard and Ballack, he is not even near.</p>
              <p>Some may argue he need time to adapt.</p>
              <p>A good player will adapt immediately to make a difference.</p>
              <p>Soccer is still soccer, no matter where it is played.</p>
              <p>It is not like racing Formula one when you have face with different track condition.</p>
              <p>So, I agreed with the author in his disappointment with aquaman.</p>

              <p>It is the policy of the individual manager.</p>
              <p>For Ah Ben, he have become injury phobia.</p>
              <p>So, he is holding back aquaman to protect him.</p>
              <p>But, he is forced to field injured stevie and torres cos he know that he have a team of useless and spiritless players in which he have recruited.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will flop if he omit S &amp; T.</p>
              <p>For aquaman, it is hard to say whether he is worth 20 million.</p>
              <p>Carrick is also injured and cost a lot for Man Utd.</p>
              <p>But, alex got men to rotate.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben stick to his pet lucas and mascher.</p>
              <p>If mascher is not out, aquaman will not even play.</p>

              <p>Hi Poignant, seriously after reading a few posts from you, I'm doubtful of your judgement of players and their ability. &lt;-- is my judgement of yours fair, after only a few posts? Just like how people are judging Aquilani after a few games?</p>
              <p>True, RB buys using money instead.</p>
              <p>Anyway, price tags are inflated these days anyway. Aquilani is a really good footballer. He's just as quick thinking and technically as good as Alonso, but he's much more mobile and more attacking than the former.</p>
              <p>Case in point, he's always moving about into the empty spaces, releases his teammates early, can pass with both feet, and willing to take on players. All these, unlike a certain Brazillian that cost us $6 Million back then. </p>
              <p>I can't wait for Masch + Aquilani, or Gerrard + Aqulani combo to hit it off soon. It's just... tantalising. : )</p>

              <p>I believe sparks will fire cos Lucas is hopeles in both creating and defending.</p>
              <p>He is just accumulating yellow card every match with his late tackle.</p>

              <p>Lucas hopeless in both creating and defending? Let me correct that sentence here:</p>
              <p><strong>Lucas is just hopeless.</strong></p>
              <p>There you go. </p>
              <p>And as for Kuyt... him, at least he chases and closes players down like mad, and occasionally scores goals. Can't doubt him for his industrialism.</p>
              <p>I suppose Liverpool could really use another mad men running around the park and pulling defenders all over the place, because Torres and Gerrard alone are not enough. And Benayoun, no offence to him, a bit small dah~</p>

              rooney is a power player. He always power his way through just like drogba. Both have decent skills but I hate this kind of player as they always push opponents to get opening. 
              
              I prefer players like henry, anelka, RVN, torres. These players have real good skills.

              <p>I think rooney this season has changed his game more. He is more mature now, he tries to create more chances for his teammates now that ronaldo is gone. Simply put, he is now the heart of the team.</p>
