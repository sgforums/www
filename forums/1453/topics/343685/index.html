              <hr>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has warned Liverpool must
              contain their anticipation over the Merseyside derby FA Cup tie which
              is sure to be the talk of their city all month - because there are
              important matches to be won in the meantime for his table-toppers.</p>
              <p>Liverpool and Everton will clash twice in a week, in the Premier
              League on January 19 and then in the fourth round of the cup the following
              weekend.</p>
              <p>With both games at Anfield, Benitez knows a crucial stage beckons in
              Liverpool's quest for both the league title and Cup.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Liverpoolfc.tv</em>:
              "It is a draw which will excite everyone in the city, because everyone
              knows about the great rivalry that exists between the two clubs.</p>
              <p>"But we must remember that we have some big games coming up in the league
              before the cup tie - and we will be taking one game at a time.</p>
              <p>"Only when the cup game comes around will it become our focus. Before then we
              play Stoke and Everton in the league, so we must keep our attention on those
              matches.</p>
              <p>"But it is good to have so many important matches, because it shows that your
              team is doing well."</p>
              <p>Reds defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7941">Jamie Carragher</a> sees the return of forward <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257">Fernando Torres</a>, who
              scored on his comeback from injury on Saturday in the third-round win at
              Preston, as vital to Liverpool's aspirations this season.</p>
              <p>Torres had not played since November because of a hamstring problem, but his
              late goal completed a 2-0 win at Deepdale.</p>
              <p>Carragher said: "Having Torres back has given everyone a big lift. It is great
              when you see a player of that calibre coming back for the second half of the
              season.</p>
              <p>"We hope the time he has been out will refresh him, because he had a long
              season with the Euro 2008 finals last summer.</p>
              <p>"A lot of players have played a lot of games this season, because the manager
              hasn't changed it around so much.</p>
              <p>"It has been a feather in the cap for everyone concerned with the club that we
              have reached the top of the table without having the best striker in the world
              in the side.</p>

              <p>rafa, players are not farking computer players with fatigue numbers. u dont change momentum by shuffling a winning team with a cock player like lucas.</p>
              <p>his first touch was to give away a foul.</p>
              <p>5 more farking minutes makes no difference in torres's fatigue level but a huge risk when the opposition defense get a break.</p>
              <p>when will u ever learn.</p>
              <p>now u upset your players spirits, i am quite sure everton has the upper edge in the coming FA tie and put a dent in the subsequent games mentality.</p>

              <p>its more frustrating when u noticed that the bench has mascherano and lucas was chosen over him in the closing stage.</p>
              <p>lucas may not be main culprit behind the free kick nor marking cahill, i cannot help noticing that the team suddenly get panicky at his arrival.</p>
              <p>no doubt he might have the potential but u dont "try" out players during moments like this.</p>
              <p>i really hope rafa is happy now. penalty or not, you gave away the advantage with a bad call.</p>

              <p>i am very disappointed with the results. after gerrard score, liverpool switched off and play without conviction at all. that's not champions are made of. i am probably more awake than some of the players there on the field.</p>
              <p>they didn't do a single thing right with the score in their favor; giving the ball away needlessly, not holding play, allowing everton to come at them, conceding fouls....etc. imo, it is an equaliser waiting to happen.</p>
              <p>i think it will really be tough now....</p>
              <p>unlike the chelsea-stoke game, you could sense chelsea wanted to comeback into the game. this one, liverpool had it in the bag but fluffed it.</p>
              <p>terrible result.</p>

              <p>Well .... true la for not playing Keane , instead Lucas was played ahead of Mascherano . Some big guns were kept for the coming UCL fixtures i think .</p>
              <p>Now Rafa has to think over for not winning .....</p>

              <p>good game overall. entertaining for the neutrals.</p>
              <p>everton made the most of their rare set-pieces and made liverpool's 90% of possession looks pretty but useless.</p>
              <p>babel was the only crappy player out there who has no radar on where the ball is. apart from that, the team played rather well except to impose themselves in the final third.</p>
              <p>hope a replay is not going to take a toll on the already congested fixtures, though the reds stand a higher chance in winning away games.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think we're about to see what has become almost customary: Liverpool capitulating after the new year begins. While this is only a draw, and not a defeat, that's twice now in the space of a week that a threadbare Everton have thwarted their crosstown rivals. Liverpool have been plagued with an inability to score, and Rafa must be wondering where his strikers are. His tirade against Ferguson, instead of boosting the confidence of his side and demoralizing Manchester United, has seemed to have done the opposite. United seem to be going on strength to strength, while Liverpool have put together a string of highly unsatisfactory, and quite frankly, poor performances. Despite the continued telepathy between Torres and Gerrard, there have been few positives for Rafa since the new year, particularly that Torres has not been scoring. The defense has also been lacklustre, compounding Liverpool's problems. The pressure is truly on Rafa now, and off-field issues will certainly not help, particularly if his contract dispute persists. These performances will catch up to them, and while it is still too early to say, it seems that the Kop will have to wait to celebrate a league title.</p></div>

              It still baffled me whenever I see Lucas in the line up...For goodness sake, when will Rafa ever learn? This idiot will never be good enough even in the Liverpool reserve team...Last week, he gave away a penalty and this week he got himself sent off and for goodness sake, I rather he got himself a straight red card rather than two yellows because the two yellow cards will mean that I may see him again after a one game break..
              
              He is the worst player in a Liverpool shirt in recent memories without any doubt.
