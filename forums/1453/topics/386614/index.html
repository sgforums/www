            <div class='col-md body'><p>The arrival of Johnson in the summer appeared to have rectified the problem and the England international began with two goals in his first four matches.<br><br>However, what the 25-year-old offered the side from an attacking point of view was somewhat negated as criticism began to grow over his defensive capabilities.<br><br>Injuries then compounded his problems and Johnson’s form has dipped in the last couple of months.<br><br>But how much the proven Premier League full-back will be missed will be highlighted in the next month as Benitez considers his options.<br><br>The most likely option is to move Jamie Carragher from central defence to fill a role he is not entirely comfortable with but which he has already performed this season in Johnson’s absence.<br><br>Alternatively, the manager could call on Swiss international Philipp Degen, who has struggled to settle in after injury wrecked his first season having signed in the summer of 2008.<br><br>The 26-year-old did not make his Barclays Premier League debut until this September and has been unconvincing in the first team, getting sent off in the 3-1 defeat to Fulham at the end of October.<br><br>An even bolder move by Benitez would be to give Stephen Darby, 21, an extended run in the side with the other option being 19-year-old Martin Kelly - who made his first start in the Champions League defeat at home to Lyon in October - who is currently sidelined with injury.<br><br>However, it seems unlikely the Liverpool boss will look to the transfer window to solve his problems - even for a short-term loan - as he has only a very limited budget to work with and more pressing priorities elsewhere.<br><br>The fitness of striker Fernando Torres and captain Steven Gerrard continue to be a concern and if Benitez is to strengthen anywhere in January it is likely to be on the forward line.<br><br>On the positive front, the Reds manager is hopeful of having winger Albert Riera back from a hamstring problem within the next few days.</p></div>
