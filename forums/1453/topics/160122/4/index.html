Crouch is not that sort of striker that perform hit &amp; run week in week out like Owen , likewise , Benitez expect Crouch to act like an assist to other strikers and midfielders , if you are expected to be an assist , you need some sort of communication between other strikers , now there isn't any .<br><br>I guess the price tag is too big a burden for Crouch .
