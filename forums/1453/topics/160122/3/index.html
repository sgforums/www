            <div class='col-md body'>i think most fans will think crouch sux. but maybe this is a plot by the boss to deceive their opponent to make them think crouch is a 'markman', where in the case crouch is only a midfielder.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
