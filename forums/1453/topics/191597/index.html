            <div class='col-md body'>Tottenham are reportedly considering a swap-deal between<span style="color: red;"> Jermain Defoe </span>and Liverpool and Australia midfielder Harry Kewell.<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has already stated his intention to bring in at least one new striker in the close-season and has long been linked with a move for England striker Defoe who, even though he surprisingly failed to make the 23-man squad for the Finals in Germany, is on standby.<br><br>With TottenhamÂ’s signing of Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov, who was the BÃ¼ndesligaÂ’s second top striker this season, England back-up striker Jermain Defoe is now looking more likely to make a summer move from White Hart Lane.<br><br>Defoe has had far less first-team action this season at White Hart Lane than he would have liked, playing second fiddle for much of the campaign to IrelandÂ’s Robbie Keane and Egyptian striker Mido.<br><br>This lack of first-team play with the eventual fifth-placed team in the Premiership may well have cost Defoe his place in the England squad for the World Cup Finals in Germany, and Liverpool - who are in desperate need of a new striker Â– would welcome a striker like Defoe with open arms.<br><br>Should Defoe favour a move to Anfield, Benitez could be prepared to sacrifice Socceroo winger Kewell in exchange for the England forward.<br><br>Kewell took some time to settle in at Anfield since his move from Leeds United, and has had the best season yet for Liverpool, but has yet to truly convince Benitez on his ability to perform at the highest level, while a series of nagging fitness issues also are a cause for concern with Kewell having been forced to limp-out in the three seperate finals - the Carling Cup, Champions League and FA Cup.<br><br>Benitez has stated that there are to be many changes to the squad in the summer, and has already mentioned that Chilean winger Mark Gonzalez, Gabriel Paletta and Fabio Aurelio are all expected to be unveiled officially as Liverpool players during the close-season.<br><br>Along with Gonzalez, Benitez also has the likes of Bolo Zenden and the versatile John Arne Riise to fill the gap in KewellÂ’s absence.<br><br>Source : <a href="http://www.worldcuplatest.com/spurs-defoe-liverpool-australia-kewell-k-3508.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">World Cup Latest</span></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though kewell has been performing well lately but cant help but feel he is just too injury prone.. mayb trade him for defoe is a good idea..<br><br>we have more than enough covers at left mid..<br><br>if defoe shd come i believe cissie will cfm move back to france...<br>but i oso hope to have 1 more striker in the squad..<br>not to mention our right mid which i feel is oso a headache to us all season..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think since liverpool is in alot of competitions, it is better to have kewell and gonzalez in the same team.. don't forget that gonzalez being a south american might take time to settle, and might not do well in his first season..kewell should stay, if gonzalez can prove in his first season that he's damn good den let kewell go..becuz zenden is not good enough to be a starter for liverpool, only as backup..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Harry Kewell is a match winner when he plays at his best.<br><br>But yeah, his proneness to injury, especially at crucial finals (Istanbul and Cardiff) would go against him. I feel he has yet to adjust fully to life at Anfield, and perhaps another season, another chance might highlight his worth to Liverpool.
