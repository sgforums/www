              <p>"The injury is much better," Skrtel told Liverpoolfc.tv. <br>  <br>"It has been six weeks since the injury and I have stopped using the <br>crutches, but obviously I have work to do in order to get the ligament back to what it was before.</p>
              <p><br>  <br>"The pain when it happened was huge and I thought it was much worse than it actually was. Once I was back in the changing room I realised it was not as serious as I first feared. <br>  <br>"I was unhappy but injuries are part of football games. <br>  <br>"The first week or two was the worst but then I started to look <br>forward to doing exercises that helped me to heel and speed up the <br>recovery process." <br>  <br>As for a likely return date, the Slovakian international is still hopeful he will achieve his initial target of a run-out during the Christmas programme. <br>  <br>"I don't know exactly the date but the predictions were for before Christmas and I am hoping it is as soon as possible," he added. <br>  <br>"It has been a long time. I can't wait to start kicking a ball again <br>and resume full training." <br>  <br><a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/agger/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Daniel Agger</span></span></a> and <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/hyypia/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sami Hyypia</span></span></a> have stood in for the Slovakian international in recent weeks and Skrtel is well aware that he faces a tough task to dislodge them from the team when he returns. <br>  <br>He said: "Daniel and Sami are excellent players and they are playing well. <br>  <br>"It will be difficult to get back into the team but I am working hard <br>and I will do my best to impress the coach and fight for my place <br>back." <br>  <br>Skrtel admits that he has been impressed with the form of the team in his absence but feels that it is too early to start thinking of <br>silverware. <br>  <br>"Being at the top of the Premier League gives us a lot of confidence," he added. <br>  <br>"We are trying to win every game and hopefully our form can continue for as long as possible. <br>  <br>"Of course I would like to win some silverware but it's still early <br>and there is a long time to go until the end of the season. <br>  <br>"I am sad that I am not currently part of the team but I am happy that we are winning and at the end of the day it is the goal of all of us to win matches."</p>

              <p>LIVERPOOL have been boosted by the return of Martin Skrtel to full training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Slovakian international has spent the last two months on the sidelines after suffering a knee ligament injury in the Reds’ 3-2 win at Man City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Skrtel had been in outstanding form alongside Jamie Carragher at the heart of Liverpool’s defence before injury struck. In his absence, Daniel Agger and Sami Hyypia have taken it in turns to fill in alongside Carragher with neither able to hold down a regular starting place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez is adamant that he needs four top class centre backs to give him the competition for places within his squad that he is looking for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though Skrtel is able to join in with training with the rest of the squad he is unlikely to be considered for the trip to Arsenal at the weekend, particularly as he is still to get any competitive football under his belt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A more likely date for his possible return is Boxing Day when Liverpool face Bolton at Anfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since joining Liverpool from Russian side Zenit St Petersburg, Skrtel has become a cult figure with fans thanks to his uncompromising physical style.</p>
