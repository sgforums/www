              <p>I have to disagree with Poolman that Ah Ben is not at fault.</p>
              <p>He is the one that can change the formation to win a game.</p>
              <p>Liverpool does have good players to win a game but they are only seen here in singapore when they play for fun.</p>
              <p>If he dun make use of his reserve players, the players will eventually leave.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have a stubborn habits of sticking his neck on the wrong player.</p>
              <p>Remember MoMo Sissoko ?</p>
              <p>Now it is Lucas.</p>
              <p>The fault is not with the player, but expecting him to perform another role in which he is not able to do it.</p>
              <p><br>Just like Kuyt as a winger.</p>
              <p>Where is Babel ? Nemeth ?</p>

              <p>I would think the 2 Yankees affected the whole of Liverpool FC .</p>
              <p>Somehow , somewhere , since annoucing they are not selling the American Baseball team , meaning no money , liverpool confidence shattered .</p>
              <p>I would say gerrard's expression told us all .</p>
              <p>Usually when LFC 0-1 down , Gerrard played like he is possessed , going for the kill , not Monday night .</p>

              <p>They are already losing.</p>
              <p>What else can I ask for ?</p>
              <p>The stability obtained from last season was disrupted by the sale of key players.</p>
              <p>Who decide the sale of the players now ? Not the Yankee.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have 100% decision in which he have fought sourly for last season.</p>
              <p>Now, he have the power to buy and sell and what did he do with it ?</p>
              <p>After the sickening drama last season, Liverpool is not better so far at all.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have a lot to learn to deploy his players.</p>
              <p>The rest is up to the players.</p>
              <p>If you insist your faith on a inmature player, you have to bear the responsibility for your decision.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is not the scapegoat, he is 100% responsible cos he is the manager.</p>

              <p>well, PM, it seems U like Rafa a lot.</p>
              <p>A loss is nothing, but then, Rafa made a critical error -&gt;</p>
              <p>(http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/steve-stammers/After-criticising-Gerrard-and-Carragher-Rafa-Benitez-needs-to-learn-what-goes-on-in-the-dressing-room-stays-in-the-dressing-room-article132001.html).</p>
              <p>t is one of the oldest maxims in football – lose the dressing room and you end up losing the battle.</p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez is likely to discover the veracity of that saying over the next few months.</p>
              <p>No-one is above criticism. No-one. That includes Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher.</p>
              <p>But
              even if a manager feels that one man who is arguably the most complete
              player in the world and another who has proved his physical courage
              beyond any debate or question are at fault, such words should be
              delivered in the inner sanctum of the dressing room.</p>
              <p>Gerrard and Carragher can take it. They are big boys.</p>
              <p>But once such verbal assaults are made in the public arena, it is the start of a slippery slope.</p>
              <p>Gerrard
              and Carragher this week – whose turn will it be after the next
              Liverpool defeat? That will be going through the minds of the players.</p>
              <p>Great managers keep their views private and in-house.</p>
              <p>I
              can recall Sir Alex Ferguson being asked after a Fabien Barthez howler
              had cost Manchester United a match what the French goalkeeper had said
              in the dressing room afterwards.</p>
              <p>That
              Glaswegian stare came to the fore as he answered: ”What goes on in my
              dressing room is absolutely none of your business. Ok ?”</p>
              <p>End of conversation.</p>
              <p>Over
              at The Emirates, Arsene Wenger has owned up to regular attacks of
              myopia when one of his players has been guilty of a misdemeanour. “I
              didn’t see it,” is now his famous, catch-all response.</p>
              <p>Over at Tottenham, Harry Redknapp made light of a glaring miss by Darren Bent by insisting his wife Sandra could have scored.</p>
              <p>Cue laugh.</p>
              <p>A dig at Bent but not in a humiliating fashion. An off-the-cuff remark.</p>
              <p>But Benitez doesn’t do humour. That’s a fact.</p>
              <p>It
              filters out that he is unhappy at the funds with which he is provided
              and yet some estimates show that his sell-buy balance is in excess of
              100 million. That’s a fact.</p>
              <p>And
              like Phil Brown at Hull, who famously – or infamously – paraded his
              shattered players on the pitch for a half-time rollocking at Manchester
              City in front of the travelling fans, the line between respect and
              resentment is gossamer-thin.</p>
              <p>Hull
              won just one more league game after the public humiliation last Boxing
              Day and stayed up more through what other teams didn’t do than what
              they did themselves.</p>
              <p>They say you reap what you sow.</p>
              <p>Benitez has just sown the seeds of discontent and there could well be a price to pay.</p>
              <p>That’s a fact.</p>

              <p>Not just Alonso .... our defense oso missed a bit of Arbeloa and Aurelio .</p>
              <p>So it's ok came Johnson to cover for Arbeloa , what about Aurelio ? I dun think Insua can do that !!</p>
              <p>I still dun understand why did Benitez signed Dossenna and not use him instead ? Instead he used Insua ? WTF right ?</p>
              <p>Now looked like we need a few more weeks to see the best of Aquilani to bring our season back , let hope so .</p>
