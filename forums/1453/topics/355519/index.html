              <p>There has been no more emotive event in
              British football history than the Hillsborough Disaster of April 15
              1989. It was the spring afternoon when a simple game of football became
              a massed human tragedy. Having failed to learn the lessons of Burnden
              Park in 1946, Ibrox in 1971, the Bradford Fire of 1985 and, in the same
              year, the Heysel riot, it was the watershed moment that football had to
              change or face extinction.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Two
              decades on, the recriminations continue, with the police authorities
              and organising bodies responsible still not brought to the justice that
              the families of those who died in Sheffield believe they should face.
              During two reports that sought to make sense of the disaster, Lord
              Justice Taylor laid blame firmly at the door of the South Yorkshire
              Police whose actions, or lack of them, had caused a dangerous situation
              to become one of mass fatality. In ordering the closure of standing
              terraces to be replaced by banks of seating, he changed the atmosphere
              and demographic of British football stadia forever.</p>
              <p>All-seater
              stadia have a direct lineage to that sunny spring day. The modernising
              of football may have had regrettable consequences with high pricing,
              the poverty gap and the closed shop that many clubs have become being
              among the main complaints but at least the match-going fan is no longer
              at the risk yielded by nearly a century of neglect.</p>
              <p>The
              disaster itself was a collision of factors that could have occurred
              many times before. Previous stark warnings had not served to solve the
              problems. The 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham
              Forest was chickens coming home to roost in the most harrowing style
              possible. By the late 1980s the football stadiums of England were
              dilapidated, a relic from the early 20th century when most of them had
              been constructed. Hillsborough itself had been rebuilt in the 1960s and
              had been one of the host grounds for the 1966 World Cup finals. The
              Leppings Lane end where the disaster took place had last been properly
              renovated in 1965. By the standards of that day, it was regarded as one
              the best grounds in the land.</p>
              <p>The era between the golden
              footballing age of the 1960s and the late 1980s saw stadia neglected to
              the state of decay. As attendances steadily fell so too did available
              revenue to spend on rebuilding grounds. Sheffield Wednesday, who spent
              much of the 1970s at the lowest ebb in their history, were by no means
              a wealthy club. But then again, by today's standards, few clubs were.</p>
              <p>To
              attend a match in that time was not the sanitised theme park that many
              Premier League clubs now aspire to. Fans who chose the terraces
              sometimes had to be prepared to stand for hours before games so as to
              make sure they got in. Access to toilet facilities were limited on
              big-match days, giving rise to many a story about fans feeling the
              warm, wet and deeply unpleasant sensation of being urinated on. When
              goals were scored or in other moments of high excitement, fans found
              themselves catapulted forward and back, up and down, steep and often
              decaying terraces. You would rarely end a match where you started to
              watch it. Take a look at videos of games from the era and view the
              swelling sea of humanity as a goal goes in. You don't get that at the
              Emirates for your £65. It looked dangerous. It felt dangerous. It
              eventually proved deadly.</p>
              <p>Another facet of the era was the
              fencing in of supporters. Hooliganism's growth in the early 1970s had
              led clubs to construct high and forbidding fences, caging fans in to
              prevent them from storming the pitch. As a result, fans were often
              given a poor view of the games, having to watch the action through tiny
              grids of metal. Should an emergency occur, they were penned in to face
              their fate as panic set in.</p>
              <p>In 1974, Manchester United, at the
              height of their "Red Army" era, had been the first to put up perimeter
              fencing. The seventies drew on and hooliganism grew worse, hitting its
              apex in 1985 when 39 people died at Heysel when a wall collapsed after
              Juventus fans fled from a charge by Liverpool fans at the 1985 European
              Cup Final. Such incidents meant that the small safety gates placed in
              the fences in case of emergency were almost always locked. At
              Hillsborough in 1989, the gates were only opened by policemen when it
              became clear that things were turning deadly. To do so, they had to go
              against orders.</p>
              <p>The "English disease", and the attitude of the
              Thatcher government - "the enemy within" - and establishment towards
              the game had football on something approaching its last legs. There was
              no TV injection into clubs of the type currently enjoyed. A latter-day
              deal for Football League rights far outstrips the amount ITV then paid
              for their one live match a week from the top division. In 1989, both FA
              Cup semis were played at the same time, 3pm on a Saturday. Neither were
              televised as live broadcasts. To the younger generation of football
              supporters, this must resemble some form of footballing dark ages.</p>
              <p>Hillsborough
              Stadium itself had previous. The FA Cup semi-final of 1981 between
              Tottenham Hotspur and Wolves had seen 38 people injured when the late
              arrival of Spurs fans at the Leppings Lane End after bad traffic on the
              M1 had led to a terrifying crush. This incident had seen the ground
              ignored for semi-finals for another six years, only being allowed to
              re-stage such games by the FA after the terrace was restructured into
              five pens stretching behind the goal.</p>
              <p>Even after similar
              crushing was reported at the 1987 semi-final between Leeds United and
              Coventry City, the FA chose to place Liverpool and Forest at
              Hillsborough for 1988's FA Cup semi, a carbon copy of the game that
              would end in tragedy.</p>
              <p>The 1988 game had seen fans feeling
              similarly uncomfortable with many a complaint made about how Liverpool,
              with a far higher average attendance, were granted the smaller end
              while Forest fans were given Hillsborough's own Kop, itself redolent of
              the stand of the same name at Anfield. The flow of car traffic from the
              roads the fans of each club would be travelling from was the given
              explanation for that.</p>
              <p>The FA chose to hold the 1989 match in
              the same place, citing its precursor as a success. That the ground did
              not possess a valid safety certificate was only later discovered.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>A
              personal memory of the stadium of the time comes from two months
              before. Manchester United travelled to play Sheffield Wednesday on
              February 11 and took a huge (12,000+) away following to South
              Yorkshire.</p>
              <p>As I sat in the main stand with my father, the first
              half was dominated by events on that Leppings Lane end. It was
              difficult to concentrate on the on-field action as it became clear
              there was something afoot in the away end. While we knew the "back way"
              over the Pennines to get to the ground, the majority of fans had been
              delayed on the motorway over. Late arrivals were obviously causing a
              bottleneck. Some form of panic was taking hold, with the central
              terraces over-filled. Eventually, a significant number of fans were
              filtered by police and stewards into an empty and uncovered stand in
              the left-hand corner.</p>
              <p>On that occasion something approaching
              sensible stewarding prevented anyone getting seriously injured. Two
              months later, with the game much higher in profile, the policing of
              events lacked anything approaching that level of calm and lateral
              thinking. Despite the late arrival of many fans, no delay in kick-off -
              a common safety practice these days - was sanctioned. Sadly, this was
              far from the last mistake made by police on that fateful day.</p>
              <p>The
              overly rigid segregation of fans on entry to the Hillsborough area and
              closing off of certain routes led to crushing in the tight back-streets
              around Leppings Lane. The sheer mass of numbers kept waiting by the
              plodding click of the turnstiles, of which there were far too few, led
              to police to make what Lord Justice Taylor would later describe as a
              "blunder of the first magnitude".</p>

              </table>
              <p>In choosing to open up Gate C at 2.52pm, opening up
              the central pens on the lower terraces that were already choc-full of
              fans already in some discomfort, the police, led by Chief
              Superintendent David Duckenfield, set disaster into agonising motion.</p>
              <p>An
              estimated 3,000 fans, unfiltered by the turnstiles and not guided by
              police or stewards into less packed pens, piled into an area reserved
              for 2,000 people. It was later found that no more than 1,600 should
              have been allowed into the pens for them to be anywhere near safe. Many
              of those who had gone in through the opened gate found themselves, as a
              result of a collapsed crash barrier, propelled to the front and
              eventually crushed against the fences. Before it was clear there was a
              disaster afoot, <em>BBC TV</em> commentator John Motson had also remarked on the lack of fans in the terraces to the flank of the fateful central pens.</p>
              <p>By
              kick-off some fans were either dying or dead yet police were trained to
              think first of hooliganism, thus denying the other emergency services
              the extra time they may have been able to use to save lives. Another
              personal memory is that at the game I was at that day (Macclesfield
              Town v Dartford), the initial reports of people being dead at
              Hillsborough centred around hooliganism. Even then, the thought of the
              "50 dead" estimated that sunny afternoon seemed unreal and utterly
              tragic, a terrible waste of life.</p>
              <p>Only one ambulance ever made
              it onto the playing field, but not until 3.36, by which time the game
              had been abandoned as fans spilled on to the pitch, with some of the
              dead already lying pitchside. In the words of Taylor, Duckenfield had
              "frozen" and failed to respond to the pressing emergency of the
              situation. Even now, the families of the lost are seeking explanation
              as to why their loved ones did not receive the treatment that may have
              saved them until it was far too late.</p>
              <p>Such questions will
              continue to be raised in the next few days and for years to come. The
              aftermath of the disaster continues. No criminal charges were ever
              brought against the authorities involved and private prosecutions
              against Duckenfield and other officers also failed to bear the fruit of
              justice to the families of the 96 who died. Yet they fight on. The
              police had tried in vain to cover their tracks, first lying that Gate C
              had been forced open and then choosing to blame drunken fans for the
              chaos that they failed to control. Taylor's report found that of the
              dead only a small minority were over the alcohol limit for driving a
              car. In choosing to paint a similarly vulgar picture of the conduct of
              fans' behaviour as <em>"The Truth"</em> in the week after the disaster, <em>The Sun</em> newspaper knocked 200,000 readers off its daily circulation. It has never recovered those readers.</p>

              </div>
              <p>That
              and other scars continue to run deep when considering Hillsborough.
              Many fans bemoan the comparative lack of atmosphere in stadiums after
              terracing was torn down in the early 1990s (Liverpool themselves were
              one of the last clubs to do so, not ripping down their Kop until 1994).
              Debates on safe-standing always fall on the stony ground of what
              happened that day, despite such policies existing successfully in
              Germany. The families of the 96 continue to be active in the cause of
              seeking justice, with the likes of Steven Gerrard, who lost a cousin on
              that Sheffield afternoon, being fully supportive of the movement.</p>
              <p>Twenty
              years on, the events of April 15 1989 are never far from the
              footballing public's consciousness. It was the day when neglect bore
              horrific consequences.</p>
              <p>In the coming week the Hillsborough
              Disaster will be back in the limelight, and rightly so. The tragedy of
              so many lives lost in the trivial act of watching a football match can
              never be underplayed. In the cruellest way possible, the realisation of
              its causes and effects changed the game forever.</p>
