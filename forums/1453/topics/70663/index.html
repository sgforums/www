Can't trap, can't dribble, can't head, can't shield... 100% crap. Why is he rated so highly? Sure, in the starting there was the 'push and run'... now that people have read his game, he just doesn't have the standard to change the way he plays his game.<br><br>Look at the top strikers, they score year in year out... They get marked, they find a way to lose their marker. Not Owen. For so many games i just see him stagnant there, at the edge of the penalty box. No diagonal runs, no nothing. Even if the ball falls to his feet, either he loses control of it, or he gets tackled.<br><br>Seeing him play pisses me off. Put any other Liverpool fan from the stands onto the field and that guy will put in more effort than that idiot Owen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Football now is so much commercialized and players having million of pounds in their pocket! Besides having the club reputation as stake now, money solves a lotta issue to get that elusive star player.<br><br>I was skeptical about the Thai PM's intention to buy out LFC cos apparently, LFC was not his first priority then. It was Fulham FC. I certainly welcome millions pour in here but I do worried abt that investor's intention.<br><br>Anyway, so long the everyday running of the club belongs to the Manager, the money much needed will be of good use.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like what Poolman have stated, football is all about money.<br><br>Money to feed Expensive players and managers.<br><br>Soccer club like Liverpool are aiming for CL because of the gate money, not for the Cup.<br><br>They need the gate money for the revenue.<br><br>But, since Liverpool will not be playing CL soccer next season, they will need another avenue for money.<br><br>That is why they will need another sugar daddy.<br><br>As for the blame on Owen for his one-dimensional ball skill, I agreed on the part that he is unable to shake of his marker as he alway have a shadow following him every match.<br><br>But, Liverpool have alter their play in front of goal lately.<br><br>Last time, it was alway direct ball to Owen to score.<br><br>Now, it seem like every one want to have a go at the goal.<br><br>So, Owen's chance of getting the ball is reduced so his chance of scoring is also reduced.<br><br>But, at least he is there to assist and support goal scoring, unlike his fellow england counterpart.</div>
