              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The 25-year old striker agreed the terms of the deal back in May and has now completed the formalities of signing the new contract. <br>  <br>Torres was already tied to Anfield for the next four seasons after signing a six-year deal in 2007. <br>  <br>This new contract includes an option for a further year's extension to 2014.</span></p>

              <p><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> insists</span> he is not yet the finished article despite establishing himself as arguably the world's top centre-forward.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has scored an incredible 50 goals in 85 games during his two seasons at Anfield, helping to earn a Ballon d'Or nomination in 2008. <br>  <br>He is also a talisman for Spain, for whom he netted the winner in Euro 2008. <br>  <br>Despite all this, Torres believes there are plenty of areas where he can improve. <br>  <br>"I'm very proud because when I came from Atletico I just wanted to play some games and see if I could play in a top team like Liverpool," the No.9 told Liverpoolfc.tv. <br>  <br>"Now two years later I think I am improving a lot, and I think I can improve a lot yet. I am still young, just 25." <br>  <br>Torres put pen to paper on an improved deal last week. <br>  <br>Despite being tied to Anfield until 2013, with the option of an extra year on top of that, the Spaniard hopes he hasn't signed his last contract with Liverpool. <br>  <br>He said: "I'm really happy. I hope I have a lot of seasons to play here. <br>  <br>"I'm happy because I went right from Atletico, I had never played in the Champions League before, and Liverpool gave me the opportunity to play against the best teams in the world. <br>  <br>"I am really happy to sign a new contract with Liverpool and I hope I can sign more contracts in the future here. <br>  <br>"I feel good because the fans are fantastic with me. Every week it is amazing to see all the fans singing my name and my song. I am very proud to play for Liverpool. <br>  <br>"It is one of the most important clubs in Europe; the club with the best fans in the world, I am sure about that; and one of the clubs with the most history in modern football." <br>  <br>Meanwhile, Torres admits Liverpool must fly out of the blocks against a stubborn Stoke side on Wednesday if they are to kickstart their Barclays Premier League campaign. <br>  <br>Tony Pulis's men held the Reds to two frustrating draws last term - but a point will not satisfy Torres and co this time round following Sunday's opening day reversal at White Hart Lane. <br>  <br>"We know them, we know last season we played against them and it was really difficult," said El Nino. <br>  <br>"We couldn't win against them, so we are waiting for a very defensive team. They will try to score from set pieces or from a long ball, but we have to be offensive and go from the first minute until the end to try to score. And if we can score in the first minute I am sure we can win. <br>  <br>"The best thing when you lose is having a game three days later because we have the chance to forget about Tottenham. <br>  <br>"It is disappointing when you cannot win, but I think we have to improve, we have to be positive. We can get three points and we are on our way."</p>

              <p>El Nino, who is away with Spain this week bidding to secure World Cup qualification, has become the darling of the Kop since his arrival two years ago - and he insists the respect works both ways. <br>  <br>"The people are so nice and polite here, and have a lot of respect for players when you are away from the pitch," he said. <br>  <br>"That is one of the main things for me. In Spain it was difficult for me to go to restaurants or just walk in the street with my friends. <br>  <br>"Now I can do these things and go to the park, walk my dogs and go out for dinner. <br>  <br>"It's a really working class city and I like that because I was born in a working class part of Spain. <br>  <br>"The people work all week and they go to the ground each weekend to enjoy the team. On the Monday they are working hard again just so they can see their team on the weekend. <br>  <br>"It's really special to see supporters with my name on their shirt. I can understand why they would wear a Stevie G or Carra shirt because they are from Liverpool. <br>  <br>"I only came here two years ago as a foreign player but they love me like Stevie or Carra. That's amazing and I have to say thank you to them for that."</p>
