            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool will tie up the signing of Holland Under-21 and Ajax forward Ryan Babel tomorrow<br><br>Babel, 20, will sign a five-year contract after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical on Merseyside.<br><br>Ajax had earlier revealed they had agreed a fee of Â£11.5million for the player.<br><br>'Liverpool have agreed terms with Ajax and Ryan Babel himself and the player will sign a five-year-deal on Friday,' said a statement on the club's website.<br><br>Babel, who briefly returned to Holland to say his farewells, admitted leaving Ajax was a wrench but he was excited about a move to Anfield.<br><br>'I am very happy with it,' he said of the transfer. 'I am now only at Ajax to say goodbye to everyone, and I must say that's quite difficult.<br><br>'I think I will miss the fans, the ones that have always supported me, the guys (Ajax team-mates) of course and the coach.<br><br>'I certainly leave Ajax with pain in my heart. I will come to Amsterdam quite often, and then I will come to visit the club.'<br><br>Babel revealed he took little persuading to make the move to Anfield.<br><br>'I listened to what they had to say and I got a great feeling about the club,' he told Ajax TV.<br><br>'I have made a choice with my heart. The coach (Benitez) has big plans for me.'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ryan Babel has described Rafael Benitez as 'like the ideal father-in-law' after sealing his Â£11.5million move from Ajax to Liverpool.<br>The Netherlands international forward has put pen to paper on a five-year contract at Anfield and afterwards revealed his admiration for the Reds manager.<br><br>The 20-year-old forward had been linked with both the Reds and Arsenal after starring for the Netherlands as they retained the recent European Under-21 championship on home soil.<br><br>"I was in Aruba at the end of last week when I was told to start thinking about Liverpool because a move could happen," he told the club's official website.<br><br>"I have met Rafael Benitez and my conversation with him was the moment I knew the deal would get done.<br><br>"He is like the ideal father-in-law. He has a lot of football know-how and he told me that I would be challenging with six other players for four positions. I have a good feeling about things.<br><br>"I met Dirk Kuyt at training, who I knew from the national team. At that moment he did not feel like a rival but I suppose that is what will happen.<br><br>"It was very important how the coach spoke to me, how I would fit in his team. After that conversation I knew it was the right decision."<br><br></div>
