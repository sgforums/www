            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guardian.Com </span><br><br>Liverpool's supporters have sought to restore their reputation for sporting behaviour by wishing Alan Smith a full recovery from the terrible injuries he suffered in Saturday's FA Cup tie at Anfield. Smith has indicated from hospital he does not harbour any bad feelings, the Manchester United player choosing to remember the Kop's standing ovation rather than their chant to John Arne Riise of "I want to know how you broke his leg".<br><br>Smith, who is making satisfactory progress from a broken left leg and dislocated ankle, has received several hundred letters, including one from the Merseyside branch of the Liverpool supporters' club. "I just feel some of the headlines since Saturday have told only part of the story," the club secretary Les Lawson said last night. "Yes, that song was sung when he first went down but it was tongue-in-cheek because everyone expected him to get back up. Even Sir Alex Ferguson said he had no idea how badly injured Smith was. Nobody really thought it possible that someone could be badly hurt trying to block a free-kick. Once it became apparent, however, everyone stopped singing and the whole ground stood to applaud him when he was taken off. Nobody wants to see a player seriously injured."<br><br>Although they stop short of saying sorry, the letter to Smith wishes him a full recovery from "all Liverpool supporters". Lawson added: "We hope he's playing again soon. If he needs any inspiration he should look at Djibril CissÃ©, who suffered a horrific injury a couple of years ago but is now back playing."<br><br>Rio Ferdinand is in doubt for United's Carling Cup final meeting with Wigan on Sunday because of the hamstring strain that forced him out of the Liverpool game.<br><br>Players injured by fouls that incur yellow cards may no longer have to leave the pitch as a result of a rule-change initiative by the head of England's referees. Keith Hackett has teamed with the League Managers' Association and the players' union, the PFA, to submit a proposal to the International Football Association Board which meets in Switzerland on March 4.<br><br>The need for treated players to leave the pitch before being recalled once the game restarts was introduced to curb time-wasting and gamesmanship but often punishes the wronged party twice.<br><br></div>
