            <div class='col-md body'>U are lacking some faith in Benitez ..... have faith will win eventually .<br><br>This is his first season he has the luxury of players to chose from , so it's fair to rotate among the players , and it's up to the selected players to perform .<br><br>Benitez is doing fine , not too bad with the new adopted system .<br><br>What fans like us needed to do now , it's to have patient , and judge only at the end of the season .<br><br>We are experimenting new changes , any new changes , there'll be a transistion period .<br><br>And it's good to rotate , and it's very good in terms of long term performances .<br><br>We saw big problems last season when we played almost the same 22's week-in week-out , which i thought it's too hectic for some players , yes we do get results , but eventually , it's not a long term solution .<br><br>No worries pal .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i understand from Benitez's interviews , we need 95 points to win the EPL ..... his philosophy is to win all home games , that is 18 x 3 = 54 points , and the rest of the 18 away games , we must get at 41 points , that is , 2.27 points , meaning he calculated which game is a must win , which can afford a draw , and which we can don't win .<br><br>It's not a secret he has a plan or all the fixtures .<br><br>And 95 points is a record , and only Chelsea and Arsenal managed to get that record .<br><br>So maybe that is his target , who know , maybe just like in 1989 , Arsenal just managed to get a win over us us at Anfield , that took the Championship from us . Arsenal only get 89 points that year .<br><br>Also maybe , UCL is Liverpool's target , maybe getting 85 points is just good enough to get inot the UCL .<br><br>85 pts - 54 points = 31 points , 31 points divided by 18 = 1.722 points .<br><br>Have a think about it .</div>

Even the best clubs has to tussle with different line-up for the next matches , and dropping games like Carling Cup .<br><br>I hope i am not the only with such opinion .</div>

Arsenal only get 89 points that year .<br><br>Also maybe , UCL is Liverpool's target , maybe getting 85 points is just good enough to get inot the UCL .<br><br>85 pts - 54 points = 31 points , 31 points divided by 18 = 1.722 points .<br><br>Have a think about it . </div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">I don't think he can win all home games in the 1st place and they now draw with blackburn and no such thing as they plan which match they should win lose or draw and if this match does not turn out the way it does then use other matches to like cover up.........if he can decide all these he can be "GOD" instead of a manager</span></div>
