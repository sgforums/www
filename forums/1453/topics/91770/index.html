            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Looks like we've got no more new signings, and we're stuck with Traore (strange?), Diao n Biscan.  So we know the squad for the season now, wat do u think of it...and wat are your expectations for the season?<br><br>Firstly, this is how I see the squad:-<br><br>Goalies :  Dudek - needs 2b more zai...pls leave ur butter at home!                Kirkland - too fragile; gets injured far too often.<br><br>Defence:  Generally ok except a little short of cover shd Hyypia be missing.  Strongly think Henchoz shd be ahead of Traore n Diao in the pecking order.  Left and Rite sides looks alright with sufficient cover.<br><br>Midfield:  Supposedly our strongest department esp. with the new boys added.  Whether Stevie and Alonso can play effectively together (big IF) is crucial to our season.  Gracia looks versatile and cld be a surprise success.  Hope Nunez can provide quality runs and crosses fm the rite; while Kewell can rediscover himself soon.<br><br>Forward:  Looks abit thin with only Cisse and Baros who are still getting used to each other.  Pongolle is still learning his trade, while Mellor has yet to prove himself.<br><br>While I wish we cld've strengthened the defence n attack lineup, I think we've a reasonable enuff squad.  Much will now depends on how Beni's gonna motivate n get the best out of these players.  Hopefully as the season progress, the new players will find their feet and gel with the team more effectively.<br><br>So for this season, my expectations will be checked - a 3rd-placing will be nice ... n a Cup or 2 will really be bonus!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Ben is still trying out the squad this season.<br><br>Top three places are out of the question.<br><br>You have to take into consideration for the existing squad to suit the playing style of the spanish players.<br><br>The present squad are used to playing long balls and playing defensive soccer.<br><br>They are not really adventurous in moving forward and stroking the ball around.<br><br>Ah Ben have to make more changes and understand the rest of premier league team before he can make any impact.<br><br>Furthermore, he seem to be the soft-spoken type of coach, not like the ah-beng type of coach in Chelsea.<br><br>So, I dun really expect any stuff from this squad.<br><br>Just pray that they stay injury-free for the rest of the season as they still lack depth in their reserves.</div>
