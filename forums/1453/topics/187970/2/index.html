If they are not given a chance now , then when ? I feel that some of the english managers should manage other teams in different leagues to have different exposure.

            <div class='col-md body'>Steve McClaren has been confirmed as the new England manager and will take charge of The Three Lions after this summer's World Cup finals.<br><br>McClaren has been working as Sven Goran Eriksson's assistant since the Swede took the reins in 2001 and he always appeared to be a leading candidate.<br><br>The FA had hoped to appoint Luiz Felipe Scolari, but the Brazilian rejected the chance to manage England last week and McClaren was quickly thrust back into the spotlight.<br><br>Bolton boss Sam Allardyce had expressed a desire to take control, but The FA opted for McClaren - with his experience of the England set-up seemingly tipping the scales in his favour.<br><br>The Middlesbrough boss will assist Eriksson in Germany this summer and he is looking forward to the challenge of leading his country.<br><br>"This is the biggest honour that any coach can have, and is obviously the highlight of my career," said McClaren. "It's a massive challenge and one that I welcome.<br><br>"I have hugely enjoyed my time at Middlesbrough and am very grateful to the club.<br><br>"However, this was an opportunity I couldnÂ’t refuse."<br><br>McClaren cut his coaching teeth at Derby, but his big break came in 1999 when Sir Alex Ferguson brought him to Manchester United as his assistant.<br><br>The 45-year-old learned plenty off the Scot and headed out on his own to Middlesbrough in 2001.<br><br>He brought the club their first ever piece of silverware when guiding them to League Cup glory in 2004 and The FA will hope he can bring success to The Three Lions.<br><br>McClaren has signed a four-year deal and will take charge on August 1, but he has a major task before the World Cup finals as his Middlesbrough side will face Sevilla in the Uefa Cup final later in May.<br><br>"My immediate priority is next week's Uefa Cup final with Boro, and then working with Sven and his coaching team to achieve success in Germany this summer, before I turn my thoughts to the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign," he declared.</div>
