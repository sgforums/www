            <div class='col-md body'>now that Newcastle is out of the UEFA cup, they season will be a failure like Liverpool's if they failed to get the 4th spot.<br><br>Will this make them go all out to win the last 3 matches? I believe they will.<br><br>I think Aston Villa might just run away with the 4th spot if Liverpool and Newcastle (draw) cancel out each other on the last match.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all i wish is for bobby to go out in the summer and get a dependable partner for woody in the defence. brambletitis is a joke. but knowing sbr's mindset, he prolly wont spend much unless he gets into champs league, something which also seems bleak. nowadays, nobody cheap is good and nobody good is cheap. i wish that he spends a little more in prolly his and shearer's last season in the club, but that's unlikely. who know, the board may decide to actually let the old man do some business.<br><br>the team should be looking to build from the back. once a reliable centre back partners woody, the midfield onwards can focus on their job. and the old striker is retiring soon. once the backline is stable, the team doesnt need to score as much to win games. look at porto &amp; stuttgart this season.<br><br>one thing i question is the sale of nobby. he's been a loyal servant to the club and his game is essential in creating the goals. sad that sbr chose to dispose him because of personal reasons. amazing, really, that bobby is able to handle the bad boys eg. romario, gascoigne, bellamy, bowyer etc and yet he hates players who put their countries before the club eg. solano, lualua. ambrose cant even cross half as decent as nobby. good thing he's still young and learning about the premier league game. being a young squad gives them room for improvement but hopefully that comes soon.<br><br>i wonder who are going to replace br and as. mourinho would probably do a good job but it's obvious he's become the aim of other major clubs. so is martin o'neill. may be we should leave that for the end of next season. for now, settle the defence pls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Sorry to learn abt Toon's exit...it's probably down to the key injuries at the wrong time.<br><br>Tat's not exactly good news to us coz now the Toon army will be gunning for the 4th spot at all costs.  I can see an exciting finale with Villa having an outside chance to nip it at the last minute, with or w/out the manure's help.<br><br>Abt ur assessment of ur team, I think u're quite right abt the defence.  But regarding Ambrose, I thot he's considered one of the more promising youngsters according to Soccernet.  So dun be too disheartened; unlike us, our youngsters are all "banned" fm 1st team duties despite showing much promises.<br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>over the years, pool has been one of the clubs producing class youngsters along with man utd. i think pool's youth system is really well built. bobby has picked up a lot of pieces here and there ever since keegan abolished the youth system. good that he likes to buy youngsters, but they can only go a certain distance. after all, they are still young and very inexperienced. a good mix of experience players + a few good youth is prolly the best bet, eg. arsenal &amp; man utd. btw, i've heard good stuff about john welsh and i've watched otsemobor once vs nufc, he looks pretty good for his age.<br><br>anyway, are you redsforever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> just making sure</div>
