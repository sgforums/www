              <p>Lucas Leiva hasn't always been the most popular of figures at Anfield, and he has acknowledged this, but insists that he is getting better all the time. Most are not impressed with the Brazilian, who hinted at a possible move away from Liverpool if he couldn't gain regular football, but with greater confidence he feels greater quality is being shown, as he explained to Liverpoolfc.tv:<br><br>'I think I'm improving and I have more confidence every day. The team is playing well too, which also helps. Everyone is on fire - all these things help me.<br><br>'I don't think about what some of the people say. I have to concentrate on the team. Rafa always gives me a lot of confidence. <br><br>'I know some people don't trust me yet but I will try to show them my quality, and I think I've now started doing that.<br><br>'When you have games in a row you get more confidence. You get some rhythm. It is more difficult when you play just one or two games a month but I have to work hard, try to improve every day and try to get to my best level.'<br><br>Lucas has also said that his room mate Javier Mascherano and Spanish star, and another fellow midfielder Xabi Alonso have been teaching him a lot and he learns from them, drawing on their, and of course Stevie Gerrard's, experience and quality.<br><br>The 22-year-old has started to look better given a run of matches (which is sometimes what you need as bits and pieces here and there can't always be enough) so I still hold out hope that he can be the player that his talent seems to imply he can be, although plenty think that his game might not really be suited to the Premier League?<br><br>All Lucas can do is keep performing when given the chance, that is the best way to win over doubters and prove that the Brazilian is worthy of a place in the Reds squad, and maybe even the starting XI.</p>
