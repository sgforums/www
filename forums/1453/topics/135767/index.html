            <div class='col-md body'>Raul's a winner. Having him at LFC will be a good thing. Not to mention the friendship he shares with Morientes, they could forge an ideal partnership upfront.<br><br>But Raul comes high wage demands and probably a huge transfer fee. Unless Raul lowers his personal demands, its unlikely that LFC will be able to afford the Spaniard.</div>
