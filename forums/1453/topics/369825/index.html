But Benitez is desperate for the 27-year-old to remain at Anfield.<br><br>Just 12 months ago Alonso was very much available for transfer as Benitez looked to bring in Gareth Barry. But with the former Aston Villa midfielder now at Manchester City, there is no suggestion Liverpool are ready to entertain any bids.<br><br>However, Real show no sign of abandoning their pursuit and with the player clearly suggesting he would be willing to start talks it will be difficult for the Reds to hold off the Spanish side and their new-found wealth.<br><br>"I talked to Xabi yesterday [Friday] and told him, as he can see here, that the fans love him and I said to him, 'maybe you have to stay," Benitez said.<br><br>"You can see he is a really good player and I'll be really pleased if he stays. All the players and his team-mates want him to stay. If we keep Xabi I will be very pleased."<br><br>Benitez has also said he believes Javier Mascherano will still be at the club.<br><br>"More or less it's the same situation. He knows our ideas, he worked hard in Thailand and he had the armband, so he knows he is important to the club," Benitez said to ESPN.<br><br>And he had a little dig at the media too.<br><br>"You have to know that nowadays, there are too many media people who have to complete their work every day. So sometimes you read news that is 15 days ago," he explained.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Weekend deadline for Xabi<br></strong></p>
              <p>LIVERPOOL - Rafael Benitez has told Xabi Alonso that he wants the midfielder's future to be resolved before the weekend. The Liverpool boss says Madrid must now make an acceptable offer close to his £30-million ($71-mil-lion) valuation or back off.<br><br>Alonso flew into Madrid last night en route to San Sebastian in northern Spain after Benitez gave the squad three days off following their Asian tour which included a stop Singapore.<br><br>Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa, meanwhile, told Spanish daily Marca his move to Real was "close to being completed" in the next few days. Reports suggest the 26-year-old has already agreed personal terms with his former club and that Liverpool have accepted a bid of around £3.5 million.</p>
