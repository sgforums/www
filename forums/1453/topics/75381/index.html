We were 2-1 up at half time and the defence should not have let go of the paddle on Henry. He's the most hugriest of all the gunners out there today! The hunger to win that three points.<br><br>That is the sorta drive and hunger that the Liverpool lads lacked.<br><br>As posted online in LFC website... it says: "As much as it hurts to say it, the gulf between the two teams has become embarrassing."<br><br>LFC has nothing to salvage for except that fourth placing. And for all the goals scored against LFC today.... the next Arsenal matchup against Newcastle Utd would be another massive task for them and goals would likely be far and few between. Heh... a win for the gunners are good news for us though.</div>
