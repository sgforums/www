            <div class='col-md body'>ashamed of what? i would love owen to stay but if he goes (and i think he will at the end of season) who can blame him?<br><br>fans have to be more mature. put yourself in owen's shoes. you are 23, near the peak of your game, your scoring rate is high, there are other first class clubs scrambling for your signature - wouldn't you go?<br><br>the problem with fans is that they think only with their emotions. players have to think about their careers. players like owen want to win real trophies, not mickey mouse cups like the worthington cup. for example, compare michael owen to andy cole - who is the better player? the answer is clearly owen. but cole has a champions league medal and owen doesn't. cole, a less talented player than owen, was in the right club.<br><br>again, i'll be over the moon if owen renews his contract. but if he goes, i'll have no hard feelings and wish him well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the end of the day, what does a striker do? Score goals isn't it? And Owen has proved time and time again, he CAN score despite lacking great technique but I dun think his strike rate is that bad after all... 149 first team goals out of 269 first team games.<br><br>Owen might not have great technique in say like R &amp; R, Van Basten or Henry... his clinical finish in front of goal is for all to see. C'mon, surely a player will have ups and downs thru out his career. And his only 23 and much too learn.<br><br>Anyway, as fans we do appreciate Owen's contribution for the team but if he does sign with other Big clubs... we should congratulate him and wish him all the best. And we still be in support of the team.</div>

Owen...hmmm..he's just another lucky player that rose to fame at the right time, at the right place and at a right age. </div></blockquote>From Liverpool Official website:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Michael Owen scored on his debut for the Reds at Wimbledon in 1997 and hasn't looked back since.<br><br>The star of Liverpool's 1996 FA Youth Cup triumph, Michael has been with the club since a schoolboy and scored prolifically as he rose rapidly through the Anfield ranks.<br><br>During the summer of 1998 he achieved worldwide fame following his stunning strike in the World Cup second round clash between England against Argentina. Off the pitch he collected the PFA Young Player of the Year for season 1997-98 and in 1998 was also voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year.<br><br>It was in the treble season that Owen continued and enhanced his reputation in the treble season. He hit two goals against AS Roma in the UEFA Cup and followed that up with two magnificent late goals to win the FA Cup Final for Liverpool in Cardiff against Arsenal - a match which has since been called 'The Michael Owen Cup Final'. That just confirmed his standing as one of the most exciting strikers in Europe.<br><br>He followed that up by scoring a sensational hat-trick in England's 5-1 win over Germany, becoming the first England player since Sir Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick against Germany.<br><br>Michael was named European Footballer of the Year in December 2001 when he received the prestigious ballon D'or and scored his 100th Liverpool goal against West Ham at Upton Park on 29th December 2001.<br><br>Despite not being fully fit he starred for England in the 2002 World Cup. He scored two goals for England in the World Cup Finals against Denmark and Brazil, and won a vital penalty against Argentina.<br><br>In the 2002/03 season Owen scored 28 goals for Liverpool including his 100th in the Premiership with a hat-trick at West Bromwich Albion. Owen also scored at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff again when Liverpool beat Manchester United 2-0 to win the Worthington Cup.<br><br>He has now scored more goals for England than any other Liverpool player when he surpassed Anfield legend Roger Hunt.</span><br><br>Probably this will give you a better view abt his exploits.

            <div class='col-md body'>If Owen kept delaying his signing, the morale of the club will be stay unhealthy days by days, so you can't blame the Pool fans to feel this way as most of them will feel frustrated and doubt Owen's lacking commitment to the club.<br><br>Right now i felt that Liverpool treated Owen as indispensable to the club. His not signing for the club might affected Pool's morale and players not being able to perform properly on matches.<br><br>Even Rivaldo said he would not join Liverpool if Owen decided to leave at the end of the season.<br><br>This problem might be solve if Owen decided to pen down to the club immediately.</div>
