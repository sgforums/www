Florent Sinama-Pongolle has been more impressive of late and isn't a player I'd be in a rush to sell but I wouldn't be heart broken if he was moved one either and Fernando Morientes has been a huge let down for me. He couldn't score in a brothel week in, week out. I was so excited when we signed Morientes but to date, he's not really done much to impress me.<br><br>It's been clear since Robbie left Anfield that he's no journeyman.

            <div class='col-md body'>Me love Fowler leh , my idol still , but he abit injury prone nowadays , also he bloated abit , too much alcohol i think .<br><br>But ... If I'm Benitez , and was offered Fowler , i would offer him a life-line back at Anfield , and providing he is willing to lower down his wages demand , like a 20,000 pounds per week ( currently he's earning like 67,000 pounds per week at City ) , and if injury no play , no pay .   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyhow , don't see him in any sort of coming back , think Parry would not want him back to influence the lads .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but but,think about it..he has good experience to give to the younger players like taking up positions in the 6 yard box.i can see him being a striker coach at pool just like ian rush in the future because he is one of the most natural finishers.<br><br>look at his goal against man utd,its just class..and pool strikers aint firing alot so its worth it if they can get his wages down.</div>
