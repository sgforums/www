Hardworking, came out of a career threatening injury<br>Daniel Agger. Class, and can shoot well too!<br>The aforementioned 2 players.<br>Jermaine Pennant has been an impressive young lad too.<br><br>I believe Rafa would go for his no.1 targets soon.<br>I heard Tevez is one of them.

Both have talked openly about their admiration for Owen. All three came through the Academy ranks and remain good mates, despite Owen having left Anfield for Real Madrid and now Newcastle United.<br><br>This is more than friends wanting to be re-united. Owen is the type of serial finisher Liverpool are crying out for; their lack of a cutting edge was highlighted during last week's European Cup final defeat to AC Milan. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I said it many times.. Pennant is really good. He supplied the corner for Kuyt's goal at the UCL final... His going to be top draw. If Alves comes in... It would be good to see a very stiff competition between Pennant and Alves. ( tevez maybe if he comes ) He just lack selfishness to score and he really needs to improve on his goal scoring records. Crosses from him are quality, and running away from defenders is his forte. He just makes it looks so easy at times!<br><br>But this is just talk talk talk talk and talk... I wana see action... We talk and talk and talk for 6 months and cant finish... Man utd have signed a midfielder for 17m and we need to secure our top targets for the summer. If we do not act fast the next few weeks we have to content with the no2 no3 targets.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
