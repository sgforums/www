            <div class='col-md body'>No. Pennant and Kuyt cannot be considered flop.<br>Key reasons why.<br><br>Rmb that Gerrard goal he scored against Bolton. That half volley kung fu kick on new years day if im not wrong. Who set it up? It was good movement between Kuyt and Pennant.<br><br>Wad about Alvaro and Pennant key passing that led to the first goal and later the demolition of Arsenal. This can go on and on, but really, Liverpool have more attackin options with the 2 of them.<br><br>Kuyt and Pennant movement are good and Pennant crosses have turned into goals. That same match at bolton, u guys rmbed who crossed for Crouch to do his carbon copy of galastasary scissors kick? Pennant. His taking the right corners and his crosses are wad premiership strikers need. Pace, anticipation and inviting crosses. The goal against Wigan, Pennant could cross for Kuyt even though kuyt is nowhere near Crouch height. Those are the crosses that have the aforementioned 3 qualities.<br><br>To label them as flops, i really think its too much. Wads more they were not expensive and really proved worth the value alr.<br><br>Kuyt has scored more goals than Drogba when he started his first season. =)<br>Pennant has crossed less than 476 crosses his did at Birmingham the last 2 season but the crosses has turned into more goals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

However, I do suspect you won't use that same yardstick with Chelsea players.<br><br>A flop would be someone with no genuine contribution to the team, which really isn't the case with Kuyt and Pennant. I believe they've made more contribution to Liverpool than for eg (since you claim to know Chelsea well), Ballack and Shevchenko. Decided not to use any other players from other clubs because you'd probably just pan all of them.<br><br>Since you talked about Drogba, he has played brilliantly this season and truely deserves his African player of the year award. He contribution to the team is immense and goes beyond scoring goals. Chelsea tends to struggle at times without him. However, you can't keep comparing everyone to him and claim they are flops because they are not like Drogba this season. It's like comparing every player to Ronaldino when he was having a good spell at Barcelona.<br><br>Going by your standards on what a flop is, not to be anti-Chelsea but to better illustrate to you, Chelsea would have more flops than Liverpool. Ballack, Sheva, Boularhuz, Mikel, Ferreira would all be flops too based on your yardstick. Although I wouldn't label all of them flops, I'm just using the same standards with which you criticise other players of other clubs.<br><br>Note; sometimes, it's not your opinion that irritates people but rather your arrogant attitude and the you-know-it-all that makes even your own Chelsea fans find you an eyesore. You have mellowed and improved over time, but just be careful not to get carried away at times.</div>

Wow... now thats not bad for a 'flop' isnt it?<br><br>I really think u are too much lo.. and some people even call u arrogant .. and having the know it all attitude. Now im not believing them but i really think u can do better with ur analysis of the game as a big picture and not down to just ur own thinking that jus bcos we kicked chelsea a**es u not happy suan our players and anyhow say that they are flops.<br><br>btw.. u are a chelsea fan? Confirm with us lehz..</div></blockquote>Chill.<br><br>You must understand, Ghimpheng's understanding of soccer isn't very good, but he think he knows a lot if not, everything. The baseline with GP is this, Chelsea and anything Chelsea is good, anything else is a failure.<br><br>He likes to emulate Mourinho especially on sgforums, and he does it blindly. He does what he does sometimes because he thinks it's 'cool' or something. But Mourinho does it to help the team, GP's a posuer at best. Mourinho does what he does to help the team, and as a physcological ploy at times. Why GP does it? To help who? Now that's a different thing.<br><br>Comment on GP, reply to him, but no need to get angry with him. At most laugh at him when he proves how silly and how shallow his soccer is. But no need to get angry with him.</div>

Never was. Moreover, others won't have the chance to comment on you if you didn't keep doing silly stuff. You know your own agenda, and it's not about sharing factual soccer news.<br><br>You act and behave like Mourinho and turn yourself into a human dart board with the things you say yet you blame others? Be responsible, like I said, you know your real agenda, most of us do.<br><br>If you want to emulate Mourinho blindly but can't take the stick, then stop. I doubt you realise what you're doing anyway.<br><br>Mourinho does what he does to help Chelsea as a team and very often is just a psychological ploy. Sometimes against his opponents, and very often to lift his team. Everything he does, he does it with the team at heart. He stopped putting on the front when competition was off.<br><br>By emulating Mourinho blindly here, who are you helping? The other Chelsea fans? Even the other Chelsea fans reject you, including mods of the Chelsea forum. You should reflect on yourself and what you are doing.<br><br>With you, it seems like you're more preoccupied with hating other clubs (esp the club that beat you for EPL). You're not helping anyone, only creating enemies unnecessarily. Maybe enemies mean nothing to you, or the more the merrier, because you think that's what Mourinho's about. It isn't, with Mourinho it's always about for the team and what helps the team. Is what you are doing helping the other Chelsea fans? They have already spoken, you just refuse to listen.<br><br>You behave in a way that knowingly attracts negative attention from everyone including Chelsea fans, yet you blame everyone else for all other reasons. You accuse Stella and eemtj for not being supporters, you blame Liverpool fans, Man U fans. There's a problem with everyone but you. So who's the one who's in over himself and thinks only his opinion is the best or the only thing that matters?<br><br>What I'm saying about you though is nothing new, it's already common knowledge about you by now.</div>
