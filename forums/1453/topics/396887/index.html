              <h1>Anfield sale saga could force Rafael Benitez to quit Liverpool in 
              the summer for Juventus</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool’s ownership war could drag on through the 
              summer, increasing the likelihood of manager Rafa Benitez walking out to
               join Juventus or Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Co-owner Tom Hicks, who put 
              Liverpool up for sale on Friday, has claimed he and George Gillett 
              expect close to £800million for the Anfield club – nearly four times 
              what they paid for it in 2007.</p>
              <p>His sky-high demands for a club
               independent analysts value at just over £300m indicate that he is going
               to use the full six-months’ grace offered by the Royal Bank of Scotland
               to sell the club, leaving a power vacuum until then, despite the 
              arrival of new chairman Martin Broughton.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/17/article-1266809-08E483D5000005DC-796_468x286.jpg" alt="Rafael Benitez" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Weighing up his options: The ongoing 
              ownership 
              dispute at Liverpool may force Rafa Benitez to head for Italy or Spain</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The biggest casualty of Hicks’ bullish stance could be Benitez, who 
              has become increasingly impatient with the off-field uncertainty. Unless
               a new owner is found quickly, it is unlikely Benitez will be able to 
              spend the £60m he said he needed to mount a title challenge next term.</p>
              <p>He
               is being courted by Madrid and Juventus but is reluctant to leave 
              Anfield without a pay-off worth up to £16m.</p>
              <p>Hicks said he would not be forced into a quick firesale of Liverpool 
              despite hostile feelings from fans. He added: ‘Liverpool Football Club 
              has been a great investment.</p>
              <p>‘There’s a strong business 
              rationale. I should make four times my money.</p>
              <p>‘The club has 
              probably tripled in value. Our EBITDA [Earnings before interest, taxes, 
              depreciation and amortization] has more than doubled. Liverpool will be 
              the<br>most profitable investment I’ve ever made.’</p>
              <p>Hicks and 
              Gillett paid about £220m to buy Liverpool from David Moores, but put the
               club in debt as a result. They are under pressure to sell, with about 
              £237m owed to RBS and Wachovia.</p>
              <p>Proposals to build a new 
              stadium at Stanley Park have failed to take off following the impact of 
              the worldwide recession.</p>
              <p>A search over months has failed to 
              attract any new investors, but Hicks is adamant he will not be forced 
              out of the door in a hurry.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘We have doubled player 
              spending both gross and net and the new stadium is now fully designed 
              and permitted.</p>
              <p>‘With fresh capital from the new owner, the new
               stadium will be operational from August 2014.</p>

              <p>‘Liverpool will be as profitable as any other club in the Premier 
              League and can compete financially on and off the pitch.’</p>
              <p>Sources
               close to Hicks threw out a proposal from New York-based investment bank
               The Rhone Group, who offered to buy 40 per cent of the club for £105m, 
              saying, ‘We will not look at opportunistic low-ball private equity 
              firms.’</p>
              <p>The saga will effect Benitez ahead of a big week in 
              which his side meet West Ham in the Premier League on Monday and then 
              travel to face Atletico Madrid in the Europa League semi-final, first 
              leg on Thursday.</p>
              <p>To add to his problems, striker Fernando 
              Torres is likely to miss both games amid fears that a knee injury might 
              require surgery that would keep him out for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>His trip to Spain to see a specialist on Friday was cancelled because
               of flights being suspended across Europe and Benitez said: ‘I honestly 
              don’t know when Fernando will be back. At the moment the knee is fine, 
              but we need the opinion of the specialist, who will decide on an 
              operation.’</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett put Liverpool up for sale as 
              part of the deal which saw the RBS extend July’s deadline for the 
              Americans to pay back £100m of their debt.</p>
              <p>Yet West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady, appointed at 
              Upton Park when David Sullivan and David Gold bought half the club for 
              £52.5m, believes Liverpool are overpriced.</p>
              <p>She said: ‘Some of 
              the world’s biggest financial institutions are floundering in their 
              quest to cut the Gillett-Hicks demands for Liverpool. It seems a lot of 
              money to pay for a club in need of costly changes on the playing side, 
              restructuring and a new stadium.</p>
