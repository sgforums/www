              <div><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="color: #333332;">Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson will hand Ryan Babel and David Ngog the chance to shine against Napoli on Thursday.<br><br>The two sides meet in a Europa League group clash, with the Anfield outfit coming off the back of the disappointing 2-0 weekend defeat to Everton. With the season in full swing, the ex-Fulham boss has vowed to rotate his squad for the midweek clash.<br><br>"I'll leave some players out - that's for sure," Hodgson said.<br><br>"Some of the more important senior players won't travel because their participation on Sunday is going to be so important to us.<br><br>"It's not just a question of playing three matches in a week it's also a question of injury.<br><br>"I don't think our squad is so strong that I can afford to risk them.<br><br>"But it'll still be a strong team we put out there and I think it's a chance for some players who have been on the fringes, like David Ngog and others like Ryan Babel who has had very few chances.<br><br>"It's yet another opportunity for these players to blast their way into the team and force me to look at them in a different light, to make sure they are players that are first on the list and not down the pecking order."<br><br>On the current injury problems, the 63-year-old continued: "After being injured, Agger is now sick, so he has ruled himself out.<br><br>"Dirk Kuyt has a wicked ankle injury. Everyone tells me it looks worse than it really is and I certainly hope that is the case because it does not look good. It is still very badly swollen.<br><br>"Christian Poulsen has recovered and is okay.<br><br>"Glen Johnson is still out injured but I would hope he would be back in training when we return on Friday - so he's not ruled out for Sunday but is for Thursday."</span><br><br></span></div>
