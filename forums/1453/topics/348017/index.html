              â€œTHE smug look on Rafa Benitezâ€™s face said it all.
              
              â€œNo sign of relief that he had just dodged an embarrassing defeat.
              
              â€œNo hint of contrition that he might have got it wrong ... No glimmer of sympathy for Portsmouth ... Benitez gambled... Benitez got away with it ... etc etc etc.â€�
              
              I reckon youâ€™ve got the idea. That was just one Monday morning report of Liverpoolâ€™s last gasp win at Pompey. But it was a common theme.
              
              In case youâ€™re unsure, Liverpool did actually win at Portsmouth. They did go back to the top of the table.
              
              But youâ€™d never have guessed from the way Rafa Benitez was mauled by the media afterwards.
              
              The manner in which the Redsâ€™ title prospects were dismissed by TV pundit Tim Sherwood was bordering on the contemptuous.
              
              Actually, forget the bordering on, it was contemptuous bordering on insulting.
              
              It was perhaps a little easier to understand the Sunday newspaper reports. A tea-time kick-off means those assessments will have been written with the match in progress.
              
              Liverpool were losing with six minutes to go, and even the Echoâ€™s Chief Sports Writer canâ€™t turn a 1,000 word report round in 360 seconds.
              
              The Monday men had no such worries.
              
              But most reports still sneered, still poked fun and still claimed Benitez got lucky.
              
              But to do so conveniently avoided the facts.....tbc

              Liverpool forced twice as many corners as the home side â€“ not a guaranteed indicator of dominance in a match, but a reasonable one.
              
              Attempts on goal? Liverpool 15 Portsmouth 9. On target? Again in Liverpoolâ€™s favour. Possession? Comfortably Liverpoolâ€™s.
              
              Clearly this was no smash and grab raid, regardless of the lateness of the strikes.
              
              So why the negativity?
              
              It appears to have become a growing trend this season â€“ from people with entrenched views and mindsets.
              
              Every time Liverpool concede a goal from a set piece, itâ€™s because of zonal marking, and analysis instantly begins of Liverpoolâ€™s defensive frailties.
              
              Yet zonal marking has been in place at Anfield for four years â€“ and Pepe Reina has won the Premier Leagueâ€™s Golden Gloves award in three of them.
              
              Then thereâ€™s the attacking focus.
              
              Saturday nightâ€™s TV analysis focused on the number of times Liverpoolâ€™s strikers spent outside the penalty area.
              
              The same attacking system which scored three goals and has outscored Manchester United this season.
              
              Imagine the reaction if Liverpool had just won eight of their last 11 matches 1-0.
              
              It wouldnâ€™t be a celebration of goalkeeping excellence, it would more likely be how Benitez was boring his way to the title.
              
              There is no doubt that the political in-fighting, the ill-timed outbursts and the bizarre transfer policy have made criticising Liverpool the journalistic equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel this season.
              
              But this time, at least, the critics have missed the target.
              
              
              **i tend to agree**
