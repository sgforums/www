Not only that, you always intepret what people tell you as something else. Either that or you keep convincing yourself contrary to what others tell you.<br><br>You are disliked not because you like Chelsea in itself, but because of your arrogant attitude. No doubt you are trying to emulate Mourinho, but quite obviously you're passing yourself off as a clown. Mourinho does what he does for the good of his team, why do you do it? So that you can piss off the non-Chelsea fans?<br><br>The arrogance in itself is wrong, nevermind why Mourinho does it. You've heard it enough times from other people and from newspaper to know that arrogance is frowned on. Yet you are blatantly doing it as if it makes you look cool. Honestly Ghimpheng, it just making yourself seem like a clueless clown wannabe.<br><br>Again I ask, what good does the arrogance serve you?<br><br>I used to think your arrogant attitude was restricted to just your soccer rants alone but apparently that isn't the case. So perhaps you admire Mourinho's arrogance because you yourself were arrogant to begin with. So now you see a public person like Mourinho being so arrogant, you find that it justifies your right to be arrogant? Just guessing.... either way, it doesn't mean arrogance is right. Whether it is you're learning from Mourinho or using Mourinho to reinforce your own arrogant attitude.<br><br>Moreover, pure arrogance, little substance and an unwillingness to be responsible will not get you very far. I think you will learn in your own time.<br><br>But just to repeat something to you, stop persisting in the view that people dislike you because you are pro-Chelsea. That was never the point. The problem was with your arrogant attitude. Even your own Chelsea fans dislike you, so go figure. Stop living in your own little delusions and believing in your silly little misconceptions and trying to find excuses when the problem is with YOU directly. People dislike you because of your ATTITUDE, not because you like Chelsea.<br><br>The problem Ghimpheng, is YOU. Not Chelsea, not the Liverpool fans or whatever fans. The problem is YOU.<br><br>It won't matter if you were a Man U fan, a Liverpool fan, an Arsenal fan, with that kind of arrogant attitude that you have, people will dislike you still. "You're always right, everyone is wrong and biased against me!" and coming up with excuses for your own faults and wrong-doings.<br><br>The problem Ghimpheng is <span style="color: blue;">YOU</span>, <span style="color: red;">YOU</span>, <span style="color: green;">YOU</span>!<br><br>You being too full of yourself.<br><br>You thinking you're always right.<br><br>You thinking everyone else should cede and give in to you.<br><br>YOU.

You and your arrogant attitude. Your being stuck up and insisting the whole sgforums was against Chelsea when the problem was essentially just you.</div>

For shooting his mouth off, Mourinho is now paying the price. He is in danger of losing his job and has made himself the most unpopular manager alive. Based on events however, I'm pretty sure being popular is not among your list, in fact you seem to derive attention and pleasure from being unpopular, even using your unpopularity at times to get under people's skin. Of course I may be giving you too much credit because you do not know what you're doing.<br><br>The sad thing about Mourinho is he lets all his arrogance and trash talking get the attention instead of his footballing genius. I know him as a good manager, however, all that is forgotten because of the trash things he says and his arrogance takes centre stage instead. Contrast with Benitez who usually doesn't say much, but let's his work speak for itself.<br><br>And Mourinho is now getting a slap in his face for all the things he had said and things he had promised. Like winning the league by Christmas, boasting how undefeatable his side is. Sometimes it's a tactic, or at least I used to. But he's really beginning to prove himself as a Moaner, especially with Chelsea playing not as well this season.<br><br>Basically, Mourinho's arrogance is now coming back to haunt him. The whole world is laughing at him for the things he failed to do. You should have learnt a thing a two about how arrogance can really lead you to humbling situations later on. Your experience in sgforums should be experience enough in getting humbled many times over. If despite all this, you still don't understand how arrogance can really do you in, then it's too bad.</div>
