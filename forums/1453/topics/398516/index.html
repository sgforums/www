              <h1>Rafa Benitez: I want Fernando Torres cash - 
              showdown talks key
                                      to future of Liverpool boss</h1>
              <p>Rafa Benitez will hold crunch talks with 
              Liverpool chairman
                                      Martin Broughton today with his tenure as 
              manager in the balance
                                      and the club reeling from Chelsea's bold move 
              for Fernando
                                      Torres.</p>
              <p>As Chelsea prepare to offer Â£70million for 
              Liverpool's star
                                      striker, Benitez will meet Broughton in London 
              and demand written
                                      assurances that all money raised from player 
              sales can be used to
                                      sign new ones.</p>
              <div><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/05/article-1273400-06F59740000005DC-978_468x302.jpg"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/05/article-1273400-06F59740000005DC-978_468x302.jpg" alt="Chelsea and Manchester City are chasing Liverpool's Fernando 
              Torres" width="288" height="185"></a>
              <p><em>Hot shot: Chelsea and Manchester
               City are chasing
                                      Liverpool's Fernando Torres</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez believed he had been given such a 
              guarantee when he
                                      signed his new contract last year, but monies 
              from sales have since
                                      been used to service the club's debts.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Broughton is unlikely to be 
              able to give
                                      50-year-old Benitez the promise he is seeking, 
              due to the
                                      chairman's non-executive role and the club's 
              delicate financial
                                      state. That will frustrate Benitez further and 
              push him into a
                                      corner over his future, which is still very 
              uncertain with Juventus
                                      waiting for him to decide if he is keen to move 
              to Turin at the end
                                      of the season.</p>
              <p>Privately, Chelsea are surprised that their 
              discreet move for
                                      Torres has become public. Yet the rumbling 
              confusion over Benitez's
                                      future has encouraged them to believe they can 
              be successful in
                                      their battle with Manchester City for the 
              26-year-old rated the
                                      world's best striker.</p>
              <p>The divide between Benitez and the club's 
              hierarchy seems to be
                                      growing wider with every day and the stark 
              realisation that the
                                      talismanic Torres could be sold has brought the 
              club's dramatic
                                      slide into sharp focus.</p>
              <p>Juventus are waiting patiently for an answer 
              on their four-year
                                      contract offer for Benitez, but the Spaniard is 
              believed to have
                                      reservations about taking on the challenge in 
              Turin with the club
                                      in such a state of transition. However, the sale
               of Torres would
                                      leave Liverpool in a similar situation and most 
              probably turn
                                      dwindling public support against the manager.</p>
              <div><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/05/article-1273400-09670023000005DC-451_468x379.jpg"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/05/article-1273400-09670023000005DC-451_468x379.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez will hold crunch talks with Liverpool chairman Martin
               Broughton" width="288" height="233"></a>
              <p><em>Show and tell: Rafa Benitez will
               hold crunch talks
                                      with Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>If, as seems likely, Benitez does depart, the
               presence of Kop
                                      idol Kenny Dalglish as an intermin manager will 
              at least appease
                                      fans as the club searches for a suitable 
              replacement. However, the
                                      pressure will be on for them to make giant str 
              ides quickly after
                                      such a disappointing season on all fronts.</p>
              <p>The sale of the club is paramount to those 
              changes, but the
                                      project Benitez began in 2004 seems no closer to
               completion.
                                      Although Liverpool have made plans to sign new 
              players, the extent
                                      of that recruitment is difficult for them to 
              predict.</p>
              <p>The club have held preliminary talks with 
              Real Madrid about
                                      Rafael van der Vaart and were linked with Real's
               Royston Drenthe
                                      and Guti yesterday, but any such moves are 
              likely to be shelved
                                      until Benitez and Torres final ise their 
              futures. Dutchman Drenthe
                                      has potential but Guti - although a free 
              transfer - would be
                                      unlikely.</p>
              <p>Fiorentina have expressed an interest in 
              Liverpool midfielder
                                      Alberto Aquilani, although his agent Franco 
              Zavaglia said: 'I don't
                                      think there is anything concrete. It is still 
              too early to tell if
                                      a deal is possible.</p>
              <p>'First of all, the priority is to finish the 
              season well. Then
                                      we will know what will be the future at 
              Liverpool.'</p>
