The roofer spent two extra nights in the Japanese capital and paid Â£126 for new documents from the British embassy.<br><br>Mr Yardley, 45, was then told his original airline ticket was non-transferable and he would have to pay Â£1,700 to get home, leaving him to rely on a whip-round at his local pub.<br><br>But when defender Carragher heard what happened, he paid for the entire cost of the trip.<br><br>Father-of-one Mr Yardley told the Daily Post: "We were on our way to the FA Cup game with Luton when one of the lads handed me this envelope and said 'Jamie wants you to have this'.<br><br>"I opened it up and there was Â£1,700 in cash in there - I was absolutely stunned.<br><br>"The lads had loaned me the money to get home, but I had to pay them back and I was really worried about where I was going to get the money from."<br><br>The Reds star heard of Mr Yardley's plight when visiting family members in Bootle.<br><br>His father Philip had been on the same flight home as Mr Yardley and told his son what had happened.<br><br>Mr Yardley said: "It was an unbelievable gesture and just shows what kind of a bloke Jamie is.<br><br>"I was struggling for money after paying to get to Japan in the first place and then I had to pay for a hotel for another 24 hours, a new passport and a flight home.<br><br>"I had no idea how I was going to pay my friends back.<br><br>"I haven't missed a Liverpool game for six years, but I was really worried I'd have to give up my season ticket."<br><br>Carragher, 28, was given the Freedom of Sefton last month for his services to local charity and youth work. </span><br><br>good character and morale well done</div>
