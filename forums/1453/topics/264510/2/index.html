It is a big leap for me and I think it was the right thing for everyone.<br><br>"The time comes in the life of a player that he needs more challenges.<br><br>"I have always done what was best for the club, too. The Liverpool offer arrived and I only told the club to listen to that offer because that is the team I wanted to play for.<br><br>"It's one of the best, if not the best, clubs in Europe."<br><br>Torres is aware of the enormous pressure he will have at Anfield, but believes he is ready for the challenge.<br><br>He has been given the number nine shirt, worn most famously by goal machines Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler.<br><br>"The fact that Liverpool are giving me the number nine jersey just goes to show the confidence they have placed in me, when considering those who have worn that shirt before me," he continued.<br><br>"A new beautiful adventure begins for me and I hope that with work and effort I can be among the best players.<br><br>"This is a unique opportunity for me. Liverpool aspire to everything and that has been an important factor in my decision to go there.<br><br>"I want to adapt as quickly as possible. I think Premiership is a football that adapts well to my style.<br><br>"I will arrive with a lot of joy and ambition."<br><br>Torres was saddened to leave Atletico after a disappointing campaign which saw the Madrid outfit fail to qualify for UEFA Cup.<br><br>He has played for the club's first team for seven years after supporting them from childhood.<br><br>"I will always feel at home at Atletico," he said.<br><br>"I am proud of what I achieved here, my heart will always be Rojiblanco regardless of where I go.<br><br>"I want to thank the fans, who have shown a lot of support over the years. It has been a pleasure for me. I hope to return one day.<br><br>"I have my conscience clear of what I have achieved. I believe this is a good decision for me and for the club.<br><br>"I hope to return some day when the club is at the level it deserves, playing in the Champions League."<br><br>Atletico president Enrique Cerezo told Torres: "We hope some day you can return.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Ten Million Quid Too Much For Torres</strong><br><br>Ladies and gentleman, these truly are the End of Days. Panic on the streets of London, Natasha Bedingfield in the charts and now Liverpool are flushing millions down the footballing toilet on a player with as much experience of high level football as a Manchester City fan. The end is very nigh.<br><br>In Spain, Fernando Torres' move to bigger and better things in the Premier League has come as very little surprise to the locals - especially Atletico Madrid fans. However, the amount of money that the club are receiving for their mulleted marksman certainly has.<br><br>Lip-quivering rojiblanco supporters have been appearing on television all week to lament the imminent departure of their side's only decent player, but were delighted that the ever crazy English were going to stump up the cash for his extortionate buy-out clause.<br><br>Make no mistake, Fernando Torres is no Sean Dundee. The MadridileÃ±o is a very accomplished, hard working, consistent striker. But he is not a great striker. And he certainly isn't a 27 million pound striker.<br><br>The former Atletico captain misses more penalties than he scores and - contrary to what keeps being repeated by various English pundits - only uses his left foot for kicking himself, when missing with his right. His passing can be awful and his former manager, Javier Aguirre, recently admitted that his striker had the erratic decision making skills of a starving Mark Viduka at an all you can eat buffet.<br><br>However, it must be taken into account that Torres has been plying his trade at a genuinely rubbish club. The reason that so few Youtube-trawling Liverpool fans have seen him play club football is that Atletico Madrid have the astonishing ability to blow every chance they have of moving onto a higher European plain.<br><br>This season was no exception and it was perhaps a miracle in itself that Torres managed to grab 14 league goals, considering his midfield supply consisted of a hopelessly out of his depth JosÃ© Manuel Jurado, the god-awful Luciano Galletti and Maniche, a footballer who stretches the definition of the word 'professional' to its limits.<br><br>Up front, Torres had to play alongside the old 'new Maradona', Sergio AgÃ¼ero, whose game was simply incompatible with that of the Spaniard, or Mista, who would often trundle into the box a good ten minutes after Torres' set up had flashed through.<br><br>It was a combination of these circumstances that has finally forced Torres to leave a side where he is idolised and could happily have played for the rest of his career.<br><br>This and yet another failure to qualify for Europe and a disastrous home thrashing by Barcelona during the season run in has convinced Torres that leaving the club was the only option if he is to revive his flagging career.<br><br>The choice of England as a place to ply his footballing trade arose after a pre-season tour to the country with Atletico Madrid, accordingly to one club insider, who said the forward was impressed by the stadiums and passion of the crowds.<br><br>Unlike the disastrous transfer of JosÃ© Antonio Reyes, Torres is moving voluntarily, speaks some English, and will perhaps enjoy a move from a country where 'the guy has not been able to socialise for about ten years' because of his profile and where fans stick him on scales to give him his weight in ham - an annual humiliation Torres has to go through.<br><br>While there are doubts over Torres' footballing abilities, there are none over his character. "The directors, players, youth teams and fans see Torres as the standard bearer for all the values of Atletico Madrid", wrote Javier Borrell in Marca, on the departing captain. "You'll never walk alone", sobbed his paper on the front page splash, as a goodbye gesture.<br><br>Torres will offer a great deal to Liverpool over the reported six years of his contract - his fierce will to win and his hunger for success, for starters. But the striker is at least ten million pounds too expensive, based on his form over the past two seasons.<br><br>The 27 million pound fee puts an immediate pressure on a striker who could have benefited from a playing in a side that he did not have to carry on his back, as with Atletico.<br><br>Liverpool fans will be wanting an immediate return, on their extravagant investment. Unfortunately, Torres will not be able to deliver it - but it won't be for lack of trying.<br><br>Tim Stannard.</blockquote><a href="http://www.football365.com/spanish_thing/0,17033,9405_2466755,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.football365.com/spanish_thing/0,17033,9405_2466755,00.html</a></div>
