Not even any obscene amount of money to bring in so called star players can guarantee league or cup success.<br><br>Benitez had been tremendous in instilling much beliefs, discipline and tactical awareness amongst the players since Houllier's days &amp; before. I'm not taking away Houllier's archievements but IMO, this current crop of players have what it takes to bring more glory back to Anfield.<br><br>2 Champions League Finals within 3 years. How many managers can do that? There is also improvement in the league standings as well and the gap is closer than before.<br><br></div></blockquote>Exactly. If Benitez is to leave, Liverpool management have to find one who is capable of bringing cup successes or even more than what Benitez has done for pool. I see very few capable of dat loh. Try Ancelotti if possible, or Mourinho. Maybe Frank Rijkaard?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by soulwinner:</div><div class="quote_body">why don't post in soccer?</div></blockquote>Maybe should? But me tinks dis 1 will get better response especially coming from Liverpool fans perspectives and their hope of what can liverpool do with or without Benitez.</div>

Improved legue standings, two champion's league finals (as compared to not qualifying regularly in the past). Your post is really funny.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>I think with huge money going to spend for him. He is expected to bring title within these 2 yrs. At least next season ,he must at least finish 2nd to really prove improvement of liverpool.<br><br>There is a price to pay for asking huge transfer money to buy star player!</strong></blockquote>This next part made more sense, of course if the board gives you money, you are expected to do better. Not just by the board but by everyone else. Mourinho was so expected to deliver beyond a Carling Cup and FA Cup this season.<br><br>Still, like BÃ¥seline has said, no one can gurantee Cup or League success, but at least be able to challenge strongly for it.<br><br>I'm not sure what you see as improvement, but not every team can be like Chelsea within a season be dominating the domestic front and sweep two titles in a row.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Benitez can be like the next Wenger or Ferguson, but give him time to continue to build his team and establish his team and himself in EPL. Success is also about building for the long term.</div>
