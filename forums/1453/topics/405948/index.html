              <p>Joe Cole has revealed he signed for Liverpool because they are the 'biggest club in 
              England'.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder officially signed his 
              four-year deal - worth £80,000 a week - after leaving Chelsea this summer.</p>
              <p>And he has spoken for
               the first time about his reasons for joining Liverpool - and snubbing a
               move to Arsenal and Spurs.</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The new Liverpool No 10 said: 'I could have stayed at Chelsea
              because the fans loved me and I won things, but I wanted to challenge
              myself and when I knew Liverpool were interested it was a no-brainer
              because they are the biggest club in the country.</p>
              <p>'I set myself a deadline to make a decision and when I made it I
              sent a text to Christian Purslow and Steven Gerrard and then turned my
              phone off.</p>
              <p>I know I have made the right decision and I am looking forward to
              the challenge. This is a challenge for me. I have played in London all
              my life.'</p>
              <p>'This is a massive club. I tried to take everything out 
              of the equation, take the financial and location side out and just 
              thought in football terms.</p>
              <p>'I thought about the semi-final of
               the Champions League in 2005 when I ran on to the field and the hairs 
              on the back of my neck stood up. I was thinking about playing in that 
              atmosphere every week and that swung it for me.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/21/article-1296540-0A7AA9BF000005DC-544_468x286.jpg" alt="Breath of fresh air: Cole says he can't wait to get started with 
              new Reds boss Roy Hodgson" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Breath of fresh air: Cole says he can't wait to 
              get started with new Reds boss Roy Hodgson</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'You talk to Liverpool players and talk about the European nights. I 
              experienced it as an opponent and it was immense. To go out there and 
              play in that atmosphere every week will be phenomenal.'</p>
              <p>Cole 
              revealed that he is exciting about working under new Liverpool boss Roy 
              Hodgson, who replaced Rafa Benitez at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>He
               added: 'I had a chat with the gaffer about football and was impressed 
              with him. The club has had Spanish and French managers over the years 
              and I think it's a breath of fresh air to get an Englishman in.</p>
              <p>'The
               club finished seventh last year, which wasn't good enough, and he 
              explained where the club wants to go. I jumped on board because with the
               players we have here and the players we are looking to bring in, it's 
              definitely going in the right direction.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/21/article-1296540-0A5D5744000005DC-92_468x304.jpg" alt="Thumbs up: Cole declared he was delighted to hear captain Steven 
              Gerrard will stay at Anfield" width="468" height="304">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Thumbs up: Cole declared he was delighted to 
              hear captain Steven Gerrard will stay at Anfield</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'I want to go out there and to run and fight for the lads and the 
              fans. That's what I'll always do and Roy is the man who can make sure we
               are a nice unit as a team.</p>
              <p>'It's all about us and being 
              together as a team and having the spirit which can take you a long way. 
              If you add that to the quality players we've got here we can go a long 
              way.'</p>
              <p>Cole has also welcomed the news that he will be playing 
              alongside Steven Gerrard next season after the Liverpool skipper 
              committed his future to the club.</p>
              <p>He said: 'That was the best 
              bit of news I could have had. I know Stevie, he is Liverpool through and
               through and I know from playing with and against him for the last 10 
              years what a quality player he is.</p>
              <p>'I know how much this club 
              means to him. I think players can play for other clubs but with 
              Liverpool you have to live and breathe it. It's that kind of a place. I 
              am excited by the challenge.</p>

              <p>'I am moving my family and everyone is excited and booking their 
              weekends up here. I am going to make it work.'</p>
              <p>'We've just had
               a young baby girl, but I'm 28 now and I have a good family around me. I
               know people will make me feel welcome and the response I have had has 
              been amazing.</p>
              <p>'I just want to get involved. When you move to a
               new club it's important to immerse yourself into everything about it 
              and that's what I'll be looking to do. I know the fans are great with 
              the players and I will fight to try and win trophies for this club.'</p>
