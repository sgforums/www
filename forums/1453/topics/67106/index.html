He is seen losing ball again.<br><br><strong>Striker</strong><br><br>Due to the defensive tactics deployed on the midfield, Owen was seem running ard as a winger.<br><br>Heskey the donkey show some trickery last night, but, blur at the six yard box.<br><br><strong>Overall[b]<br><br>Liverpool exhibit the same pattern of play every match.<br><br>Midfield or Goal keeper pump ball into the opponent's half.<br><br>Heskey head the ball down.<br><br>"Some one" fetch the ball and score.<br><br>BUT, the ball is always lost to the opponents after a few headers.<br><br>The midfield is alway rarely seen in the opponent's half, they prefer to play defenders instead.<br><br>Last of all, I "admired" GH's courage in telling the whole world again that he will not be replaced by O'Neil.<br><br>He have now learned to lie to himself openly.<br><br>That is PATHETIC  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> !</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sick of hearing his post match talk...full of crap. David Moores must be slowly packing his bag liao. Charlton is five point clear in fourth place and GH was saying he was quietly aiming for 3rd place.<br><br>The previous three wins were all fluke, 2-0 win at Yeovil was nothing but expected, 1-0 win at at Chelsea was nothing but luck and the win against Villa was crapy. What's there to be cheeky about. When it comes to the real test of quality, the current team should be more than happy at where they are lying now in the table.</div>
