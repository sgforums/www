You just keep trying.<br><br>"It is how they want to win points, you cannot say anything about this.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"We were trying. When you play with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">small clubs</span> it is difficult, they play deep." </span><br><br>Liverpool are still waiting to hear whether Javier Mascherano will receive Premier League clearance to begin his Anfield career following a move from West Ham, but Benitez had no news regarding the eligibility of the Argentinian.<br><br>"I don't have any idea. We are waiting. With confidence, but waiting," Benitez added.<br><br>Of a wider significance at Anfield is the news that American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks could be close to sealing a takeover of the historic club after talks with DIC fell through last week.<br><br>Benitez for one is hoping that talks are resolved quickly to put an end to the intense speculation about the future of the club.<br><br>"If it's next week it will be better, then we can start talking again about football."<br><br></div>
