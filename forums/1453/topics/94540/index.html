            <div class='col-md body'>liverpool has lost. not exactly very sia suay this time round, considering how they battle during the last 20 minutes.<br><br>but what i seriously dont understand is that why do they always begin to perform only when they are trailing? can't they fight more aggressively consistently?<br><br>anyway, i aint too upset with this result. not that it is deserving with quite a number of contraversial decisions from both referee and linesmen, but at least it lives up to what is expected of such big game.<br><br>now for team and tactical analysis.<br><br>i still miss the hyypia and henchoz combination. carragher simply aint commanding enough to be a centre back yet. his no-nonsense attitude is high-regarded but only when he is playing right-back.<br><br>riise no longer fits into the team, from my point of view. without a pair of stable centre backs, his style of overlapping the midfielder cannot come useful given that he needs to backtrack on wingers.<br><br>as for the midfielders, what i would suggest is to throw kewell, hamman, gerrard, alonso and garcia on an island for a couple of months. make them eat, sh|t and mate with one another to enhance their understanding among themselves.<br><br>i cant rate the strike forces much because they didnt get to perform much.<br><br>what liverpool needs is to have 5 proper <strong>team</strong> players who knows how to pass among one another in the <strong>opponent's half</strong>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Losing to Man utd is a terrible result. It's as bad as losing to Tampines Rovers.  This is how I feel regarding this result. No disrespect to man utd but i rather Liverpool lose to Norwich or WBA then to lose to man utd. Well, what to do ? This  game wasnt' to be our game. Even if they beat us, it doesnt mean they will win the title , there is still a long way to go. Good luck to every man utd's opponents, may the force and luck be with you guys.</div>
