              <h1>Rick Parrey to leave Liverpool</h1>
              <p class="Date">Today 13:26</p>
              <p>The relationship between Rick Parry and manager Rafael Benitez and American co-owner Tom Hicks has been strained.</p>
              <p>Rick Parry said the request was offensive but he has now decided the time is right to leave.</p>
              <p>The departure of Parry is likely to take Benitez a step closer to finally signing a new deal.</p>
              <p>In November Parry pledged his loyalty to the club after he was linked with the chief executive's post as part of the Football Association's 2018 World Cup bid.</p>
              <p>He decided to remain at Anfield, despite being the top contender from a five-man shortlist for the job</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been locked in a series of boardroom wrangles with Benitez looking to gain greater control over transfers in his protracted talks over a new contract and co-owners Hicks and George Gillett falling out.</p>

              <p>NEWS that Rick Parry is to leave Liverpool may come as a major surprise – but the simple truth is, someone had to go.</p>
              <p>The Anfield hierarchy has been hopelessly split for some time now with Parry’s relationship with co-owner Tom Hicks having completely broken down.</p>
              <p>Last April, Hicks told the world that he wanted to remove Parry from his position as chief executive only to see that move blocked by George Gillett.</p>
              <p>Today, Hicks has got his way and Parry will leave at the end of the season by which time he will have clocked up eleven years of service with the club.</p>
              <p>The words “mutual consent” will almost inevitably be used in the official statement which will confirm his departure and in this case that phrase is unquestionably accurate.</p>
              <p>Hicks does not want Parry running his club and Parry does not want to run the club if Hicks continues to own it – it is as simple as that.</p>
              <p>Speculation will inevitably surface suggesting Parry’s departure is because he has lost some sort of power struggle with Rafa Benitez but the ECHO understands that this is not the case.</p>
              <p>In actual fact, today’s developments have come about because of an acknowledgement on all sides that the current situation in the boardroom cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
              <p>No successor to Parry has been named yet but the early front runner for the role will be the club’s commercial director Ian Ayre, brought to that role by Hicks.</p>
              <p>But whoever moves into the role will be faced with the immediate task of having to try and bring unity to a club hopelessly split for two years.</p>
              <p>Though Hicks and Gillett have tried to convince people they’ve buried their differences, there is ample evidence this isn’t the case.</p>
