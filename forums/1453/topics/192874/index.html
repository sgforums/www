            <div class='col-md body'>Take it easy lah.<br><br>Sometimes I don't understand why ManU fans come to Liverpool forums and post about ManU. Clearly people who do such things have the intention to try and boast about the club they support and ridicule other fans.<br><br>There's nothing wrong in being proud of your club. There's nothing wrong in talking about your club's successes.<br><br>But there is no need to thumb down others.<br><br>That's why I like Rafa Benitez. He talks about his own team. If he is asked what about the other team, he's happy to say he doesn't talk about them.<br><br>Mourinho of course is the ultimate in talking about other teams except his own.<br><br>Have some respect for others. In the end if you want people to respect for eg ManU, then please have some respect for Liverpool.<br><br>Credit where credit is due. ManU's comeback against Bayern was unique and amazing. Kudos to ManU.<br><br>But I think Liverpool's comeback from 3-0 down at halftime against AC Milan is not something small.<br><br>As Rafa Benitez likes to say "If they are talking about us, then they must be worried about us"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool has nv won the EPL title for at least the last ten years. (not counting the old first division title before it changed its name to EPL) sad case..<br><br>istanbul's CL final was more of a fluke. milan were sleeping to be hit back with 3 goals in 6 mins. W/o ger, honestly, liverpool are nth. (just take a look at the match against WH in the Fa Cup final) WH were playing well, and pool was simply v. poor. Reina? haha. but i knew it in the penalty shootout that he's gonna reclaim himself, and he did.<br><br>face the fact that liverpool are simply not good enough. lucky rafa sold nando. cisse's on his way out. and there's crouchie left.<br><br>and the def is ageing with hyypia. traore the clown's going.. so that's gd news. Agger is a gd backup though he lack pace. Riise is reliable and so is Carra. Aurelio should provide competition on the left side of def/mf. Young Argentine Central defender Gabriel Palleta is coming, but he isn't that fantastic anyway. I would consider Ger, Carra and maybe Xabi to be true-blue liverpool players.<br><br>alonso + ger is one of the best mf pairings. sissoko has a chance to become a v. gd player but his passing is wayward.. really poor at times. Kewell is back  (amid injury recurrences) and unless mark gonzalez plays on the right wing for pool next season, that'll be a huge problem of who to fill the void on the right wing. Certainly, sinama pongolle is not up to the mark. Le tellec is going to PSG.<br><br>9.5m - 12m for Bent may be a bit too much. Kuyt's most probably's on his way to newcastle. Defoe's future is still unclear. And where do the goals come from? Crouch? what a joke!<br><br>A mf to be the top scorer of the club is not a v. good thing. Mis-firing strikers are to be blamed. I can't imagine the whole lot of strikers not scoring a single goal between them for more than a month or two. simply pathetic.<br><br>trouble brews...<br><br>p.s i'm just speaking my mind. if you really go analyse, it's the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Coming from 3-0 down to win the CL is a FLUKE? Then MAN U come back is also a FLUKE? So what consitutes a great comeback and what constitutes a FLUKE?

Was it a fluke? Nope. MAN U worked hard for their 2 goals. So, before you say LIVERPOOL win is a FLUKE, think twice again.</div>

(not all but so do behave like that)..<br><br>Its true that we have yet to win the EPL champion before and we accept that.. but we see progress and are excited about it..<br><br>It is also true that Gerrard is very impt to the club.. we did over dependent on him, but then thats what we call star players! and Gerrard is truely a top star!<br><br>Put it this way, ppl tend to find excuses when things go wrong but I cant recall any that are more ridiculous than those form Old Trafford..<br><br>Did anyone recall a certain match that Man U lost to Southampton 6-3?<br>I rem the reason given was that the players cant see each other in their grey colored jersey?!<br><br>Or what did that italian GK say when a goal lobang thru his legs?<br>His studs are too long? (anyone can explain how is that related to goal keeping??)<br><br>Or did any players said they forgot urine test?<br><br>SO before making comments, please take a look at your team!<br><br></div>
