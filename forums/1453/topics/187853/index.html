            <div class='col-md body'>Sissoko is certainly proving to be a great buy by Benitez. Don't forget he's still very young! So there's a lot of potential in this fella. I can see him becoming a dominant player for Liverpool in the future much like how Viera used to boss for Arsenal.<br><br>The team played in a 4-1-4-1 position against Chelsea with Sissoko shining at the holding role.<br><br>Letting Alonso drop back into the defensive midfield position and playing a 4-4-2 formation with an additional striker would be an option especially against weaker teams who are content to sit back and play out for a draw. However at the moment it doesn't look as if Liverpool is going to have a prolific striker signed in the summer. At least that's what I think. Also even at Valencia, Benitez never favoured playing 4-4-2 as his first choice formation.<br><br>It depends on the players you have. Eg if you have great strikers, then playing 2 strikers would of course be wiser. If you have better midfielders who can also score, but not so good strikers, then playing 1 striker might be wiser.<br><br>Then again, it's also up to the manager to sign the players for the formation and style of play he prefers.<br><br>Chicken or egg problem? I guess a lot depends on how Liverpool was when Benitez took over the team. We didn't have a very good midfield but had better strikers. Remember Kewell was nonexistent last season and this season a lot of matches have been won because of Kewell. Most papers have attributed the semi final win to him.<br><br>So I think Benitez had no choice but to play 4-4-2 when he first took over at Liverpool. Also we didn't have Crouch and neither Baros nor Cisse nor Morientes play well as lone striker in the EPL. These days Benitez has better options.<br><br>I still think he favours playing the Lone striker with more midfielders.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I think his idea is to eventually play 5 across midfield with a lone striker, Gerrard in the middle behind the lone striker. Just like how he mastered the successful 4-5-1 Valencia formation, with Gerrard in Aimar's position.<br><br>Another alternative would be the 3-5-2 Wingbacks formation that throws another striker up front. Wing players Risse, Krompkamp, Finnan and Warnock can easily play either full backs or wing backs.<br><br>I think Rafa is slowly getting to his ideal squad.<br><br>Sissoko, Alonso and Gerrard certainly look key to Benitez's long term plans.</div>

I dun think Benitez has believed in strikers very much. They tend to distort the shape of the team. And unless they are prolific strikers, they are more a burden and luxury.<br><br>Sissoko, Alonso, Gerrard, Kewell, Reina, Carragher, Finnan, Riise, Hyppia, Crouch and Garcia are probably the players who are assured that they won't be sold.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like sisoko..i think he has brought some stability and license to roam for gerrard...with him in the team...gerrard has lesser defensive responsiblity and can concentrate on what he does best...<br>a pity though...i never liked 3 centre midfielders at the same time...but what to do...alonso...gerrard...and maybe sisoko...you can't miss any of them in the squad...</div>
