"I'm sure that at the end of the week both Pepe and Jerzy will be fit.<br><br>"Sissoko has started training now, and we will see. But I think all of them will be okay.<br><br>"There's only Fabio Aurelio and Luis Garcia injured. The rest of them will be fit."<br><br>Benitez also admitted he has a dilemma over who to play on both flanks against Milan with Harry Kewell pushing for a return on the left wing.<br><br>Kewell and Bolo Zenden are both battling it out to start wide on the left, while Jermaine Pennant is hoping to start wide on the right should Steven Gerrard be employed in central midfield.<br><br>Benitez has yet to make a decision on his starting line-up, but he is happy with the way his side are preparing for the final.<br><br>"We certainly have options on both wings, these are the areas I am having to consider carefully," added Benitez."This involves Bolo (Zenden), Harry (Kewell) and Jermaine (Pennant) and I have not yet made my decision.<br><br>"We looked at all the players in the training camp and in every training session people were talking about Harry Kewell.<br><br>"He played well for half an hour against Charlton but we needed to see whether he is fit and then decide if he can play from the start or not. There's a lot for me to decide yet.<br><br>"What I know at the moment is that we are focused and we will be ready. The players are really thinking about this game and you could see in previous matches that as much as you tried to push them, their minds were already on the final.<br><br>"The only thing we can do now is to prepare properly for the game and approach it with confidence because it's easy to become nervous or stressed."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zenden injury leaves Kewell in line for Athens<br><br>The door has been opened for Harry Kewell to make a remarkable comeback in the Champions League final due to an unlucky training ground injury to Bolo Zenden.<br><br>The Dutch midfielder is on crutches after sustaining the injury at Liverpool's La Manga training camp in Spain, ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League final against AC Milan in Athens.<br><br>Zenden - out of contract this summer - played in both legs of the semi-final against Chelsea, and was ahead of Kewell in the race for the left-wing spot.<br><br>Kewell has only just returned to action after a year out recovering from groin operations and boss Rafael Benitez - although happy with the Australian's progress - was sceptical that he would have enough match fitness under his belt to play the whole 90 minutes of the final.<br><br>But with Zenden's injury, the Spanish coach may have to seriously consider Kewell, or move full-back John Arne Riise into a midfield role with Alvaro Arbeloa coming in at left-back.<br><br>Chile winger Mark Gonzalez, talking this week about the prospect of leaving the club in the summer after a disappointing season, could also find himself in contention for the left-wing role.<br><br>Liverpool fly back from Spain tomorrow afternoon, and Benitez will give Zenden every chance to prove his fitness.<br><br>Benitez says: 'Bolo has injured his ankle. He's been treated by the doctor and the good news is the swelling is not that bad. We will need to see how it is after more checks.<br><br>'It will be difficult to say he will be fit for the final now, but I won't say no yet. He is strong and determined and it may recover quickly. I still hope he will be okay.<br><br>'It will be a big disappointment for him and for us if it's not possible. Bolo can bring character, experience and tactical knowledge to the team.<br><br>'He is one of the good options for the left side, but now we must see how he recovers and decide what to do.'<br><br>Benitez has confirmed that goalkeeper Jose Reina is, as expected, fit for the final.<br><br>Reina picked up a shoulder injury at Fulham, and was left out of the final home league game against Charlton as a precaution.<br><br>But the Spanish star has trained normally all week in La Manga to dispel any fears that he would struggle to face Milan. Benitez also has number two 'keeper Jerzy Dudek back from a groin injury.<br><br>Benitez must also decide whether Pennant plays on the right, but he has no intention of giving any indication on that position because it would instantly confirm that Steven Gerrard will play in his favoured central midfield role.<br><br>Benitez only has Luis Garcia and Fabio Aurelio on the long-term injured list, although Mohamed Sissoko's chances of playing have been handicapped by injury.<br></div>
