            <div class='col-md body'>Fowler targets final hurrah<br><br>Robbie Fowler is hopeful of having one final chance to shine in Liverpool colours.<br><br>The forward will end his association with the club when his contract expires in the summer, but his final appearance at Anfield did not go according to script.<br><br>Fowler endured a disappointing day in front of goal and was substituted with minutes remaining to allow the Anfield faithful to hail their departing hero.<br><br>The move backfired, though, as Liverpool were awarded a penalty shortly after which was converted by Harry Kewell.<br><br>Reds boss Rafa Benitez has admitted he was wrong to remove Fowler, but the striker is hoping for one last hurrah in the UEFA Champions League final.<br><br>"I hope the Charlton game may not be my last game for the club," said Fowler. "Like everyone here, I want to be involved in the Champions League final.<br><br>"We all want to claim a shirt, I am no different so I hope this will not be the end and I can contribute something in Athens."<br><br>Fowler felt being substituted minutes before the penalty award summed up his season.<br><br>He added: "Being substituted a minute before we got a penalty was just typical of the way things have gone for me this season, but it has been a good day.<br><br>"I would have liked to have got a goal, but the most important thing is that we did not lose, with it being my last game at Anfield.<br><br>"But it was one of those things, nobody could have known we would have won a penalty so soon after me going off.<br><br>"I've had a very good career here at Liverpool, it was an emotional time as I walked around the pitch at the end and I cannot thank [enough] the people here at Liverpool who gave me the chance to come back.<br><br>"It gave me the chance to say goodbye properly, and I didn't get to do that at the end of my first spell here."<br><br>Benitez added: "I was just too quick. If I had waited a minute more, Robbie could have scored from the spot in front of the Kop, that would have been a perfect way to end for him.<br><br>"I had wanted to give him the chance of a personal ovation, but it was just one of those things in the end. It was just bad luck for him, but at least I made sure he got the ovation he deserved."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maldini ready for final fling<br><br>Milan captain Paolo Maldini has declared himself fit for the UEFA Champions League final against Liverpool.<br><br>Maldini made his first appearance in four games in the 1-1 draw with Catania on Sunday.<br><br>The former Italy international had been struggling with a knee problem, but after coming through 65 minutes unscathed against Catania he says he is ready to tackle Liverpool in Athens in nine days' time.<br><br>"I feel good and the knee didn't give me troubles," Maldini told the Italian press.<br><br>"The one with Catania has been a good test because the ground was hard. I have not had troubles.<br><br>"I'm optimistic and I think in Athens I will play. I'm really keen on that match."<br><br>Maldini was replaced by Kakha Kaladze on Sunday, but Maldini insists the substitution was decided before the match as Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti did not want to take any risks.<br><br>"It has been an already defined replacement. I could play until the end but it wasn't the time to risk," concluded Maldini.<br></div>
