It appears that the Liverpool board and the majority shareholder David Moores were unable to approve these terms in order to allow DIC to make a formal offer to all shareholders.'<br><br>The news prolongs Liverpool's long search for the outside investment they believe they need to compete at the top end of the Premiership and in Europe.<br><br>DIC had been their most likely suitor and entered into discussions with the club late last year.<br><br>The deal would have valued the club at Â£450million but the Dubai group have decided to withdraw following the board's decision to allow more time to consider the Gillett bid.<br><br>Gillett, owner of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, has proposed a deal which is thought to offer shareholders more for their holdings.<br><br>Sameer Al Ansari, executive chairman and chief executive officer of DIC, said: 'We are very disappointed to be making this announcement. DIC are a serious investor with considerable resources at our disposal.<br><br>'At the same time, we are supporters of the game and of the club. Liverpool's investment requirements have been well publicised and, after a huge amount of work, we proposed a deal that would provide the club with the funds it needs, both on and off the pitch.<br><br>'We were also prepared to offer shareholders a significant premium on the market price of the shares. However, we will not overpay for assets.'<br><br>He added: 'Liverpool is the most successful football club in English football history.<br><br>'It exists to win things for its supporters. It deserves to be in the hands of people who support it, who understand its history and legend and who share the enthusiasm and passion of its fans.<br><br>'As businessmen, we move on. As fans, we hope that the new owners would share the same vision as we had for LFC and, of course, in realising the new stadium that is so badly needed to ensure the club can continue to compete at the highest level in the Premiership and Europe.<br><br>'I am sure I will be back at Anfield with my family soon to support my team, as I have done so in the last 30-plus years.<br><br>'In the meantime, I wish the manager, the players and everyone connected with the club the best of fortune for the challenges ahead and will make sure that I am there the day they lift the Premiership trophy.'<br><br>He added: 'Liverpool is the most successful football club in English football history.<br><br>'It exists to win things for its supporters.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>DIC tried to bully Liverpool board, says Parry</strong><br><br>LIVERPOOL, England, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Dubai International Capital group tried to 'bully' Liverpool's board into accepting a takeover offer, the English Premier League club's chief executive Rick Parry was quoted as saying on Thursday.<br><br>The DIC withdrew their bid on Wednesday when Liverpool asked for more time to consider a rival offer from American sports tycoon George Gillett.<br><br>'We have a duty as directors to consider a very interesting bid from George Gillett,' Parry told the Liverpool Echo.<br><br>'The DIC response to this was to give the club 12 hours to make a decision but the chairman was not prepared to have Liverpool Football Club bullied like that'.<br><br>Liverpool are now concentrating on the offer from Gillett, the owner of NHL side Montreal Canadiens, and Parry insists the change of heart was not down to money.<br><br>'The price is not a factor in (chairman) David Moores' mind. He is not after cash for himself, absolutely not, but he felt compelled to consider the rival bid,' Parry added.<br><br>'We would also stress this is not a question of going for the second choice. David has always given George Gillett serious consideration while at the same time we didn't want to rush into any decision, and we were aware DIC might walk away.<br><br>There were initial fears Gillett was keen on forcing Liverpool to share a new stadium with city rivals Everton.<br><br>But whilst Liverpool did announce an exclusivity agreement in November, Gillett impressed the board with his proposal and the way he completed due-diligence in three days.<br><br>'George Gillett has made it absolutely clear to us he will not be in favour of a ground share,' Parry added.<br><br>'There will be funding for the new stadium and a proper commitment to investment in the team.<br><br>'Be assured the only thing David Moores is concerned about is the club being in the right hands for the future.<br><br>'You can be certain he has done his homework carefully and will make a decision in the best interests of the club.'<br><br>Liverpool are believed to have had second thoughts about the DIC after they took several weeks to complete due-diligence.<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez told a news conference on Thursday he was happy with the board's actions.<br><br>'When the club was talking to the DIC the conversations were good, but if the board decided to change, maybe they think the new people are better. I trust<br>the board,' Benitez said.<br><br>Source:http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=406101&amp;cc=4716</div>
