              <h1>Liverpool 4 Benfica 1: Dirk Kuyt's flying 
              high for Rafa Benitez
                                      as Reds book last four spot<br></h1>
              <p>Liverpool's  players must sometimes wake up 
              and wonder just
                                      how a season that began with such promise has 
              reached the home
                                      straight with them playing in the Europa League.
               When all is said
                                      and done, it remains Europe’s second-rate 
              competition.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Rafael Benitez and his 
              improving team have set
                                      about their quest for a consolation prize with 
              admirable zeal in
                                      recent weeks and last night’s defeat of Benfica 
              has now made them
                                      clear favourites to lift the trophy in Hamburg 
              next month.</p>
              <p>For all that they have laboured this season, 
              Benitez’s players
                                      have recently shown flashes of the football of 
              which they are
                                      capable. It has come far too late to rescue 
              their Barclays Premier
                                      League hopes, of course. The team will be hard 
              pushed to finish
                                      fourth.</p>

              <p>But in Europe they have found a little of 
              their true selves and
                                      at a capacity Anfield last night they advanced 
              to a semi-final date
                                      with Atletico Madrid on the back of some 
              expansive attacking
                                      football.</p>
              <p>Victory didn’t come without some anxiety, of 
              course. It seems to
                                      be the way with English teams in European 
              competition of late.</p>
              <p>Unlike neighbours Manchester United the night
               before,
                                      Liverpool’s carelessness in conceding a goal 
              with 20 minutes left
                                      did not lead to the calamity that for a while 
              looked possible as
                                      Benfica pressed forwards late in the game.</p>
              <p>A goal from Fernando Torres — his second and 
               his team’s
                                      fourth — with 10 minutes left ensured that 
              didn’t happen.</p>
              <p>They were unlucky to lose the first leg in 
              Lisbon to two
                                      penalties and a red card a week ago and last 
              night they were, after
                                      a slow start, the better side by some distance.</p>
              <p>The highlight was, as is often the case, a 
              Torres goal. His
                                      first of the night and Liverpool’s third, it 
              arrived just before
                                      the hour and was superb.</p>
              <p>Dirk Kuyt — by far the game’s best player — 
              and the Brazilian
                                      midfielder Lucas had given Liverpool a half-time
               lead with two well
                                      executed goals but the one that followed the 
              interval revived
                                      memories of Terry McDermott’s breakaway effort 
              against Tottenham
                                      here in the late 1970s.</p>
              <p>This one wasn’t in that class perhaps, but it
               was breathtaking
                                      all the same.</p>
              <div><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/08/article-0-090E6969000005DC-567_468x300.jpg"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/08/article-0-090E6969000005DC-567_468x300.jpg" alt="Liverpool's Lucas Leiva (R) puts the ball past Benfica goalkeeper 
              Julio Cesar" width="288" height="184"></a>
              <p><em>Breakaway goal: Lucas glides the ball 
              past Benfica keeper
                                      Julio Cesar</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>When a Benfica set piece came to nothing on 
              the edge of the
                                      Liverpool penalty area, the side broke with 
              remarkable speed.</p>
              <p>Javier Mascherano began the move with a run 
              and pass to Yossi
                                      Benayoun. The little Israeli then spotted Kuyt 
              charging down the
                                      right flank and when the ball was passed his way
               the Dutch striker
                                      delivered a first time cross for Torres to ram 
              home at the far
                                      post.</p>
              <p>It was a goal that effectively won the match 
              and sealed the tie.
                                      It will be remembered for a long time.This, too,
               was one of
                                      Liverpool’s better attacking performances of the
               season. They
                                      actually began hesitantly and Benfica were the 
              better side for 20
                                      minutes, creating one half chance for David 
              Luiz.</p>
              <p>However, the game turned on a set piece in 
              the 27th minute as
                                      once Kuyt headed in Steven Gerrard’s corner, 
              they never really
                                      looked back. It was an odd goal as Kuyt was 
              initially flagged
                                      offside by a linesman. Only when referee Bjorn 
              Kuipers pointed out
                                      that the rules do not allow for offside from 
              corners or throw-ins
                                      was Kuyt’s effort allowed to stand.</p>
              <p>It was a peculiar, confusing moment and 
              embarrassing for the
                                      linesman. Nevertheless, Liverpool were in front 
              and as the goal
                                      gave them the confidence to express themselves 
              they doubled their
                                      lead within two minutes or so.</p>

              Liverpool a goal to the

              </div>
              <p>A totally different goal, this one began with
               Benayoun’s dart
                                      infield towards the centre circle from the left 
              touchline. Leaving
                                      his marker behind, he fed Gerrard and the 
              captain’s smart through
                                      pass released Lucas in to space.</p>
              <p>The South American is not exactly Liverpool’s
               most expansive
                                      player but he is showing signs of greater 
              ambition these days and
                                      the manner in which he shimmied around 
              goalkeeper Julio Cesar to
                                      score was a movement worthy of Torres himself.</p>
              <p>With their noses now ahead in the tie, 
              Liverpool never really
                                      looked as though they would give up on their 
              task. The Benfica
                                      central defender Sidnei shot across goal from an
               angle just before
                                      half-time but once Torres converted in such 
              sumptuous<br> fashion with half an hour to go the home team 
              were on their way to
                                      a semi-final match up with his old club 
              Atletico.</p>

              and, for once, the
                                      blame lay with their captain Gerrard.</p>

               in the 70th minute
                                      was a poor one and should have hit the base of

              <p>Another goal for the Portuguese would have 
              knocked Liverpool
                                      out, of course, and hearts were most certainly 
              in mouths when
                                      another Cardoza free-kick six minutes after the 
              goal struck the top
                                      of the wall and looped just inches wide.</p>
              <p>The resulting corner was then headed just 
              wide of the other
                                      upright by Ssidnei but that was largely the 
              extent of the late
                                      drama as Mascherano released Torres with eight 
              minutes left and the
                                      Spaniard converted the fourth goal.</p>
