            <div class='col-md body'>Crude I have to say but I simply dun give much a damn about excuses. The performance on the field says it all.<br><br>For the past Seasons, we have seen LFC playing dodgy football to say the least. We are not asking for the passing football that LFC was famed for in the 80s but to play good football with passion and clever tactical play.<br><br>Week in week out, we have seen LFC playing with not much of a purpose and only a handful of players capable of doing that. Maybe it's not due to the players at all... maybe it's just due the tactics employed by GH.<br><br>As mentioned before by a fellow Reds fan here... we need someone to bring LFC a level up and above. Playing consistent football that win Championship.</div>

Perhaps we let him go on financial grounds - he was the highest paid non-1st-team player.

He is the type of manager that I can called Passionate about Football , like jumping when scored , or furious when decision went against him , and every player in the team  would play for him !<br><br>Looking at Celtics , he took over the team when Rangers rule , now he has won every Major Title in Scotland , and even fared better in Europe than Rangers ! He don't make Mega signings , he kept his existing players , and got a few on free , and start winning , and kept winning , with a tight budget !<br><br>If Martin O'Neill is given the budget GH was given , I bet he can do a more terrific job !
