              <p><a class="red" href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/squad/gerrard/"><strong>Steven Gerrard</strong></a><strong> has vowed to get even better after picking up his Football Writers' Player of the Year award in London last night. </strong></p>
              <p>The skipper enjoyed another scintillating season at the heart of the Reds' title push and believes both he and Liverpool are on the verge of an even better campaign next time out. <br>  <br>"The coaches at Liverpool and England are always driving me on, trying to improve me as a player. I am 29 on Saturday and I still feel I can get better," he said. <br>  <br>"I am still learning every single day in training, working on parts of my game, am still very hungry and ambitious. <br>  <br>"There is still a lot to achieve for me personally, for Liverpool and England, so hopefully next year is going to be a lot bigger for me trophy wise. <br>  <br>"The night has blown me away to be honest, I did not realise it was such a big event with so many people here. <br>  <br>"I would love nothing better than to come back here and share this evening with you again, so I will certainly try my best to be here next year." <br>  <br>He added: "I would not be standing here without my family, my wife and a few close friends are here tonight, and I have to say a big thank you to them. <br>  <br>"Also my club manager, Rafael Benitez, who has a lot of belief in me. <br>  <br>"He has pushed me further forwards into a role I am absolutely loving at the moment - every time I go out, I feel so confident. <br>  <br>"It is great to be here to receive an individual award, but without my teammates, I would not be able to be here. <br>  <br>"They have been fantastic this season and I am proud to be the captain of such a great team. <br>  <br>"Although this is an individual award, I would much rather be in a London hotel now preparing with my team-mates for the FA Cup final. <br>  <br>"Now, however, I believe we are moving forwards and are capable of challenging for major honours." <br>  <br>At a gala dinner to celebrate Gerrard's prize the toast to the FWA was made by Fabio Capello, with the England boss urging the midfielder to continue his club form into the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra. <br>  <br>Capello said: "Steve, you have played a fantastic season, and scored a lot of goals. Now, please, just two more to help us towards South Africa." <br>  <br>Gerrard responded by insisting he would do his very best to ensure his country are in the World Cup finals next summer. <br>  <br>He said: "The new manager has come in and changed things. I can honestly say it is a good time to be an England player. <br>  <br>"I have got a lot of belief in the England manager and his coaching staff. <br>  <br>"I think it is going to be an exciting year and hopefully we can get [World Cup] qualification sorted as quickly as possible. <br>  <br>"Then hopefully we can do better than we have done in previous years for England."</p>
