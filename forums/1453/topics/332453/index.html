              </span></p><p>Rafael Benitez believes if Liverpool win in
              his home city of Madrid in their next Champions League group match on
              October 22 they will have one foot in the knockout stage.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager thinks one more point after that will see them qualify from Group D.</p>
              <p>Benitez witnessed a convincing 3-1 victory over out-classed Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven at Anfield last night.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are still unbeaten now after 11 games this season, and
              the Spaniard said: "We have four games left in the group now, and we
              know from experience that you must fight to the bitter end.</p>
              <p>"But I believe that 10 points will now be enough to see us into
              the next stage. We will try to win our next match away to Atletico
              Madrid, and then maybe just one more point will do."</p>
              <p>Benitez hailed Liverpool's best-ever start to a group stage campaign.</p>
              <p>Coming after the opening win in Marseille last month, this is
              the first time Liverpool have taken a six-point maximum from their
              opening two matches at this stage.</p>
              <p>With Atletico Madrid's win against Marseille, Liverpool and the
              Spanish club are now in a very strong position at the head of the group
              to both reach the knockout stage.</p>
              <p>Benitez saw Robbie Keane score his first goal for the club, and
              skipper Steven Gerrard his 100th, after Dirk Kuyt had opened the
              scoring, before substitute Danny Koevermans grabbed a late consolation
              for the visitors.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "It was almost the perfect night. It was a really
              good game for us with lots of positive things, a solid performance with
              balance and quality.</p>
              <p>"Now we must keep on winning. This is a very good start for us,
              different maybe from last season when we did not start our group
              matches that well.</p>
              <p>"I was pleased for Robbie Keane. Now he has got his first
              European goal for us, I hope he will now score his first Premier League
              goal.</p>
              <p>"I know Robbie will score a lot more goals for us in the future, so this was just the first step for him.</p>
              <p>"I was pleased also for Steven Gerrard. For a midfielder to
              score 100 goals is very impressive. He is amongst the very best
              offensive midfield players anywhere."</p>
              <p>PSV coach Huub Stevens accepted his side had been outclassed,
              saying: "If you go behind so quickly, it will always be difficult
              against a team like Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Our organisation was okay, but Liverpool were just better. A
              difference in quality, the way they play out from the back is a
              different level to what we are used to.</p>
              <p>"English teams are very strong, they show that in the Champions League every season. We found it hard to contain them.</p>
              <p>"For us it is important that our two games against Marseille
              give us six points. Atletico and Liverpool are very close to qualifying
              even now.</p>
              <p>"They are both very strong. From what I have seen now we have
              played them both suggests that they are very much the favourites to go
              through now.</p>
              <p>"You see how good the English, Spanish and Italian clubs are.
              It is a problem for the Netherlands, we are happy to be in the
              Champions League but it is becoming very difficult to compete."</p>
