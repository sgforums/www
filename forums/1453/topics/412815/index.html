              <span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="color: #333332;">Liverpool scout Jakob Friis-Hansen has given a huge hint that Reds manager Roy Hodgson is determined to bring in four new additions to Anfield in the January transfer window.<br><br>Danish born Friss-Hansen was spotted in his homeland watching a clash between Lyngby and FC Nordsjaelland where speculation suggested he was monitoring youngsters Kim Aabech, Lasse Rise and Emil Larson.<br><br>However, the Liverpool scout played down suggestions the club are interested in the trio and his attendance was simply for social reasons.<br><br>"I played with an old friend in Lyngby and have many good friends at the club, and because you have seen me up there, it does not mean that I am interested in their players. It is not what we need now," Friis-Hansen admitted to <em>bold.dk</em>.<br><br>The Premier League outfit are currently entangled in a dispute between boardroom members over a potential ownership sale to New England Sports Ventures.
              
              </span><br><br><span style="color: #333332;">The American consortium are owners of the famous baseball team Boston Red Sox and have recently been given the go-ahead by the Premier League to complete the sale. However, current owners George Gillet and Tom Hicks are seeking to block the takeover.<br><br>Liverpool players have come under fire for their dismal performances in the Premier League so far, and Kop hero Fernando Torres has previously been vocal about the need for more quality signings.<br><br>Reds scout Friis-Hansen admits the North West outfit, who are currently in the relegation zone of the League table, are working hard to attract a number of players for the first team.<br><br>"The results are now important in Liverpool, it is first priority to get four prominent players in the next window for the first team. Players who can go into the starting line-up,” said Friis-Hansen.<br><br>"Roy [Hodgson] will hopefully get some money to work with. I will work in Italy, Germany, France, Belgium and Holland and will this year also be going to Spain for Liverpool and it is solely for the first team.<br><br>"It is a shame for Roy to get such a start, for there is no doubt that he is a really good coach. But it has been a tough start, because you did not know and still do not know what will happen with the club financially.<br><br>"I can hopefully go out and look at players in the highest price category at a time. But we will see."ï»¿</span><br></span></div>
