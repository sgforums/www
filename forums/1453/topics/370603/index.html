              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez believes Alberto Aquilani would be an exciting addition to his title-chasing squad.</strong></p>
              <p>Roma have given permission for Liverpool to discuss terms with the 25-year-old, who has yet to take a medical at Melwood. <br>  <br>In an exclusive interview with Liverpoolfc.tv, the boss revealed how Aquilani could fit into his side. <br>  <br>"<span style="color: #000000;">Roma have allowed us to talk with him, so that's good and positive. He is a player with the quality we are looking for," said Benitez. <br>  <br>"He can play a little bit higher than </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/mascherano/"><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> - maybe between him and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. <br>  <br>"He has good passing - the final ball is good - and he also works. If he can settle down properly in England he can be a very good addition. <br>  <br>"I think the signing should excite the fans. He won the U19</span> European Championship with his country, and U21 too. He has some trophies - including the Italian Cup. <br>  <br>"I always remember one game - England versus Italy U21s at Wembley, and he was man of the match in a 3-0 win." <br>  <br>The Reds concluded their discussions with Roma over permission to talk to the player once the sale of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid was agreed.</p>

              <p>The Italian international underwent ankle surgery in May and is only expected to be fit in the next "four to eight weeks".</p>
              <p>Aqulilani agreed a five-year contract with Liverpool after Reds boss Rafael Benitez identified him as his preferred replacement for Xabi Alonso, who joined Real Madrid for around £30m earlier this week.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had a bid of around £20m for the 25-year-old accepted by his Italian employers on Wednesday before the player headed to Merseyside for a medical and contract talks.</p>
              <p>The now former Roma man is expected to be at Anfield on Saturday to witness his new team-mates take on Atletico Madrid in the club's final pre-season friendly before next weekend's big kick-off.</p>
              <p>The crocked midfielder is believed to be earning around £80,000 a week.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafa Benitez praised the versatility and passing abilities of </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/aquilani/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Alberto Aquilani</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> after the Italian was unveiled at Melwood today.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Liverpool manager said his new recruit has a different style of play to Xabi Alonso and should not be seen as a direct replacement for the Spanish midfielder. <br>  <br>"Xabi is a holding midfielder that can play long. He (Aquilani) is a player with more mobility, playing a little bit higher," said Benitez. <br>  <br>"He can pass the ball and keep getting into the box." <br>  <br>Benitez has a clear role in mind for Aquilani, but is confident his new No.4 could comfortably fill in anywhere in central midfield. <br>  <br>"We have Mascherano and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/leiva/"><span style="color: #000000;">Lucas Leiva</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> both playing really well, with Gerrard in front. He can play instead of any of them," he said. <br>  <br>"He can play as second striker if necessary, but his best position will be between Gerrard and Mascherano - or between Lucas and Gerrard." <br>  <br>Rafa brushed off any lasting concerns over Aquilani's ankle injury and insisted the Italian is on the road to recovery. <br>  <br>"We knew that he had some problems," he explained. <br>  <br>"We think that we can improve him and keep him fit. We are 100 per cent confident he will be okay. <br>  <br>"Since the first day he was here with the physios, he was in the gym and the swimming pool, training and working really hard to be fit as soon as possible."</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Journalist: Alberto, welcome to Liverpool Football Club. Can you tell us why you decided to leave Roma? <br></strong>  <br>I knew that I would only leave Roma for a club such as Liverpool. I hope to grow as a player here and do the shirt proud. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: You mentioned the 1984 European Cup final between Roma and Liverpool. Would it be fair to say Liverpool have always been your second team? </strong><br>  <br>Yes. I did not actually see the game because I wasn't born when the final took place, but Bruno Conti spoke to me about it a lot and especially his mistake in the penalty shootout. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: You're a young boy, so it must have been difficult to leave the city of Rome and come to Liverpool? </strong><br>  <br>It was a difficult decision to leave my home city. Obviously I was born and raised there, and I've always been a fan of Roma. It wasn't easy, but when this opportunity presented itself I did not think twice. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: You've been here about a week now and you've met some of the players and the manager - how have they helped you settle in so far? </strong><br>  <br>They have definitely helped me a lot, especially the manager and (chief scout) Eduardo Macia. They have made me feel at home and shown me how important I am to them already. I've met some of the players, but not many because they've been playing in international games. I know they are going to be great and I'll have no problem fitting in. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: What aspect of playing in the Premier League are you most looking forward to? </strong><br>  <br>The football played here in the Premier League is different to Italian football. It is much faster, athletic and the teams are stronger. This is proven by the fact you always see English teams reaching the latter stages of the Champions League. I don't think it will be a problem and I'm looking forward to it. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: How much of a risk is it for a footballer to come to a new country and league in a World Cup year? </strong><br>  <br>There can be advantages and disadvantages, but obviously that depends on me. Marcello Lippi told me that I will have absolutely no problem. He said I am coming to play for a very important team and if I play well here, he will definitely call me up for the national team. My plan now is to keep improving because I don't want to stop. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: Xabi Alonso was a very important player for Liverpool last season when they came close to winning the Premier League. Do you feel any added pressure stepping into Xabi's shoes? </strong><br>  <br>Xabi was obviously a very important player - he played well. But I am not his natural substitute and it is important for me to play well whether I am taking his place or someone else's place. That's the main thing. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: You've arrived here with an injury and you'll be out for a few more weeks. Do you feel you can put those injury worries behind you and play a lot of games for Liverpool after you've recovered? </strong><br>  <br>That's exactly what I hope. I knew of the injury before I came here and I am happy because here they have diagnosed the injury problem properly - they know exactly what it is and say it can be fixed. I am hoping to recover well and not to have to stop playing again. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: When do you hope to make your debut? </strong><br>  <br>I don't really know when I'll make my debut. At Roma, I'd already started to train a little bit, but the doctor here prefers me to take it easy. I am here for five years, so there is no point in rushing back and then having to stop again later on. At the moment I am listening to the advice and I am hoping to get better soon. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: Liverpool had a great season last campaign and almost won the league. This year they'll be challenging Manchester United and Chelsea again. Do you know of the pressure you'll be under to help achieve that? </strong><br>  <br>I'm very well aware of the pressure this club is under and that I'm going to be under too. If you want to play for a big club, you have to be ready for the pressure. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: You played at Roma with a legend in Francesco Totti. You're now playing at Liverpool with a legend in <a class="red" href="/team/squad/gerrard/">Steven Gerrard</a> - how good is he as a player? </strong><br>  <br>Like I've said before, I think </span></span><a class="red" href="/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"> is the best midfielder in the world and I am very proud to have the opportunity to play alongside him. I hope I can learn a lot from him. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: Did you speak to <a class="red" href="/team/squad/dossena/">Andrea Dossena</a> before deciding to come here? </strong><br>  <br>Yes. I know Dossena very well from the Italian national team and he told me I would be in for a fantastic atmosphere here. <br>  <br><strong>Journalist: Any reason why you picked the No.4 jersey? </strong><br>  <br>Some of my favoured numbers were already taken and No.4 in Italy is considered to be a midfielder's number, which is why I went for it. I don't like high numbers that have no meaning.</span></span></p></div>

              <p>What good is a player when he is injured for 2 months at the opening two months ?</p>
              <p>Liverpool was not successful due to boo boo for the past three opening of the seasons where they dropped points.</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt the wisdom of Ah Ben in signing a player that he cannot fight a war with.</p>
              <p>After the openning match, Liverpool need a lot of repair to be performed.</p>

              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez today <span style="color: #000000;">revealed new signing </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/aquilani/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Alberto Aquilani</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> is making good progress in his recovery from an ankle injury.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss isn't putting a timescale on when we'll see his new signing in action for the first time, but he admits Aquilani is improving as he continues to work under the guidance of the Reds' medical staff at Melwood. <br>  <br>"Alberto is improving," said Benitez. "We were talking before about six to eight weeks and after a few weeks his ankle is much better but he will need time. <br>  <br>"He's in the swimming pool and in the gym and working with the physios but he's not jogging yet. <br>  <br>"We cannot put a date on things and it's important to just see how he progresses. <br>  <br>"We are checking on him regularly and he had a scan in the past week which showed he is much better. <br>  <br>"It's just a case of keeping an eye on him every day. When he does start to play everyone will see what a clever player he is."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Italian International is yet to make his Reds debut as he continues to recover from an ankle injury, but he believes once he gets back to full fitness he will prove his worth. <br>  <br>"I know Liverpool have spent millions on signing me but I'm here to prove I'm worth it." the 25-year-old said. <br>  <br>The former Roma man is also looking forward to playing in the Premier League, which he has so far enjoyed watching from afar. <br>  <br>"It's very good fun watching it, mostly because the matches are never over, and even if you are leading by two or three goals, you still keep attacking," he said. <br>  <br>"I can't say if it is the best football in Europe, but for sure it's the most spectacular, dynamic and challenging. <br>  <br>"And the stadiums, every time I played there, they are beautiful and all have a terrific atmosphere." <br>  <br>He added: "There are champions at this club, such as </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, who can make the difference at any moment and inspire the team. <br>  <br>"I'm thrilled to play alongside them also because I'm sure they will be able to improve my game." <br>  <br>With World Cup year approaching, the Italian also dismissed claims that moving from his home country may hinder his chances of being selected by Azzurri coach Marcello Lippi. <br>  <br>He added: "I don't think I have more or less chance in the Premier League than in Serie A. I'm confident I can deliver and then it's all up to me, <br>  <br>"All the rest will follow, because</span> only on the pitch can you give a good account of yourself."</p>
