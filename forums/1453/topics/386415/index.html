              <p class="SubHeading">Rafa Benitez claims Liverpool took a huge step towards finishing in the top four after Fernando Torres downed rivals Aston Villa with an injury-time winner.</p>
              <div class="ArticleRight">
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;"><img src="http://assets2.liverpoolfc.tv/uploads/placeholders/rafa_villa_263.jpg" alt=""> </div>
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;">The Reds are now just four points behind fourth-placed Tottenham - who they play at Anfield in January - following the 1-0 triumph at Villa Park.</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez believes his side have gained much more than three points from the victory.</p>
              <p>He said: "We knew we had to win to reduce the gap. The team was working hard and you could see how everyone was together.</p>
              <p>"I'm really pleased for Fernando, for the team and for the club. After this game it's easier because everyone's happier.</p>
              <p>"We've talked about the squad. Players like Gerrard, Torres, Carra, Mascherano - they all played so well last year and if they do the same we can do well.</p>
              <p>"We were playing a team with a lot of confidence. We had to work hard and play well. The conditions were really bad but little by little we controlled possession. We made some mistakes but tried to win the game from beginning to end." </p>
              <p>On his much-publicised 'guarantee' that Liverpool will finish in the top four, Benitez added: "You have some experience as a journalist. What do you think a manager will say? People are surprised because I say I guarantee. But I am a manager, I have to believe and I believe 100 per cent we'll be in the top four."</p>
              <p>Benitez knows keeping Torres fit for the rest of the season will be key to his side's chances.</p>
              <p>The Spanish ace played despite an ankle problem and became the fastest player in Liverpool history to record 50 league goals.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "He had some problems with his ankle more than his groin. He's working hard with the physios and fitness coach. It depends on how he feels but he was okay for this game.</p>
              <p>"We signed a very good player, a player with a good mentality and quality. You saw here that he has one chance and he scores.</p>
              <p>"He is one of the best strikers in the world. For me, you can never, ever say someone is the best because there are other good strikers in other countries.</p>
              <p>"I was surprised the other day with an expert talking about how Gerrard scores goals and always saves Liverpool. But he is Steven Gerrard. And Fernando Torres is the same.</p>
              <p>"If these players are fit and playing well then we know we're a very good team. Hopefully Fernando will be fit until the end of the season."</p>
              <p>The gaffer also reserved words of praise for Pepe Reina, who ensured Liverpool kept a clean sheet with a string of world-class saves.</p>
              <p>"Reina is a fantastic keeper," said Benitez. "When you have a top-class keeper in a top side you know there will only be one or two situations where he has to be good and he is really good in those situations."</p>

              <p>Liverpool have a lot of scare at the back when Villa nearly scored.</p>
              <p>Their defence is still weak.</p>
