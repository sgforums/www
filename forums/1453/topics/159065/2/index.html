            <div class='col-md body'>i extracted this from ESPN soccernet.<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez refused to criticise his players after watching them crash out of the Carling Cup at Championship club Crystal Palace.<br><br>'I cannot say anything about [tonight],' Benitez insisted. 'I know we lost the game, but the team worked hard and created opportunities. You cannot attack the players if they work hard. We started the game well tonight.<br><br>'We made some mistakes in defence, and that is the reason we lost this match. And even though we made chances, we failed to take them.'<br><br>why always the same old excuse?</div>
