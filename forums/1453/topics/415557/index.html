              <p>New Liverpool director of football strategy Damien Comolli insists that he will be working closely with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span></span> to bring new faces to Anfield in the coming transfer windows and stressed that his position will not undermine the manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0813/christianpoulsenroyhodgsonunveiling20100813_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Christian Poulsen, Roy Hodgson" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p>Comolli joined Liverpool from Saint Etienne two weeks ago and it has been suggested that the club's new owners appointed him as a result of doubts about Hodgson's transfer record since taking arriving at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has brought <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Joe Cole</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Paul Konchesky</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Christian Poulsen</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Raul Meireles</span></span> to the club, but all have flattered to deceive thus far, and it is thought that John Henry sought out Comolli in a bid to improve the quality of new recruits.</p>
              <p>But Comolli has moved quickly to play down reports that he will have final say in any future transfers, insisting that he and Hodgson will work together to target new players.</p>
              <p>"I think it was just a feeling between the owners and Roy as well that they wanted someone to be in there and come and help on a daily basis, support Roy in terms of making sure there is the best structure around all the club in all the areas which are football related," Comolli told Liverpool's official website.</p>
              <p>"In the short term, in my position you always think of the next window or the next two windows and I think everybody has got this in mind. As I've just joined, we've got only a few weeks to prepare for the window but we are also looking at the summer transfer window.</p>
              <p>"That's what I would call short term but then long term we are already looking at things like the pre-season tour for next season, we are already looking at the academy to see what we can improve, what the targets are there in England, young players who we could bring in, the same thing about Europe, to identify players around Europe that we'll be trying to bring in. It's a mix of short term and long term which I think is one of the beauties of this job.</p>
              <p>Comolli has built a strong reputation for spotting talent during spells at Monaco, Arsenal - where he helped unearth Gael Clichy and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/23601/Kolo-Tour%C3%A9"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Kolo Toure</span></span></a> - and Tottenham. Comolli was responsible for bringing the likes of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/77653/Gareth-Bale"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Gareth Bale</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/76762/Luka-Modric"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Luka Modric</span></span></a> to the White Hart Lane, though he also facilitated the signings of the significantly less successful Adel Taarabt and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/23602/David-Bentley"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">David Bentley</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>After clashing with then-Spurs manager Martin Jol, who complained several players had been signed without his permission, Comolli was later sacked along with Jol's successor Juande Ramos.</p>
              <p>But the 37-year-old Frenchman is confident that a strong relationship with Hodgson will help bring the Reds success.</p>
              <p>"We've been talking at length since I joined, several times a day on different issues and different matters, not only related to the transfer window or to scouting, we talk about everything. I think this relationship is going to grow in a positive way, that's for sure. We see things the same way. So far everything we have discussed we totally agree and have the same vision. I expect that's going to go on.</p>
              <p>"When you see the clubs he has managed and the national teams he has managed, what he's done at Fulham, what he's done at Blackburn and obviously being in charge here. Obviously, when you have managed Inter Milan as well and all the pressure there is there at one of the biggest clubs in the world, you have to have respect for what he's done.</p>
              <p>"I think sometimes it becomes controversial and it should not be. As John Henry said, it will be a consensus among us. That's the way John sees it, that's the way I see it and that's the way Roy sees it. The manager's decision and the manager's opinion on a player is absolutely crucial."</p>
