              <p>Based on your own views, which liverpool players should be offloaded and who should Liverpool buy to improve our dismal result in the EPL?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The player that should be offloaded is</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Charles itanje(not sure the spelling) - Dun know what benitez see in him? Should offload him asap, make use of Scott carson or promote our youth players like Dean Bounzanis or the young Bulgarian keeper Niklova something</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Riise - He seems to be getting slower compared to last time. Have been putting ordinary performance this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3)Harry Kewell - No point keeping him just to hope that he can produce his Leeds form once he is fit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4)Voronin - Should sell him away to earn $$ since he came in on a free transfer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5)Dirk Kyut - Hardworking but can't seem to get into goalscoring position. A striker but playing as a wide midfield player, not strong in the air and lack of confidence. Perhaps not suitable to EPL</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Players that should bring in:</p>
              <p>1) Mascherano - Hell of a player. Roy keane type of player. World class!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Right / Left back - Rafinha, Daniel Alves, Micah Richards, Nicky shorey, Tyrone Mears(Derby county), Veluso etc</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Wingers - Steward Downing, David Bentley,  David Silva</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Striker - Benzema, Promote Ryan babel to striker role, David villa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez should remain at liverpool for at least another season though it can be fustrating to see him rotate team selection for every match. David moyes was almost sacked when everton seems to be fighting relegation few season ago but now they are playing very well and their league position justify it. Moyes was given time to build the team for the future and is now bearing the fruit and i'm sure Benitez would be producing the same as well. Hopefully the youth players that he brought in would be class players in the future.</p>

              <p>well ..... dunno if Benitez will be kept 4 another season ....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Striker wise , Torres &amp; Kuyt doing a good job , Crouch could be going out .</p>
              <p>Kewell will go for sure .....</p>
              <p>Kewell's salary too high for a calibre like him . 40,000 pounds for a half-fit player .... no worth .</p>
              <p>I would go for a very good winger in Italy or Spain .</p>
              <p>We need a overhaul in our full back system .</p>
              <p>Other Elite League , most full backs create good crosses for the strikers , not ours .</p>
              <p>Wingers just Kewell out , another one in .</p>
              <p>Central midfielder also full house</p>
              <p>I need one more Central Back to understudy Carra . Agger &amp; Martin not enuf .</p>

              <p>Itandje is here because he is not a bad player and are willing to play second fiddle. While Scott Carson will not be willing to do so. He, along with Ben Foster, Joe Hart and a host of potential young England keepers all have a chance to take over from Paul Robinson. In Liverpool, you have Reina, who himself is a young and fantastic keeper. To displace him, Carson will either have to wait for a long long time or hope Reina be sold or kena bad injury.</p>
              <p>That is why Carson is loaned out or else I believe Rafa would rather keep him as the subsitute. The current 3rd choice David Martin is also a very good goalkeeper....so in a couple of years or so....and he is not playing....I believe we will go down the same road...so Itandje is a necessary evil...unless someone else better than him is willing to play second fiddle....</p>
              <p>I still believe we need one more PROVEN striker. Hunterlaar is my top choice but well, a lot of Dutch players came over and flopped except Ruud of cos. Villa is another choice.</p>
              <p>We also need really really need 2 class wingers. I was excited by Quaresma being linked to us a while ago cos despite his temperament and suspect inconsistency, he is that kind of player whom you need to just run down the wings and get a few crosses in. The wingers we have just seem to like to cut in from the flanks.......</p>
              <p>If Quaresma can come, that would be great.</p>
              <p>Other than that, I thought if Hypia leaves, we should get someone with experience to cover Agger and Skrtel.</p>

              <p>Harry Kewell is still around is a surprise to me already.</p>

              <p>liverpool got a lot gd goalkeepers under their rank so its probably not a big problem (the problem is if benitez dare to use them not)</p>
              <p>i think kewell should really go ba,he at leeds damn good come liverpool cannot make it,not help by getting injured regularly,too bad we cant see the best of him.</p>
              <p>itanje MUZ go,this guy is crap,serious</p>
              <p>voronin cant make it,he miss 2 great chance against arsenal recently in BPL,but he early season quite good,maybe lack of match fitness,i dunno</p>
              <p>liverpool MUST keep crouch,too gd a player to let go.</p>
              <p>they should get a good right back,winger,and striker</p>
              <p>rightback... ryan taylor from wigan looks pretty good</p>
              <p>winger,quaresma,joaquin,modric</p>
              <p>striker,huntaleer,dont really know his name,that guy from ajax,he score goal like for fun like that</p>

              <p>i still think Arbeloa and Aurelio still not up to our standard .</p>
              <p>Voronin just a fringe player .</p>
              <p>Finnan still the best bet in the right back slot , but he's near the end of his career .</p>
              <p>We need one left back and one right back , as our priority</p>
              <p>Midfield settle .... Alonso / Gerrard / Mascherano is done , our regular midifielders , supported by Lucas , Yossi and that Plisse .</p>
              <p>Striker ... why need strikers when we have Crouch / Torres and Voronin , Babel also can play as striker .</p>
              <p>Wingers .... Kewell most likely to be off load , we still have Pennant and Babel , at either wings .</p>
              <p>I think Rafa will start recruiting some serious central half in place of our aging Carra and Hyypia , Skrtel not enough .</p>

              <p>carra still can go on for some more seasons,dont forget we got agger,liverpool got a lot striker but only 2 is good(crouch,torres),babel for now should stay as winger,benitez is developing him like how it works on henry and walcott.centre midfield is very good</p>
              <p>wingers arent up to the standard,yossi is not the kind of winger we need as he's better at playing short passes,not long balls</p>
              <p>and of cause,we need 1 more prolific striker,torres is,crouch maybe,not kyut and voronin</p>
              <p>i still think riise shouldnt go,he provides something that arbeloa and aurelio cant,and like what people said,form is temporary,class is permenant,lets just give riise 1 more season,hes my fav player,would be damn sad if he leaves =(</p>

              <p>2. finnan: one of my favs but age is catching up. not what he used to be. will be sad if he does leave</p>
              <p>3. kewell: i had such high expectation of him. a disappointment. time's up to make way for others.</p>

              <p>What I heard this morning was that, Kewell is going (not surprised at all) Riise going (not surprised too) Alonso going (not surprised too) Crouch (kind of a pity)</p>
              <p>I have wanted Rafa to sell Alonso long ago. His half hearted tackle gave the free kick to AC which they converted and wins the CL. Look at his passing these days.. to who I don't know. He just wasn't up to standard these days. At least thats how I feel. It's not exciting watching him at all.</p>
              <p>Riise... getting slower and slower. How long we have see his shot makes the keeper dive for a save? Either he needs a glasses or he needs more training.</p>
              <p>Crouch is still useful but then again... he is not getting the starts he need.</p>
