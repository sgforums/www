Raul's agent, Gines Carvajal, has made it clear that if Real are willing to let the striker leave in the summer, he would "move to England without any problems".<br><br>Benitez worked with Raul when he was in charge of the Madrid youth set-up in the mid-90s and has maintained on good terms with his fellow Castilian. </span></div>
