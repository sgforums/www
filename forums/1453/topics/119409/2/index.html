            <div class='col-md body'>When liverpool are down, they need someone to lead them and fight. But where is Steven Gerrard? He did not really influence much of the game...he was not being really marked by chelsea players. I dun really blame him for the own goal but he look so listless throughout the whole game. This sign further strengthen my view that gerrard is not interested in leading Liverpool. Unconvinced? Compared Gerrard performance this season with last season. He was much more better in last season when he played with passion and pride. This season he is just being average...pls give the captain armband to Jamie Carragher who is a passionate and loyal Liverpool servant.<br><br>By the way, through out the whole match, i was really angry with Garcia giving away lots of possession. Lost ball liao still stand there fuming about it instead of tracking back to win back the ball.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for once, i enjoy watching liverpool playing defensive formation.<br><br>still, the ending was frustrating and devastating to watch, but i would still give credits to the players for putting up a decent fight.<br><br>though baros and gerrard only have themselves to blame for, for not burying glorious chances.<br><br>nothing to be ashamed of to lose this game, considering the cheap tactic used by the chelsea manager.<br><br>apparently, chelsea players (cole and duff) tried to get hyypia sent off and mourinho attempted to unsettle carragher with constant finger-pointing provocation.<br><br>he could argue that carragher tried to take out one of his player but i dont see ah ben complaining when lampard ended alonso's season.<br><br>for improvement, ah ben should start telling garcia not to over-estimate his dribbling skill, coz almost none of his attempt was successful.<br><br>lastly, gerrard can no longer blame liverpool for not winning trophy coz he played a major part in giving it away.<br></div>

The main priority for Liverpool is to secure 4th placing. Whether Gerrard want to play for Liverpool FC is not a concern, he now trying to do an action as what michael owen does.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It's 'official' Stevie G is a Chelsea man this summer.</strong><br><br>For once Dudek decides to play a decent game with the defence sticking to his decision but he failed to inform his midfielders esp his captain.<br><br>When the match started I thought Liverpool was going to put up a tough fight for Chelsea to get their first medal of the season and when Riise brilliantly volley home from the equally brilliantly cross from Morientes, I seriously thought Liverpool was going to win with that goal, thus my eariler post. When they started the second half, I some how felt it's not going to be the result I wanted. They are defending too deep. Yes, Chelsea put 4 strikers but no matter how well you defence, you can't defend for 45 minutes when you are not having possession of the ball.<br><br>Where are the midfielders for Liverpool? Things just got worse when Riise has to drop back to left back. The only person doing a decent job in midfield seems to be an old work horse Dietmar Hamann. I said this before and I will say it again, Luis Garcia is a TOTAL DISGRACE to the no 10 jersey. He can't hold the ball for more than 5 seconds. If he can't get pass players, DONT try! Can't even pass to his own team mates. What's his role? right midfield? Finnan did better than him in that area leh.<br><br>Blame it on luck... if there's no critical tackle made, Gerrard would have scored. If Biscan would have timed his jump better, Liverpool would have scored in extra time, if Baros would have pick Biscan out instead of shooting himself at the last minute of regular time, Liverpool would have won. If not for the excellent save from Chelsea's keeper, Hamann would have scored. If these IFs would have count, Stevie (mr liverpool) own goal woundn't have matter. Too many IFs. Teams can't win if they dont make the chances count. Remember Man U some years back with Andy Cole, he picks up the rebonds and made them count which in the end won Man U the EPL cup.<br><br>Well... true to the captain's words, Liverpool is not going to win anything this year. Shouldn't bother him anyway cos he's 'officially' the Blues  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">If this is the Premiership , the show will indicate possession : Chelsea 90% - L'pool 10% !<br><br>Bizarre on why Benitez deployed a so defensive tactics , hoping for penalty shoot-out ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Chelsea deserve the win , so obvious they're the hungrier lot !<br><br>I never blame Stevie Gee for that own goal , the way the game went on , it's inevitable the goal will come for Chelsea ! 'Cos they created more .<br><br>No one is to blame for L'pool , the lads played well , just that Chelsea played better ! Chelsea are more agreesive , more passionate , more desire , more commited .<br><br>Again Drogba is the talisman for Chelsea , I saw him played against us when he played for Marseille , and when I saw his name on the team sheet , i knew this chap are going to create a lot of problems for Hyypia , oh yes , not only he did so , he did marvellously well ( nearly getting Hyypia sent-off too ) !<br><br>No complaints we lost , we lost to a expensively-assembled on form on their day .<br><br>My only consolation : Nunez scored !!!<br><br>Forget about this defeat guys , we've more important assignment to be accomplish ! </span></div>
