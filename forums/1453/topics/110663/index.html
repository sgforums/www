I think it is an utter disgrace. On top of it, I dont think the FA does much to penalise refs for bad decisions.<br><br>I think it is time FA started using electronic media to improve refereeing standards. Many people will say it will take time but dont you think it is better that a game be prolonged by 5-10 minutes and the outcome of the game is fair rather that try and save those 10 minutes and let the game be affected by bad decisions.<br><br>Even though, I dont believe it will take much time. What can be done is put another referee using television who has the power to override the ref's decisions. He will constantly watch the match and if he finds anything controversial, he can tell the ref to change his decision(Like garcia's goal against boro or penalty against chelsea or red card against gardner in carling cup). And I dont think it will take any more time than the time taken to show the replay on television to the viewers.<br>************************<br><br>Also read tat such has already been so in games like rugby and AFL; so why not in soccer!?</span> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">i think having video refs could be an option ... but it's difficult to implement ... sometimes it may even bring up more problems ... it may sound funny, but having video refs does not eliminate all mistakes ...<br><br>other sports like rugby league, rugby union, and cricket already use video refs ... when the refs onfield are unsure about some incidents, usually goal scoring situations, they will refer it to the video refs ... they also have video reviews where players can be charged for violent conduct or striking etc<br><br>i guess the first question would be: at what level do we implement the video refs? ... it would be a massive exercise for fifa to implement it across all levels ... it means writing up new guidelines for the video refs and re-training them ... the cost of installing the technology is also huge ... video refs in a rugby league match may get 4 or 5 angles on the goal line ... the major leagues probably have similar number of cameras but what about games like the tiger cup?<br><br>another difficult part is where does the video ref's responsibility ends? do they only look at goal scoring situations, particular incidents, or do they cover the whole game? ... because if they're involved in the entire game then there may be a lot of interruptions ...<br><br>the video ref option is defintely worth exploring ... but it can only minimise the mistakes, it cannot eliminate all mistakes ... that's why an argument against it is that the refs' wrong decisions are part of the game ...<br></span></div>

How if one match there's five appeals ? Instead of a 90 minutes ball game , it will be extended til 125 minutes !!<br><br>Secondly , as far as rythem and momentum in a football match is concern , any delay really tamper the beautiful flow of football .</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mike riley is a flop in refereeing and he should be dropped!!! but i think that video replays would affect the game completely. Usually all these kind of bad refereeing decisions would balance out in the end. sometimes they go your way sometime it doesn't.
