            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to the thread title... I agreed wif Poolman's short and simple take.<br><br>The back fours are rather sound, if not... effective and no-frills. The fans are happy that young and very promising Agger is showing immense skills, mentality and maturity at the higest level.<br><br>Again, the midfield are sound and effective but still weak on the wings which our strikers depends alot on it. Right now, the system is over killing Kuyt's ability to have a decent shot at goal and running too rugged at the same time.<br><br>Goes the same for Crouch... we have the tallest in EPL bt the ineffective wingers does not allow much field time for Crouch bcos of that tactical reason. Pennant redeemed some bit but I still feel he is too inconsistent.<br><br>All in all.. despite these shortfalls... the all-round play is quite good. Much more tactically disciplined and better mentality on the field. They jus lacked the cutting edge in the front third and from the wings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i feel abt liverpool is not that they have a weak team. The crux of the problem is they bring in many talented players each year and this tilts the balance of the club. Feels more like a market than a club and the ever changing style of play definitely is not doing the club any good. To me players like bellamy and gonzales ane good player..Put them in a team like spurs and they will perform.<br><br>But back to this thread..Defence is solid enough...I think whats most impt is get a tricky winger and most importantly another central mid who have an eye for goal, some one who is constantly look to get into the action.<br><br>I see..boa morte, pedersen and kevin nolan as good choice. Not big names at all but surely adept in their respective positions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our wingers are okay. They just lack goals. Pennant have only scored once if im not wrong and he shld be more selfish.Gonzalez no need to say, but i was really impressed with Fabio Aurelio, playin so well but getting a career threatening injury. Steven Gerrard don look as effective at the right but he still contributes a lot. We miss players for the big games like Luis Garcia, who can score during big matches and is quite skilful with the ball, just have to practice not to lose it. S Finnan? Getting older alr, may retire soon and thats where Alves will use the time to get use to the League if we managed to buy him.<br><br>Just a statistic, but liverpool wingers have done well to supply crosses. 80 percent of Liverpool goals are crosses or played from both wings. Not forgetting Kuyt who i think have quite a handful of assists too.<br><br>We really lack goals from the wings but i think they are doing their part at crosses.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
