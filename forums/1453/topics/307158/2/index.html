              <p>Yes i fully agreed , ever since the departure of Paco Ayesteran , Liverpool was never the same again .</p>
              <p>Hope Rafa get him back to stablize the team , which i think to save face , Rafa will not do that .</p>
              <p>Just hope DIC , the more likely new owner , will not employ Mourinho , cos Mourinho will maybe get Paco as Asst Coach .</p>
              <p>Rumour that DIC don't believe Rafa can deliver the Elusive EPL title .</p>
              <p>Maybe Rafa has sensed his days at Anfield are numbered .</p>

              <p>when paco left rafa, he tot he could fill his shoes in conditioning the players but he simply try to do too much.</p>
              <p>even his youth coach is complaining about his interferences.</p>
              <p>kyut plays right wing so much so that he naturally drift to the right these days, even when he should be playing second striker. i am still trying to figure out why would you put someone who cant dribble nor cross as a winger.</p>

              <p>I believe .... like Kenny Dalglish , Houllier , Roy Evans and Souness .... Rafa will go "with mutual agreement ".</p>
              <p>Liverpool never sacked their Manager !</p>
              <p>One way or the other , it's like a sack la .....</p>
              <p>What do u expect , a manager , who has spent a fortune on foreign players , and had only deliver one UCL .</p>
              <p>At this stage , this is not enough .</p>
              <p>This defeat , plus losing the grip on the EPL Title , also Carling Cup defeat , and his last straw - UCL , and if ... Liverpool don't get 4th , i think Rafa will go .</p>
              <p>Nothing can save him , only winning the UCL can save his ass .</p>
              <p>The way i see , Liverpool not good enough to win the UCL this season .</p>
              <p>So i regret to say , Rafa will give way to someone else .</p>

              <p>Actually Ah Hou did not put his players out of position, nor did he rotate his players.</p>
              <p>His downfall is he bought and used too many lousy players.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting he is crazy about playing defensive soccer.</p>
              <p>Maybe Ah Ben is sick of being in the limelight after his buddy, Jose left.</p>
              <p>He could be getting excuse to be sacked and to gain compensation.</p>
              <p>His players could be plotting his downfall indirectly by playing with no passion and no standard.</p>
              <p>The players are also to blame for the defeat.</p>

              <p>If you were Rafa, would you want to stay?</p>
              <p>Firstly, his senior management has backstabbed him.</p>
              <p>Secondly, he might not even get the funds he wants to buy a few players that he really really needs.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, the team doesn't show any interest in playing for him cept for Stevie G, Torres and Carragher.</p>
              <p>Lastly, he has too much work to do like covering for the loss of an assistant manager and he's not even being appreciated.</p>
              <p>Maybe getting sacked and a handsome compensation package might not be so bad after all.</p>

              <p>Stevie G and Jamie Carragher plays their hearts out for the pride of the Liverpool uniform, something most of the others doesn't seem to be doing. Also it doesn't help that many of his buys has ended up being flops.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>numb to it already. its beginning to get worse than houllier days. the liverpool now has no passion, no effort, no heart, no nothing. they r jus a bunch of mediocre players running ard in liverpool jerseys. rafa has lost it. he can no longer motivate his players like previous seasons, mayb its bcos of the departure of paco? look at the amt of effort put in by the players every week, honestly i have come to expect unconvincing performances or wins for a long time, used to this kind of performances already. waste my weekend nights and starhub $$$ to c them play. at least the NBA all star was much better.</p></div>
