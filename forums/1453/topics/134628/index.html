They were in eighth place behind Werder Bremen of Germany.<br><br>Henk Potts, football finance expert for Barclays stockbrokers, said: "These figures show that English football is the dominant financial force in Europe, and the value of the Champions League TV contracts to the clubs who take part.<br><br>"The earnings from the Premier League are very important but the Champions League is the big cash cow of modern football. If you can make it to the Champions League for several seasons then it really is the road to riches.<br><br>"However these figures also show how important success on the pitch is. Manchester United had a poor season in Europe last year and that is reflected in the figures.<br><br>"Malcolm Glazer will want the club to be rising pretty rapidly up the earnings table but to do that he has to invest in players. That's the difficulty facing every club - how much to invest in players in order to bring in even more money."<br><br>The UEFA figures just show the distribution of performance bonuses and market pool cash - money from TV,, sponsorship and new media - and do not include gate receipts, another area where English clubs outperform their European rivals.<br><br>Onepot of Â£20m is split depending on domestic league position - the reigning English champions (last season Arsenal) got 40%, Chelsea 30%, third-placed Manchester United and fourth-placed Liverpool 15% each.<br><br>Another pot of Â£20m is split among the English clubs according to how many games each side plays in the tournament.<br><br>Should five English clubs qualify for the group stage next season - Liverpool must negotiate three qualifying rounds to get there, while Everton must play one - earnings will fall because the pots will have to be split five ways rather than four. Similarly, should only three qualify - and Chelsea and Arsenal have done so automatically - their earnings will rise.<br><br>As Scotland's sole representative, Celtic got the market pool for their association to themselves and earned Â£7m, just below Italian side Roma (Â£7.1m) and more than Spanish club Deportivo La Coruna (Â£6.6m).<br></blockquote></div>
