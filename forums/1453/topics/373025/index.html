              <p>4 days ago, Burnley defeated Man U 1-0, today I post in football forum, the stupid owner delete my thread.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nevermind, that is not the only football forum around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Owen Coyle has given his Burnley players permission to go out and bask in the glory of beating Manchester United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/0819/burnleyfansceleb20090819_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Burnley fans" width="275" height="155">

              <p class="photoDesc">Burnley fans in rapture after Robbie Blake's screamer</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Clarets first win since ending a 33-year top flight absence was also their first over United since 1968.</p>
              <p>Veteran midfielder Robbie Blake was the matchwinner, lashing home an 18th-minute volley after a period of Burnley pressure.</p>
              <p>But goalkeeper Brian Jensen also deserved hero status, saving Michael Carrick's penalty just before half-time to lay the platform for an unexpected triumph, repeating Carling Cup shoot-out heroics from last season.</p>
              <p>"I have told the players to enjoy it because it is not often you beat Manchester United,'' said Coyle. "I felt before the game if everything went our way we could probably get a positive result.</p>
              <p>"Then I saw a statistic on TV that Manchester United had won their last 17 matches against newly-promoted teams, scored 44 and conceded four. At that point I wish the TV had been turned off.</p>
              <p>"We rode our luck at times but we offered enough of a goal threat. The goal itself was outstanding, although I was not surprised because that is the type of thing he has in his locker.''</p>
              <p>It was the perfect response to Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Stoke.</p>
              <p>That reverse had the critics out in force, claiming there was no way Burnley, with their minuscule budget, could possibly survive in such rareified company.</p>
              <p>"One or two have already written us off,'' said Coyle.</p>
              <p>"I am not surprised about that. When you look at the financial side, we will have to produce every week.</p>
              <p>"Outside this club, everybody looked at our first five games (Stoke, United, Everton, Chelsea and Liverpool) and expected we would be on zero points.</p>
              <p>"We were disappointed on Sunday and we needed to be brave tonight. Now we have a massive game on Sunday against Everton, although whatever happens we are three points better off than we were at this stage in the Championship last season.''</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson was quick to offer congratulations to his fellow countryman, whose reputation is growing almost by the week.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson is no doubt relieved his side will not encounter many atmospheres as hostile as the one United experienced tonight.</p>
              <p>"People refer to this as a ramshackle place but I love this type of stadium,'' said Coyle. "And the supporters know that these players will give their maximum in every game.</p>
              <p>"Sir Alex said well done at the end. He dealt with defeat in the gracious manner I would expect of someone like that. He is the best manager in world football and I still expect Manchester United to be champions.''</p>

              <p>Let me just say that I se you lot as being no better than the other lot. Maybe one difference is you guys are playing more politics behind the scenes than them who are mostly ranting. Why the politics? Is it because of forum activity or rating? What's to be gained from playing politics here anyway. Maybe I'm not so much as you guys into choosing sides so all this politics thing seems real moot to me.</p>
              <p>But there is nothing I see that makes either of you sides any better than the other.</p>

              <p>bashings with reason are okay, considering U can support what you said.</p>
              <p>but as discussed, about 70% are pure anti-mu with moronic post with no content than to just start a flame war. And which leds to people been ban.</p>
              <p>Is that how you want to run a forum? U tell me.</p>
              <p>And about ur whines about how many moderators, blah blah blah, ask you take actions, U want to sit back in your crouch. Then as per discussed, just sit quiet and dwell in your own well.</p>
