            <div class='col-md body'>Pepe Reina has spoken of his pride at breaking Ray Clemence's club record of most clean sheets in his first 100 starts.<br>The Spanish stopper achieved a 55th shut out during his 100th game against Wigan on Saturday.<br><br>As revealed by liverpoolfc.tv, that eclipses Clemence's post-war record of 51.<br><br>"It's a massive record for me, but it wouldn't be possible without my teammates," said Reina. "I'm very proud to be part of Liverpool history because of that. They are great numbers and statistics, but you must keep working to repeat it.<br><br>"I always try to do my job as well as possible and I hope it's the first 100 of a million clean sheets, or maybe just to do the same in the next 100 games!<br><br>"Two more would be nice against Chelsea, but we'll have to wait and see what happens. We'll go into the game full of confidence.<br><br>"We can put all our focus on Chelsea now. We knew the first target was to make sure we qualified for next season's Champions League, and now we have done this we have plenty of time to think about Chelsea.<br><br>"Without having played in the games two years ago, I know the atmosphere is going to be really good and both squads recognise anything can happen. We'll face a big team with plenty of respect.<br><br>"I don't know how many times we've met over the last few years, but we know each other perfectly.<br><br>"They know our strengths and weakness and it's the same for us. It's not a game where there are surprises. The team which makes least mistakes will win it.<br><br>"The boss will have us prepared and every single time we can take advantage we'll do it."<br><br>Reina has suffered European semi-final heartbreak before, losing to Liverpool while a Barcelona player. He's determined not to feel that pain again.<br><br>"When you're as close as I was in the 2001 UEFA Cup to a big final, it's a pity when someone beats you," he says.<br><br>"The aim is to make the next step and I'm confident we can do that this year."<br></div>
