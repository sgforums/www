They should have doubled their lead with only eight minutes on the clock when Torres came close, while in the penalty area.<br><br>After that, the visitors started to gain a foothold into the game and after a series of free kicks, halfway through the first half Sunderland received a way back into the game when Christian Poulsen handled inside the area to give the Black Cats a spot kick.<br><br><strong>Darren Bent</strong> stroked the resulting penalty under Pepe Reina to give what his side felt, as justice, as they levelled things up.<br><br>Things got worse for the home side minutes later when Paul Konchesky was forced from the field with an injury, to be replaced by Daniel Agger as Hodgson’s side were forced to reshuffle at the back.<br><br>For the rest of the first half, both sides seemed to cancel each other out, as the continually gave the ball away. On the half time whistle Atwell was surrounded by both Turner and Mignolet, who complained about Liverpool’s first goal.<br><br>

              <p>I don't know what is Roy doing, he rested players at northhampton in hopes of getting fresher players for the match today. But it wasn't about the 'freshness' of the players, it's about how they play the ball around and the formation.</p>
              <p>I've emphasized on the importance of formation for a very long time. Rafael plays 4-2-3-1, but it was with 2 defensive midfielders. Roy plays 4-2-3-1, with 2 central midfielders.</p>
              <p>IMHO, we should play 442 with Jovanovic/N'gog and torres up front. we've seen at Man Utd match, after getting N'gog on we were better. At sunderland's match, after getting N'gog on, we were better.</p>
              <p>Hope Roy will see that.</p>
              <p>Plus, our passing was very bad. Half of the time seeing a long, heck, even short passes getting intercepted so easily.</p>
              <p>A very frustrating time for us Liverpool fans.</p>
