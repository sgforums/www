            <div class='col-md body'>fantastic result.<br><br>I saw the game and I much say LFC certainly deserved the win. It was another one of those magical nights. At the KOP end, 3goals when it seemed unlikely. Stevie G absolute cracker. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I must applaud the subs Pongolle and Mellor. Im not their biggest fan to date but they were certainly the reasons why LFC are still in the UCL. Both created and scored a goal each. Kudos to Benitez for getting the tactical decisions spot on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Now for the merseyside derby!</div>

Antonio Nunez abandoned his post shamefully and the Greeks have the away goal that means - because Monaco are leading in Spain - that Liverpool must win by at least two!<br><br>47 mins: A management masterstroke! Sinama has scored! Kewell, reliving past glories, absolutely skins Pantos down the left, and lays it across the face of the goal for Sinamo to toe-poke home! Cure delirium in the Kop! GOOOAAAALLLL!!!<br><br>78 mins: Another managerial masterstroke!! GOOOAAALLLLL! Olympiakos failed miserably to clear a free-kick .... Sinama scrapped for the ball wide to the left ... won it and dinked a fine cross to the edge of the 6-yard box where Nunez rose majestically and powered a header towards goal ... it was blocked ... but Mellor, seconds after coming on, pounced to drive it into the net acrobatically!!!!<br><br>86 mins: Unbelievable scenes!!! Carragher dawdled on the right then dinked it into Mellor ... who cushioned a header backwards to about 25 yards out ... it's sits up nicely .... for Steven Gerrard to smack a shot like a supernova past the keeper and into net!!! GOOOOAAALLLLL!!! No Uefa Cup for him then!</span><br><br></span></div>

It was another one of those magical nights. At the KOP end, 3goals when it seemed unlikely. Stevie G absolute cracker. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I must applaud the subs Pongolle and Mellor. Im not their biggest fan to date but they were certainly the reasons why LFC are still in the UCL. Both created and scored a goal each. Kudos to Benitez for getting the tactical decisions spot on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Now for the merseyside derby!</div></blockquote>kudos to harry kewell too, he's earned his keep</div>
