            <div class='col-md body'>Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas is delighted that Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse is keen on a move to the French champions.<br><br>Newspaper reports in France claim Lyon will open talks with Liverpool in the near future about the possible transfer of the striker, who has failed to win a regular starting place under Rafa Benitez.<br><br>"When a player wants to come to Lyon, we love the fact that he declares it," Aulas told Le Progres.<br><br>Cisse has again reiterated his desire to play his football in France and would relish the opportunity to play under Lyon coach Gerard Houllier.<br><br>"I have never had the chance to work with Mr Houllier, it would be a pleasure, I respect him a lot you know," the 24-year-old added.<br><br>"He recruited me at Liverpool, not Benitez, but then he left the club."<br><br>Another Liverpool player hoping to be playing his football in France next season is midfielder Bruno Cheyrou.<br><br>The 28-year-old spent last season on loan at Bordeaux but the French club do not want to pay the Â€1 million (Â£685,000) transfer fee to sign the player permanently.<br><br>Cheyrou has one year remaining on his contract at Anfield and was hoping Bordeaux would take up the option in his loan deal to keep him at Stade Chaban-Delmas.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lyon striker Karim Benzema has agreed a contract extension with the club through to 2010.</div>
