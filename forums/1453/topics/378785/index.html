              <p>torres can play for 30 games for liverpool without getting injured.</p>
              <p>but he seems to be injured 3 times out of past 3 international breaks. as if spain requires those wins to qualify.</p>

              <p>All thanks to the beach ball ... i won abit ..... when my friend wanna take Liverpool , level half ..... i at first hesistate , but then , playing away , without Torres and Gerrard , Sunderland stand a chance for a draw , me will win half .</p>
              <p>Bonus day , Villa , Bolton and Sunderland really really make my day .</p>
              <p>No need to work like fuck next week .</p>
              <p>All thanks to the Big Red Ball .</p>
              <p>Me just got a feeling , after World Cup Qualifiers , each game for the Top teams is hard .</p>
              <p>By normal standard , Liverpool could have been handicap more than just level half , maybe 0.5/1 , not -0.25 .</p>
              <p>MU can anytime handicap 2.25 playing at home , not just 1.5 .</p>
              <p>Fishy odds , indeed fishy today .</p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez refused to blame the manner of Darren Bent's bizarre winner for Liverpool's fourth defeat of the season - and admitted his side need to improve to keep their title dream alive.</strong></p>
              <p>Bent sealed a 1-0 win for Sunderland after his fifth-minute strike deflected off an inflatable ball thrown on to the pitch by a supporter. <br>  <br>But Benitez said: "It was a special situation but we didn't play well. The goal changed the game but we didn't play well, made some mistakes and gave the ball away. After this they played well on the counter-attack. They had some chances and when we had our chances we didn't take them. <br>  <br>"These things can happen in a lot of games. It's a bad situation for us that the (inflatable) ball was in the middle and was influential but again I will say we didn't play well - that's the main thing for me. <br>  <br>"We had some players who we knew could be a little bit tired, and then conceding after four minutes it was even more difficult. We have to do better if we want to win these kind of games." <br>  <br>Asked if he thought the goal should have been allowed, Benitez replied: "It's a very technical question but it could be because it could have been a goal anyway." <br>  <br>Despite the result, Benitez can take consolation in Chelsea's defeat at Aston Villa which means the gap to the top increased by just a single point to seven. <br>  <br>Manchester United rose to the summit thanks to a victory over Bolton but with Alex Ferguson's men visiting Anfield next Sunday, Benitez knows there will be plenty of opportunities to make up ground. <br>  <br>He said: "In a normal season teams at the top would be winning every game and it would be a long distance to the top now but Chelsea have lost two games and I think we'll see a lot of top teams lose games. <br>  <br>"Losing four games is bad but crucial? That depends on the next few games. If we can win two or three games in a row we can be at the top of the table. It's a question of keeping our confidence, working hard and trying to do better. <br>  <br>"We have an important game on Tuesday and then on Sunday. It's not important to talk about the table, we just have to think about getting three points in every game. <br>  <br>"You have to analyse some things. We made some mistakes and we need to find solutions. <br>  <br>"We won five or six games in a row, so I think we were fixing things, but in these difficult games we need to improve." <br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">  <br></span>Liverpool went into the game without injured duo </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br>  <br></span></span>On whether they will be fit for Tuesday's home match with Lyon, Benitez said: "Both are improving but it's too soon to say. We'll see again with the physios on Sunday. <br>  <br>"We have two or three days and we'll see how they progress. They are improving but it's difficult to say if they can be available. We think they can be but it's too soon to say."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Darren Bent scored the only goal of the game but it was a moment of controversy after his fifth-minute strike deflected off an inflatable ball thrown on to the pitch by a supporter to deceive </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/reina/"><span style="color: #000000;">Pepe Reina</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> on its way into the net. <br>  <br>"It was frustrating for us but Chelsea also lost so there is still a long way to go," said Carragher. <br>  <br>"Now is not the time to talk about the title. We are looking to the next game. <br>  <br>"We now have the Champions League tie against Lyon which will be in front of our own supporters at Anfield to restore some confidence before we take on Manchester United next Sunday. <br>  <br>"We will stick together and work hard on the training ground to put things right. We know we've got a good team, good players and a good manager so we've got to have belief in ourselves and keep going. <br>  <br>"We have the quality and the belief we will get back to winning ways soon, hopefully starting on Tuesday against Lyon." <br>  <br>The vice-captain refused to use the absence of key duo </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> as a pivotal factor behind the Sunderland defeat and claimed the squad has the quality to cope with injuries. <br>  <br>"It's easy to say we missed Stevie and Fernando and yes they are world-class players, but we have a big squad and we have won without them before. <br>  <br>"Sunderland played well. We weren't at our best but we can bounce back and restore some confidence."</span></p>

              <p>well, not sure whether it is due to fact balloon was thrown by their own fans.</p>
              <p>and maybe, unlike SAF, he prefers to blame his own players.</p>
              <p>Given the way the top teams are losing, title race is wide open, but Pool is on the outside already.</p>
