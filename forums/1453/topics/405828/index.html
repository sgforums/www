              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Dream move: Jonjo Shelvey</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Jonjo Shelvey has insisted he is determined to make an instant impact
               at Liverpool as the teenager prepares for his first season in the 
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>The 18-year-old England youth international, 
              regarded as one of the brightest young talents in the game, is with the 
              squad in Switzerland ahead of the new season.</p>
              <p>Shelvey, who was
               signed from Charlton at the end of last season, said: 'I'm really 
              excited and can't wait for the season to start now. I want
              to get at least 20 games under my belt this season so I can start
              getting myself into it.</p>
              <p>'I am confident, you have to be. When you 
              are 18
              years of age and you are getting thrown into games at Anfield then you
              can't have any fear. You have to go and do what you do.'</p>
              <p>Shelvey 
              admitted it was a dream come true to be playing with Liverpool's stars,</p>
              <p>He
               to;d the club's website: 'Being at Liverpool is what every kid dreams 
              of. When I was in school and in the playground I used to pretend to be 
              players like Steven Gerrard, so it's unreal to think I'll be training 
              with these players day in and day out.</p>
              <p>'It still hasn't really 
              sunk in now that I could be playing in the Premier League week in and 
              week out. It's unreal.'</p>
              <p>Shelvey also admitted he was already 
              learning a lot more about the game, adding: 'At Charlton training was 
              just shooting and five-a-sides and I was getting home at 1pm. At 
              Liverpool we're not getting home till 2pm or 3pm and that's what I 
              needed.</p>
              <p>'I needed to be somewhere where I could learn about the 
              game because it got to the point where I wasn't learning at Charlton. 
              I'm glad to be around the best people you could possibly be around.'</p>
