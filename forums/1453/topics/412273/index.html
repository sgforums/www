              <h3><img src="http://u.goal.com/110300/110300_news.jpg" alt="Liverpool Manager Roy Hodgson (Getty Images) "> </h3>
              <div id="article_content" class="KonaBody"><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Anfield Win Is A Must</strong></span><br><br>Liverpool host Blackpool in the Premier League on Sunday looking for a major improvement following a string of lackluster displays and results.<br><br>Roy Hodgson was tipped to have a tough start to life at Anfield when he took over in the summer, but it’s turned out much worse than even the most pessimistic of supporters would have imagined.<br><br>The Reds began the season by progressing through to the Europa League group stage and rather unfortunately only drawing at home to Arsenal. However, they have only beaten West Bromwich Albion domestically since - and even that was a narrow win. In fairness to the Anfield club, though, they have suffered both of their league defeats to title chasing Manchester United and Manchester City.<br><br>Despite only losing to the Manchester clubs in the league, Hodgson is already getting criticism from sections of supporters and the media. He failed to steer his side to all three points away to Birmingham City and at home to Sunderland - where they drew 2-2 thanks to Dirk Kuyt’s controversial goal last weekend - but there can be no excuses for one of the most embarrassing results in their history as they lost on penalties to League Two strugglers Northampton Town in the League Cup.<br><br>Liverpool drew 0-0 away to FC Utrecht in the Europa League on Thursday night as their slump continued, but they will surely be able to bounce back with a win over Blackpool. At least you would think they would be able to, and if they don’t it will pile more pressure on Hodgson, Gerrard, Torres &amp; Co.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Seasiders Living The Dream</strong></span><br><br>Some were tipping Blackpool to go straight back down to the Championship following their play-off win last season, but they’ve already proved it won’t be as simple as that.<br><br>Despite predictions that the Tangerines could finish the season by beating Derby County’s league record worst points tally of 11, they already have seven points on the board. After an emphatic win over Wigan Athletic on the opening day, they have also seen off Newcastle United at St James’ Park and drawn 2-2 at home to Fulham.<br><br>However, they have had their turnovers as expected as well. The 10-man Seasiders lost 6-0 to Arsenal at the Emirates in their second game of the season before being hammered 4-0 by Chelsea, and with them already losing 4-0 at half-time in that game, Ian Holloway changed his team’s tactics, opting to switch back to his usual attacking style rather than the 4-5-1 he had gone with from the start at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Holloway’s men were unlucky to concede a dubious late goal at home to Blackburn Rovers last time out which condemned them to a 2-1 defeat, and ended with their boss being hit with an FA charge for swearing at referee Mike Dean. But despite Brett Emerton’s winner coming after a quick break from one end of the pitch to the other from Blackburn, Holloway has vowed to stick to his attacking principles even if it means they are hit on the counter-attack just like at Bloomfield Road last weekend.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>TEAM NEWS</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;">Liverpool</span><br><br><img style="margin: 3px; float: left; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/104500/104598_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80">Roy Hodgson has received more injury news this week as Martin Kelly picked up a knee problem in the draw with Utrecht on Thursday.<br><br>Kelly’s likely absence means that due to injuries to Paul Konchesky (hamstring), Fabio Aurelio (Achilles) and Daniel Agger (groin), Liverpool are without a recognized left-back.<br><br>Fernando Torres is set to start against for the Reds despite poor displays of late, while Steven Gerrard will play after being rested in midweek.<br><br><em>Possible starting XI: Reina; Johnson, Skrtel, Kyrgiakos, Carragher; Gerrard, Poulsen; Kuyt, Meireles, Cole; Torres.</em><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;">Blackpool</span><br><br><img style="margin: 3px; float: left; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/88400/88465_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80">Matt Phillips, who scored on his debut with almost his first touch in the Premier League last week, is pushing for a start.<br><br>Rob Edwards featured in a reserve game this week and is also vying for a starting place, which means Neal Eardley may drop to the bench.<br><br><em>Possible starting XI: Gilks; Eardley, Evatt, Cathcart, Crainey; Grandin, Adam, Vaughan; Phillips, Harewood, Campbell.</em><br></span></span></div>

              <p>Seasiders Shock The Kop To Leave Reds In Relegation Zone</p>
              <h2>Ian Hollloway's men grab deserved win and leave Liverpool struggling at the bottom.</h2>
              <div id="article_content" class="KonaBody"><span id="divAdnetKeyword">Blackpool pulled off one of the biggest shocks of the weekend by beating Liverpool at Anfield 2-1 on Sunday.<br><br>Goals from Charlie Adam and Luke Varney gave the visitors a 2-0 lead but Sotiros Kyrgiakos managed to get one back for the home side and it looked as though for long periods of the second half that they would find that a elusive equalizer but the away side managed to hold on and grab a deserved three points.<br><br>Liverpool welcomed back the return of their influential captain Steven Gerrard after he was rested in midweek against FC Utrecht. Fernando Torres who has been harshly criticized recently according to his manager also retained his position in the side and Joe Cole started.<br>But perhaps the biggest shock was Roy Hodgson’s decision to play Jamie Carragher at left back. It has been a problem position for Liverpool this season and it was the first time he played that position in seven years.
              
              <br><br>Blackpool manager Ian Holloway decided to leave out Brett Ormerod and Marlon Harewood, as he preferred the partnership of DJ Campbell and Luke Varney upfront, which would prove to be a shrewd decision by the forty-seven year old.<br><br>In a thrilling first half Blackpool raced to a shock 2-0 lead courtesy of Charlie Adam from the penalty spot and Luke Varney only seconds before half time.<br><br>Blackpool had the first real opportunity of the match. Charlie Adam tested  Pepe Reina early on with a thunderous free kick but the Liverpool goalkeeper got strong hands to the ball and managed to parry it away to safety.<br><br>The personal nightmare for Liverpool striker Torres continued as he had to go off injured after only nine minutes despite making a lively start to the match and he was replaced by David N’Gog who had seven goals to his name this season.<br><br>Charlie Adam was having a big impact on the match controlling the midfield and the home side struggled to keep him quiet.<br><br>Blackpool could have went ahead after fourteen minutes a lovely long diagonal switch from left midfield to right enabled Neal Eardley to whip a dangerous ball behind the defense, DJ Campbell met the ball on the half volley at the back post but he was unable to divert the ball on target.<br><br>In reply, Steven Gerrard hit a stinging drive from twenty-five yards out but it did not trouble the keeper as it went harmlessly over the bar.<br><br>Neat play in the middle of midfield enabled Gerrard to fire a low ball into the box and substitute Dekal  Keinan made an important intervention to stop N’Gog having the easiest of finishes to keep the score at 0-0.<br><br>Blackpool were not afraid to take the game to Liverpool and on twenty minutes Luke Varney’s shot was blocked by Martin Skrtel although perhaps the better option was to square it to striking partner Campbell who was free in the box and he certainly made Varney aware of this.<br><br>But then away side took the lead on twenty-nine minutes from the penalty spot. Charlie Adam played a fantastic ball through to Varney he then cut inside and took on the right back Glen Johnson. Johnson got all his angles wrong and could have no complaints as he ended up bringing down Varney in the box and Adam confidently dispatched the ball past the grasp of <br>Reina from the resulting penalty.<br><br>Glen Johnson then had a chance to make amends for his error as the ball broke to him in the box on thirty-five minutes. He had Blackpool players diving out to block the ball he feinted one way then cut onto his right but his shot lacked composure and he lashed it over the bar.<br>The tide was turning the way of Liverpool. It was Dirk Kuyt’s turn to test the keeper. Raul Meireies was out on the right wing he curled in a teasing ball, the striker rose above the defense but could only power the header straight at the keeper.<br><br>Liverpool had another half chance a few minutes later. N’gog slid a ball into the path of Joe Cole he jinked onto to his right foot and from the edge of the box fired a low shot aiming for the bottom right hand corner but the keeper read what he was doing and managed to get down and smother the ball.<br><br>The home side’s brief period of control in the match was ended shortly before half time as Blackpool incredibly got a second and it was no less than they deserved.  The Seasiders were playing lovely little interchanges in the build up to the goal. Taylor-Fletcher then dinked a delightful chip over the top of the Liverpool’s defense despite appeals for an offside, Luke Varney snuck in under the radar and fired a low hard shot past Reina.<br><br>The halftime whistle went and a ring of boo’s could be heard around Anfield with Roy Hodgson having a lot to do if he was to salvage anything from this match.<br><br>N’Gog had a great chance to half the deficit on forty-seven minutes. An in swinging ball in from Dirk Kuyt found the striker in acres of space in the area but he his header was wayward and <br>was not troubling Matthew Gilks in goal.<br><br>But they would not have to wait long as they found a way back into the match with a goal on fifty-three minutes through Sotiros Kyrgiakos.  Gerrard floated in a cross and the defender’s bulleted header from six yards out giving the Kop something to shout about.<br>The momentum was very much with home side as they stamped their authority on the proceedings in the second half. Joe Cole had a great chance to level the match but his shot drifted wide of  the goal.<br><br>Raul Meireles was next to try his luck but he pulled his shot wide of the away sides goal on fifty-nine minutes.<br><br>The Seasiders were hemmed in with the hosts throwing everything at them. Substitute  Milan Jovanovic corner was met by Gerrard but his strike was again wide of goal.<br><br>Blackpool then countered the pace of Luke Varney was giving Kyrgiakos problems and he was lucky not to give away a penalty on the striker as he recklessly lunged in the box but Varney skipped past him cut back from the by-line but Glen Johnson was there to snuff out the chance.<br>Liverpool looked a different side from the first half. Dirk Kuyt and Joe Cole linked up well to create another opportunity but the ball from Kuyt skidded across the surface, which evaded the on rushing Cole.<br><br>The home fans roared on their team as they could sense that an equalizer was not far away but Blackpool were managing to deal with everything the hosts through at them. They might have even extended their lead with six minutes to go. Taylor-Fletcher who had a great game played a pass into Varney and he rifled the ball towards goal on the turn but it was too high to trouble Reina in goals.<br><br>Gilks pulled off a fantastic save at the end to ensure the three points were Blackpool's.<br></span></div>
