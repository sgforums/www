            <div class='col-md body'>Getafe have warned Liverpool they will have to meet their asking price if they want to sign star striker Riki.<br><br>The Reds are reported to be lining up a move for the 25-year-old when the transfer window reopens in January.<br><br>Anfield chief Rafa Benitez is keen to bolster his attacking options and he is thought to have made Riki his top target.<br><br>Riki has enjoyed a fine season so far with Getafe, helping them into the top three, and Getafe president Angel Torres admits he is aware of interest from Liverpool and other clubs in the player.<br><br>"We realise that Liverpool or any big club could want Riki, but nobody has officially spoken to us. I don't know if they have spoken to his agent," Torres told Marca.<br><br>"I have to say that not Liverpool nor anyone are going to get him for Â€4 million (Â£2.73 million) - they have to pay his buy-out clause.<br><br>"He is an adaptable striker who is in the news and it would be a shame for us to lose him, but it's obvious that if someone pays his buy-out clause and he wants to go then there is nothing we can do about it.<br><br>"I am not surprised Liverpool may want him because he is in incredible form at the moment. Liverpool have scouts here and all over the place."<br><br>Meanwhile, Benitez has warned Harry Kewell that he needs to prove himself this season.<br><br>The Australian has struggled to hit the heights at Liverpool since his arrival from Leeds in 2003.<br><br>Kewell has failed to play this season through injury, but he is close to regaining full fitness.<br><br>Benitez has admitted that this is a big season for Kewell and that the pressure is on him.<br><br>"Harry will need some time to get back to his best, but this is an important season for him," said Benitez.<br><br>"Harry wants to be fit and playing again, he wants to show people that he can play and be a good player for Liverpool.<br><br>"He is disappointed with how it has gone for him during his time here, but he is a professional who knows what he is capable of and he wants to play.<br><br>"He has more confidence in his fitness now. Maybe in the past he didn't have that kind of confidence, but he does now.<br><br>"The fans have criticised him a little at times, but they see a player with Harry's talent, they realise he is good and they want him to perform better.<br><br>"If you are a good player and play for Liverpool, you have to expect supporters to say, 'Come on, play better'.<br><br>"I have to manage the situation and understand Harry's problems, but this is a season where he does have to play well."<br><br>Wah 3 strikers not enough ar.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wait pool do create alot of chance if you watch the matches..against blackburn it was very evident that the service should have been good enough but they don't take their chances..and good strikers are always able to conjur up something when there is nothing..so don't always blame the service..cause i have seen pool play alot of times and really their finishing is poor.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All lies with Benitez and his so-call tactics....<br><br>Many said Benitez is the master of tactician , i have doubts leh ...<br><br>We don't see lots of creation leh , where is our link play ? Through balls ? one-twos ?<br><br>We only see our overlapping defenders delivery blind crosses into the nobody's land .<br><br>And we don't see crosses when Crouch is playing .<br><br>We control alot , just plain passings in opponents halves , but once Garcia got the ball , it's back to square one .... we wasted alot of time controlling , not creating .<br><br>We wasted alot of those 90 mins trying to get back possession lost by Luis Garcia and Josemi ..... oh my god , please sell this two .</div>
