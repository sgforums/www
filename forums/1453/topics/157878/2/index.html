With him on the pitch, there are more chances. He is a vry intelligent player. Only that sometimes he loses the ball when he tries too much..but thats his natural flair. He is learning and he will only become better. He can do for LFC what Robert Pires did for Arsenal.<br><br>As for the crosses, honestly, there is no out to out winger in the LFC team. The closest 2 are Kewell and Zenden. Both are'nt playing as much as they will liked to. Risse is never a natural left winger. He is only good at set pieces and the occasional long range efforts.<br><br>The central midfield is their strongest point...Alonso, Gerrard Sissoko or Hamann..thats why you see LFC playing through them so often..<br><br>They dun go wide not because they dont want to but because they cant! They dont have the wingers!!<br></div>
