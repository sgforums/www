              <p>i always believe when you put in a sub-standard player, u need to waste another player to cover up his mistake. resulting your team to only 9 players.</p>
              <p>though lucas isnt a total screw up today, but he and his department was not there to provide support, both offensively and defensively.</p>
              <p>as such, gerrard is tracking back to cover the midfield, leaving only babel dribbling himself and torres being swarm by at least 2-3 defenders most of the time.</p>
              <p>i guess the reds are still in asia mood and standard.</p>

              <p>if even at this point of stage, the players arent sure of what they going for, and need a wake up call, we aint fit to be a top club.</p>
              <p>today's play is a showcase of lacking of motivation, attitude, and key communication among the 11 players.</p>
              <p>lacking of quality in wingers is another major issue.</p>
              <p>if rafa thinks that gerrard and torres will still own together, he may have to think twice, for 2 seasons, he has been doing the same thing. now, rivals understand how he operates and that prove fatal.</p>

              <p>similar lineup and strategy is still fine with me. it is the lack of winning mentality that bothers me.</p>
              <p>not a fan of mourinho, but i gotta admit this is one biggest gift he left chelsea.</p>
              <p>when trailing a goal, every players want a piece of the action, dying to bring the ball forward and squeeze is between the posts.</p>

              let's hope they are consistent enuff to give our rivals the same level of performance.

              <p>They have to learn that they have to start all over again every season.</p>
              <p>This have happened for the last four season when Liverpool have to play with different formation.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have lost his crown jewels in alonso and bought a injured midfield player who may come back too late to make any impact.</p>
              <p>I have to say that it is time for Ah Ben to find another club and bring Jose in.</p>
              <p>Unless he can create miracles by buying some world class players, we can save our time in sleeping early for the next few weekends.</p>
              <p>He have got his FULL control for player purchase for this season so what difference have he made so far ?</p>

The understanding has to be better. As a team we were not comfortable in possession in the first half. <br>  <br>"We were playing against a good team so we knew we needed to play well. We didn't but we have another game on Wednesday against Stoke and we have to improve." <br>  <br>Asked if he felt his side should have been awarded two late penalties, the Benitez admitted: "I think everybody could see, especially the challenge on Voronin. It was so clear. You could maybe say the second incident was ball to hand, but the first one was clear." <br>  <br>Another worry for the boss was the fitness of centre halves </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/skrtel/"><span style="color: #000000;">Martin Skrtel</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/carragher/"><span style="color: #000000;">Jamie Carragher</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> after the pair clashed heads in the first half. <br>Carragher continued with a bandage around his head while Skrtel also tried to play on before eventually being replaced by Spanish youngster Daniel Ayala. <br>  <br>Asked about Skrtel and Carragher's condition, Benitez added: "Martin wanted to continue.
