            <div class='col-md body'>ANDERSON SET FOR LIVERPOOL<br>Team Talk 09 November 2005<br><br>Liverpool midfielder John Welsh is set for a permanent move to Hull in a swap deal that will see teenager Paul Anderson head in the opposite direction.<br><br>Welsh, currently on loan with the Championship outfit, will make the switch permanent when the transfer window reopens in January in exchange for highly-rated prospect Anderson.<br><br>It seemed a deal for Anderson was off last week following ongoing behind-the-scenes discussions at Anfield about how much Liverpool should spend on untried reserve players.<br><br>But, after the Reds improved their offer for the 17-year-old, who impressed during a trial at Anfield earlier in the season, a swap deal involving Welsh was struck.<br><br>Hull chairman Adam Pearson was keen to avoid a situation whereby Anderson would be free to leave the KC Stadium when his scholarship runs out in the summer, with a fee then set by a tribunal.<br><br>Pearson said: "We don't want to lose Paul, but neither do we want to be in a situation whereby he moves to Liverpool when his scholarship expires and then we receive pittance for him at a tribunal.<br><br>"The fact is he wants to join Liverpool and will now do so in January in a swap for John Welsh. The ideal scenario would be to keep Paul and sign John permanently as well, but it's not to be."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never seen him play before but its good to see that LFC are trying to build on their youth system. Be it buying from elsewhere or training from within.<br><br>John Welsh is already past 20. His 1st team chances are limited. I can't see how he is able to break into the side. As much as I will like to see the club keep Welsh,who with all respect was afterall former skipper for the England U21s, trading him for a potential prospect like Anderson sounds like an alright deal to me.</div>
