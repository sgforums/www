            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I agree.That Salif Diao was hopeless in the first half.<br><br>Even Biscan contributed more in just 60 secs than what Diao managed to achieve in 45mins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Another player whom I thought was very poor was Josemi.He looked out of pace at right back,poor positioning and the sending off was unnecessary.I agree with Benitez that they need to be more agressive away from home but that does not mean the players should lunge in with poor timed tackles!<br><br>On a whole,a tale of 2 halves.LFC played well in the 2nd half,inspired by Baros and Xabi Alonso.Let's hope they play like they did in the 2nd half more often. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">It's a game of 2 halves...and of 2 players - Diao and Alonso.  And it's been a while we came back fm 2 goals down.<br><br>1st half began poorly for both teams; but slowly, Fulham began to take control.  Our passings were poor, if not sloppy!  Frankly, the whole team was sloppy... but it was Diao who "stood up" for his numerous bad passes, one of which cost us the 1st goal.<br><br>The 2nd goal started fm a mix-up b/w him and Hamann...both going for the same player n ended up tackling each other to the grd.  By now, the Reds were dis-spirited and counting the minutes to the 1/2.<br><br>Thank goodness our prayers were answered in the 2nd-H.  Alonso came on n the whole team looked fired-up.  Lady luck blessed us with our early 1st goal.  A hit and hope attempt by Baros was deflected by a defender and flew beyond the reach of the so-far reliable Van de Sar.<br><br>Our saviour then created the 2nd with a great cross fm the left.  Garcia headed attempt was parried by the goalie only 4 Baros to react 1st and hit it home.   By then, we knew we cld go for the kill.  This was h/r dampened, albeit temporarily, by Josemi's 2nd yellow n sending off.<br><br>The 3rd goal came almost immediately fm a free-kick.  Alonso's curling attempt was helped by a wicked deflection fm a Fulham player and flew in the top-left-corner.  It's another stroke of luck...but we deserved it for pushing forward!<br><br>The last and sweetest goal might be late but by then, we were quite sure of the points.  Biscan came on with less than a minute of added-time.  Good work fm Cisse who won the ball in the middle and raced upfield.  Another sub - Warnock played a part by laying the ball back to Biscan who surprised everyone including the goalie by slicing it goal-wards...n the rest is history!<br><br>While the 1st-H was best forgotten, it was a spirirted display by the team in the 2nd-H.  We were still going forward even when we were 1-man down; the win was thoroughly deserved and the score cld've been better if Alonso had converted a free-sitter after his free-kick-goal.  Nevertheless, he's easily the best player of the nite...n more importantly, he has given us much hope for the future!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can't wait for gerrard to click with alonso. Then we'll probably have one of the best midfields in the premiership. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
