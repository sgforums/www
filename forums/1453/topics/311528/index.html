              <h1>
              <p>LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Liverpool could still have a say in the Premier League title race after rediscovering their form, manager Rafael Benitez said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Five consecutive league victories have strengthened Liverpool's grip on fourth place and home and away wins over Inter Milan in the Champions League have changed the mood at Anfield after their FA Cup defeat by Barnsley.</p>
              <p>They are eight points behind leaders Manchester United and Arsenal, but have still to play them both, starting with United at Old Trafford on Easter Sunday.</p>
              <p>'How near we finish to the top now will be interesting,' Benitez told the club's website on Tuesday. 'We have been criticised this season, but let us see where we are in three or four weeks.</p>
              <p>'We have important games and if we win them we will be a lot closer. If we can beat Manchester United we will be closer to the top, and that will give us more confidence.</p>
              <p>'If we beat Everton after that we will be closer still. Maybe, maybe we can be closer if we don't talk too much about it.'</p>
              <p>Liverpool have a daunting fixture list in the next few weeks. After United they face Everton at home in the Merseyside derby followed by three consecutive matches against Arsenal, two in the Champions League quarter-final with a league game sandwiched in between.</p>

              <h1>Torres vows to bring the title to Anfield after 17 years of waiting</h1>
              <p>Fernando Torres has pledged to fire Liverpool to the Premier League title.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez splashed out a club record £26.5m fee on Torres this summer.</p>
              <p>It left critics questioning whether the 23-year-old Spanish striker was overpriced and whether he could handle the physical demands of the Premiership.</p>
              <p>But Torres has been an instant success at Anfield, scoring three goals in his first four Premiership games to fire Benitez's men to the top of the table.</p>
              <p>Idol And Torres admits that he has taken delight in proving people wrong - and believes Liverpool can win the title this season.</p>
              <p>He told the Daily Mirror: "After I left Atletico Madrid I dreamed of days like I had against Derby. It was a magic Saturday and I know it is early but I have confidence we can carry on playing like this.</p>
              <p>"Scoring two goals at Anfield in the Premiership shows that I am ready for this big challenge.</p>
              <p>"Everything this summer, all the hard work in making the move happen has been proved worthwhile by games like this and I am so grateful to Liverpool and my team-mates.</p>
              <p>"My objective now is to be an idol at Liverpool and if I keep scoring goals like this then hopefully it will help me become a favourite for the fans.</p>
              <p>"I know that many people have doubted me because of the size of the transfer fee but my answer will always be with the goals I score.</p>
              <p>"That is the most important thing in the world, especially for me as a striker who feeds on goals.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to set a target but if I avoid injuries and stay in good form then I want a minimum of 15 goals.</p>
              <p>"That will be a good number for me in what will be a very hard first season in the Premiership."</p>
              <p>And while Torres has grabbed most of the headlines, it is another Spanish import, Alvaro Arbeloa who has impressed Benitez.</p>
              <p>The full-back has been the only ever present player at Liverpool this season, and Benitez said: "Arbeloa has done a great job for us so far.</p>
              <p>"He is a young, fit boy and he is only going to get better. He wasn't used to left-back but he has come in and performed very well."</p>

              <p>We need to beat all teams including MU , Arsenal and Everton to be closer to the title , and hoping MU , Everton and Everton on the ways slips .</p>
              <p>I am not hopeful , but Rafa gave me a lift after the interview .</p>
              <p>Miracles does happens .</p>
              <p>And Rafa is going to plot a miracle , like what he did at Valencia ! A miracle to the Barcelona and Real Madrid dominance hierachy in Spain .</p>
              <p>His timely lift will definitely bring the best out of the lads , and of course the supporters . !!</p>
              <p>He first must stick to the same 11's before they gets punctured la ......basket . </p>

              <p>Actually I have stated in one of my previous post that Liverpool might be able to win the EPL title this season judging from the tight schedule of Man Utd and Arsenal. (Chelsea is still relatively strong)</p>
              <p>But, the only person that can spoil the show is Ah Ben himself.</p>
              <p>I would rather he keep his big mouth shut and focus on getting the points and getting his team sheet proper.</p>
              <p>Once he become ya ya and start yakking nonsense, it would bring unnecessary pressure to the players.</p>
              <p>Maybe with a few match winning streak, he is getting too much air inside his head.</p>
              <p>As for Liverpool, we are still relying on the golden kid, Torres and the rest of the strikers are not in sync.</p>
              <p>We are weak at corners, man utd have scored too many goals against us during chaos when taking corners.</p>
              <p>We are not yet good enough to beat arsenal.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben is just silly and stupid to fall into the rollercoaster trap set up by the press again.</p>

              <p>Come to think of it ....</p>
              <p>Rafa is using one tactic from the famous ancient SunZhi's strategies .</p>
              <p>" Sound East hit West " ( sheng dong ji xi ) .</p>
              <p>I think Rafa already knew they have lost the title , football veteran in management , he should have knew , MU mathematically is almost there .</p>
              <p>He has an eye for the 2nd or 3rd .</p>
              <p>By saying Liverpool wanted the title , these pressured MU &amp; Chelsea to beat Arsenal ( both yet to face each other ) , plus a defeat to Liverpool , would condemn Arsenal to 4th instead .  </p>
              <p>From there , his next mind game will be on Chelsea .</p>
              <p>You all see la .</p>

              <p>To win the title does not depend on ONE or TWO players. Looking at how Liverpool play... they just lack the 'fire' to win the EPL title.</p>
              <p>They seem more keen with Champion's League</p>
