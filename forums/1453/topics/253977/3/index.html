            <div class='col-md body'>FOWLER: I HAD TO FIGHT BACK THE TEARS<br><br>Robbie Fowler admits he had to fight back the tears as he waved a final goodbye to the Anfield faithful on Sunday.<br><br>The goalscoring legend, whose contract is up in the summer, made his final appearance in front of the Kop during the 2-2 draw with Charlton.<br><br>"At the end, on the lap of honour when the fans were chanting my name, it was a bit of an emotional time but I did my best to keep the tears in," said the 32-year-old.<br><br>"With it being my last game at Anfield, I'd have loved to have scored but not everything goes to plan in football.<br><br>"I have had a good career at Liverpool and today I tried not to let things get on top of me - I think it worked. I felt I did all right."<br><br>Fowler, who Rafa Benitez made captain for the afternoon, missed out on a final day goal after being substituted in the dying moments.<br><br>His standing ovation had barely lapsed when Liverpool were awarded a penalty which Harry Kewell happily stepped up to convert.<br><br>"It's just one of those things," said Fowler. "The manager has been great and I can't thank him enough for giving me a chance by bringing me back to Liverpool.<br><br>"I know what he was doing in bringing me off and getting me a good ovation from the crowd.<br><br>"But as I've said before, things don't always go to plan in football. If I was on the pitch, I'd have taken the penalty, and if we'd have won the game, it would have been better.<br><br>"But with a bit of luck, I'll be involved in the Champions League final and we'll see what happens there."<br><br>Fowler wasn't given the chance to say goodbye when his first spell at Anfield ended with a move to Leeds United in November 2001.<br><br>The striker added: "I missed saying goodbye last time and I'm glad I could to do it this time. I'd have loved to have stayed but all good things come to an end.<br><br>"Thankfully I had a decent chance of saying goodbye. I've thanked the manager and the fans have been fantastic to me, in the first spell and probably just as good the second time around."<br><br>As for what's next for one of Liverpool's all-time greats, the man himself isn't yet sure.<br><br>"I've had no offers yet. We've got another game and I'm not too worried about what's happening in the future just now. I'm just focused on the next game and that's the main priority.<br><br>"I've not even thought about my future. The next game is massive for us. I want to focus on that, and whatever happens after that we'll see.<br>"I don't think many people could cope if the game against Milan goes to penalties but as long as Liverpool win, no matter how, then we'll all be happy."<br></div>
