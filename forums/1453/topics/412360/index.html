              <p>Liverpool manager <span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span> said the <span style="color: #000000;">2-1 defeat at home to Blackpool</span> was a disaster - but he will not accept his underperforming side are in a relegation battle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/1003/royhodgsonfrustration20101003_205x285.jpg" border="0" alt="Roy Hodgson" width="205" height="285"> </div>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Charlie Adam</span>'s penalty and <span style="color: #000000;">Luke Varney</span>'s perfectly-timed run and finish did the damage for the Premier League newcomers in the first half. Although <span style="color: #000000;">Sotirios Kyrgiakos</span>' header pulled one back Liverpool will spend the forthcoming international break rooted in the bottom three.</p>
              <p>They have won just one of their seven league matches - a 1-0 victory over West Brom at home - and are 18th with just six points.</p>
              <p>"I'd rather not think about it,'' was Hodgson's response to being asked about the game. "In the first half we were correctly punished for a lacklustre display. We had the ball as much as them but did not do anything with it anywhere near enough to satisfy my, the club's or the players' demands.</p>
              <p>"We conceded two goals on counter-attacks but in the second half we came out and tried to turn matters around but could only get one goal. Their great result is our nightmare result. It is a very bad day and there is nothing I can say.</p>
              <p>"At the moment things look bleak and really bad and it is difficult for me to put a bright face upon it. There are 31 games left but when you are in the relegation zone you are in a relegation battle.</p>
              <p>"But I really don't think my concerns are with relegation, my concerns are that we are not playing to our full potential. I am not going to think too much about relegation with 31 games to go.''</p>
              <p>If Hodgson was in any doubt that his honeymoon period is over just three months after taking over it came shortly before the end when the Kop began chanting the name of club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was overlooked somewhat dismissively for the manager's job when <span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez</span> left in the summer.</p>
              <p>"What's fair and unfair? There is no fairness. The fans are entitled to voice their frustrations, they are a frustrated group at the moment,'' he added. "I am the one responsible because I am the team manager. When the team does badly then the criticism is going to fall my way and I have to accept it.''</p>
              <p>Striker <span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span> was forced off with injury after just 10 minutes but Hodgson did not know the extent of the problem.</p>
              <p>"It is a groin strain, I don't know how severe,'' he said. "It came as a surprise to us, we had no awareness there were any problems in the groin area. I don't know if it was something which happened during the course of the game.''</p>
              <p>Blackpool manager <span style="color: #000000;">Ian Holloway</span> admitted the departure of Torres so early gave his side an unexpected boost.</p>
              <p>"To see the best striker in the world limp off after a few minutes, I can't tell you what that did for us,'' he said. "His mere presence is awesome so to see him come off played into our hands and helped us.''</p>
              <p>Holloway said it was one of the best days of his football career.</p>
              <p>"It is one of the dreams I've had for years,'' added the Seasiders boss, whose side were applauded off by the home fans. "When the fans were singing You'll Never Walk Alone - it's my dad's favourite song but he's no longer with me - I was singing myself and it was a bit emotional.</p>
              <p>"This is not far off the home of football - these supporters have seen some of the best football over the years and in my era as a player there was no better team in the world. The boys made me so proud and for that set of supporters to clap us off that is all I wanted - that was what my dream was last night.</p>
              <p>"This is a fantastic moment for Blackpool.''</p>

              <p>I am actually shocked that no british press ask for his head when there is a defeat.</p>
              <p>He should buck up with his formation before his dressing room is empty.</p>
              <p>Either the players are losting faith in his formation or their confidence.</p>

              <p>i don't believe the current situation is the manager's fault.. the squad is already fragmented.</p>
              <p>all the talks about the key players wanting to leave is not helping at all... in fact i thk it is causing the so called "not good enough" players to drift apart from the key players. the call for better players is also not exactly morale boosting for the rest of the squad.</p>
              <p>throw in the new signings who need time to gel and we hav a rather messy situation but no way they will be fighting against relegation.</p>

              <p>Personally i think it's Roy's fault. Yep you are also right in the sense that players are new and need time to gel in. But Roy's no newcomer, he should have seen pretty clearly that the team plays better with 2 man up front instead of having only torres lurking around the corner. we need more people up front instead of staying and trying to make defence the key.</p>
              <p>Not saying that we are defending good. Again, personally, i think we have the worst defence not in terms of skill, but communication and awareness of pitch in the whole EPL. look at how Johnson concede the penalty, look at how easy it is to lose skrtel in a 1 on 1, look at how Kyriakgos and Carragher lose to the pace of Philips yesterday?</p>
              <p>I'm making quite a good bet by saying that most Liverpool fans yesterday are frustrated as me, shouting at the TV over mistakes made by the players. Have anyone noticed our passing rate? Have anyone noticed our considerably high amount of chances compared to Blackpool? Have anyone noticed how other teams pressed for the balls when they are losing and how Liverpool DID NOT? Have anyone ever thought why do they always play high balls instead of keeping it on the ground seeing that hardly any high ball connects?<br><br>Of course i'm not saying Liverpool are bad, they have shown their ability in periods, but we need them to 'shine' from the 1st to the 90th minute, otherwise, a Europa League qualification would even be challenging. Oh, i thought we're gunning for the Champion League spot? With this kind of mangaging and playing style? Dream on i would say.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, i do hope Liverpool pick up their pace from now on..</p>

              <p>I am not a Liverpool fan but i am surprised by their recent form. A big club like Liverpool FC deserves a better showing from its manager and players. Their history is too big and huge for the current players to throw away. Languishing in the relegation zone is a disaster for them.</p>
              <p>They need to show their spirit and not let the supporters and ex-players down. Many fans support Liverpool and continue to do so even when the premier league title eluded them for so many years.</p>
              <p>I think the current players are lacking passion. The tactics can be wrong, the starting 11 can be wrong, the formation can be wrong, but the passion must be there. Right now, i dun see it in their eyes. </p>
              <p>The players must realise its a privilege to play for Liverpool. The shirt they are wearing, every matches they play, goes into the history books.</p>
              <p>They better buck up and show the footballing world that they are a force to be reckon with. I will be rooting for them.</p>
