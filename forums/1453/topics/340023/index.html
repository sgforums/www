              <p><strong>LIVERPOOL </strong>  <br><br><strong>Cavalieri: 6.0-</strong> Looked comfortable and composed between the posts tonight and had a good command of his penalty area.   <br><br><strong>Dossena: 6.0- </strong>The Italian left back put together a decent performance keeping the PSV attackers in front of him at all times.   <br><br><strong>Carragher: 7.0-</strong> The Liverpool captain earned his paycheque by keeping a close eye on Bakkal all evening long.   <br><br><strong>Agger: 7.0-</strong> Made a vital sliding clearance in the 20th minute and was an absolute rock at the back tonight   <br><br><strong>Arbeloa: 6.0-</strong> An eventful night for the Spanish defender as he almost received a red card and just about scored an own goal before being taken off in the second half.  <br><br><strong>Mascherano: 8.0-</strong> Was a bit unlucky when he attempted clearance hit Marcellis and fell to Lazovic but rebounded with a monstrous showing in the second half.   <br><br><strong>Lucas: 7.5-</strong> The much maligned Brazilian youngster was solid tonight and it was his superb set piece delivery that Babel met to level the match just before the end of the first half<br><br><strong>Riera: 7.0-</strong> Scored a highlight reel goal with a magnificent strike in the 69th minute   <br><br><strong>Babel: 7.5-</strong> The immensely talented Dutchman was the most dangerous player on the field and was rewarded with a goal just before the halftime whistle   <br><br><strong>Ngog: 7.0-</strong> Disappeared for long stretches of the match but popped up to score his first Liverpool goal with a cool finish in the 78th minute.   <br><br><strong>Keane: 6.0- </strong>Did not find the goal he was desperately looking for but did set up Ngog for one with a brilliant through ball which put the match to bed.   <br><br><strong>SUBS: Darby (69”) 6.0, Spearing (76”) 6.0, Kelly (81”) NA</strong>  </p>

              <p><strong>It's nice to read comments fm everyone after a good result; juz enjoy....</strong></p>

              <p><strong><strong>THE VERDICT (fm Liverpool.tv):</strong> </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The local paper</strong> <br>Living up to the inspirational ideology of one legendary Liverpool manager is one thing, surpassing the notable achievement of a second is quite another. Victory over a limited PSV Eindhoven side last night was enough to secure Liverpool's passage to the Champions League as group winners in keeping with Bill Shankly's old adage of first being first and second being nowhere. The Reds boss will be equally delighted to have surpassed Bob Paisley's club record of 39 wins in European competition on a night when Liverpool again delivered on a continental platform. <br><strong>Tony Barrett, Liverpool Echo</strong> <br>  <br><strong>The broadsheet</strong> <br>Top of the Premier League table and an impressive performance by his fringe players on the Champions League stage. It is safe to say the feel-good factor is awash at Anfield. Liverpool secured the result they desired in Eindhoven to finish top of their group and secure home advantage in the second leg of the last 16. Application, perspiration and inspiration will be needed over the remaining rounds if Liverpool are to win the European Cup for a sixth time. On their current form, only a fool would bet against them from doing it. <br><strong>The Telegraph</strong> <br>  <br><strong>The tabloid</strong> <br>Robbie Keane may have endured another goalless evening, yet his endeavour was unstinting. An extra layer of sheen was applied when Keane threaded a brilliant pass for David Ngog to score his first goal for the club and round off the victory after 77 minutes. Last season Keane was substituted here as Spurs were dumped out of the UEFA Cup on penalties. Now in Europe's premier competition he had at least been afforded a chance to aim for the stars. <br><strong>Paul Joyce, The Express</strong> <br>  <br><strong>The player</strong> <br>It was a great night for us. We got the right result, we were able to rest a few players, youngsters like Lucas and David Ngog played well and we saw three of our Academy lads come on which I'm sure will give everyone at the club a boost. <br><strong>Jamie Carragher</strong> <br>  <br><strong>The boss</strong> <br>We played very well and there are a lot of positive things to come out of this result. It's always easy to talk about Arbeloa, Carragher and Agger, but the whole team worked hard. And the last positive thing is seeing the three young lads come on to make their debuts. It is very good to have young players like Darby, Spearing and Kelly come on from the bench in the Champions League. <br><strong>Rafa Benitez</strong> <br>  <br><strong>The supporter</strong> <br>Congratulations to the team and to Rafa. We played really well in the second half and put some nice flowing moves together and scored some great goals. I thought Lucas was great and it was nice to see the young lads Jay Spearing, Stephen Darby and Martin Kelly get a chance. <br><strong>Lucas 21, LFC.TV Message Boards</strong></p>
