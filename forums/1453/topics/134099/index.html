            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From soccernet:</strong><br>UEFA spokesman William Gaillard today insisted European football's governing body had no plans to change the rules at the moment and allow Liverpool to defend their Champions League crown....<br><br>'The rules are what they are,' Gaillard said. 'They were used already once when Real Madrid won...... and actually were not among the qualifiers in the Spanish league.<br><br>'The Spanish FA told us they would replace the fourth-placed team - Real Zaragoza - with Real Madrid. It is a tough decision to make but it is not for us to make, it is for the FA and they told us Everton would be the fourth English club.<br><br>'Rules are rules and they were passed for a very good reason.'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>What's your say? Should UEFA change the rule to allow Liverpool to defend their title?<br><br>Personally, to be fair, I say... no  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>of course I would LOVE to see Liverpool defend their title esp based on what happened this morning, being the most incredible come back of Champion League history, we just have to be given the chance to defend this hard earn title BUT rules are rules and they are there for a reason. I don't think any fans would want their club to give up a chance at the Champion League.<br><br>We are keeping this cup in Anfield for good anyway...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Sports Ministry has got itself involved. Currently, it is int talks with Uefa. Can the decision of the FA be overruled?<br><br>A side note, it is not fair that SPL champs rangers have to go through the qualifiers to get to the UCL. This competition is meant for league champions, so why let the 3rd or 4th place teams enter? It only cheapens the value of the UCL. Allowing those who finish 3rd in the group stages into the 3rd round of the Uefa Cup is also bad for the smaller clubs.</div>
