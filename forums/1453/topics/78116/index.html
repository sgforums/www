            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we got the result we needed and it was a fairly encouraging display.  The opening half an hour saw a midfield ferocity that has been noticebly missing quite often this season.  They closed down, tackled and forced Middlesbro into errors.  They really looked like they were up for it and wanted it.  I think this was a major factor in giving us the initiative in the game and if we could get midfield performances like we did in the first half I think Liverpool would not be any where near what we are behind the leaders at the moment.<br><br>Saying that though, the standard of our crossing was quite poor and we suffered the usual problem of not getting men into the box.  Our counter attack is incredibly slow and we didnt get enough forward to support when we did go into counter attack.<br><br>We, once again, relied too much on the long ball to Owen and this tactic was frustrated by Owen's first touch on the ball which was often awful.  He dwelt on the ball too often as well and gave possession away.  I dont know why a world class striker seems to need half an hour on the ball.<br><br>Once we were 2-0 I think we could have done more but the usual defensive caution surfaced once again.  We laid back off them and gave them the ball alot more.  This is probably most frustrating off all.  I actually think this team has ability if they were allowed to be a little bit more adventureous.<br><br>Anyway, points in the bag.  So I reckon I'm happy (ish).<br><a href="http://www.kopcd.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.kopcd.co.uk</a></div>
