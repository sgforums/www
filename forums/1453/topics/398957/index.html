              <h1>Jamie Carragher: What really happened at 
              half-time in
                                      Istanbul</h1>
              <div><img src="http://images.icnetwork.co.uk/upl/icliverpool/feb2006/9/9/00076BAD-C805-13FE-81CC0C02AC1BF824.jpg" alt="Jamie Carragher celebrates with the supporters in Istanbul" width="200" height="244"></div>
              <p><em>AT half-time in the 2005 Champions League
               final in Istanbul,
                                      Jamie Carragher found himself staring into the 
              abyss.</em></p>
              <p>AC Milan had just produced a spell-binding 45
               minutes of
                                      football to leave Liverpool trailing by three 
              goals to nil.</p>
              <p>All hopes of winning a fifth European Cup had
               seemingly been
                                      extinguished as Carragher and his team-mates 
              walked into the
                                      dressing room for Rafa Benitez’s half-time team 
              talk.</p>
              <p>Here, in an exclusive extract from Carra: My 
              Autobiography,
                                      Carragher talks for the first time about what 
              exactly went on
                                      during that mythical 15 minutes and how 
              Benitez’s inspirational
                                      intervention helped change the course of 
              football history.</p>
              <p>PEOPLE ask what was going through my mind in 
              those moments
                                      before half-time.</p>
              <p>As I walked towards the dressing room, I was 
              suffering from a
                                      depressing combination of despondency and 
              humiliation.</p>
              <p>I couldn't bear to lift my head up and 
              glimpse the faces in the
                                      crowd, or the banners and red jerseys scattered 
              around the
                                      Ataturk.</p>
              <p>I looked towards the floor and saw nothing 
              but endless
                                      dejection. My dreams had turned to dust.</p>
              <p>I wasn't thinking about the game any more. My
               thoughts were with
                                      my family and friends. I was so sorry.</p>
              <p>Daft, seemingly trivial ideas scattered 
              themselves across my
                                      mind, such as 'What will everyone at home be 
              saying about
                                      this?'</p>
              <p>The thought of going home a laughing stock 
              disturbed me. It
                                      would have felt like the whole city, the whole 
              country, even the
                                      whole world was taking the mickey out of us.</p>
              <p>There was a sense of shame to go with my 
              sorrow. The Liverpool
                                      fans had taken over the stadium and there was 
              nothing we could do
                                      to make amends.</p>
              <p>I almost began to regret reaching the final. 
              All defeating Juve
                                      and Chelsea had achieved, it seemed, was to 
              allow AC Milan to
                                      outclass us and possibly secure the greatest 
              ever margin of victory
                                      in a European Cup final.</p>
              <p>They'd beaten Barcelona and Steaua Bucharest 
              4-0 in the 1994 and
                                      1989 finals, and now I feared we'd create 
              history for the wrong
                                      reasons, at the receiving end of a record 
              defeat, by five or six.
                                      Keeping it at 3-0 and at the very least 
              restoring some
                                      respectability was all that mattered to me now.</p>
              <p>Nothing was said by the players as we 
              returned to the dressing
                                      room. A mythical 15 minutes in the Liverpool 
              legend was upon us,
                                      but it didn't feel that way.</p>
              <p>The trickiest test in such circumstances is 
              ensuring you don't
                                      give up.</p>
              <p>It would have been easy for us to accept our 
              ambitions were in
                                      tatters, that nine months of toil were going to 
              end in
                                      catastrophe.</p>
              <p>Mentally we were all over the place, but I 
              knew it wasn't in my
                                      nature to accept this fate. No matter how bad it
               was, we were going
                                      to have to face up to our responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, there was at least one sane head
               in the room
                                      prepared to restore our battered spirits.</p>
              <p>In that Ataturk dressing room Rafa Benitez 
              cemented his place in
                                      Anfield folklore.</p>
              <p>My admiration for his handling of the 
              situation is unlimited.
                                      Rafa's conduct rarely changed, regardless of the
               circumstances. His
                                      calm demeanour was never required more than now.</p>
              <p>Privately, he must have felt the same as us. 
              He too couldn't
                                      have failed to think about his family, or what 
              the people of Spain
                                      would be making of his side's battering.</p>
              <p>Here he was, still struggling with his 
              English, trying to
                                      instruct us to achieve the impossible.</p>
              <p>“Good luck,” I thought to myself.</p>
              <p>He showed few signs of emotion as he 
              explained his changes, but
                                      the speed with which he made a series of 
              tactical switches showed
                                      how sharp he still was.</p>
              <p>First, he told Traore to get into the shower.
               That was the
                                      polite code for telling a player he's being 
              subbed.</p>
              <p>Djibril Cisse was told he'd be coming on to 
              play on the right
                                      side and was already getting kitted out.</p>
              <p>As Djimi removed his shirt, an argument was 
              brewing between
                                      Steve Finnan and our physio Dave Galley. Finnan 
              had damaged a groin
                                      and Dave told Rafa he thought he should be 
              subbed.</p>
              <p>Finn was distraught and pleaded to stay on. 
              Rafa wouldn't
                                      budge.</p>
              <p>“We've only two subs left because we've 
              already lost Kewell with
                                      an injury,” he explained. “I can't afford to 
              make two now, and if
                                      you stay on I've lost my last sub.”</p>
              <p>Traore was told to put his kit back on.</p>
              <p>Then, as if struck by a moment of clarity, 
              Benitez made an
                                      abrupt decision.</p>
              <p>“Hamann will replace Finnan and we'll play 
              3-5-2,” he explained,
                                      displaying an assured conviction in his voice 
              which, temporarily at
                                      least, gave me confidence.</p>
              <p>“Pirlo is running the game from midfield, so I
               want Luis and
                                      Stevie to play around him and outnumber them in 
              the middle so he
                                      can't pass the ball.”</p>
              <p>The swiftness of this decision confirmed to 
              me he may have
                                      considered this formation earlier. The same 
              set-up had worked in
                                      Turin, although that had been a purely defensive
               strategy.</p>
              <p>“OK,” part of me was thinking, “forty-five 
              minutes too late, but
                                      we got there in the end.” Given the 
              circumstances, it was still a
                                      brave move.</p>
              <p>With both Cisse and Hamann now preparing to 
              come on, there was
                                      only one problem.</p>
              <p>“Rafa, I think we've 12 players out there 
              now.”</p>
              <p>Djibril would have to wait a while longer for
               his
                                      introduction.</p>
              <p>When we emerged from our desolate dressing 
              room, I wasn't
                                      encouraged by the look of steely determination 
              on the face of
                                      Maldini as he led his side back out.</p>
              <p>There were claims after the match of 
              premature celebrations in
                                      the Milan camp at half-time.</p>
              <p>I was upset on their behalf by that pack of 
              lies. Traore gave an
                                      interview after the game suggesting the Italians
               were cocky at 3-0,
                                      but I think he was naive in his answers and it 
              was twirled into a
                                      fairy story by the newspapers.</p>
              <p>It simply didn't happen. Milan were far too 
              professional for
                                      that. There was no way their captain, with all 
              his experience, was
                                      going to allow anyone in his dressing room to 
              take victory for
                                      granted.</p>
              <p>Nothing I saw suggested Milan were already 
              popping champagne. I
                                      have too much respect for them even to suggest 
              it.</p>
              <p>Even if they did, privately, believe they had
               both hands on the
                                      cup, who could blame them?</p>
              <p>As I headed back into the arena, I was sure 
              Milan were going to
                                      win, so were the forty thousand Scousers in 
              Istanbul, so why
                                      shouldn't they have believed it?</p>
              <p>I could hear “You'll Never Walk Alone” in the
               distance, and as I
                                      exited the tunnel it grew louder. It wasn't the 
              usual version of
                                      our anthem, though.</p>
              <p>There are different moments when The Kop 
              summons Gerry Marsden's
                                      classic. Before every home game it's a deafening
               rallying cry, as
                                      if to inspire us to perform and frighten our 
              opponents into
                                      submission.</p>
              <p>If we're winning in the closing stages of a 
              huge match, it will
                                      be sung again, this time in celebration.</p>
              <p>But there are other occasions the words of 
              the song have greater
                                      meaning, and at half-time in Istanbul the fans 
              were singing it in
                                      sympathy more than belief.</p>
              <p>There was a slow, sad sound to it, almost as 
              if it was being
                                      sung as a hymn. The fans were certainly praying 
              on our behalf.</p>
              <p>To me, it was the supporters' way of saying, 
              “We're still proud
                                      of what you've done, we're still with you, so 
              don't let your heads
                                      drop.”</p>
              <p>There was probably a hint of a warning in 
              there too, as the walk
                                      back to my position felt like a guilt trip: 
              “Don't let us down any
                                      more than you already have.”</p>
              <p>Our coach Alex Miller's final instructions at
               half time were for
                                      us to “score a goal for those fans”.</p>
              <p>That was the mindset we had. Get one and 
              pride might be
                                      restored.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>*This was what Mr. Rafael thought and did during half-time.</em></span></p>
              <p>"I walked into the dressing room rehearsing what I was going to say 
              to them but also how I was going to say it," he said. "It's really 
              difficult to come up with all the things you want to say in a foreign 
              language. I was trying to find the right English words.</p>
              <p>"We talked about what we were going to change. It's tough enough 
              motivating a team which is losing 3-0 in Spanish. In English, it is 
              much, much tougher.</p>
              <p>"But the words came more easily than I could ever have hoped. The 
              important aspect was to lift their spirits.</p>
              <p>"I started with a motivational speech to get them fired up. I 
              demanded they start working again and emphasised there were 45 minutes 
              left and we had to come off the pitch proud of ourselves because we'd 
              done everything in our power.</p>
              <p>"So I reminded them it had been a hard battle to reach such a 
              massive game and that we owed something important to all the Liverpool 
              people. I said if we scored we would totally change the course of the 
              game. I emphasised it was the most important challenge.</p>
              <p>"I said: 'Don't let your heads drop. We're Liverpool. You're playing
               for Liverpool. Don't forget that. You have to hold your heads high for 
              the supporters. You have to do it for them.</p>
              <p>'You can't call yourselves Liverpool players if you have your heads 
              down. If we create a few chances we have the possibility of getting back
               into this. Believe you can do it and you will. Give yourself the chance
               to be heroes'."</p>
              <p>It was a chance that was gloriously, unforgettably taken and Benitez
               broke open the secrets of his finest moment in A Season On The Brink, a
               new authorised account of his first term at Anfield, by distinguished 
              Spanish journalist Guillem Balague.</p>
              <p>But the Liverpool chief told how even after he had given the 
              exhortation that changed everything, his plans were enmeshed in a few 
              minutes of sheer chaos.</p>
              <p>Benitez wanted to introduce Didi Hamann and told Djimi Traore he was
               coming off - but then learned Steve Finnan's injury was too bad for him
               to continue.</p>
              <p>Benitez added: "I started to write the new formation on the board. I
               told Traore to get changed and that Hamann was coming on for him. The 
              idea was for Hamann to make Kaka's life much tougher.</p>
              <p>"I took Didi up to the whiteboard so he understood what I wanted and
               explained the tactical changes to the rest of the side. Then I was told
               Finnan was injured.</p>
