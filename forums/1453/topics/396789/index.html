              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Cautious: Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Rafa Benitez gave
              a cautious welcome
              to a potential change
              of ownership at
              Anfield yesterday
              and revealed he wants
              urgent talks with new
              chairman Martin
              Broughton.</p>
              <p>After being installed to supervise
              the eagerly awaited end of Tom
              Hicks’s and George Gillett’s Liverpool
              reign, Broughton sought to
              reassure Benitez over his future
              and made a bold pledge that transfer
              funds would be available.</p>
              <p>With a £16million, four-year
              contract awaiting his signature at
              Juventus, the Liverpool manager
              intends putting both issues to the
              test in the next few days.</p>
              <p>‘I have not met the new chairman
              yet or spoken to him, but I will,’ he
              said.</p>
              <p>‘I don’t know exactly when,
              but it will be sooner rather than
              later, because it is important for a
              manager and chairman to talk.</p>
              <p>‘It is clear we have to get 
              together
              and talk about everything. It is
              normal to want to cover all
              subjects and it can be good to have
              just one person on hand to answer
              all your questions.</p>
              <p>‘I don’t know whether money will
              be available at the end of the
              season. I don’t know his agenda yet but I hope that is the case and it 
              is
              something that will be part of our
              conversation.</p>
              <p>'If he has said he
              wants me to stay and there will be
              money, that is good. But I need to
              meet him to find out.’</p>
              <p>Benitez produced a plate of cakes
              and pastries to mark his 50th
              birthday and was in a jovial mood
              as he smiled: ‘I’m an old man now
              — it’s official.’ </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/16/article-0-092914FE000005DC-532_468x305.jpg" alt="George Gillett (L) and Tom Hicks " width="468" height="305">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Selling up: George Gillett (L) and Tom Hicks </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>It could almost have been an
              unintentional admission that
              working for Hicks and Gillett had
              put years on him, but he was wary
              of celebrating the end of a troubled
              chapter, just as he remained
              guarded about Juve’s efforts to
              prise him away.</p>
              <p>Mindful there could be a long gap
              between confirming the arrival of
              Broughton and Barclays Capital
              and bidding farewell to Hicks and
              Gillett, Benitez said: ‘Always, we
              have to be positive and believe
              things will improve.</p>
              <p>'I would like to
              think it is true when people say this
              is good news, but my experience is
              that it is better to wait and see.</p>
              <p>‘All our fans agree that 
              we need to
              see signs of progress. There has
              been talk of new investment for a
              while but now there is one person
              everything can be channelled
              through.</p>
              <p>'When I sit down with him,
              I will explain my ideas and see if we
              can go forward quickly.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/16/article-0-0928773C000005DC-376_306x423.jpg" alt="Martin Broughton" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In the hotseat: Martin Broughton</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>‘Everyone sees this as a step in the right direction but the next
              stage must be completed as quickly
              as possible. Stability is always a
              key word in any business, and
              football is no different.</p>
              <p>'It would
              help us all if a satisfactory
              conclusion can be reached soon.’</p>
              <p>Asked if he would be dishing
               out
              slices of birthday cake at Melwood
              in 12 months’ time, Benitez gave a
              knowing grin and said: ‘Hopefully, I
              will still be here on Monday when
              we play West Ham.</p>
              <p>'I don’t want to
              say too much about my future,
              because there has been a lot of
              speculation already.</p>
              <p>‘My agent is supposed to have
              made an admission in a Spanish
              paper (about meeting Juventus
              officials). But if you talk about the
              press here or in Spain or Italy, they
              are not always the same.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes things are said that are
              not true. Even if there were quotes,
              you cannot always believe them.</p>
              <p>‘I wanted to be Liverpool
              manager in the past, and I still
              want to be. I actually want to manage
              until I’m 70 or even 80. Where?
              You never know in football.’</p>
              <p>Chelsea fan Broughton, who
              admitted horse-racing was his
              main sporting passion, backed
              Benitez and insisted there would
              be no cashing in on Steven Gerrard
              or Fernando Torres at the end of
              the season.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/16/article-0-0866A19E000005DC-852_306x423.jpg" alt="Fernando Torres " width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Staying? Fernando Torres </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>He said: ‘I can’t see any
              reason for any forced sales. In fact,
              there will be money available for
              transfers, though I am not going
              into how much.</p>
              <p>‘What’s best now is for somebody
              or bodies to come in and build the
              new stadium, make sure the club is
              properly financed and that there is
              enough money available to take the
              club forward.</p>
              <p>'I have looked at the
              stadium project, and any buyer
              would be crazy not to proceed with
              it. Any bid wouldn’t be a winning
              one without that commitment.’</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett paid around
              £220m for Liverpool in 2007 and
              initially set an asking price of
              £500m, which now looks like having
              to be lowered.</p>
              <p>Broughton insisted there was no
              deadline for repaying £100m of the
              club’s £237m debt and that RBS
              were prepared to wait for the sale
              to go through.</p>
              <p>He said the Americans
              were seeking a ‘reasonable
              price’ and added: ‘Rafa is a good
              manager. We want him to stay and
              he’s under contract.’</p>
              <p>Torres is still waiting to return to
              Spain for a verdict on his knee
              injury after flights were grounded,
              because of the Icelandic volcano.</p>
