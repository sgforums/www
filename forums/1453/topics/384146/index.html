              <div>So there I was looking at who got third place and might be interesting opposition for us in the Europa League, when Jamie Redknap starts talking about how two CSKA Moscow players tested positive for drugs in their last CL game and how if UEFA follow through on their own rules, CSKA would be thrown out the CL.</div>
              <div>Apparently, if one player tests positive the punishment goes on the player, if two (and only two from each side are tested) the punishment goes on the club. Any decsion would be made the day before the CL and Europa League draw.<br><br>He then asks "If UEFA have the guts to kick CSKA out, who would go in to replace CSKA. Should it be Wolfsburg (3rd in the same group) or the best placed 3rd place runner up. <br><br>Out of interest I checked who this would be. Juve have 8 points, Marseille 7 but both have played all six games. We would therefore be in pole position on 7 points and would finsh highest third place on 10 points if we beat Fiorentina at Anfield tomorrow. <br><br>What do you think. Gary Macillister thought it was only right Wolfsburg go through and as I recall Ruud Houllett and Redknap either said little or seemed to agree with Gary Mac. No one mentioned it as a back door for Liverpool.<br><br>What if we did end up going through like that? Personally, I would feel more than a tad embarrassed - but then after I had got over that ....</div>
              <div><br>I could feel its due process (like a refs decsion out of our hands) and we would have got the highest points total for 3rd place so we have a just case. I would be happietr if we could offer to play Wolfsburg in a winner takes all game on neutral ground. Why not it would be fair and fun!</div>
              <div><br>But even better would be seeing the faces of the Mancs and the Chavs (Real Madrid too) as we literally rise up from beyond the grave. They would be quacking in their boots that with that sort of luck we would go on to win the trophy. Depedning on the run in - it might even eclipse Istanbul. <br><br>It could'nt happen of course, could it?</div>
