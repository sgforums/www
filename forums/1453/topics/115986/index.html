            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool have been giving all the gamblers and fans some major heartattack with their inconsistent display of football.<br><br>Now, no one is starting any pre-match prediction in this forum any more.<br><br>For the past few matches, after the saints victory over the Reds, all the teams playing Liverpool are deploying a 1-5-4 formation.<br><br>The reason is simple.<br><br>Liverpool's approach to the game is alway through the central path and lacking in wing play.<br><br>So, just plant lots of players in front of goal and you can stop Liverpool.<br><br>Two of the goals scored yesterday was from wing play and that is an rare occassion.<br><br>Biscan started out for Liverpool yesterday but he was unable to plug the hole in the mid-field and letting opponents going past him.<br><br>Only when Didi substituted Biscan, the stability is there.<br><br>Gerrard was in the mood to play yesterday and was all around the field and at times leaving a gap in the midfield area when he move too forward.<br><br>Despite certain weakness that is exsistant in the present team, the team have gradually becoming to believe themselves and have dug deep to produce this deserving victory.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , most important is we got the 3 points. The performance to be frank was not very convincing especially with the shakey defence. Luckily for us, Fulham was wasteful with a couple of their chances, if they have put those chances in, the result would have been very different. Rafael needs to work on the defence, you cant defend like that especially playing in CL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Stevie G's first half were terrible last night i thought ?<br><br>Because of Garcia's and SG's lack of communication on the pitch , it caused us Andy Cole's equaliser .<br><br>I thought he should chase after the loose ball instead of staring at Garcia ?<br><br>Nando's first Anfield goal was a World Class header hor ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Long time never see L'pool score like that .<br><br>2nd goal : That SG's free-kick reminded me of Damien Duff's free-kick for Chelsea that kicked MU out of Carling Cup Final . I thought that goal should be credited to SG , not Hyypia .<br><br>Also Murphy ever took like that and scored once too.<br><br>L'pool's third is like sky-drop for Baros to score , even Baros also stunned by the rare &amp; sudden opportunity. Well done Traore for winning that loose ball , and Morientes' slip to Riise , a well set-up goal !<br><br>Well done to Fulham , they did gave us plenty of problems upfront with Boa Morte , Cole and Radzcinski !<br><br>Why did our defense so loose last night huh ???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hate the look of garcia's "alamak!" look everytime he loses possession. he seem to be too lightweight and liverpool always lose possesion thru him. sigh... hopefully he start to get better coz the cross he delivered for morientes's goal was top class too! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
