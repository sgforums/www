            <div class='col-md body'>Well ..... it's a massive gamble for Rafa .<br><br>Massive in a sense , Garcia is proven to be an important goal scorer , always tends to score important goals when we needed it most , but now ..... Who can guarantee me Torres can adept to the English games in his first season ?<br><br>And we are talking about scoring important goals ?<br><br>The feeling really sucks man ..... Rafa can be quite brutal , a player in the mode of Garcia , always claimed to be his favourite son in Liverpool , can be sold to Athletico just like that !!!<br><br>Anyway .... Let's hope those new boys from Bulgaria , Brazil , can be handful for us at the absence of Garcia .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

Just went to atletico website and saw garcia in their 07/08 squad. I really hope rafa will add a creative player this summer.<br>On a side note, atletico website is filled with flash, looks nice but the loading time abit long... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He has talent and the skills to change a game. When you are at home the opponents play deep and there is not much space, but he can change this.<br><br>"We missed him in the last six months. In some games I thought: maybe if we had Luis today it would be different."<br><br>On why the time had come for Garcia to move on, Benitez added: "He was happy here but Atletico is a good club for him.<br><br>"It was the right time, because after three years maybe the situation was different. He wanted to play every game and that's not easy <strong>when we have other players coming here.</strong> This was a very good solution for him and also for us."</blockquote>somehow, i sensed that rafa has someone to replace him</div>
