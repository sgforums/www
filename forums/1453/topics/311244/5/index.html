              <p>sianz......turn off tv after 0-3 down.....although masch did liverpool in with his red, but i think the ref cocked up a bit with his early decisions. big matches like this and you make a few dubious calls early and it set the tone. players are all psyched up and this will blow the fuse of a couple who felt wronged. masch blew up. i hope he will learn from it to see it from the team's point of view. he's a critical piece of the liverpool's core, and losing him with 10men against Man U is a losing proposition.</p>

              <p>i actually thought pepe was very jittery. prior to the first goal, he almost push the ball into his own net. when ronaldo scores, i think he's at fault too. when a keeper commits out, he must get the ball. nani's 3rd was unstoppable....</p>
              <p>well, he did actually saved a couple of 1-on-1, but still, i think reina could have done better on the 1st and 3rd goal.</p>
              <p>i think most liverpool players were off form today. </p>

              <p>i actually thought pepe was very jittery. prior to the first goal, he almost push the ball into his own net. when ronaldo scores, i think he's at fault too. when a keeper commits out, he must get the ball. nani's 3rd was unstoppable....</p>
              <p>well, he did actually saved a couple of 1-on-1, but still, i think reina could have done better on the 1st and 3rd goal.</p>
              <p>i think most liverpool players were off form today. </p>

              <p>Well, true true... he was but when you look around the whole Pool team today, You can't fine a better performer than him. Where was Gerrard? and Torres... So much was said about him before the match... But in the end, I don't recall him getting a shot at United's goal at all... That why i say Reina don't deserve to be the fall-guy.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just my thought lah... Pool fans may think differently...</p>

              <p>i think the red card played a big part. u cannot play man u 10 men at old trafford. i was actually quietly confident that liverpool can edge out a victory prior to the kick-off.</p>
              <p>at this stage of the league, rafa has got to plot for a win. i don't think he pick the team to draw. i still think the liverpool lads was not at their best.</p>
