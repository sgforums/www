              <p>Man Utd ...recent years , has been getting quite a handful of positive results from us .</p>
              <p>Our previous problem , we lacking a winger , and has been relying alot on Gerrard on both wings . even with the inclusion of Pennant , we still yet to register any victory over MU .</p>
              <p>I remember when RVN was with them , they kept exposing the lacking of pace against Hyypia , and won ! By o couple of penalties  . Well we can say RVN jelly legs a bit .</p>
              <p>Then the next two games , they kept exposing our impotence in the air , played the likes of Rio Ferdinand , John O'Shea inside the box , and won !</p>
              <p>Now with the inclusion of Torres and Skrtel , we might as well sent the team against Inter to Old Trafford ?</p>
              <p>If i am Rafa , i would not want a win against MU @ OT , which is very difficult .</p>
              <p>I will sent a defensive Great Wall to OT , which u saw against Inter .</p>
              <p>Draw !!!</p>

              <p>We do have an advantage  .</p>
              <p>Do u know ?</p>
              <p>Man Utd will have to play 3 match in a week , and against us , it's their 3rd match ? For 1st against Derby last Saturday</p>
              <p>Wednesday they will have a crunch match against struggling Bolton . Their advantage was at home , but MU and Bolton , not very far for Bolton , Bolton will give them a fight , and this match could well be a test for MU .</p>
              <p>Against Liverpool , if they can still manage to grap 3 points from us , aftre playing 2 matches , hats off to them , they fully deserve to be crown Champion , if Gunners slips more .</p>
              <p>All i can say , no team is so charitable to grant a smooth passage for Man Utd . They have to fight for the Title .</p>

              <p>Q&amp;A with Rafa Benitez (ESPNsoccernet)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rafa, this is a huge game this weekend against Man United - what does it mean for Liverpool fans?</p>
              <p>I think it's really important for all of us. For the staff, players and supporters. Everybody's watching this game as one of the most important during the season.
              
              Empics
              Benitez is yet to record a Premier League victory over Manchester United and Sir Alex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What does it mean to play against a team like Manchester United?</p>
              <p>I think it's a good team with a lot of players with qualities so you must be aware of all of them. Sometimes you play against a team and they have two or three good players but United, the majority of them are top class players so you really need to concentrate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who is the biggest threat?</p>
              <p>You can talk about Rooney, Tevez, Ronaldo, Giggs - all of them they are really good players.
              After losing against Barnsley in the FA Cup you have won 7 in a row.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What has changed?</p>
              <p>I think that the team needed to win, and sometimes when you win confidence is high so I think that was the key. We started playing well again and taking our chances. Because against Barnsely we had a lot of chances to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What changed in the mood of the team?</p>
              <p>The atmosphere is really good because we are winning and winning and playing well. If you can keep winning, the people are happier and easier to approach in this game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How important was the game at Anfield against Inter in regaining that mentality?</p>
              <p>It was really important - we knew that Inter Milan was at the top of the table, one of the best teams in Europe so it was really important to show that we could beat them or anyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it by design that your team starts to play at the highest level at this part of the season?</p>
              <p>I think it was important beacuse we were changing some players and we changed also the position of some players. And the understanding was so good that they started playing really well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo - is the key to the Red Devils?</p>
              <p>Yeah, I think so. I think he is a player that can beat players, is quick so is always a threat for the other teams. Yeah I think one of the key players is Ronaldo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you halt Ronaldo?</p>
              <p>You know, if you want to stop players like Ronaldo you need to work really hard as a team, that's the idea.
              We'll try to do the same things that we were doing before but against United, the key is to control four or five players, it's not just one or two. So it's more difficult, you need to work hard as a team.</p>

              <p>Rio Ferdinand is doubtful for Manchester United's clash with Liverpool on Sunday but Edwin van der Sar could feature.</p>
              <p>The pair have both missed United's last two matches, defender Ferdinand with a back problem and goalkeeper Van der Sar with a groin injury.</p>
              <p>Manager Sir Alex Ferguson was due to assess both players in training on Friday, along with striker Louis Saha.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman sustained a knock in Wednesday's defeat of Bolton but is expected to be fit.</p>
              <p>Spanish defender Gerard Pique could continue in Ferdinand's absence.</p>
              <p>England full-back Gary Neville, who has been out for a year with groin and ankle problems, is close to a return after another run-out for the reserves on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is relishing the prospect of another ferocious battle with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's side face a stern test of their title ambitions as their great rivals visit Old Trafford on the back of seven straight wins.</p>
              <p>No love is ever lost between the two teams and this time, with just eight matches remaining, the stakes are high for both clubs.</p>
              <p>United will hope to score a psychological blow ahead of the clash between closest challengers Arsenal and Chelsea later in the day while Liverpool are keen to cement their grip on fourth place.</p>
              <p>On the face of it, Ferguson could be forgiven for wishing for more modest opponents than their fellow Champions League quarter-finalists, but the Scot insists he would have it no other way.</p>
              <p>"We have got a big game, a massive game - I enjoy the madness of it. I love the Liverpool games and the players do,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"They'll be anticipating a really difficult game, but they are the games you want to be playing in.''</p>
              <p>Key to Liverpool's hopes will be Fernando Torres, the in-form striker who has scored 10 goals in his last eight matches and 27 in total this season.</p>
              <p>Torres was once a target for Ferguson before Liverpool prised him away from Atletico Madrid and the United boss is well aware of the danger he poses.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "For a first season in the premier division, he has to be very pleased with that. I'm sure Rafa's delighted with that return.</p>
              <p>"I don't think he came here with any great doubts - he had a good record in Spain and is a Spanish international.''
              The meeting of Torres and United's star attraction Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 33 goals this season, has been much hyped.
              Ferguson said of the match-up: "It doesn't concern me at all.
              "I'm only concerned about one player, and that's our man. I don't pay attention to these things.''
              Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has no new injury worries ahead.
              Defender Daniel Agger is still out, having had a third operation on a broken metatarsal earlier this week. Benitez does not expect his return until next season.
              Harry Kewell will captain Australia this weekend in Singapore, and although the midfielder has talked of still fighting for a new contract it seems likely now that he will leave Anfield this summer.
              Benitez could field an unchanged side at Old Trafford, although he may use the experienced John Arne Riise in midfield ahead of Ryan Babel.
              Defender Jamie Carragher believes the goalscoring double act of Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard can cut United down to size.
              The tough defender will be at the heart of Liverpool's attempts to halt the free-scoring Cristiano Ronaldo and co - but he has great confidence in the Anfield club's 46-goal scoring duo.
              "When you put great players together, you get results. Torres and Gerrard are certainly that, they are both very clever on the pitch,'' said Carragher.
              "Torres stretches defences and Gerrard gets into the hole behind; Stevie then is able to produce the passes for Fernando to run on to.
              "It is not something we work on too much in training, it is just two top players getting together and the combination works.''
              Carragher concedes Liverpool can only be seriously considered as a challenger for fourth place now and is aware they must continue their run of victories - which now stands at seven - if they are going to hold off Everton.
              "Fourth place is obviously the aim now. We have to stay there, even if we know Everton are right in behind us,'' he added.
              "They have had a great season and they are the main danger. They will look at how many games we have got left and believe we will drop points over the next few weeks.
              "We have Manchester United and Arsenal away, and Everton at home in our next three league matches.
              "We will see after those next three games where both teams are, but I expect it to be neck and neck right to the end of the season now.''</p>
