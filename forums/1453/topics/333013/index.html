              <td class="med" colspan="2" width="487" valign="top"><br>Liverpool have enjoyed their best ever start to a Premier League season, beating Manchester United and Everton before Sunday's remarkable turnaround at City. <br>  <br>The Reds are level with Chelsea at the top of the table during the international break but Benitez, whose side were unbeaten in the league at this stage last term, is keen to manage expectations. <br>  <br>"It's important to send the right messages," the boss told Liverpoolfc.tv. "We have a long, long way to go. We have to do things properly both now, in one month's time and in three months' time. <br>  <br>"We can have a lot of confidence in ourselves but we must keep our feet on the ground. <br>  <br>"We (the squad) were talking about this before, although we can enjoy being at the top of the table. But the players know we must keep going until the end. You can't win a title now – you can only win it at the end of the season." <br>  <br>The City turnaround was the fourth occasion Liverpool have come from behind this season, with Marseille, Middlesbrough and Man Utd all defeated after taking the lead. <br>  <br>While Benitez is delighted with the mental toughness being displayed, he's keen for the Reds to start dominating games from the first whistle – if only for his health. <br>  <br>"If I had to decide between a game like City and a simple 2-0, I'd always choose 2-0. That would be better for my heart!" joked the Spaniard, whose side have scored just one first-half goal in the league this season – and that was a Wes Brown OG. <br>  <br>"It's very positive that we are scoring a lot of goals in the second half but also dangerous. We need to change it, start scoring in the first half and have some easier games. Having said that, when you can come back like we have, that is very pleasing."</td>
