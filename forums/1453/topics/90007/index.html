            <div class='col-md body'>hello bobo + redsy. out from hibernation thx to the souness news  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>anyway i dont think any club would want an alan shearer. just imagine, the last 2 nufc manager were sacked after he was dropped. i'm not saying that shearer isnt a great player, but he's definitely somebody who is bigger than the club. dont think he'll be that anywhere else other than nufc. and sir bobby isnt a novice like gullit. he's managed primadonnas eg. romario, gazza, ronaldo etc. apparently there's something about shearer that you and i dont know. it's too coincidental (the sackings). wonder if souness will drop him since he's been known as a disciplinarian and has the gut to drop and even sell the so called star players (duff &amp; dunn).<br><br>act. i have mixed feelings abt shearer after the sacking of sir bobby. on one hand, this is the player that has been the symbol of nufc since keegan management. on the other hand, he's the cause of the dismissal of one of my favorite managers of all time. sir bobby may not have the best tactics, but he certainly had the charisma &amp; personality of a well-liked manager. am touched when he thanked both his parents and talked about them when he rcv his knighthood (from the nufc subscription tv online). what an honorable man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3 wins in a row is not bad at all. hope that the team gets a grip on what they should be doing. but i'm still not convinced by the appointment of souness.<br><br>not sure if they are rebuilding or taking a step back. one criteria for rebuilding a side is of course a good manager, and i dont really see that in souness. may be he'll be a one season wonder just like dave moyes' first season in everton or burley's ipswich debut season in the prem league. but as they always say, only time is the ultimate test for that (ok that is translated from a chinese proverb)<br><br>nufc is a big enough club. they have the $ from the woody transfer. hopefully souey doesnt screw it up in the january transfer window. we dont need to be like leicester or bolton in signing all the old &amp; free players. we need to sign class players to play at the back. we have enough crap in bramble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">There's still 3 months or so before the Jan transfer window opens , now it's good time for Souey to assess the team , and with the promised money , GS will definitely signed a couple of players in for defense , which is quite pathetic for me !<br><br>Yes , a recognised central defender , but who ? Not much available leh !<br><br>Souey might go for Australians !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Who knows he get that Aussie fella from Rovers that broke the legs of Carragher and Baros !</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lucas neill i think. better stay away from him. nufc may be called a declining team, or a weaker team, but pls dont make them a cheater. anyway, the look on souness' face after the game is classic. hahah. i guess he's mocking the southampton fans since he had a bad experience there. and his blackburn lost to them due to a 90-min penalty earlier in the season.<br><br>or may be he's doing that gesture to prove to the toon fans who doubted him. sure that's a gd motivation to have. i can admit that i am one of the doubters, am still one now. but who knows, this may be a blessing in disguise for the club. remember when arsenal brought in their manager, people were asking, "arsene who??"</div>
