            <div class='col-md body'>The players of Aston Villa have made a public statement to voice their disgust at the way chairman Doug Ellis is running the club.<br><br>Liverpool fans have wanted to see more money invested at Anfield for some time but spare a thought for this lot!<br><br>The statement issued by the players said: "People talk about Aston Villa being a big club and winning the European Cup in 1982.<br><br>"We feel it should be a big club but if the chairman has got ambition, he needs to start showing it. It has to come from the top.<br><br>"So many other clubs are doing so much to show their ambition apart from us. As players we're all ambitious and we want to improve on last season.<br><br>"The chairman should be behind the club and not working against what we're trying to achieve. There have been a series of cutbacks and we feel we have to mention this because they are now starting to affect us.<br><br>"At the end of last season, the chairman refused to pay Â£300 for the pitches to be watered. The training ground development, which we were all looking forward to working in, has stopped.<br><br>"Now we have lost a masseur because the club refuse to pay for one and are clubbing together to pay for our own.<br><br>"We have also heard that the physio, who was on his way to see Martin Laursen, could not claim back for a cup of coffee at the airport.<br><br>"We've had no explanation for the cutbacks and we feel if the manager (David O'Leary) can't get one, then we have no chance.<br><br>"Maybe the chairman thought he would have left by now because of the takeover. Supporters are concerned with what happens on the pitch and rightly so.<br><br>"But we feel with all the cutbacks, it is difficult to attain the targets we all share.<br><br>"In the second half of last season, there was no investment in the team, a loan player - Eirik Bakke - was sent back to Leeds, and now we're unable to sign James Milner from Newcastle.<br><br>"There are no positives coming out of the club. We need to see a plan where the club is going and all the players feel the same. Every penny is being watched."<br><br></div>
