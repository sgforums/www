            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Revealed: The Worlds Most Complete Player<br><br></span></strong>There has been much speculation about who the best footballer in the world is, with, and in no particular order, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Steven Gerrard receiving most nominations. While a cogent argument can be made for any of the above, when it comes to identifying the world`s most complete player, the task is much easier.<br><br>He started his career as a defender, breaking into his first team at the unglamorous position of right back, and immediately established himself as a force. After a string of impressive performances, his tough, no-nonsense tackling and fiercely determined attitude marked him out as a fan favourite and future star. It was not long before he caught the attention of his national coaches, duly earning selection to the Under 21`s, although not for long.<br><br>Four games later, his Under 21 career was over, not because he was not good enough, au contraire, but because he was too good. Since then, he has represented his country at senior level on 72 occasions, scoring 14 times. A 1 in 5 goals ration is impressive for someone employed in a holding midfield role for most of his caps. Were it not for a succession of debilitating back and groin injuries forcing repeated injury withdrawals earlier in his career, his full caps total would now be somewhere above 90.<br><br>He made his mark at international level in what was one of his countries finest ever results, scoring a crucial goal in the process. He also made two assists and countless other quality contributions to what ended up being a legendary match. He`s scored at the World Cup Finals and the European Finals, as well as captaining his country, but it is his exploits at club level for which he is most venerated, not least of which being a certain cup final in Istanbul. <br><br>In one of the most remarkable games of all time, he almost single-handedly dragged his team back from a seemingly insurmountable deficit to emerge victorious. Not content with initiating the comeback with a header that would have made any old fashioned centre forward proud, he proceeded to secure the penalty from which came the equaliser. With the game level and moving into extra time, his manager deployed him at right back having sacrificed the starter there at half time. Thirty minutes and one of the all-time best displays of defending under supreme pressure and exhaustion later, he lifts the coveted trophy, a fitting reward for a Herculean, man-of-the-match performance.<br><br>Continuing his ever-improving goal-getting record, he has scored in an FA Cup final, a League Cup final and a UEFA Cup final, to compliment that Champions League final strike. As a testament to his all-round game, he now finds himself mastering another new position, his fourth regular spot at club level. After transitioning from right back to centre midfield and then to right winger, he is now back where he should be in the middle of the park, an area from which he can have most impact. His attacking midfielder role has yielded fantastic returns so far, with 21 and 24 goals over the last two campaigns. Not content with just scoring goals, he also supplies them, with his name regularly at the top of the list for most assists in his respective league and accuracy percentage on corners.<br><br>For all his statistical excellence, he elevates himself above his rivals with his intangible qualities of mental strength, inspiration and leadership. He has long been recognised as the talismanic heartbeat of his club, with his acclaimed never-say-die attitude and ability to bring his team back from the dead. It is impossible to quantify how much influence he exerts on a match, but it bears comparison with the influence Jupiter exerts on the asteroid belt, and we have witnessed enough comebacks and Hollywood style endings to recognise this greatness. Such leadership is a priceless commodity, and an increasingly rare one in this age of prancing, over-pampered "show ponies". You will not find this player berating his teammates for not finding him and you definitely will not catch him sulking when things do not go well.<br><br>A recent claim suggested that a certain Manchester United number 7 was the world`s most complete player because, "he can score with his right foot, his left foot and his head". Admirable qualities, sure, but our beautiful game does not just consist of dazzling skills and offensive prowess, it also requires heart, toughness and passion. To be considered as the worlds most complete player, twinkle-toed magic or 30 yard wonder goals are not enough, football is about more than that, much more. While there are some who score more goals or wow the fans with silky skills and sleight of feet, there is no one who combines all of the qualities mentioned above quite as well as a certain Englishman. <br><br>Now in the prime of a career that has seen excellence produced as a right back, right winger, holding midfielder, attacking midfielder, left winger and forward/support striker, at club and international level, he is receiving the plaudits he richly deserves. His admirers range from the former world`s best player, to the current world`s best manager - if the papers are to be believed - with a list of accolades nearly as long as his list of football attributes. <br><br>He, himself thinks he can still improve and, after witnessing ten years of season-on-season improvement, it would not be a shock if he does. Having just turned 29, he has plenty of time to establish himself as the most complete player the world has ever seen, if he has not done so already, as well as lay claim to the title of outright best. For now, the comparisons will rage and the opinions will range as to whom the best player in the world is. When it comes to the world`s most complete player, however, the answer is simple: Steven Gerrard. No comparison.<br></p></div>
