            <div class='col-md body'>What the article meant was that Crouch tormented their defense , make them really busy defending , when the whole team busy defending , how to attack ?<br><br>How to win when you don't attack ?<br><br>And when you attack , your mind is still worrying about Crouch lurking behind , how to play ?<br><br>When L'pool put those aerial balls towards Crouch , most of the time Crouch got it  , this is troubling Betis the whole game .<br><br>Once i read from that Betis' keeper : " Oh ! That big guy ? What's on earth you sent a basketball player on a football pitch ? "  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
