              <p class="SubHeading">Fulham manager Mark Hughes has moved swiftly to quash rumours that forward Clint Dempsey is leaving the club.</p>
              <div class="ArticleRight">
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;">The American is Hughes' top scorer this season with five league goals and that form led to him being linked to a reunion with former Fulham boss Roy Hodgson at Liverpool.</div>
              </div>
              <p>"I think his agent has been asked questions and he has tried to answer them intelligently," Hughes said.</p>
              <p>"I am sure there is interest in Clint, all good players are mentioned at some point when you are entering a transfer window but there has been no contact from any club and we won't encourage it because I know he is very happy here, he is enjoying his football and he is making an impact for us."</p>
              <p>Hughes is getting ready to launch his own transfer moves after seeing his current strike force hit with Bobby Zamora, Andy Johnson and Mousa Dembele struggle with injuries, but he is not so keen for other managers to approach his stars.</p>
              <p>"The mad month is getting close and it will be on us very quickly. I am sure people are trying to get things in line but if anyone enquires about Clint they will be getting short shrift."</p>

              <p class="SubHeading">Bolton would be willing to sell Johan Elmander for £8.4 million, according to reports.</p>

              </div>
              
              <p>The Sweden striker has been linked with a move away from the Reebok in January after catching the eye of a number of Europe's leading lights thanks to a sensational season so far.</p>
              <p>Elmander is out of contact in June but - with Bolton in the financial mire somewhat - they may reportedly decide to cash-in on the 29-year-old come January, with Liverpool and Inter Milan allegedly monitoring him closely.</p>
              <p>Sky Italia claims Inter have already made contact with Wanderers - who have told former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez that he will have to fork out £8.4 million to land Elmander.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been heavily linked with a £5 million move for the Swede in the New Year as Roy Hodgson attempts to bring more potent goal-threats to Anfield, but will have to pay more than they bargained to sign the former Toulouse man.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss has admitted that his side rely too heavily on the goalscoring talents of Anfield hero Fernando Torres and, hence, is understood to have identified his attacking department as the most in need of reinforcement.</p>
              <p>Hodgson is expected to be back in the transfer market by new Liverpool owners NESV - with some reports suggesting the 63-year-old will have upwards of £25 million to use to bring fresh blood to Anfield.</p>
              <p>West Ham striker Carlton Cole and Brazil legend Ronaldinho have both been linked with moves to Liverpool as Hodgson and NESV step up their pursuit of more attacking options.</p>

              <h1>Free Liverpool and Spurs target leaves transfer door wide open</h1>
              <h1>Liverpool and Spurs could be set for a negotiation war for South African midfielder Steven Pienaar.</h1>
              </div>
              <div class="ArticleContent content-link-builder">
              <div class="cmsContent content-link-builder">
              <div class="ArticleRight">
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;">
              <div class="Tagline" style="display: none;"></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              
              <p>The Everton ace continues to stall over a new deal at Goodison Park, and with Pienaar's contract set to expire in the summer some top clubs have begun to monitor the situation. Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Munich are just a trio thought to be interested.</p>
              <p>All three have been linked in recent months, and a move to Liverpool would undoubtedly be seen as the 'biggest' due to the nature of the rivalry between the Toffees and the Reds.</p>
              <p>This has not stopped others making the move to Anfield in the past, though, and Liverpool boss Roy Hodgon could look to capitalise on their neighbours' in-ability to tie down the player.</p>
              <p>SkySports asked Pienaar about his future yesteray, and the player replied: "No comment.</p>
              <p>"I am still focused on staying at Everton, this season is not over yet, so anything can happen. In football anything can happen, it can change tomorrow, today, no-one knows."</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp is thought to have a long-standing interest in the player dating back to his time at Ajax, and senses an opportunity to bring the player to White Hart Lane as the club compete on several fronts, including the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"I was also told this by one of my team-mates, so I don't know what is going on," said Pienaar in response to the talk of interest from Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
              <p>A discount offer could be made in January, but the Bafana-Bafana star appears set to stay at his current club until the summer before deciding on his best option.</p>
              <p>This could lead to a battle similar to the one that ensued for the signature of Joe Cole. Both Liverpool and Spurs were desperate to land the England international, but the Reds' won the day after negotiations.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will hope to do the same again if the opportunity arises, but know they will face stiff competition if they are to beat Tottenham to the former Borrusia Dortmund ace's signature.</p>
