              <p>The versatile CSKA Moscow player, who is comfortable in wing or striking positions, is thought to be considering a Russian Premier League exit with Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson one of the managers thought to be keen.</p>
              <p>After starting his career as a teenager at Grampus Eight, Honda moved to Dutch side VVV-Venlo in January 2008. After two years with the Eredivisie club, CSKA made their move for the player, securing his services for an undisclosed fee.</p>
              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger was heavily linked with the player in the summer after a series of complimentary comments during the World Cup, but Liverpool have now joined the chase for the player.</p>
              <p>Player agent Kees Ploegsma told Sport.co.uk: "When a big club comes in he will want to leave but at the moment that has not happened.â€¨â€¨<br><br>"A lot of managers will be watching him after he played so well at the World Cup - now they can watch him more for CSKA and hopefully they will decide to try and do something in January."</p>
              <p>CSKA are reportedly considering cashing in on the player, and Liverpool are set to challenge AC Milan and the Gunners for the player's signature.</p>
              <p>The Reds are keen to strengthen their side during the transfer window, with new owners NESV promising the Liverpool boss a transfer war chest in the region of £35 million.</p>
              <p>Hodgson is thought to have highlighted 'five or six' players as potential signings in the opening month of 2011, and Honda is thought to be on the Liverpool shortlist.</p>

              <h1>Hodgson set to beat Fergie to £6 million World Cup ace</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="SubHeading">Liverpool are ready to take advantage of Manchester United's faltering interest in Ghana World Cup star Anthony Annan and sign him for just £6 million, according to Goal.com.</p>
              <div class="ArticleRight">
              <div class="ArticlePic" style="display: block;">Annan impressed in South Africa and looked certain for a move to the Premier League during the summer but no offers were forthcoming.</div>
              </div>
              <p>Manchester United were the most prevalent team interested in the 24-year-old and Annan admitted he would jump at the chance to move to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>However, now Sir Alex Ferguson's interest has blown hot and cold, after the Scot revealed he did not want to bring any more new signings to Manchester United in January, plus the fact Annan is cup-tied for the Champions League matches, and Liverpool have moved into pole position.</p>
              <p>The Anfield side have already drawn up a shortlist of potential targets for the forthcoming transfer window and Annan, along with Saint Etienne's holding midfielder Yann M'Vila, is heading that list.</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson is now expected to fly to Norway and watch the Rosenborg ace.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's new director of football strategy Damian Comolli is thought to have alerted Hodgson to Annan's availability and the relatively low transfer fee would enable the club's new owners to bring another, more expensive, world class player to Anfield as well.</p>
              <p>Annan has previously announced his interest in a move to the Premier League, saying: "I think if I have opportunity to play there [England] I would be very grateful. If not Germany, Italy, Spain, everywhere. I think I will be ready to play over there."</p>

              <p>Benzema wowed the English crowd last week when he scored for France against England at Wembley last week. Such a performance has prompted Redknapp to urge the Reds to go after the young striker.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool need a striker and they should look no further than Karim Benzema," the former Liverpool midfielder wrote in the Daily Mail.</p>
              <p>"He played this game like it was his personal audition. He's started only one league game for Real Madrid this season and we could all see last night that he is better than that. Benzema enjoyed his night and put on a bit of a show.</p>
              <p>"The new Anfield owners have their first challenge: sign him," he added.</p>
              <p>Benzema joined Real for around $47 million (€30 million) but could reportedly be available to Liverpool at closer to $19 million (€12 million).</p>

              <p>The Hammers striker was publicly critical of boss Avram Grant after they slumped to 3-0 defeat at Anfield last Saturday and the east London club remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League.</p>
              <p>This has led to speculation that the 27-year-old wants out of Upton Park, with Liverpool reportedly the frontrunners for his signature.</p>
              <p>Cole said after the Liverpool loss: "We can come here and talk a good game and say we are going to do this to them and come with a game plan, but we didn't even turn up for this game,</p>
              <p>"In the first 10 minutes we had lost the game, psychologically anyway. I'm lost for words now, I can't speak too much because I get emotional with these things and it gets on my nerves and I don't want to talk about certain things.</p>
              <p>"I think I had just one cross. Apart from that I had nothing and as a striker, that's starvation, that's famine - what am I supposed to work on?</p>
              <p>"I'm deflated. I'm not happy and I hope something can happen as soon as possible because we need to change this asap."</p>
              <p>The £9 million-rated England forward was linked with a switch to Anfield during the summer and Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson has recently admitted he was monitoring Cole.</p>
              <p>He said: "Cole is a good player and was one of the players I was watching and we were looking at a lot of forwards.</p>
              <p>"He was one I watched and we talked about but we didn't make any particular move for him.</p>
              <p>"At Liverpool we are always linked with every player but I do like Carlton Cole and think he's a good player, but there was no offer made for him."</p>
              <p>Hodgson has made no secret of his desire to add more potency to his Anfield attack after admitting that Liverpool rely too heavily on Kop heroes Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Bolton striker Johan Elmander and Aston Villa winger Ashley Young have both been linked with moves to Anfield as the January transfer window draws closer.</p>

              <p>According to the <em>Mirror</em>, Liverpool, Newcastle and Stoke all have the talented Swede in their sights after it was revealed he could leave Bolton for nothing in the summer when his contract expires.</p>
              <p>Elmander is Bolton's record-signing after joining the club from Toulouse for around £10 million in 2008, and the 29-year-old has been in magnificent goalscoring form of late.</p>
              <p>His performances have led to Bolton launching a surprise assault on the Champions League places and have also reportedly caught the eye of Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has made no secret of his desire to add more potency to his Anfield attack after admitting that Liverpool rely too heavily on Kop heroes Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>And, with Torres' chequered injury history, Hodgson is keen to strengthen his striking ranks and is thought to be interested in bringing Elmander to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>However, Bolton boss Owen Coyle has attempted to ease fears that the Sweden international would be moving to Anfield, but admitted that Elmander would be crazy not to consider joining a club the size of Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Coyle said: "If players are playing well it is only natural bigger clubs will cast an eye on them. That is the nature of football and I am relaxed about it.</p>
              <p>"Until those bids come in, it is all hypothetical. When they do we will give them respect and make a decision. I do not get caught up in it too much and beat myself up. Johan knows that.</p>
              <p>"If it was a club of a similar size to Bolton I believe he would stay here. If an elite club came in Johan would be crazy not to think about it.</p>
              <p>"I have no problems with that. Johan is well within his rights to do what is right for himself and his family. What I will do game by game is try to get the best out of him."</p>
              <p>Coyle added: "Phil [Gartside] has had talks with Johan's representative and that will be on-going.</p>
              <p>"Johan has been terrific from day one and if they decide they want it to run its course into January, then so be it."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have also been linked with moves for out-of-favour Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema and Czech ace Tomas Necid as the Anfield club look to step up their pursuit of another goalscorer.</p>

              <p>Reports in Italy had suggested that Liverpool could be tempted into a swap deal with Dirk Kuyt moving to the Italian club with Philippe Mexes heading in the opposite direction.</p>
              <p>But it has now emerged that Liverpool are keen to keep Kuyt at Anfield and are poised to make a £20m offer for Vucinic.</p>
              <p>Vucinic, 27, has a proven track record in Serie A and is regarded as one of the best forwards in Europe.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson is desperate to find a proven partner for Fernando Torres and Vucinic could be just the right man to help Liverpool challenge for major silverware again.</p>

              <p>Sakho has spent his entire career in the French capital, making his debut as a teenager in 2007. He has gone on to become a stalwart at the Parc des Princes, and made his international debut for Les Bleus earlier in the month.</p>
              <p>Hodgson was in the Wembley crowd to watch Sakho play in France's 2-1 win over England, and the Liverpool manager was thought to be impressed with the player's composure and tackling ability on the biggest stage.</p>
              <p>New Reds owners NESV have pledged a transfer war chest thought to be in the region of £35 million, and the former Fulham boss is thought to be keen on adding at least 'five or six' players at Anfield in the opening month of 2011.</p>
              <p>A foil for Fernando Torres is thought to be the priority at Liverpool, but the Merseyside outfit are keen to strengthen in a number of core positions, including the centre of defence.</p>
              <p>Lille centre-back Adil Rami has also been linked with a move to the Premier League, and both players are thought to be on the Liverpool wishlist heading into the transfer window.</p>

              <p>I couldn't agree more. Right now what we need is a wide player who can play the wings efficiently and not like Maxi or Kyut, which cuts in the center a lot. And of course a target man who could hold up balls and is strong enough, Torres has the technical skills but isn't strong enough. Maybe someone like Vucinic or Carlton Cole are considerably average subsitutes.</p>
              <p>Also, we have to strengthen our midfield's creativity and defence rigidness. Skrtel has been playing like a babarian, of course he did some pretty clean and slick tackles sometimes, but all in all, too rough and collects too much yellow cards.</p>

              <p><br>I agree i don't think Hodgson is Champions League/Champions of EPL type of manager. He's Euro cup, max. But bear in mind these appointments are made by previous owners. If Hodgson doesn't produce something worthwhile this season, he will be sacked, hopefully.</p>

              <p>The Lorient forward is being monitored by a string of European clubs, with Arsenal thought to be favourites to land the player. However, the Metro reports that Liverpool and Spurs could join the race for the player with late moves.</p>
              <p>Gunners representatives are thought to have opened preliminary discussions over a £10 million deal, with French reports claiming the club have been in contact with the player's agent.</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson and Harry Redknapp are waiting in the wings though, and both clubs are thought to have scouted Gameiro in case things go wrong over a move to north London.</p>
              <p>Gameiro began his career at Strasbourg before moving to current club Lorient in 2008, and last season the striker made a name for himself with 17 Ligue 1 goals. International recognition has followed, with a first Les Bleus cap coming against Belarus in August.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been linked with a handful of striker in recent weeks, with Hodgson keen to find an attacking foil for Fernando Torres in January.</p>
              <p>The Anfield outfit have money to spend, with new owners NESV thought to be pledging a transfer war chest in the region of £35 million for the Liverpool boss.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has reportedly identified 'five or six' players to bolster his squad in the opening month of 2011, with new Liverpool Director of Football strategy Damien Comolli thought to be keen on French player additions.</p>
              <p>Gameiro fits the bill of young, attacking talent, and Liverpool could be ready for a Premier League fight with Arsenal and Spurs in their efforts to land the coveted frontman.</p>

              <p class="SubHeading">Liverpool are reportedly preparing to make a move for Roma striker Mirko Vucinic.</p>
              
              <p> </p>
              
              <p>The Reds have been linked with the Serbian for some time and now, according to talkSPORT, they will step up their interest in the £20 million-rated 27-year-old in January.</p>
              <p>Vucinic has been an inconsistent performer since joining Roma from Lecce in 2006, however he has plenty of Champions League experience and has the ability to be a big hit on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson has made no secret of his desire to add more potency to his Anfield attack after admitting that Liverpool rely too heavily on Kop heroes Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>And, with Torres' chequered injury history, Hodgson is keen to strengthen his Liverpool strike force and is thought to be interested in bringing Vucinic to Anfield.</p>
              <p>"We are quite clearly short of the players we need to give us adequate cover in attack," said Hodgson.</p>
              <p>"That is an area that really needs addressing, but whether it happens in January or the summer remains to be seen."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have also been linked with moves for Bolton striker Johan Elmander and Aston Villa winger Ashley Young in what is sure to be a busy January at Anfield.</p>
