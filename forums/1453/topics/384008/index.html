              <p>FORMER Liverpool FC striker Stan Collymore is calling on Steven Gerrard to leave Anfield "in search of the Premier League".</p>
              <p>Collymore believes the Reds ace will never win the ultimate goal while with Liverpool and he says many players in the current squad are not good enough to play alongside Gerrard.</p>
              <p>"It's time for Steven Gerrard to put his loyalty to Liverpool to one side and go in search of the one honour that has eluded him - the Premier League," he writes in his latest column for <a href="http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/stan-collymore/Why-Steven-Gerrard-must-quit-Liverpool-now-to-win-the-Premier-League-plus-Megson-on-brink-at-Bolton-article247225.html"><span style="color: #005689;">MirrorFootball.co.uk</span></a>.</p>
              <p>"He's not going to see that day while he's wearing a red shirt and as sad as it is for me to say this as a former Liverpool player, I think it is time for him to leave Anfield.</p>
              <p>"I was at Blackburn on Saturday and players like<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> Lucas, Rieira</strong> and<strong> Kuyt</strong></span> don't deserve to play with him to be honest."</p>
              <p>Collymore thinks Gerrard has more chance of winning a domestic title with Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, AC Milan and Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>He said: "I've seen him lift the European Cup and I'd love to see him lift the Premier League trophy, but it won't be as a Rafa Benitez player and I'm not sure it will ever happen for him as a Liverpool player.</p>
              <p>"I'm not saying this to try and wind up Liverpool fans. I just think it would be a tragedy if after seeing inferior players to him like Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick win the title, he didn't.</p>

              <p>I agreed with Collymore.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have made Liverpool 2nd rated this season with his boys.</p>
              <p>Ah Hou's boy was the backbone of his glories.</p>
              <p>Stevie already dropped the "Come and Get Me, I want BPL medal" hint to the top three clubs.</p>

              <p>What can Ah Ben do with 20Million or 30 Million warchest?</p>
              <p>Anyone who's played CM games will know that transfer kitty is just a portion of the equation, because next comes the wages. If a club don't have the reserves in their finance to support a player's wages, even a huge transfer tag won't suffice.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's true that it doesn't do the England man justice to see him playing with Sub-World Class players week in and week out., and definitely it must be tiring for him to drive the club forward every year.</p>
              <p>Look at Messi, with Argentina, he's surrounded by sub-par players and the team isn't really breaking records, but with Barcelona, he's now World Player Of The Year already. Wow.</p>
