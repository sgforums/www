We often hear players say that they have nothing but respect for Gerard Houllier and that he means a lot to them, this tonight was conclusive proof. This wasn't a P.R. exercise, this was the real thing. It was real emotion and it was a joy to watch. It demonstrates just how much the manager is valued by the club's most important player.<br><br>Despite venting my anger at the poor performance against Portsmouth, I won't be making a u-turn and now dropping at the feet of Gerard Houllier to worship him. I have the utmost respect for the manager as an individual but we've all been here many times before so for now let's concentrate on facing Leeds and nothing else. ***<br><br>Somehow, I shared the writer's feeling <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></span></span></div>
