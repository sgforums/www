              <h1>Juventus join chase for Liverpool loaner Alberto Aquilani but
                                      Italian giants line up swap deal with Felipe Melo<br></h1>
              <p>Juventus are keen to sign Alberto Aquilani after Liverpool
                                      manager Roy Hodgson cleared the Â£20million flop to leave Anfield on
                                      a loan deal.</p>
              <p>However, the Serie A giants could try to tempt the Reds with a
                                      permanent transfer, offering Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo in
                                      exchange.</p>
              <p>Hodgson signed Denmark international Christian Poulsen from Juve
                                      as a ready-made replacement for wantaway Argentina captain Javier
                                      Mascherano.</p>
              <div><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/20/article-1304688-0AD9F73A000005DC-78_468x328.jpg"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/20/article-1304688-0AD9F73A000005DC-78_468x328.jpg" alt="In the stands: Alberto Aquilani (right) was left out of Liverpool's Europa League qualifying tie against Trabzonspor at Anfield on Thursday night" width="288" height="201"></a>
              <p><em>In the stands: Alberto Aquilani (right) was left
                                      out of Liverpool's Europa League qualifying tie against Trabzonspor
                                      at Anfield on Thursday night</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But the Italians believe there is still interest from Anfield in
                                      one-time Arsenal target Melo, according to Italian newspaper
                                      Corriere dello Sport.</p>
              <p>Hodgson left Aquilani out of Liverpool's 1-0 Europa League win
                                      against Trabzonspor on Wednesday night to stop him being cup-tied
                                      and admitted a return to Italy was on the cards.</p>
              <div><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/20/article-1304688-0789C561000005DC-604_306x461.jpg"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/20/article-1304688-0789C561000005DC-604_306x461.jpg" alt="Who wants me? Roy Hodgson has sanctioned a loan move away from Anfield for Aquilani" width="288" height="433"></a>
              <p><em>Who wants me? Roy Hodgson has sanctioned a loan
                                      move away from Anfield for midfielder Aquilani</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'We are considering possibly loaning him to an Italian club, but
                                      nothing is sure about that yet so I don't have anything definite to
                                      report,' said the boss after the play-off round first leg.</p>
              <p>'I didn't want to use him (against Trabzonspor) just in case the
                                      loan goes through, because for Aquilani this year it's very
                                      important that he plays regular football, every week, as the No 1
                                      man on the teamsheet.</p>
              <p>'I can't promise him that here so if a loan move to Italy could
                                      help him in that respect it might be good for all parties.</p>
              <p>'It would certainly be what he needs, it would certainly protect
                                      the value of the player and when he does return to Liverpool no
                                      doubt we will see the Aquilani that we signed before he came here
                                      injured last year.'</p>
              <p>Aquilani was signed from Roma last summer as the replacement for
                                      Xabi Alonso, who left for Real Madrid, but the Italy midfielder
                                      never managed a regular run in the team because of injuries.</p>
