            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">Michael Owen insists he did not "snub" a move to Liverpool to join Newcastle - and admits the suggestion he did makes his "blood boil".<br><br>The England striker left Anfield for Real Madrid in 2004 - but after failing to nail down a first-team place with the Galacticos, moved back to the Premiership this summer in a Â£17m move to St James' Park.<br><br>"...... Liverpool was my first choice. I had spent more than a decade there and I did think I would be going back when I met Rick Parry and BenÃ­tez just before the transfer deadline.<br><br>"We had discussed the wages and all the nitty-gritty of a contract, so I have no doubts that their interest was genuine, whatever you may have heard. But it was difficult for them because they had sold me for Â£8.5m and were being asked to pay considerably more to take me back. They had to make their own financial decisions."<br><br>********<br><span style="color: red;">Mr O!!!<br><br>As a fan, I can't say I've pleasant memories abt ur leaving us!  U left us when we seemed 2b in "crisis", we cut loss by getting a mere 8.5m fm those spanish scums.  Then when u were in "crisis" there, u expect us 2 pay double the amt to save u?!  I wonder if he noes who had caused such a difficult financial decision for us!?<br><br>Now, whose blood shd be boiling!?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></span> </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Owen held the club at ransom. He refused to sign a new contract despite verbally declaring that he will. No way LFC was going to let Owen leave at the end of the season for free, that was how Madrid got the cut off price and Owen moved to Madrid to seek greener pastures ( so he calls it ).<br><br>Everyone knows what happened straight after. Istanbul. I won't elaborate.<br><br>Then Owen starts to panic. He's not playing regularly for Madrid. And the World Cup is approaching. His place in the national team is under threat. Even Sven Goran Ericcson said so. So what does Michael do? He wants to return home, to the premiership. To where? Liverpool of course. Sure, LFC will want to welcome him back, legendary striker leh. what do you expect. But wait, there's a twist. Madrid wants 16 million. Come on, LFC may have the money, but why will they want to buy back a player twice the amount they sold him for?That's not very clever.  So newcastle spends more money and brings Owen back.<br><br>For me, Owen's at fault. The way he left Liverpool may be forgiven but not forgotten. And don't blame the club for not matching the ridiculous 16 million price tag.</div>

He refused to sign a new contract despite verbally declaring that he will. No way LFC was going to let Owen leave at the end of the season for free, that was how Madrid got the cut off price and Owen moved to Madrid to seek greener pastures ( so he calls it ).<br><br>Everyone knows what happened straight after. Istanbul. I won't elaborate.<br><br>Then Owen starts to panic. He's not playing regularly for Madrid. And the World Cup is approaching. His place in the national team is under threat. Even Sven Goran Ericcson said so. So what does Michael do? He wants to return home, to the premiership. To where? Liverpool of course. Sure, LFC will want to welcome him back, legendary striker leh. what do you expect. But wait, there's a twist. Madrid wants 16 million. Come on, LFC may have the money, but why will they want to buy back a player twice the amount they sold him for?That's not very clever.  So newcastle spends more money and brings Owen back.<br><br>For me, Owen's at fault. The way he left Liverpool may be forgiven but not forgotten. And don't blame the club for not matching the ridiculous 16 million price tag. </div></blockquote><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Walau, are u a script writer?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Last nite he was boo-ed by some fans....n there was no standing ovation for him - tat shd speak volumes abt how the Reds fans feel  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Anyway, agree tat we shd forgive....but not forget!
