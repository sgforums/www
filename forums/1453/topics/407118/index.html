              <p>         <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Steven Defour</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool are reportedly set to make a bid for Standard Liege midfielder Steven Defour.</strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old has been the subject of interest from Manchester United, but the Daily Mirror suggests that the Merseysiders are set to do battle with their great rivals for his signature.</p>
              <p>Alex Ferguson is known to be a long-term admirer of the Belgium international, and the United boss even sent the former RC Genk man a personal message of encouragement after the playmaker broke his leg last September.</p>
              <p>Prior to his injury, Defour was regarded as one of the hottest prospects in European football; reportedly catching the eye of Arsenal and Real Madrid among others.</p>
              <p>Defour is a versatile midfielder - equally as comfortable in a free role or as a holding player - and has been compared to Paul Scholes in his pomp. And, with Argentina captain Javier Mascherano nearing the exit at Anfield, Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson is keen to fill the void that will be left by the Inter Milan target.</p>
              <p>Despite signing a new contract with Standard in March, Defour's agent has offered his suitors hope in their pursuit.</p>
              <p>"If a club agrees a fee with Standard and us, then it is possible he will leave," said Paul Stefani.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have been linked with an array of midfielders with Defour and West Ham's Scott Parker recently added to the alleged list of targets, which reportedly includes Christian Poulsen and Stilyan Petrov.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Peter Crouch</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp is ready to sell Peter Crouch as he gears up for some major wheeler-dealing at Tottenham.</strong></p>
              <p>Crouch has followed Redknapp to many clubs and been bought and sold several times by him, but this latest ­potential exit will come as a surprise to him.</p>
              <p>Redknapp is looking for more strength in his attack and insiders reveal Crouch was being teed up for a sale to Fulham before manager Roy Hodgson left for ­Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Successor Mark Hughes may be ­interested in the leggy front man, who controversially turned down Fulham a year ago - he'll decide this week.</p>
              <p>Hodgson is a possible bidder for Crouch if the price is right and a ­sensational return to Liverpool is not out of the question.</p>
              <p>And England star Crouch could be pitched into the Tottenham move for West Ham midfield dynamo Scott Parker.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maynor Figueroa</span></em></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson is preparing a £5million bid for Wigan's Honduras star Maynor Figueroa.</strong></p>
              <p>Hodgson will make a ­renewed effort to raid the Latics for Figueroa after his snub from Luke Young.</p>
              <p>Figueora appeared in all three of Honduras' games at the World Cup and Wigan boss Roberto Martinez ­faces a fight to keep him.</p>
              <p>Stoke have also registered their interest for the ­27-year-old left-back, who shot to ­Barclays Premier League stardom with his stunning 60-yard goal against the Potters last season.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Scott Parker</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool are set to make an £8million bid for Scott Parker.</strong></p>
              <p>Anfield boss Roy Hodgson has pinpointed the West Ham midfielder as the man to replace Javier ­Mascherano, who is set to join Inter Milan in a £20m deal.</p>
              <p>The Hammers ­hierarchy have ­insisted that Parker is the one player they will not sell this summer.</p>
              <p>"Not at any price," said chairman David ­Sullivan.</p>
              <p>That has not stopped Tottenham declaring their interest.</p>
              <p>And just as Liverpool allowed Spurs and ­Arsenal to make the running in the ­pursuit of Joe Cole, before stealing their thunder, they are poised to strike again with Parker. The key issue is whether West Ham will relax their tough stance.</p>
              <p>The Upton Park club have been boosted by the news that Robert Green wants to stay and they are likely to start talks soon with ­Matthew Upson about a new contract.</p>
              <p>Upson's current deal ­expires at the end of this season and he would ­qualify for a free transfer but West Ham want to avoid that scenario.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Hodgson's attempts to land Christian Poulsen have been given a boost after the Juventus midfielder's agent said it was an "honour" to be linked with Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Joern Bonnesen, his agent, said: "There has not been any contact and there is not much more that can be said ­until there has been, but we know there's an interest from them."</p>

              <h2 style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.05em; FONT-SIZE: 1.05em">FERNANDO TORRES has ended speculation about his future by declaring: Liverpool are the best club in England.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish striker has been heavily linked with Double winners Chelsea and big-spending Manchester City.</p>
              <p>But new Reds boss Roy Hodgson has convinced him to remain at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Torres, 26, said: "I really appreciated the fact that Roy came out to see me while I was on holiday.</p>
              <p>"He told me about his plans for the club and what he wanted from me and I appreciated that.</p>
              <p>"I hope he will be the right man to reach the targets of Liverpool Football Club and I am really looking forward to working with him.</p>
              <p>"This is the best club in the country so the targets and expectations are always high."</p>
              <p>Torres, who is currently recovering from a groin injury, added: "I am really happy to be back, really happy to stay with all my team-mates.</p>
              <p>"My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is the same as it was on my first day when I signed.</p>
              <p>"I am looking forward to the challenge ahead."</p>
              <p>Torres admits the arrival of Joe Cole, combined with skipper Steven Gerrard pledging his future to the club, helped erase any lingering thoughts of leaving Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard added: "I was talking to Stevie a lot and I also met with Joe.</p>
              <p>"I think Joe is exactly the kind of player we need to improve the history of our club.</p>
              <p>"We are keeping our best players and so it's nice to be back with them. Hopefully we can play together as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>"At the moment I am training just on my own but as soon as I can I will train with the team and with the new manager."</p>

              <p><span style="COLOR: #ff0000"><em>Christian Poulsen</em></span></p>
              <p>Liverpool are poised to step up their attempts to land Juventus midfielder Christian Poulsen.</p>
              <p>Though the Reds are awaiting the next move from Inter Milan in their pursuit of Javier Mascherano, they pressing on with plans for life without the Argentinean.</p>
              <p>Once Inter strike a deal with Manchester City for the sale of Mario Balotelli, they will be better placed to push through their bid to take Mascherano to the San Siro.</p>
              <p>The Reds are looking at a number of options to replace Mascherano and Poulsen, the Denmark international, and Standard Liege's Steven Defour head Roy Hodgson's list.</p>
              <p>But it is looking more likely that Poulsen - a player who is well known to Hodgson - is the frontrunner after sources in Denmark revealed further discussions have taken place between the Reds and Juve.</p>
              <p>Poulsen's adviser Joern Bonnesen has not spoken with Liverpool directly - nor has Poulsen - but it understood he could end up at Anfield for a fee in the region of 6million euros.</p>
              <p>Bonnesen has also let it be known that his client would love to work with Hodgson - who was his former manager at FC Copenhagen - again if the opportunity arose.</p>
