            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has explained why he decided to quit international football.<br><br>Speaking to local paper the Liverpool Echo, the centre-back explained that there were many factors that had to be considered before making the decision. Pivotal though, was the disappointment of not being further up the pecking order in England Manager Steve McLarenÂ’s list of centre-backs.<br><br>Â“I first thought about it (retiring) after the World Cup because I wondered how many chances IÂ’d get for England.Â”<br><br>Â“Then when Sol Campbell was out of the picture I thought I could put pressure on Rio Ferdinand for the other centre-half position alongside John Terry.Â”<br><br>Given CarragherÂ’s consistently impressive form for Liverpool, it is easy to understand his frustration at being left out of the set-up. Players such as Jonathan Woodgate and Ledley King have often been given the nod by McLaren ahead of the experienced Carragher.<br><br>Â“I canÂ’t really argue with that because theyÂ’re top draw players,Â” Carragher told the Echo, Â“ItÂ’s just that from a purely personal point of view, itÂ’s been disappointing because after some of my performances for Liverpool I thought I deserved a chance.Â”<br><br>Â“Everyone can see that England are very strong in the central defensive department at the moment. There are a lot of world-class players there and most of them are younger than me, have their best years ahead and will get better and better. IÂ’m 29 now, and I have to accept that if IÂ’m not a regular starter now, I donÂ’t think I ever will be.Â”<br><br>But fans of the Liverpool legend may be happy to hear that Carragher is reluctant to draw a definite line under his international career: Â“If itÂ’s an absolute emergency-and by that I mean all available centre-halves are injured or there are suspensions-I probably wonÂ’t say no if IÂ’m asked. IÂ’m not going to leave England in the lurch.<br><br>Carragher played 27 times at Under 21 level with England eventually becoming captain. He made his first senior squad appearance as a sub on 28 April 1999 against Hungary, with his full England debut coming against Holland in 2001. He played a total of 34 times for the England senior squad.<br><br></blockquote></div>
