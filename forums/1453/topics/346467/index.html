              As Robbie Keane returns to Tottenham after just six months and 7 goals in 27 appearances, many Liverpool fans are left bemused by the events which have seen the Republic of Ireland captain return to White Hart Lane so dramatically.
              
              â€œDEAR Mr. Keane,
              
              On behalf of Liverpool Football Club, I apologise for the way youâ€™ve been treated. When you not only signed for the club you supported as a boy, but were given the hallowed number 7 jersey in the process, it must have been a dream come true - but the way that dream descended into six months of nightmare was unfair and completely uncalled for.
              
              To never being given a chance to find form was unfair. To be dropped and benched time and time again while having the burden of an unjustified price tag was also unfair. To be a part of a squad that no matter how you performed, how hard you trained, or how much heart you gave to the club was never going to matter.
              
              You have remained professional throughout and showed signs of â€˜making the gradeâ€™ with the goal at Arsenal and two more against Bolton, alas you weâ€™re dropped for the next match and saw only 75 minutes of league action since.
              
              I, and many others, wish you well on your return to Spurs - and can understand that your feelings towards the club youâ€™ve always loved may have changed. Many of us have supported you, and wanted to see you get a fair chance, but it was never on the cards. Alas, you were just one of the toys thrown out of the pram during our managerâ€™s month of madness, where he thought nothing of treating a consummate professional as a pawn in a political game just so he could prove his point and get his way.
              
              See you at Anfield on the 24th of May.

              Rafa Benitez has suggested Robbie Keane struggled to cope with the pressure and expectation of playing for Liverpool. 
              
              The Premier League title contenders cut their losses on the Irish striker on transfer deadline day by allowing Keane to return to Tottenham Hotspur.
              
              Keane had scored just seven goals in 28 appearances since moving to Anfield from Spurs six months ago, and was unable to reach the heights expected of him.
              
              Reds boss Benitez insists the 28-year-old was given the support to succeed on Merseyside and is disappointed the move did not work out.
              
              High expectations
              "He is Tottenham's player now, so the manager has to support him, but he played a lot of games for us," said Benitez.
              
              "When we signed him, I thought he could be a fantastic partner for Fernando Torres. And if Torres was injured, we could rely on Robbie. I thought he could guarantee goals, but that clearly wasn't the case. 
              
              "Sometimes, even with good players, they don't settle in at a new club or they have problems with systems or developing an understanding with other players.
              
              "Another factor is that Liverpool are a different club from most. Expectations are really high, people are asking questions every week and the pressure is on all the time. Maybe that was why he found it so difficult. 
              
              "Do I feel any responsibility for what happened? I supported him as much as I could and gave him plenty of opportunities to show his quality. He was not treated badly. 
              
              "There is some disappointment it didn't work out, but we did all we could to improve things before having to accept that sometimes you cannot make the improvement you are looking for."
              
              *****************
              my take is we din sign him to fail.
              
              but there are alot of on-goings behind the scene tat we fans din and may never know!  maybe someone will write a book soon....
              
              anyway, keane is now gone....let's move on!!!
