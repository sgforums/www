            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE REDS: TOP OF THE CLUBS</strong><br>By Gary Lim<br><br>November 10, 2005<br><br>IT is something which would have made Bill Shankly very proud - if the legendary manager were alive today.<br><br>The former boss of Liverpool, credited with transforming the Merseyside club into a European power during the 1960s and 1970s, lived and breathed Liverpool Football Club.<br><br>And recently, the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), ranked Liverpool as the current world's No. 1 club.<br><br>The Reds, captained by Steven Gerrard (above), are perched at the top in its latest monthly world club rankings.<br><br>IFFHS was founded 21 years ago in Leipzig, in the old East Germany.<br><br>I know many football fans would be up in arms on hearing the news.<br><br>What about Chelsea?<br><br>They're a popular choice for sure.<br><br>Barcelona?<br><br>Must be up there or thereabouts.<br><br>And Juventus?<br><br>A top-class side without a doubt.<br><br>But the IFFHS, which began ranking the world's teams since 1991, don't think so.<br><br>Chelsea are ranked a lowly 12th, Juventus occupy 19th spot while Barcelona are placed 28th.<br><br>Lo and behold, Real Madrid are in 30th spot, below the likes of CSKA Moscow (6th), Villarreal (10th), AZ Alkmaar (14th) and Newcastle (17th).<br><br>According to the IFFHS <a href="http://www.iffhs.de/" rel="nofollow">website</a>, points are awarded to clubs for wins, with different competitions carrying different weightage. The ranking 'takes into consideration the results of 12 months of continental and intercontinental competitions, national league matches (including playoffs) and the national cup'.<br><br>The website also reads: 'The World Club Ranking is a precise classification showing the real level of the clubs free of any subjective influence. It is the result of a profound analysis that allows us to fairly report the level of international performance for each country.'<br><br>Just like how the seedings for Grand Slam tennis tournaments often baffle the players, there is seldom one magic formula in sports on who is the best.<br><br>Years have passed since the debate over whether Pele or Diego Maradona is the best-ever footballer began, but there is no conclusion and there probably never would be. An element of subjectivity, plus a small dose of common sense, certainly helps.<br><br>For example, with no disrespect, did anyone really think that Greece were the strongest European team by virtue of their win at Euro 2004?<br><br>Liverpool may have won the Champions League title last season. But at the same time, they finished fifth place in the English Premier League, a massive 38 points off the pace, and recorded 14 losses in 38 games.<br><br>On the other hand, English rivals Chelsea were the runaway winners of the League and won the Carling Cup final against Liverpool.<br><br>However, they lost to the Reds in the Champions League semi-finals.<br><br>Barcelona, where stars such as Ronaldinho, Deco and Samuel Eto'o entertain their fans week in, week out on their way to the Spanish League title, certainly look stronger than Liverpool.<br><br>So, too, are Manchester United, who are ranked fifth by IFFHS.<br><br>Football fans here, like Terence Yee, are puzzled by the rankings.<br><br>The 26-year-old sales executive, a Pablo Aimar fan, believes that Chelsea should be at the top.<br><br>He said: 'Chelsea may have lost their last few matches but if the rankings are based on the last 12 months, then they certainly did well.<br><br>'I thought Barcelona and Juventus should be somewhere there as well.<br><br>'Whatever it is, it can't be Liverpool.'<br><br>Chua Seng Chye, 35, a hostel manager, feels that the results are 'nonsense'. He said: 'If you ask me, French club Lyon is certainly one of the best sides over the past year. They did well in the Champions League and are continuing to shine this season.<br><br>'Liverpool did well to win the Champions League last season and I believe they should be among the top teams. But can't be No.1, lah.'<br><br>One thing is for sure. There will never be a consensus when it comes to picking which is the best team.<br><br>Well, someone said football is a beautiful game, didn't he? - TNP<br><br></div>
