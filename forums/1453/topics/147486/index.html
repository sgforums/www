            <div class='col-md body'>In the most recent interview before the Season ickoff, Rafael Benitez has admitted that Michael Owen could have a future back at Anfield.<br><br><blockquote>Rafael Benitez finally broke his silence on the rumours surrounding Michael Owen's future on Friday when he addressed the national press for his final press confrence before today's big Premiership kick-off.<br>Speaking to journalists from England's leading national newspapers, Benitez was pressed relentlessly for a quote - any quote - about any move for Real Madrid striker Michael Owen.<br><br>While the Liverpool manager maintained that his top priorities remain the recruitment of a new centre-half and a right winger, he was prepared to admit that a move for a player of Owen's calibre can never be totally ruled out.<br><br>"Michael Owen is a good player, so I can't say no," he told Liverpool's Daily Post newspaper. "I don't know at this moment if we can do something about the strikers because we are waiting on a good offer for Milan [Baros]. If we don't get that offer then we can't do anything about it.<br><br>"There were no problems between me and Michael. He's a good player and a nice boy, a good professional." </blockquote><a href="http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N149661050813-0922.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N149661050813-0922.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is understood that Rafa's transfer priority lies in a right winger and a centre-back. Owen will likely be a secondary issue.<br><br>It's obvious Rafa has to trim the strike-force to accommodate Owen. If Owen does comes in, I see two almost identical set of striking partners. Crouch/Nando with Cisse/Owen. This setup will be good cos LFC will have a long Season ahead with EPL and UCL commitments and that will give Rafa options and rest players.<br></div>

But tell me, who do you think is able to give us 20 goals a season. The safest bet is Cisse but that is a BIG question mark. Owen can give us the 20 goals. I have never been a fan of Pongolle.

He's their player and they will decide," Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo.<br><br>"But when I see Michael in the England squad I won't even have to ask him where he'd like to be in a few weeks.<br><br>"I am waking up every morning looking in the papers and hoping to read he is on his way here.<br><br>"Could you imagine him coming back to Anfield and scoring against us for another Premiership club? It would be a nightmare.<br><br>"Whoever signs him guarantees themselves 20 goals and in my opinion he'd be the best striker in the league."<br><br>Owen, who left Liverpool last summer, is now fifth-choice striker at Madrid after the club signed Robinho and Julio Baptista.<br><br>And the 25-year-old fears another season on the substitutes' bench will damage his chances of keeping his place in England's starting line-up at the World Cup next year.<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has played down talk of a movefor Owen, but news that Milan Baros is close to joining Aston Villa could change the situation.<br><br>Newcastle manager Graeme Souness said on Friday that he thoughthe had "a good chance" of signing Owen.<br><br>Souness is keen to replace summer departures Craig Bellamy and Patrick Kluivert.<br><br>"We know all about Michael's situation - he is a target. But wealso have other targets," said Souness.<br><br>Owen has also been linked with a move to Manchester United, although the Old Trafford club have denied that they are interested.
