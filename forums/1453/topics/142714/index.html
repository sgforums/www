            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Liverpool consider deal to bring unhappy Owen home </span></strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Guardian</span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Liverpool hierarchy have been made aware that Michael Owen would welcome a return to Anfield with the England striker frustrated at the bit-part role he perceives he will play at Real Madrid in the coming campaign.<br><br>The Spanish club are still attempting to complete the signing of the Brazilian striker Robinho, 21, from Santos, whose arrival would push Owen further down the pecking order at the BernabÃ©u. The 25-year-old has become increasingly disillusioned since leaving Merseyside last August and is now anxious to secure a move back to the Premiership, with the European champions his preferred destination.<br><br>Rafael BenÃ­tez has made the Southampton striker Peter Crouch his priority as an attacking signing in the transfer market. However, there are elements within the Liverpool boardroom who would prefer to re-sign Owen rather than pursuing that interest in Crouch, though BenÃ­tez would take convincing before switching targets.<br><br>Striking a deal with Real could pose a further problem. Liverpool have not budgeted to sign Owen permanently and BenÃ­tez is reluctant to offer Real a profit on the Â£8m fee that took the forward to Spain a year ago. Similarly, Real are thought to be unwilling to countenance his departure on loan for a year.<br><br>Luis Figo will decide this weekend whether he is to join Internazionale or Liverpool after Real confirmed the 32-year-old Portuguese winger will be allowed to leave the BernabÃ©u on a free transfer.</span></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Owen would be a viable option cos his goal scoring speaks for himself and he is still very much adored among the fans. He is still a better finisher IMO among the strikers we have now.<br><br>Moreover, it will interesting to see Crouch and Owen paired up together. Crouch, despite his height... is very much agile and good in the air and has neat technical abilities. U don't see many people of his height has that qualities.<br><br>Also, Owen's mental strength is rather resilient too. He may not has the best of game in 89mins but give him a chance on the 90th mins... chances are, he may score that one for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Loan deal is more ideal , if Owen don't perform , sent him back to Bernabeau .<br><br>In footballing terms , L'pool has too much player of Owen's mode , Cisse.....Baros ... Pongelle ..... but not a single player that has the mode of Crouch , whose helight can really threaten , Crounch'e presence in the team give Benitez a wider dimension .<br><br>Oh yes , Morientes can possess height threat , we need two on that height thing . If one is injured , the other stand in .<br><br>At least we can see a different L'pool against different opoosition .<br><br>Or else people will say L'pool is a one dimensional team , pass to Owen , just pass to Owen .......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the bottom line here is not whether Liverpool wants Owen but rather how much Real Madrid wants from him and how much Liverpool is willing to pay. It really makes no sense to pay RM more than what they pay us last season for Owen. That's bad business. It's not like Liverpool wanted to sell Owen last season and realizes they made a mistake and wants him back now. I think it is Owen who realized he made a mistake but Liverpool is not going to pay for his mistake.<br><br>For me 8 million pounds to RM plus Nunez is all Liverpool will offer for Owen to return. No more than that!</div>
