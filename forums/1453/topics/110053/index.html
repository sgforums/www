            <div class='col-md body'><br>Thursday, December 30, 2004<br><br>Morientes: I will join Rafa's Liverpool<br><br>Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes has revealed he 'will go to Liverpool'.<br><br>Morientes: Mind is made up. (BarryCoombs/Empics)<br><br>The 28-year-old has been out of favour at the Bernabeu and spent last season at French club Monaco.<br><br>Despite returning to the Bernabeu this season, the Spain international is down the pecking order behind Ronaldo, Raul and former Liverpool striker Michael Owen. Reds boss Rafael Benitez is desperate to bolster his attack after summer signing Djibril Cisse broke a leg earlier this season.<br><br>'Yes, I am going to England - I have decided,' Morientes said in comments reported on Liverpool's official website.<br><br>'I will go to Liverpool and for many reasons. The main reason is the coach Rafa Benitez. He is Spanish and knows me perfectly, which is worth a lot for a professional.<br><br>'We have asked Real Madrid to make a fast solution and I don't want to expand any further, except to say I am already looking through the English dictionary.'<br><br>The player's agent Gines Carvajal has admitted Morientes' future is now in the hands Madrid, who will need to agree a fee for the player.<br><br>'Everything depends on Real Madrid. I haven't seen anything in writing from Liverpool,' added Carvajal.<br><br>'I know they spoke with Madrid and the initial amount did not satisfy the president. But within the right price frame the feelings of the player will be a priority. That is important.'<br><br>Liverpool legends Ronnie Whelan and David Fairclough have acclaimed Morientes as the ideal transfer window signing. And former captain Whelan cannot wait to see the 28-year-old in a red shirt.<br><br>He said: 'Morientes scores plenty of goals at the very top level. He is good in the air and good on the ground and he brings players into the game.<br><br>'He is everything a good centre-forward coming to Anfield should be and what is needed.'<br><br>Fairclough, himself a top striker from the Shankly era, agrees that Morientes would be a class signing. 'Getting Morientes would be something of a coup because he is top quality around Europe and I wonder if there are any much better than him,' he said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Real holding out for Morientes cash<br><br>Liverpool are locked in an increasingly bitter war over the future of Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes, despite the player's demands to be allowed to move to Anfield.<br><br>Fernando Morientes: Set for Anfield? (BarryCoombs/Empics)<br><br>Anfield boss Rafael Benitez is believed to have increased his bid for the 28 year-old striker to Â£5million.<br><br>But that still appears to be not enough for the Spanish giants, who want Â£7million before allowing the hitman to leave.<br><br>The deadlocked situation has raised the prospect of Manchester City's Nicolas Anelka being an Anfield target.<br><br>But Manchester City reacted angrily to further speculation over Anelka's future.<br><br>A spokesman said: 'This is now becoming tiresome and we will not continue to respond to this crazy speculation. We have had no enquiry about Nicolas Anelka.'<br><br>Sources in France today claim there has been an approach from Liverpool and discussions on a three-year contract have taken place. Lyon have also entered the race for Morientes and the situation has become increasingly complicated by the fact that Real sacked coach Mariano Garcia Remon today.<br><br>New appointment Wanderley Luxemburgo seems likely to want to sign Brazil's latest striking sensation, Robinho.<br><br>That would push Morientes even further down the pecking order, but the appointment of a new manager could delay a decision on the Spanish international, who has been top of Benitez's shopping list for weeks.<br><br>Benitez's increased bid and Morientes' demand that he be allowed to move to Merseyside seem to have been lost on the Madrid powerbrokers.<br><br>Liverpool will not pay Â£7million for Morientes, but may be prepared to give Manchester City Â£6million for Anelka, who had a short spell at Anfield under Gerard Houllier.<br><br>Anelka is only 24 and would be of more immediate benefit to Liverpool because he could play in the Champions League for them. Liverpool also refuse, point blank, to allow a first option clause on Steven Gerrard to be part of any negotiations for Morientes.<br><br>Morientes is becoming increasingly frustrated with the situation, and in comments reported on Liverpoolfc's official website, said: 'I am going to England, I have decided.<br><br>'I will go to Liverpool and for many reasons, the main one is the coach Rafa Benitez. He is Spanish and knows me perfectly, which is worth a lot for a professional.<br><br>'We have asked Real Madrid to make a fast solution and I don't want to expand any further, except to say I am already looking through the English dictionary.'<br><br>Liverpool have also been hit by an injury to Harry Kewell, who they hoped would be able to play in the Premiership match against Chelsea on Saturday after missing two matches with a groin problem. Liverpool still rule out a possible operation, but the Australian midfielder visited a specialist yesterday and had an injection - and will be out for between four and five weeks.<br></div>
