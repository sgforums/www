              </span></p><p>Robbie Keane believes he is on the brink of a prolific partnership with Liverpool team-mate Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pair had struggled to hit it off in the early games this season, since Keane's £20million move from Spurs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in the last two matches both players have made goals for each other as well as finding the net themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keane's view was reinforced by the way the pair linked up in the 3-1 Champions League success over PSV Eindhoven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keane scored his first for Liverpool, created by the Spaniard,
              while Keane had helped to set up both of Torres' strikes against
              Everton at the weekend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now Keane said: "I helped make two for Fernando on Saturday and he has responded with a great assist for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Like any partnership it takes time, it never always works out straight away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We have been starting to link up well, I was involved in both
              the build-ups for his two goals at Everton and now he has made one for
              me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It is great for us and we will continue working hard at the
              partnership. Hopefully this is the beginning of a hat-full of goals for
              the pair of us."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Keane was relieved to net his first for the club on his 11th
              attempt. he said: "It was nice to score my first, to get it out of the
              way, to be honest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It was a good night for me, but the three points were more
              important. Fernando produced a fine run and cross for me to connect
              with, it went in and that problem is out of the way now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I can now concentrate on the next game and making sure that Liverpool win as a team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I did the cartwheel celebration because I said last season I
              would only do it on special occasions, and this was a special occasion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I have celebrated like that for many years, and dreamt from
              being a kid that one day I would do it for Liverpool. I've done it now,
              so maybe I'll put it back in the box for the next big occasion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I've changed my boots for the Champions League, maybe they are lucky boots now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But it is not really about luck, it is about training hard, winning and getting three points. That is all that matters to me."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He added: "I was delighted that Stevie (Gerrard) got his 100th
              too, we said to each other than it is always important to get these
              things out of the way - for both of us - because people keep on about
              it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"As players we do not tend to think so much about them, but I
              had the same situation at Spurs last season. It took me a few games to
              get my 100th goal there, much the same as Stevie has experienced here."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fellow forward Dirk Kuyt got in on the act with his 10th goal in
              16 European games for Liverpool, but he was happier to see Keane break
              his duck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: "It was great to see Robbie score, and to see how happy he was with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He deserved it because he has played really well in the last
              few games. He deserved that goal and I am sure he will score a lot
              more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It was also good to see Steven Gerrard score his 100th for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"That amount for a midfielder is amazing, it was a great
              achievement and another great goal. But when you look back at the goals
              he has scored, so many of them are as spectacular as that."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kuyt added: "It is a big difference to last season when we only had one point at this stage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But we have talked about the situation and set out to put that right this time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We have done what we set out to do, now with six points we must continue to build on that level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Three points in Madrid next will be very difficult, but it is a challenge we relish."</p>
