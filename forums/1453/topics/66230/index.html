            <div class='col-md body'>Extract from Liverpoolfc.tv<br><br>Gerard Houllier has urged Chairman David Moores to reconsider his pledge to look at his own position if Liverpool fail to qualify for next season's Champions League.<br><br>Houllier believes Moores remains the right men to stay at the helm at Anfield, insisting that continuity is the key towards a bright future for the club.<br><br>The Liverpool boss said: "The Chairman is the best supporter of this club. He is the best fan.<br><br>"He only wants the best for the club and last night I think he was saying that if people felt it would be in the best interests of Liverpool for him to look at his own position then he would do that.<br><br>"But I think that would be a mistake. Continuity is the key for this club. We are all in it together and we need to stay together."<br><br>Our dear GH is having cold feet now that the Chairman have put his head on the chopping board.<br><br>It is kind of strange that from beginning of the season till now, GH hold a STRONG belief that he will remain LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB MANAGER by the end of the season.<br><br>He choose to ignore call calling for his head.<br><br>And he seem unwillingly to give up his job.<br><br>Unlike Kevin Keegan, GH have no guts to say that he will resign if he fail to deliver.<br><br>He know that LFC dun sack their managers.<br><br>Now, Owen is for real fed up with GH empty promises and really decided to move on.<br><br>More players will follow <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> .<br><br></div>
