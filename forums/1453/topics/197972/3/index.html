We paid Â£3million for Jermaine plus we owe Arsenal 25% of any sell-on fee.<br><br>'We don't want to sell him for Â£3.5million, that's for sure. Now it's a question of how far Liverpool are prepared to go in meeting our valuation.'<br><br>Bruce could use the money from a Pennant deal for Coventry striker Gary McSheffrey after the player insisted he was committed to the Sky Blues.<br><br>Birmingham have had two bids rejected for the player who was Coventry's leading scorer last season.<br><br>Bruce is keen to bring in new firepower to supplement DJ Campbell, Mikael Forssell and Cameron Jerome, particularly after the sale of Emile Heskey to Wigan for Â£5.5million.</span></div>

That's how much he means to them. Liverpool have offered him less than half of that.<br><br>"The fee isn't a problem but Feyenoord want this paying quickly or with a significant advance of cash. Liverpool are tying to keep this amount low whereas Newcastle have offered a bigger incentive to Feyenoord to deal with them instead.<br><br>"Money has never been a big issue in Dirk's career which is why he's never been in a rush to leave Feyenoord."<br><br>He added: "Of course he'd prefer to move to Liverpool and if they pay him less he's fine with this. He will only move to Newcastle if the Anfield door is closed on him by Feyenoord."<br><br>Meanwhile the Liverpool Daily Post are today reporting that Rafa is 'back at his desk at Melwood today hoping to conclude the Â£10m switch of Dirk Kuyt'.</blockquote><a href="http://www.koptalk.com/detail_subtitle_listing.php?link_id=3996&amp;subid=2&amp;sticky=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.koptalk.com/detail_subtitle_listing.php?link_id=3996&amp;subid=2&amp;sticky=0</a></div>
