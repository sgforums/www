Owen will not go to Newcastle permanantly. First of all, the reason why he is desperate to leave is to play footy regularly this year since it is a World Cup year. But after that, what? Owen craves for European football. That's the reason why he left Anfield in the first place. Can Newcastle give him that? I don't think so. They may even have problems getting that UEFA Cup place, let alone Champions League.<br><br>I think there are more twist to this saga yet. Now that Newcastle has made their move, Liverpool will follow suit. But it won't be that high a price. So it's a matter of whether Real will want to accept our offer.</div>

The Magpies have no good strikers left after Craig Bellamy's departure. Alan Shearer has little time left, while Patrick Kluivert was shown to be a flop. Michael Owen is a proven goalscorer, and Newcastle's willingness to bid up to 15m pounds shows they are serious about bringing him on board.<br><br>It has always been a dream of mine to see Owen wearing the Black &amp; White of Newcastle United Football Club and banging in the goals alongside Shearer.</div>
