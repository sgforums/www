              <p><strong>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez is fast losing patience at Anfield and is considering walking out at the end of the season.<br><br></strong>The Tactician has had to suffer in silence as he missed out on numerous transfer targets due to the financial constraints he's currently under. Sources close to the Spaniard say he is feeling suffocated as the criticism mounts on him and his struggling team.<br><br>The Reds boss was in touching distance of delivering the Premier League to the Liverpool faithful last season. But Benitez feels powerless to improve on last terms heroics, having to work with such a small budget.<br><br>He has managed to sign Alberto Aquilani and Glen Johnson but the deals were funded from the sales of Alvaro Arbeloa, Xabi Alonso and Robbie Keane. The Reds manager has received no additional funds for transfers.<br><br>The Liverpool manager can only pray flops Ryan Babel, Lucas and Andrey Voronin start showing dramatic improvement. The Anfield chief had hoped to cash in this summer. But with the owner’s refusal to supplement any additional funds, suitable targets would still be out of Liverpool’s price range.</p>

              </span></p><hr>
              <br><br>Tom Hicks and George Gillett have plunged the Merseyside club into financial turmoil since they arrived in 2007. The American owners arrived with talk of big transfer kitties and a plush new stadium but in reality all they have brought is debt and instability.<br><br>There has been talk of big money takeovers ever since the Americans financial problems emerged. So far none of these have materialised. If the situation doesn’t change by the January transfer window, Benitez is seriously considering cutting short his tenure with the club. <br><br>The successful coach would rather walk away with his head held high than have his reputation trampled on.<br><br>Rafa is extremely concerned that the Americans will try to make him a scapegoat if poor results continue on the pitch.  The former Valencia chief has never had the best relationship with his bosses.  Friends have revealed the Spaniards growing paranoia that the Americans may wield the axe to shift the blame from them. <br><br>Benitez though, is unlikely to walk out mid-season out of respect for the Kop faithful. The Yanks would expect an angry fans backlash aimed at them following any such announcement from the supporters favourite.<br><br>In such a situation insiders believe the American owners would be loathe to having Benitez still at the club knowing that he would receive the fans backing and sympathy.<br><br>Reds legend Kenny Daglish has been made favourite to takeover the Anfield hot seat if Benitez were to go. Such a move would surely only be a short-term measure with the Scot having not managed a side in over ten years.<br><br>Daglish, who is currently employed with the youth team at the club, is 9/4 to be the next permanent manager.<br><br><p></p>
