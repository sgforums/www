            <div class='col-md body'>Pool are at the top of their game especially at home... They have only let in i think 3 goals all season at Anfield... But somehow or rather, united always seem to do well against Pool but not so against the gunners.<br><br>Anyway, it has been 5 long yrs since pool beaten united at Anfield in the Premiership... Hope this good record continues and united do manage to get at least a point from this as Anfield has become a very difficult place for away teams to get points.<br><br>They have played 14, won 11 / draw 3 / lose 0 / scored 29 / and let in 3 only so far.<br><br>The last time Pool beat United at Anfield in the Premiership was a 3-1 win in November 2001. Lets hope this record will last beyond sat...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the Barca tie just days away from this, you just wonder if Rafa will be dropping this game and resting a few of his key players.<br><br>But having said that, I think the players have had more than enough rest over the past week. Most of the players that played at the Nou Camp were rested in the game against Sheffield United. They would have had at least 7 days break so I'm really expecting them to come straight back into the team for 2 games in 4 days, which is not that demanding considering the rest they've had.<br><br>The only players that played in Barca and against Sheffield were Risse, Gerrard, Carragher and Finnan. I don't think Rafa can afford to rest any of them.<br><br>So, there you go, we can expect a full strength team up against United. Forget abt Barca for now, Liverpool vs ManU is the game of the season.<br><br>I'm expecting Pool to halt the run of Man U wins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, Pool really need to be at their full strength against Barce now that Eto is back and seems on form too. Pool going thru in the CL is still not a foregone conclusion even tho they may have a very good 2 - 1 lead... For Barce to win Pool by 2 goals or even a 3-2 score is still very possible given the attacking players they have.<br><br>Going through to the next stage of the CL will also give them a few more millions extra and a chance to win the only title left to them whereas winning against man u will still give them a no higher than a 3rd or 4th place finish which they have already made theirs. So Pool really got nothing much to gain by going all out to win apart from giving chelsea a chance as i guess nobody seriously belief Pool will be able to over-take the blues with about 10 games left to go.<br><br>So ah ben should put his eggs in the Barce basket and make sure they get thru and not waste them on what i would call a meaningless match from Liverpool's point of view...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
