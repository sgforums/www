            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez looked stunned by the defeat. He said: "I would have trouble explaining how we lost that in Spanish; in English I find it almost impossible. "We dominated the game, were in control and had plenty of attacks. Sometimes football is all about luck. When you have so much of the play and make chances without scoring, you must be careful against a team as good as United.<br><br>"United have a great defence and a fine goalkeeper. He stopped one from Peter Crouch at the end everyone felt was going in. But although we had so much of the game, we did not make too many chances. "The decision to disallow Craig Bellamy's effort in the first half for offside was right. It just was not our day."<br><br>He added: "United are really close to the title now. Chelsea are a good team, but they cannot make mistakes now because United will continue to win. "As for us, we are down now, but we will train hard and be ready for Barcelona on Tuesday."<br><br>Gone is Liverpool's 30-match unbeaten home league record, stretching back to October 2005.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a postive result actually ....... although we lost today , a better performed team lost today . I think most MU fans would say Liverpool make MU looked like an average team today , base on our performance .<br><br>Evra were their weakest ..... then they took him out , Silvestre in .<br><br>Then we attack from their 2nd weakest link , Gary Neville ! Then they sent in O'Shea , as cover for Neville just infront of the 2 centre backs .<br><br>It's the best Liverpool performance since Benitez took over .<br><br>I can't say MU played well and won ..... and i can't say too , they won by luck , EPL is a season long ball-game , so , this match just another match for MU , they are on-top cos they were fantastic thru'out the season , with 9 games to go .<br><br>MU never move their tactics backward , but today , we saw them moved backwards - Defending twice .<br><br>Until that well-taken , fatal free-kick .<br><br>The rest is history .<br><br>Still , i am proud of our performance . No doubt about that .<br><br>hey , Barcelona just got beaten by Sevilla .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Had Carragher not injured Rooney, i guess O'Shea wouldn't have taken part in this match at all... As they say, everything happens for a reason... and every action has a reaction... In this case, it just happens that O'shea came on late in a game that he wasn't even suppose to play and scored the winning goal...<br><br>Actually i was rather pleased when i saw Ah ben taking out Bellamy instead of Kuyt. I thought that was a mistake on Pool's part. Bell was the one causing all the trouble to united.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought Pool players used up a lot ot energy throughout this match... They were running all over the place trying to unsettle the united players and prevent them from playing their normal slow passing game by rushing to every united player that had the ball... The problem is this type of play tho good but will use up a lot of physical strength and towards the end... they became more tired and less alert. And it could also take more than 2, 3 days for them to recover fully...</div>
