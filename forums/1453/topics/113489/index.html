            <div class='col-md body'>Leeds' young goalkeeping star Scott Carson will join Liverpool within the next 24 hours due to his desire to play being more important than pay.<br>Not even the wealth of Roman Abramovich has been able to tempt Carson to Chelsea, with Liverpool beating their Premiership rivals to the signature of the 19-year-old, who would have been out of contract at Elland Road this summer.<br><br>After making an initial bid of Â£250,000 a fortnight ago for Carson, one which was flatly rejected by Leeds, it is understood Liverpool have significantly upped their offer.<br><br>The Reds are believed to have agreed a figure of around Â£750,000 for the England Under-21 international, with add-ons taking the sum up to the Â£1million mark.<br><br>With Championship side Leeds still crippled by debt and facing administration, the cash will come as a much-needed boost, even if manager Kevin Blackwell is losing another of the club's promising young players.<br><br>Carson is apparently due to undergo a medical with Liverpool today before then agreeing personal terms on a four-and-a-half-year contract.<br><br>That is not expected to be a problem as Chelsea were willing to offer Carson a lucrative deal over the same period of time, with the road to such riches an attractive one.<br><br>However, it is understood Carson felt his opportunities would have been limited behind the sensational Petr Cech at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>After savouring Premiership football last season with Leeds, playing and distinguishing himself against Manchester United and, coincidentally, Chelsea at a time when former goalkeeper Paul Robinson was suspended, Carson would like to shine again at the highest level.<br><br>With Chris Kirkland likely to be out for the rest of the season with a back injury, and Jerzy Dudek attracting criticism for his inconsistent performances, there may be the chance for Carson to prove himself with the Reds sooner rather than later.<br><br>Should Carson pass the medical, and it is anticipated there will not be any problems, he will become Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez's first signing from outside Spain.<br><br>In confirming Carson's move to Liverpool, United spokesman Bryan Morris said: 'We wish Scott the very best at his new club.<br><br>'He has proven himself to be a top-class keeper during his time at Leeds United and we are sure he will continue to impress at Anfield.<br><br>'His steady nerve in pressure situations and his professionalism on and off the pitch will ensure he has a bright future ahead of him.'<br><br>Liverpool spokesman Ian Cotton confirmed that Carson was heading to Merseyside for a medical.<br><br>He told the club's website: 'We have agreed terms with Leeds for Scott Carson. He will come to Liverpool today for a medical and to discuss personal terms.'</div>
