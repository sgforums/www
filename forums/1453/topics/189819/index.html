            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that based on merit, Theo Walcott don't deserve to go to the World Cup.<br><br>What has he done? He has nvr played for Arsenal. Only a BIG FAT PRICE TAG on him. He is all word, no action yet. Unproven. and a BIG gamble. so BIG that it's illogical.<br><br>There are tons of others that deserve the place more.<br><br>Darren Bent....he must be thinking what else must he do to get a call up. Scored so many goals in the EPL this season.<br><br>Talk about Pace, Jermaine Defoe has the pace too what .He scores goals even when mostly deployed as a subsititute striker.<br><br>Even Andrew  Johnson and Robbie Fowler deserve to go more than Walcott.<br><br>Of cos, I might be too harsh on Theo, he may turn out to be the superstar wonderkid this June for all i know...but until then, my stand is that Sven must be out of his mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was interesting to read how the English press reacted to Eriksson's selection especially in relation to Lennon and Walcott.<br><br>The press regarded the inclusion of Lennon as fair on the basis of his current form and abilities. On the inclusion of Walcott, quite a few columnists regarded that as a masterstroke by the England manager. Walcott will bring extra pace to the England set-up and hopefully terrorise defenders in the last 20 minutes of a game (as some of you have pointed out).  Its true that on the basis of merit and achievement, this young lad cannot be compared with Bent or Defoe but Walcott can be a trump card in turning the game round.<br><br>Eriksson and Wenger are no fools but we will all await with bated breath at England's first friendly against Hungary to see if the choice was justified.</div>
