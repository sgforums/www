            <div class='col-md body'><p>Daniel Agger has revealed he was made ''no promises'' about his first-team place from Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez when he agreed to sign a new contract.<br>Click Here<br><br>The Danish defender was involved in months of negotiations about a new deal last season, amid claims he had demanded a massive wage rise and assurances about regular first-team football.<br><br>But Agger has agreed a new five-year deal, although he confirmed at the weekend he had not yet put pen to paper.<br><br>Agger said: ''In football you can't get any promises from the manager about when you are going to play, and especially not at a club like Liverpool where we have so many talented players all competing for places.<br><br>''I believe I am good enough to play regularly in this team and that is what Iwant to do.''<br><br>The 24 year-old told the club's website: ''I believe this team, with the players we have, will be able to challenge for many honours and trophies over the next few years. I think I have a chance to play in this team, otherwise I would not be staying at the club.<br><br>''And I really like this city, and I like the people who live here. It's not the same as my home town, Copenhagen, but I actually really like where I live. That is important. I believe if you have a happy, settled and comfortable life outside the pitch then you're going to be a much better player on it.''<br><br>Agger will be competing with Jamie Carragher, Martin Skrtel and young reserve defender Martin Kelly next season, now that Sami Hyypia has left the club.<br><br>But Benitez is believed to be chasing Portsmouth defender Sylvain Distin, so competition will be as sharp as ever for the Denmark international.<br><br>Agger added: ''Of course, if you have a manager who tells you that he is confident in your ability and he believes in you and what you can bring to the team, then that is also important.<br><br>''The manager has done this by coming to me and offering me the contract.''<br><br>Former Tranmere goalkeeper John Achterberg, 37, has left Prenton Park after 11 years' service to join Liverpool's coaching staff. He will look after the reserve- and youth-team keepers.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>AGGER: WHY I COMMITTED FUTURE</strong><br><br>Daniel Agger has explained why he was happy to agree a new Liverpool contract - even without guarantees from Rafa Benitez about first-team football.<br><br>The Dane accepted a new five-year deal last month despite having to settle for 26 senior appearances in 2008-09.<br> <br>And Agger has revealed how Benitez made no promises about when he would play.<br> <br>Even so, the 24-year-old was delighted at the opportunity to commit his prime years to Liverpool.<br> <br>"First of all, I believe this team, with the players we have, will be able to challenge for many honours and trophies over the next few years," Agger explained to LFC Magazine.<br> <br>"Secondly, I think I have a chance to play in this team, otherwise I would not be staying at the club.<br> <br>"Thirdly, I really like this city, and I like the people who live here. It's not the same as my home town, Copenhagen, but I actually really like where I live. That's important.<br> <br>"I believe if you have a happy, settled and comfortable life outside the pitch then you're going to be a much better player on it."<br> <br>Agger added: "Of course, if you have a manager who tells you that he is confident in your ability and he believes in you and what you can bring to the team, then that is also important. The manager has done this by coming to me and offering me the contract.<br> <br>"In football you can't get any promises from the manager about when you are going to play, and especially not at a club like Liverpool where we have so many talented players all competing for places.<br> <br>"I believe I am good enough to play regularly in this team and that's what I want to do."<br> <br>Agger arrived at Anfield in January 2006, just a few months before the FA Cup triumph over West Ham.<br> <br>However, the Dane played no part in the Cup run and is still waiting for what he would regard as his 'first' medal with Liverpool.<br> <br>It's a situation Agger is desperate to address.<br> <br>"Everybody wants medals, they want trophies and they want success," he said. "That is what a club like Liverpool should be all about.<br> <br>"I won both the league and cup in my first season at Brondby. I haven't won anything at Liverpool so far and that is something I really want to change.<br> <br>"We won the FA Cup in my first season at the club but I didn't play a game in the competition that season. So although I have a medal for that victory I don't count it as my having won it."<br> <br>Having helped the Reds to within an inch of the Barclays Premier League title, Agger is confident a piece of silverware is on the horizon in 2009-10.<br> <br>"I think you can see on the pitch this season, and especially in the last few games, what playing for this club means for the team," he said.<br> <br>"We have showed that we have a winning character now throughout the team. We have developed this season a mentality which says that you can't beat us.<br> <br>"Even when we are in a difficult position we have a belief in our ability to change the result."</p></div>
