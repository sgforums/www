            <div class='col-md body'>Today's ST got report on this. I also found this online.<br><br><blockquote>Henry To Liverpool Speculation Spreads  What, on the face of it, sounds the unlikeliest rumour of the summer so far, appears to be gaining currency.<br>Henry To Liverpool Speculation Spreads<br><br>Today's Daily Mail reports that bookmakers William Hill have been forced to slash their odds on Arsenal's Thierry Henry moving to ....Liverpool, after receiving a glut of bets on the transfer.<br><br>The bookies have cut the chances of the Gunners' captain playing his home games at Anfield rather than the Emirates next season from 10/1 to 3/1.<br><br>The decision apparently follows a 48-hour frenzy of gambling on the transfer going ahead.  Hill's spokesman, Graham Sharpe, said: "We started to take calls asking for odds for Henry to join Liverpool a couple of days ago and initially offered 10/1, not believing it was that likely a move for the Frenchman.<br><br>"However, after taking increasingly more calls and bets - mainly from the Liverpool area - we have shortened the odds significantly just in case there is something to the story, which has yet to emerge into the public domain."<br><br>The possibility of such a move has been buzzing around certain internet sites for some time now, though if Henry does leave Arsenal - which is by no means certain yet - he seems more likely to head for Spain or possibly Italy.<br><br>Henry, who missed much of last season with various injury problems, has been complimentary in the past about the Liverpool fans and the special Anfierld atmosphere, but moving there from his beloved Arsenal seems a far-fetched notion. He has repeatedly said he is happy living in London and playing for the Arsenal fans, although his resolve may have been shaken by recent developments, notably the effect on manager Arsene Wenger of vice-chairman David Dein's departure from the Arsenal board, and the Gunners' failure to mount a strong challenge for honours last season.<br><br>However, thus far, the speculation about a possible exit from the Emirates Stadium of the the Gunners' all-time top scorer is no more than gossip.<br><br>Barcelona and AC Milan have both expressed interest in the man who has netted 226 goals for the Gunners since joining the club in 1999. </blockquote><a href="http://goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=322467" rel="nofollow">http://goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=322467</a><br><br>Seriously, how did this happened? It'll be a great shock if this becomes real.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
