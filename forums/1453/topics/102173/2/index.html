And even if he gets close to the defender, he does'nt try to tackle the ball.Instead, he pushes the defender and commits the foul. His lack of pace makes him look more clumsy.<br><br>Its only Palace tonight. Can't imagine what will happen when Josemi is up against the likes of Reyes,Henry,Duff or Robben.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why get a defender from Spain in the first place?<br><br>Is Spain or England more well-known for defense?<br><br>So far, I would say only Alonso lived up to his price tag...<br>Josemi... I hope I never see him in a red jersey again...<br>Garcia... Have to learn how to convert chances and hold the ball well...<br><br>For the other players:<br>Kewell... Showed some potential down the flanks, might be better as left-mid than striker...<br>Hamman... waiting for Gerrard to be back...<br><br>Let's pray Finnan is right-back for next game...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">I think what Benitez trying to do , is to do a Carbone in Liverpool . This Valencia Carbone is a damn good right back , tough tackling , and run deep too , and crosses well .......but this Josemi ????? Run can la , slow a bit ...tough tackling , yes and no , yes to sure commit foul , no as sure got red card anyhow tackle ..... cross , yes la , but cross into wrong channel..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope Benitz openly criticise Josemi as in he criticise Kewell .</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Baros - Although Baros was the saviour for last night, his performance were too individualistic and gunning for personal glory. There are a few cases where better chances can be created if he passed the ball to Riise. But, being a striker, you have to be selfish at times.<br><br>Garcia - Need to go for target practice. Have not fulfil his role as a playmaker in connecting the passes.<br><br>Kewell - Should be dropped as he is all around the places at the wrong time. Cannot hold ball, got some tackle-phobia. He will still get his first team as he is ah ben's favourite boy.<br><br>Finnan - Was very impressive in holding up the right wing and stringing passes into the 6-yard box.<br><br>Alonso - Was excellent in springing passes but need a harder man to hold up the ball, some one like Biscan or Gerrard.<br><br>Taore - Another hard working Liverpool player, but tend to wander too much up front. Maybe it is ah ben's tactics.<br><br>Josemi - Consistent under-performer for the past five matches. He is the weakest link and tend to make mistakes in tackling and calling offside. Myabe he should play more reserves game to gain the momentum of the English game.<br><br>The good thing about the past few matches is that Liverpool is creaitng more chances at the six yard box but they still need some one station there and be alert enough to score.<br><br></div>
