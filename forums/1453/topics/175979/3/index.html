But not in white, not in a Blue.. never...no matter how much goals he scored.<br><br>Yeh, I'm excited abt his partnership with Crouch.<br><br>Cisse, I always felt.. a disruptive element in the LFC camp with his nonchalant attitude on the field and whinings.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fowler will definitely be in the squad against Birmingham , and maybe who knows , after 2-0 to Liverpool , Benitez may well throw him into the ring , and let the fans know why exactly did he signed Fowler .<br><br>Trust me , being at 30 , being a Scouser , and playing at Anfield , and playing for his beloved club , age cannot defy passion .<br><br>Trust me , when you are passionate about something , if your mind say yes , your body will follow .</div>
