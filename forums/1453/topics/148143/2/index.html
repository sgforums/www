He's more of a tricky forward than a winger IMO. And Cisse is a striker for gewd;s sake... technically he's good in the box but tactically and technically, he needs hellava improvement on the right.<br><br>Rafa did brought in a centre back but the young spaniard is one for the future and we still need a experienced back-up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I beg to differ, LFC does need wingers in all aspect. Great headers like Nando needs decent services from the wings as he had demonstrated given the opportunities.<br><br>It's funny sheetz cos LFC hadn't had decent wingers since what... McManaman left for RM? While Bolo looks hardworking on the left/centre/right... he didn't threaten much against the opposition.<br><br>If the line of attack is not align, it's hard for the strikers to get services and shots at goal. Misalignment of Line of attack occurs when you push to attack but ya flanks or centre is not supporting you and the attack breaks down. Gerrard made things click in the centre but the wings not doing their part to provide decent crosses.<br><br>Look at how C Ronaldo's substitution brought life into Man Utd's game against Boro. He took on the defenders, ruffled the defences and provide decent crosses. They can made a difference.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>We do need a right winger but that will not solve the problem. I think it is evident that something must be changed in the striking department as well. Playing with just one striker is not good. Probably Crouch is bought to fill that role. Morientes is just a temporary solution. But even then, I don't think playing with just one striker is going to work. I still have big doubts over Cisse's ability to produce goals. So he is not my ideal striking partner for Crouch. Also, I think the porblem now is that Rafa wants to play Gerrard, Alonso and Sissoko. So no choice but to go with 1 striker.<br><br>I have a suggestion. Why not play Gerrard at the right midfield? I am sure he will be better than Cisse or Garcia. Garcia is too lightweight and his trickery isn't impressive. Cisse is just not a right midfielder (remember Diouf?). Since Liverpool is blessed with good centre midfielder like Alonso, Sissoko and Hamann, I think playing Gerrard on the right is still ok. I think he has played in that position before. By doing that, we can play with 2 strikers. Also, Gerrard can have the option of playing as a free role behind the front two.<br><br>And my ideal strikers will be Crouch and Owen. So I think we really need to bring Owen back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys. I don't understand why the dissapointment and pessimistic when Liverpool has won the game. Yes. It's only 1-0 and yes, the performance is not exactly vintage. But still, that's 3 points in the bag and that's all that matters at the end of the season. Nobody is going to care at the end of the season that Liverpool did not perform particularly well at home to Sunderland. Just ask Chelsea last week at Wigan.<br><br>Liverpool won 1-0 and there are people who began to write off Liverpool's chances. Yet did you ppl write off Chelsea's chances when they nearly lost at Wigan? Chelsea were lucky they won at Wigan and they were lucky to win against Arsenal. That goal was really a fluke. I don't think Drogba knew where exactly the ball is and it just happens to fall on his shin and bounces into the net.  So if luck was not on their side, Chelsea could have got just 1 or 2 points so far this season.<br><br>Now was Liverpool lucky to get 4 points now? No, in fact, I think we were unlucky not to have 6 points. We were definitely unlucky not to get 3 points at Boro. If only Gerrard was in his scoring mood that day, we would have won. And at Anfield, there's nothing lucky about Alonso's strike. And Liverpool didn't look at losing the match either. Yes. Sunderland did pose us some problems. But at the end, they were not even close to scoring.<br><br>So cmon guys. It's only 2 games into the season and we have got 4 points and they are not due to luck. So get your chins up and there's plenty more to look forward to.</div>
