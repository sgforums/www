              <p><em>The following is a statement from New England Sports Ventures.<br><br></em>New England Sports Ventures ("NESV") can confirm that their bid for Liverpool FC has been selected by the Club's Board of Directors and agreement has been reached with the Board to purchase the Club. NESV wishes to extend its appreciation to the Board for their diligence and their efforts on behalf of Liverpool FC and its supporters.</p>
              <p>NESV wants to create a long-term financially solid foundation for Liverpool FC and is dedicated to ensuring that the Club has the resources to build for the future, including the removal of all acquisition debt. Our objective is to stabilize the Club and ultimately return Liverpool FC to its rightful place in English and European football, successfully competing for and winning trophies.</p>
              <p>Since 2001, New England Sports Ventures has made successful investments in sports and entertainment properties. Our portfolio of companies, including the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park, New England Sports Network, Fenway Sports Group and Roush Fenway Racing are all committed to one common goal: winning. NESV wants to help bring back the culture of winning to Liverpool FC.</p>
              <p>We have a proven track record, shown clearly with the Boston Red Sox. The team has won two World Series Championships over the past six years. We will bring the same kind of openness, passion, dedication and professionalism to Liverpool FC.</p>
              <p>We are hopeful with regard to the pending legal and English Premier League procedures now underway, however, in light of these issues, we will respectfully refrain from comment or further actions at this time.</p>
              <p><strong>Background on NESV</strong></p>
              <p>Created in 2001, New England Sports Ventures is one of the largest sports, media and entertainment companies in the world with a proven track record of success for each of its subsidiaries. NESV's portfolio of companies includes: 100 percent of the Boston Red Sox, a Major League Baseball club; 80 percent of New England Sports Network, a regional sports television network; 100 percent of Fenway Sports Group, a sales and marketing company; and 50% of Roush Fenway Racing, a NASCAR racing team.</p>
              <p>NESV is led by Principal Owner John Henry and Chairman Tom Werner, who collectively have more than 30 years of experience as owners in Major League Baseball. This ownership group has been voted as the best in MLB by the readers of the Sports Business Journal in each of the past two years, and in 2009 Sports Illustrated selected this group as the number one ownership group in MLB.</p>
              <p><strong>NESV Achievements</strong></p>
              <p>From 2002 through 2009, the Boston Red Sox have had the second highest regular season winning percentage in MLB, have qualified for the postseason in a club record six of the past seven seasons, and have won more postseason games and World Series Championships than any other club. In addition to a commitment to winning, NESV has made a significant investment into extensive improvements to Fenway Park, resulting in additional seating, more concourse space, expanded concessions options, and an overall enhancement to the Fenway Park fan experience. The Red Sox have also been deeply committed to supporting the community. Since 2002, the Red Sox Foundation has donated more than $38 million to worthy charitable programs throughout New England, and the team through its Community Relations efforts has given away more than 27,000 autographed items and Fenway experiences to be used in fundraising efforts, and has helped facilitate more than 4,000 player and alumni appearances in the community.</p>
              <p>New England Sports Network has had the highest rated MLB games for the past six seasons from 2004 through 2009, and in 2009 delivered the highest television household ratings among all regional sports networks in the United States. NESN has also created a large amount of unique and original television content and is at the forefront of the industry in terms of digital media.</p>
              <p>In addition to assisting with sponsorship sales for both the Red Sox and NESN, Fenway Sports Group serves as the exclusive sales agency for other tier one properties and brands such as Major League Baseball Advanced Media, Boston College, and the Deutsche Bank Championship PGA Tour event; helping many of its clients grow sponsorship revenues by more than 20% annually. FSG also manages all non-baseball events hosted at Fenway Park, including the hockey events centered around the 2010 NHL Winter Classic, the Fenway Football Challenge, and major concerts. FSG provides specialized sports business consulting services for other professional sports teams, assisting the Miami Dolphins in selling the naming rights deal for Sun Life Stadium.</p>
              <p>Roush Fenway Racing is one of NASCAR's premier racing teams and has won 32 championships and more than 360 races in drag racing, sports car and stock car racing; as well as five championships across NASCAR's three premier series.</p>
              <p><strong>John Henry, Principal Owner</strong></p>
              <p>Henry's background includes finance and agriculture, and he is a former limited partner of the New York Yankees and sole owner of the Florida Marlins. He is in the Futures Hall of Fame. He sits on the Executive Council of MLB and manages the Roush Fenway Racing relationship. He is an active board member of Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) and specializes in digital media issues. Henry is passionate about soccer and lives in Boston, Massachusetts and Boca Raton, Florida.</p>
              <p><strong>Tom Werner, Chairman</strong></p>
              <p>Werner's background includes Harvard, ABC, and Carsey-Werner, and he is the former owner of the San Diego Padres. He produced some of the biggest hit series in television history such as The Cosby Show, Roseanne, 3rd Rock from the Sun and That 70's Show.
