            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Eriksson names Cole as top player</strong></span><br><br>Sven-Goran Eriksson has named Chelsea's Joe Cole as his choice for the Premiership's Footballer of the Year.<br><br>The England coach does not have a vote but, asked who he would nominate, said: "Thierry Henry has been important for Arsenal in the last games, or Joe Cole.<br><br>"I put him on the bench many times but today is different - Cole is a complete football player.<br><br>"He knows when to do tricks and when not to. You should never take that away from him, it's one of his strengths."<br><br>Eriksson added that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has played a significant part in Cole's development.<br><br>"I think Joe has been in the England squad every time if he is fit," said the England coach.<br><br>"I always believed in him, even when he did too many tricks and lost the ball sometimes where he shouldn't lose it, but I always believed in him because his talent is incredible.<br><br>"I think Mourinho has done a great job with him, absolutely fantastic.<br><br>"I don't know how he did it but I suppose it's a case of 'do what I want or you sit on the bench.'<br><br>"I didn't need to say that to Joe because I put him on the bench many times."<br><br>Cole has cemented a place in the England team, usually starting on the left side of midfield and Eriksson admitted that he had played a role in the player's development.<br><br>"During the last year, I think Joe is the most improved player," said Eriksson.<br><br>"He lives for football and when he was on the bench when Claudio Ranieri was the manager at Chelsea he was very frustrated.<br><br>"There was one day when reception at Soho Square told me 'Joe Cole is here and wants to have tea with you!'<br><br>"He didn't know what to do because he couldn't play for Chelsea and wanted to talk to me. I spoke to him and said 'keep going, work harder, dont think too much.'<br><br>"Since then he has done very well. And I know he wants to do a very good World Cup."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is Thierry Henry , who single handedly brought Arsenal to beat Real , here we have Wayne Rooney , who also single-handedly brought MU into 2nd , we have also Jamie Carragher , who has been brilliant for the last 5 years .....including one European Cup , who has doubt his commitment ?<br><br>Let's discount Stevie Gee and Lampard , we have got players like John Terry , Newcastle's Shay Given ..... so many , just because Cole played in a Championship team ?<br><br>I sense that it's more or less a encouragement b4 the World Cup .

            <div class='col-md body'>Joe Cole has improved a lot over the past few seasons. He seems to have peaked under Jose Mourinho.<br><br>But to be footballer of the year is another story. Over the years we have seen either skippers, influential key players, consistent performers or 20-30 goal getters basked with that honor. In that aspect, I feel that Joe Cole lacks the consistency. He's been brilliant in some games but seemingly ineffective in others.<br><br>I think the likes of John Terry, Thierry Henry and Steven Gerrard are ahead of Cole in the race for player of the year.</div>
