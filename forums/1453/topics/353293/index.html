              <p>A 2-0 victory in this fixture last season saw the Reds open up an
              eight-point advantage in fourth place over nearest rivals Everton,
              which all but guaranteed a Champions League place for the following
              season. <br> <br> But with both clubs in very different positions from that April
              afternoon encounter, expect a totally different match this time around.
              <br> <br> Five of the Liverpool team that won that day have now moved on to
              pastures new, while Fulham also look a very different outfit and are
              not in the relegation dogfight of last season. <br> <br> The Reds should have every reason to be confident, however. They've won
              four of the last six clashes down the years at Craven Cottage...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Skipper Steven Gerrard has warned Liverpool they will have to be on top form to beat a potentially fresher Fulham team this weekend.<br><br>Eleven of Rafa Benitez's first-team squad were involved in internationals this week - substantially more than their opponents.<br> <br>And with Craven Cottage playing host to a Manchester United defeat two weeks ago, Gerrard knows three points are far from a given.<br> <br>"The good thing now is that we can put the internationals to the back of our minds and just concentrate on the run-in," he said.<br> <br>"The last three weeks have been among the most enjoyable in my Liverpool career and we want to keep that momentum going.<br> <br>"We know that it is going to be difficult at Craven Cottage. They are a team that deserves respect; just look at what they did against Manchester United.<br> <br>"Maybe because they don't have as many internationals as us, they might be fresher. We know they will be up for it - they are chasing a European place, so there is something riding on this game for them."<br> <br>Another player hoping to put the internationals out of his mind is Javier Mascherano, whose Argentina side lost 6-1 to Bolivia.<br> <br>The midfielder said: "For some of us, playing in the altitude was something new, for others not so much, but we can't say that we lost because of the altitude.<br> <br>"Our rivals played better and nothing turned out right for us.<br> <br>"This should serve us as a lesson and it will surely consolidate the squad, who are very united and growing in every aspect."</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>We look back on our last five trips to Fulham ahead of Saturday's clash.<br>There are some memorable moments in there, including a dramatic 4-2 win in Rafa's first season.<br> <br>A repeat this time around would send Liverpool to the top of the Barclays Premier League...<br><br>Fulham 0-2 Liverpool<br>Premier League - April 2008<br> <br>Liverpool went eight points clear in fourth place after goals from Jermaine Pennant and Peter Crouch gave them a comfortable 2-0 win at Craven Cottage. Victory was the perfect preparation for our Champions League semi-final with Chelsea, while defeat for Fulham left them perilously close to the relegation trap door.<br> <br>Fulham 1-0 Liverpool<br>Premiership - May 2007<br> <br>Fulham secured Premiership survival with a 1-0 win over the Reds courtesy of a 66th minute goal from substitute Clint Dempsey. After the midweek victory over Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final, Rafael Benitez took the opportunity to rest the likes of Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Crouch and Dirk Kuyt. Emiliano Insua made his second start for the club while Robbie Fowler partnered Craig Bellamy in attack. Fowler and Bellamy both missed good chances and Argentine Gabriel Paletta had a goal disallowed but it was Fulham's day as Lawrie Sanchez guided the Cottagers to safety.<br> <br>Fulham 2-0 Liverpool<br>Premiership - October 2005<br> <br>Liverpool slipped to their second league defeat of the season thanks to goals from Collins John and Luis Boa Morte. It might have been different but for the form of former Reds stopper Tony Warner, who thwarted Harry Kewell, Luis Garcia, Sami Hyypia and Djibril Cisse after coming on as a 62nd minute substitute. The game was preceded by a minute's silence for late Fulham legend Johnny Haynes.<br> <br>Fulham 2-4 Liverpool<br>Premiership - October 2004<br> <br>One of the club's most memorable Premiership games during which Rafa's Reds demonstrated for the first time the bouncebackability that would bring us all so much joy in the seasons to come. Summer signing Xabi Alonso was the catalyst this time, coming on for Salif Diao following a dire first half which ended with the home side two up. Luis Boa Morte's brace was quickly made irrelevant with goals from Milan Baros, Alonso, Igor Biscan and an OG from Zat Knight. Not even a late sending off for new boy Josemi could tarnish Rafa's first away win in the league.<br><br>Fulham 1-2 Liverpool<br>Premiership - November 2003<br><br>A penalty from Danny Murphy two minutes from time sealed an excellent victory at Loftus Road. A superb volley from Emile Heskey had earlier been levelled by Louis Saha, and the game looked like it was heading for a draw until substitute Florent-Sinama Pongolle was hacked down in the box. The win left Gerard Houllier's side two points behind fourth-placed Birmingham.</p></div>

              <p>Fulham boss Roy Hodgson will have a fully-fit squad to choose from as
              he sets about plotting another 'Big Four' casualty when Liverpool visit
              Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, ever-present midfielder Danny Murphy
              should once again start in the centre of the field to face his former
              employers.</p>
              <p>Murphy spent seven years at Anfield, representing the
              club almost 200 times, but all former ties will be put aside when the
              Cottagers captain takes to the pitch on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Mark
              Schwarzer intends to do his part in aiding Fulham's surge up the
              Premier League ladder by keeping a sheet clean against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The
              west London outfit downed Manchester United by a two goal scoreline
              without one riposte from Sir Alex Ferguson's men in their last match,
              and the Fulham glovesman is hoping Rafael Benitez's Reds will be dealt
              a similar fate.</p>
              <p>"You want to play well against a team like
              Liverpool because they're quite rightly regarded as one of the best
              teams in the world,'' Schwarzer said.</p>
              <p>"We have a lot of respect for them, but we want to get one up on them as well.</p>
              <p>"There
              are eight games to go and we've got some very difficult games to come
              and we'll take each game as it comes but we definitely want to finish
              in the top half of the table.</p>
              <p>"If we can continue our current form over the coming games who knows what will happen,'' he concluded.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are likely to be without defender Sami Hyypia and midfielder Yossi Benayoun.</p>
              <p>Hyypia returned from international duty with a knee injury and Benayoun, also on World Cup quali</p>
              <p>Liverpool
              forward Dirk Kuyt has signed a two-year extension to his contract,
              tying him to the Merseyside club until at least 2012.</p>
              <p>The
              28-year-old Holland international's current deal was due to expire at
              the end of next season and manager Rafael Benitez is delighted Kuyt has
              joined captain Steven Gerrard in committing his long-term future to
              Liverpool.</p>
              <p>He told www.liverpoolfc.tv: "This is another great piece of news for the club.</p>
              <p>"Dirk
              had one year left on his contract and we were keen for him to stay. He
              is a player with great quality who has a big part to play in our
              future. We are delighted to have reached an agreement.</p>
              <p>"To have
              announced new deals for Steven and Dirk on the same day shows how hard
              everyone is working and that we are moving forward quickly as a club.
              These are very positive messages and I am very happy.''</p>
              <p>Liverpool announced earlier that Gerrard had signed a deal which will keep him at Anfield until 2013.</p>
              <p>Kuyt joined Liverpool from Feyenoord in the summer of 2006 and has been transformed from a striker into a right-winger.</p>
              <p>He
              has scored 10 goals in 41 appearances for the Reds this season and has
              emerged as a key figure in Benitez's title-chasing team.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
              are currently one point behind Barclays Premier League leaders
              Manchester United having played a game more than their bitter rivals.</p>
              <p>Jamie Carragher wants Liverpool to be top of the Barclays Premier League to put maximum pressure on champions Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Defender
              Carragher said: "We have got an opportunity to go top of the league
              with United playing on Sunday and it is one we have got to take.</p>
              <p>"We
              have got to try to pick up three points in every game and try to catch
              United. A draw is probably not a great result, even though we can go
              top with a point because of the goal difference.</p>
              <p>"But when the game is finished on Saturday, we want to be top of the league.''</p>
              <p>The
              31 year-old knows it is vital that Liverpool take maximum points from
              all their remaining fixtures to put maximum pressure on the champions.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "You would not have expected United to lose two games on the
              bounce. That is the way the title race is in England, though.</p>
              <p>"Every
              game is very difficult and it just goes to show how well we have done
              this season when United lose two games in a week, but we've only lost
              two league games all season.</p>
              <p>"We are only one point behind now,
              but United still have a game in hand, but between now and the end our
              aim is to try to win every game so their extra game doesn't count.''</p>
