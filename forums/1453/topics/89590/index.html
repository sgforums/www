            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i dont see a diff from how the player perform before and after GH left.<br><br>i simply cant see the desire in liverpool players winning the ball on 50-50 situations. in the second half, spurs defenders were given all the liberty to kick the ball around in their own half without any form of pressure but not vice versa!<br><br>basically, only gerrard and josemi were the players doing all the work.<br><br>each liverpool player is paid at least S$100k per week, but they lose possession and made mistake like those schoolboys fooling around the void deck.<br><br>i still stick to what i said last season. it was really not all about the coach, players are partly responsible as well.<br><br>i dont expect magic from ah ben in the first competitive game. however, if the players still prefer to play with so little determination and aggression, who coach also the same lar.</div>

It'll not work in long terms !<br><br>2ndly , Murphy's position is sorely missed ! I missed his one-twos , splitting-passes , through-balls ...we need someone of Murphy's mode in Liverpool's set-up , sadly , he left ! So sad too , Murphy's Charlton was thrashed 4-1 at Bolton !<br><br>3rdly , we are in need of a players that can run at defenders , at Spurs' game , we don't see someone that run after their defense and create some havoc for them , we are in need of several input of players !<br><br>Or alternativesly , bring back Cheyrou , maybe he can do a Murphy's Law for LFC !<br><br>Next game : @ Anfield vs Man City<br><br>Go Reds Go !</span></span></div>
