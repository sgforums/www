              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Gone: Benitez is now at Inter Milan </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Fernando Torres admits Rafa Benitez had to leave Liverpool
               - and the striker has refused to commit his own future to the club.</p>
              <p>Benitez was axed by the Reds earlier this month after 
              leading the club to seventh in the Barclays Premier League - their worst
               finish for 11 years - before replacing Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Mired
               in internal conflict and financial doubts that have intensified over 
              the last 12 months, Liverpool face a fight to hold on to their star 
              players this summer - and Torres is not surprised that Benitez was shown
               the door.</p>
              <p>'At this point I think it was best for everyone,' 
              Torres told Spanish newspaper AS.</p>
              <p>'He won everything, and last 
              year they demanded too much from him.'</p>
              <p>Benitez
              led the club to their fifth European Cup win in 2005 - their first for
              21 years - and was central to persuading Torres to leave Atletico
              Madrid to become Liverpool's record signing in 2007.</p>
              <p>However,
              the Spain striker is still waiting to win a major honour, leading
              Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester City to wonder if he is open to a
              transfer this summer.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old has previously
              insisted he is happy to stay at Liverpool but has warned that the team
              needs to bring in world class recruits.</p>
              <p>Conversely, team-mates Javier Mascherano, Steven Gerrard, Yossi
              Benayoun and Dirk Kuyt have been linked with moves away from Anfield.</p>

              mark in South Africa just yet</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>On the eve of playing for his country in the World Cup last 16 match
              against Portugal, Torres shunned questions about his future but hinted
              he was frustrated at the uncertainty at Anfield.</p>
              <p>'They will
              tell us the situation after the World Cup. At the moment we don't have
              a coach,' he said, indicating questions about his future could wait
              till after the tournament in South Africa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>'What Torres wants is to beat Portugal. The rest, we'll see.'</p>
              <p>Torres is one of a clutch of players who is struggling to 
              fire at the World Cup and admits that injuries have taken their toll.</p>
              <p>He
               required knee surgery shortly before the tournament and has looked a 
              shadow of the player who scored a brilliant winning goal in the Euro 
              2008 final against Germany.</p>
              <p>'It's not easy coming back after an 
              operation,' he said. 'I think I still have a little way to go before I 
              am back at 100 per cent, although I am close.'</p>
              <p>Torres played a
               part in each of Spain's group games but is yet to get off the mark.</p>
              <p>'Forwards
               are measured by goals,' he said. 'I read the English press and no one 
              expected (Wayne) Rooney to go out of the World Cup without scoring a 
              goal.</p>
              <p>'If I had scored two goals against Honduras, when there 
              were chances, it would be another matter. But that's football. I am calm
               because I know I have the confidence of (Spain manager Vicente) del 
              Bosque.' </p>

              <p>Ah Roy may sell him and get a few more strikers to come in as he is too injury prone.</p>
              <p>As for stevie, I think he would want to win the BPL title unless Ah Roy can convince him, he should be leaving.</p>
              <p>For Ah Roy, if he can get Liverpool in order and win the BPL title and any cup, he will be the manager of the century.</p>
              <p>But, that is too high a order for him considering he got players like Lucas which is unsaleable.</p>
