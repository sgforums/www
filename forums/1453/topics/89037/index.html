Not juz the finanical implications of qualifying... it may also turn out to be a "decider" whether Owen remains a Reds for the coming season(s).<br><br>It may've been a tadbit draggy by now...but the Owen saga looks set to be resolved by the time the ball is kicked *whew*!?<br><br>If he goes, we get the $$$ plus Morientes (if rumour is true tat he's joing R.Madrid).  If he stays, then we'll get see if he's worth his wages under the new man...more imptly I feel, we get to retain the heartbeat of the Reds.  This is esp. impt when Murphy is almost certainly moving on.<br><br>Watever the outcome, the next 24 hrs looks likely to change the outlook of our team n our coming season...I can wish us the best!<br><br></span></span></div>

Its a open secret his most powerful weapon is his speed.<br><br>Murphy arnt really the kind of player tt can change a game or dictate the pace in midfield. I have always held the opinion he arnt good enough for liverpool<br><br>the sales of owen and murphy should preferably be used to finance the purchase of pablo aimar and mista (both from valencia) since benitez is familar with both players..<br><br></div>

Look at wat now!?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>He has put the club in a fix - we either sell him now (no matter how cheaply) or risk losing him for free next summer!  I dun blame RM for taking us to ransom... it's a commercial deal and surely they know they have the upper-hand in it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></span></span></div>

His style is predictable !<br><br>And I always think Morientes and Raul are good enough to keep Owen on the bench , and I've not mentioned Ronaldo !</span></span></div>
