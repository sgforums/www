Gerrard is a big assert to the club , no doubt about it but we can stlll win games without him. One big example : Liverpool vs Everton , Gerrard sent off 18 mins of play. We played with 10 men for the rest of game and end up winning 3-1. Period.<br><br></div>

(btw, man utd thrashed a team whom manager was busy planning his vacation)<br><br>players evolve, so do clubs.<br>if gerrard had gone to chelsea last summer, liverpool would have find alternate means to fill up the gap like how fabregas over vieira. (still rem how fabregas showed vieira a lesson or two when arsenal last met juventus?)<br><br>i would see liverpool being a better team with gerrard than nothing without him.<br>as i have mentioned, gerrard is a product of liverpool academy. with that, i can easily say that gerrard is nothing without liverpool.<br><br>simiarly, if wenger didnt buy henry from juventus, he would have rot there and probably under investigation for fixing matches now, let alone being the player responsible to keep arsenal within top 5.<br><br>btw, i dont even know if we could have discuss about liverpool's FA cup success if reina didnt make the last ditch save and stopped three penalties. gerrard brought the team beyond extra time, but he still has to rely on reina to perform in the sudden death. so is liverpool nothing without reina?<br><br>and if we really want to trace all the way back, it was crouch who met finnan cross to win manchester united before they crossing swords with chelsea and west ham. so is liverpool nothing without crouch?<br><br>dont simply see things in one sided manner. i know its easier but doesnt tell u much about how team sport works.</div>

I just kept looking at the clock and wanting it to run out. I had absolutely nothing left.<br><br>"We basically finished the game with about five men! People were going down with cramp all over the place because we'd put so much effort in.<br><br>"For my first goal it just sat up really nice to volley it. For my second I had a bit of luck in there as well.<br><br>"I don't tend to get two goals in a game very often but I remember the knockdown for the first one was perfect." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rafael Benitez shrugged off suggestions that Liverpool rely too heavily on Steven Gerrard by insisting: "We could still have won the Cup without him."<br>Gerrard was the star of the show in Cardiff on Saturday as he made one goal, scored two others and then netted again during the penalty shoot-out as Liverpool won the FA Cup for the seventh time.<br><br>Despite a man of the match display at the Millennium Stadium, Benitez insists his side could still have triumphed even without their talismanic skipper.<br><br>"I don't think we'd have lost if we didn't have Stevie because we have played a lot of games without him," said Benitez.<br><br>"Maybe we would have needed to have done different things, but I am very clear on that.<br><br>"He has scored 23 goals this season and it is outstanding for a midfielder to get that many.<br><br>"We know that we need to leave him to go forward and play his own game. That is the reason why we have Xabi Alonso and Sissoko.<br><br>"You talk about Stevie but if you don't have Sissoko working as hard as he has been, the balance of the team would be impossible.<br><br>"If you want to win trophies, you need a good team and some top class players after that. Stevie is one of the best players in the world, but we have a good team."<br><br></div>
