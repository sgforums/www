              <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Mazzarri looking for Euro boost</h2>
              <p class="lastUpdate"> </p>
              Napoli coach Walter Mazzarri, like his opposite number Roy Hodgson, accepts his priority has to be domestic form but that will not stop his side seeking to gain a significant Europa League advantage.
              <p>The Italian club host Liverpool at the Stadio San Paolo hoping to take a big step towards qualification from Group K.</p>
              <p>Their form this season has been encouraging - they are currently fourth in Serie A - and considerably better than Liverpool's, who have slipped to second-bottom of the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's form in Europe has been much better, with five wins and a draw through both qualifying and the group stage so far.</p>
              <p>Napoli, like their opponents, are trying to recapture former glories and Mazzarri believes facing teams like Liverpool can only help in that quest.</p>
              <p>They drew their opening two games against Utrecht and Steaua Bucharest but Liverpool pose the biggest threat.</p>
              <p>"Playing an important side like Liverpool is another step for the club to grow,'' he said.</p>
              <p>"We have to hold up Napoli's name though, but without forgetting about the league, which is our primary objective.</p>
              <p>"But having said that, we will give our maximum because we really want to get through the group.''</p>
              <p>Despite Liverpool's troubles this season, and the fact they have left key duo Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard at home, Mazzarri is taking nothing for granted.</p>
              <p>"They have a great squad. An individual is not able to dictate the team's strengths,'' he added.</p>
              <p>"I'm more worried because it's clear (Roy Hodgson's) studied a line-up that could give us more problems.</p>
              <p>"I want a great match. I would like the team to play good football and produce a positive performance.</p>
              <p>"I don't want only to secure a good result. I want to achieve it in the best possible fashion.</p>
              <p>"We want to give happiness to our supporters and we will play with soul, regardless of the possible outcome.''</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson has defended his squad selection ahead of the game.</p>
              <p>He has chosen to rest Torres, Gerrard, Raul Meireles and Lucas Leiva, while he is also without Glen Johnson (hamstring), Daniel Agger (illness) and Dirk Kuyt (ankle).</p>
              <p>The 63-year-old admitted his decision was coloured by the fact the team were in desperate need of a win against Blackburn in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"I was concerned that if players like Lucas Leiva and Raul Meireles were to play it would be five matches in two weeks,'' said Hodgson, who admitted it was a risk.</p>
              <p>"And when it comes to Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres - two important players - we have an important league game on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"For me it was, quite simply, a priority. After our very poor start to the season and bad results, if we had to make a sacrifice within the team in one game or another, in which game do you make it?</p>
              <p>"I made the decision to make the sacrifice in this game because we need a win more badly on Sunday than we do tomorrow (Thursday).</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I played Gerrard and Torres and one of them got injured or were tired and our performance suffered.</p>
              <p>"If we then lose and people say we chose a weakened team because I prioritised Sunday over this game then I will hold my hands up and say they are right.''</p>

              <span style="color: #0066cc;">Napoli</span> tactician <span style="color: #0066cc;">Walter Mazzarri</span> believes his team played a good match, and were unlucky not to have scored a crucial goal against <span style="color: #0066cc;">Liverpool</span> in the <span style="color: #0066cc;">Europa League</span>.<br><br>Mazzarri is most pleased about the team being able to dominate the Reds for large period of the match.<br><br>"We tried everything we could, but all that we lacked was a goal," the coach told the club's <em>official</em> website. "We were playing against a side that is accustomed to playing Europe. And to have them suffering for a majority of the match means Napoli instils fear into their opponents when commanding the play.<br><br>"Our only fault is that we were unable to capitalise on the good chances we had to score. Liverpool wanted to not concede a goal, as well as wanted to bring home at least a point. This was seen in the number of attacking chances they had. <br><br>"Overall, we did deserve to win. Had we been able to, the match would have certainly changed complex. We would have played with more space."<br><br>Mazzarri disagrees with Liverpool counterpart Roy Hodgson, who said he fielded a second-string side.<br><br>"I don't believe that he did this," Mazzarri points out. "In fact, Hodgson played the best formation he could to put us in difficulty. Other players may not have given him the same guarantees. <br><br>"Maybe we played a little less open than usual, because we were overwhelmed by the importance of the event. But in the second half, we loosened up and missed a chance to score.<br><br>"Napoli must continue to play good football, and work hard towards this goal," added Mazzarri.</div>
