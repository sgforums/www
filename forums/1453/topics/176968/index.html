            <div class='col-md body'>Rafael Benitez has reiterated his belief that Steven Gerrard is a better player than Frank Lampard.<br>The two talented midfield men come face to face at Stamford Bridge tomorrow as Liverpool aim to cut the gap on league leaders Chelsea.<br><br>Lampard goes into the crucial game as the newly crowned England player of the season, narrowly pipping Gerrard, but Benitez is in no doubt about which player he would rather have in his side.<br><br>"You look at Steven and what he has done for us this season, to have scored 17 goals for Liverpool, that is just fantastic," says the Reds boss.<br><br>"I don't know how important Lampard is for Mourinho, but Gerrard is the key for us. People compare the two players and they say that Lampard scores more goals and he plays more games.<br><br>"But to score 17 goals for a team like Liverpool that scores far less than Chelsea, that shows Gerrard really is the key player.<br><br>"Lampard is a very good player but he has very many good players - very expensive players - around him at all times," said the Anfield coach.<br><br>"Sometimes Chelsea have such dominance that they can coast through games - they find it easier at times to win matches.<br><br>"So people say that Lampard plays so many games, but when you are winning two or three-nil with plenty of time to go, then it is easier to manage that game, to rest in the contest.<br><br>"We don't have that luxury and it means our players get harder matches. Gerrard has to play hard through many matches but he is still offering so much to us every game."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no doubt that comparisons between Gerrard and Lampard will always surface.<br><br>I would like to see it in the way......<br><br>The deployment of Gerrard by RB forces Gerrard to work a lot on his own. In the case of Lampard, JM surrounds Lampard with players who can support him.<br><br>Therefore, Gerrard may have to work harder than Lampard which is why some of you think that he is better.<br><br>Similarly, Lampard has the freedom to do his things because of support by his team-mates.<br><br>Whatever the case, Liverpool is happy with Gerrard, Chelsea is happy with Lampard and fans from both corners are happy with their man and that matters most.</div>

Gerrard because he is captain. Lampard leaves it to John Terry. Can't really compare in this instance.<br><br>2.   They are both equally passionate playing for club and country. Though Gerrard may lose out a bit cos he indicated he may consider a move out of Anfield last year.<br><br>3.   Off the pitch hard to say. On the pitch probably Lampard. Consider last season when Liverpool won a higher percentage of games when Gerrard was not playing.<br><br>4.   See (3).<br><br>5.   This goes to Gerrard hands down.<br><br>Gerrard's game is more suitable for the English game where his workhorse like attitude makes him a valuable asset. Lampard's forte is his vision and ability to be at the right place at the right time.<br><br>I guess both of them SHOULD be first on SGE starting 11. Becks can wait. But again Becks is like a son to SGE and that is really irritating.</div>
