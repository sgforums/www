Mascherano has already played for Corinthians, as well as West Ham.<br><br>The authorities finally agreed to cave in on the transfer and it will be announced tomorrow, on the final day of the transfer window.<br><br>Rafa Benitez last night saluted the signing. "We have an agreement to take him on loan for 18 months then we have an option to sign him permanently.<br><br>"He is a top class player and played at the top level at the World Cup. We were monitoring him when he was with River Plate. The only question is whether he can play to his level in England, but I know he can play a lot better than he did at West Ham.<br><br>"We don't have another holding midfielder and this is a crucial time for us. We will play against West Ham, Everton, Newcastle, Sheffield United and Barcelona twice."<br><br>Mascherano made only three Premiership starts with West Ham, and seven appearances altogether.<br><br>Benitez added: "Maybe Liverpool can be a better option for him because we can speak in Spanish to him and we play a different style of football that suits him better. Corinthians and River Plate are top sides in their countries and he is used to winning trophies. I think he will have more possibilities with us."<br><br>Benitez also explained why he expected to get his man. "There is a big difference between the law and the rules," he said. "A worker cannot be stopped working. That's the law in the European Community.<br><br>"Then there are the rules, which can change depending on your country or continent. There are players in the world now who have played for three or four clubs in a season.<br><br>"The rules are one thing, but the law is another. Nobody can stop people moving to other jobs. They have freedom and they need to work. The law is more important than the rules."<br><br>Liverpool are moving to secure the long-term future of a number of their top men because of a new regulation giving a player the right to buy out his contract when it entered the last two years.<br><br>Benitez confirmed that Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher would be offered new deals in the summer along with Spanish pair Xabi Alonso and Luis Garcia.<br><br>Source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=432371&amp;in_page_id=1779&amp;ito=1490</blockquote></div>

It was thought at the time that their arrival was a prelude to businessman Kia Joorabchian - a key player in MSI which still held the registration for Tevez and Mascherano - taking over the Hammers.<br><br>However, Joorabchian lost out to an Icelandic consortium headed by Eggert Magnusson - and Mascherano struggled for playing time, starting just five games.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
