That is asking for really alot considering that Liverpool's offense was never too good this season<br><br>So Manu way too unlikely to let slip it's 2nd spot</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to disappoint all of u, i feel pool supporters should not pin so much hope for 2nd place. i dun see man u will fail to win one of their remaining fixture, just like man u fans hoping man u to cling the champ n hoping to beat chelsea.<br><br>anyway i hope pool players can do their best n ignore the pressure n their matches just to hope man u slip. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Currently the race for 2nd looks like this:<br><br>Liverpool 79 points Goal Difference 30 Games left to play - Vs Portsmouth at Fratton Park on May 7th<br><br>ManU 79 points Goal Difference 34 Games left to play - vs Middlesborough at Old Trafford on May 1st, vs Charlton at Old Trafford on May 7th<br><br>It's going down to the wire. I'm hoping ManU do not win against Middlesborough. Then it gives Liverpool a better chance.<br><br>At the moment the relegation battle has been decided; West Brom, Birmingham City and Sunderland are going down. The title has gone to Chelsea.<br><br>The only thing left undecided is the battle for 2nd and the battle for 4th. But then again Spurs might still lose out on the CL place if Arsenal win the CL.<br><br>So really.....all eyes will be on ManU and Liverpool for the last day!<br><br>Portsmouth have nothing left to play for. So the match at Fratton Park on the last day may not be so difficult for Liverpool.<br><br>As for ManU, they have lost Wayne Rooney, their most important players. When Rooney doesn't perform, ManU doesn't get the results. Remember the Sunderland match at Old Trafford?<br><br>Also, ManU have to play Boro on Monday just barely 3 days after the massively draining (both physically and mentallY and emotionally) clash with Chelsea.<br><br>There's a chance Boro can hold out for a draw. The ManU attack seems quite toothless without Rooney pulling the strings.<br><br>Curbishley will want to go out on a high in his last game for Charlton.<br><br>Here are the permuations:<br><br>1) If ManU draw both ties and Liverpool wins their last match, Liverpool are second.<br><br>2) If ManU lose to Boro, then on the last match, Liverpool have to match ManU's result and score enough goals such that they have a better goal difference. At the moment ManU have a better difference by 4. If they do lose to Boro, it would have to be cut to 3 or less. Hence Liverpool will need to win against Portsmouth by &gt;4 goals if they want to be second.<br><br>3) If ManU beat Boro, then on the last day, Liverpool have to hope that ManU lose to Charlton while they beat Portsmouth away. And they also have to hope they score enough goals to have a better goal difference than ManU.<br><br>Hence in conclusion, the Boro game is massively important for Liverpool. It will determine the likelihood of Liverpool's chances of finishing 2nd. Boro MUST NOT lose to ManU.</div>
