            <div class='col-md body'>LAMPARD TARGETS CROATIA RECORD<br>By John Curtis, PA Sport<br><br>Frank Lampard has admitted there is greater onus on <span style="color: red;">England to end Croatia's 16-year unbeaten home record in competitive matches </span>on Wednesday after flopping against Macedonia in the European Championship qualifier at Old Trafford.<br><br>England produced a dismal performance in their goalless draw, although they still top their group with seven points from three matches but only on goal difference from Israel.<br><br>Croatia's only defeat on home spoil since gaining their independence in 1990 being in a friendly to France in 2000, but Lampard knows England need a positive result.<br><br>Lampard, who win his 50th cap on Wednesday, said: "It was going to be difficult irrespective of Saturday's game but when you drop points you want to make sure you don't drop any more.<br><br>"By no means can you take for granted we are going to get the three points. We know the atmosphere in games in eastern Europe is pretty hostile and there are a lot of things we have to overcome to try and win that game.<br><br>"Ideally we would have taken three points from the home game and gone to Croatia looking to draw or win - but now there is that bit more onus on trying to go there and win.<br><br>"It is potentially the hardest game in the group, although Russia and Israel away will also be difficult. They will test us.<br><br>"But we have got to stand up on Wednesday to a hostile crowd, a good technical side and show what we are about as a team."<br><br>England will be without Lampard's long-time midfield partner Steven Gerrard, who will be suspended after collecting his second yellow card in the qualifiers.<br><br>Lampard, who scored his first England goal against Croatia three years ago, said: "Steven will be a big loss. He is such a big player for England but it is time for someone else to step up and show what they can do."<br><br>Shaun Wright-Phillips, Scott Parker and Phil Neville will all come into contention depending on whether coach Steve McClaren opts for a 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 formation.<br><br>Lampard believes England's confidence should not be eroded by their first setback under new boss McClaren but insists England were always bracing themselves for a tough battle to qualify for Austria and Switzerland in 2008.<br><br>He said: "You shouldn't have self doubt after that one game. It is important to stay together and stay focused as a team.<br><br>"We are a realistic bunch and all know international football is not a breeze.<br><br>"Sometimes you think you have got the hang of it - but you don't always win games. We have to look at the negatives, the things we didn't do well and put them right. But we have to stay positive."<br><br><span style="color: green;">hope so.......hope that SWP can play on the right wing replacing the suspended gerrad @ the starting line up and parker for carrick and phil neville for gary neville and Darren Bent For Rooney until rooney score for man utd  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span></div>

This'll be the last time I come on and b*tch about players, instead we should think of ways they can improve rather than say 'OUT OUT OUT.'<br><br>And as for Frank, he's finally got the lead role in centre midfield on wednesday, so with the right selection, I expect good things from England. </span><br></div>
