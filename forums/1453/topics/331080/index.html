              <p>Here are all the pre-match stats and facts ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Stoke City at Anfield. </p>
              <li>Head to Head: (League only) <br>  <br></li>
              <li>At Anfield: Liverpool 41 wins, 9 draws, Stoke 3 wins. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Overall: Liverpool 53 wins, 27 draws, Stoke 26 wins. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>The sides last met in the league in 1984-85. Liverpool won 1-0 at the Victoria Ground thanks to a late Ronnie Whelan goal. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>In the return at Anfield the Reds ran out 2-0 winners with Steve Nicol and Kenny Dalglish scoring. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>The clubs are meeting today for the first time since November 2000 when Liverpool won 8-0 at the Britannia Stadium in a League Cup tie with Robbie Fowler scoring a hat-trick. Only two players, <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/hyypia/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sami Hyypia</span></span></a> (who scored) and <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/carragher/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Jamie Carragher</span></span></a>, who played that night are still with the Reds. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Liverpool have won the last 12 league meetings in a row at Anfield. Since losing 4-3 to Stoke here in March 1959 the Reds have won 23 and drawn one of the 24. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>The Reds biggest home win against today's opponents came in January 1902 when they won 7-0. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>In the top flight Liverpool have won 37 and drawn eight of the 45 games played against Stoke at Anfield. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Home and away Liverpool have lost only one of the last 16. That defeat came in April 1984 when they went down 2-0 at the Victoria Ground with former Red Colin Russell scoring one of the goals. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>There have been two league hat-tricks scored by Liverpool players against Stoke. The first was from Andy McGuigan who became the first to score five goals in a game for the club as the Reds won 7-0 in 1902. The last came from Roger Hunt who netted four in a 6-1 victory on Boxing Day 1963. Both feats were achieved at Anfield. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>In all competitions Liverpool have won 46, drawn 10 and lost three at home to Stoke in 59 meetings. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>The last time the sides met on this ground Liverpool won 2-1 in a League Cup tie in October 1994 with Ian Rush scoring twice. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Stoke will become Liverpool's 40th different opponent in the Premier League. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Last Saturday <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/babel/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ryan Babel</span></span></a> scored his eighth goal for Liverpool while appearing as a substitute. Only David Fairclough, with 18, has come off the bench to score more for the Reds. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Steven Gerrard's next goal will be his 100th for Liverpool. He will be the 16th player to achieve the feat and the first since Michael Owen in December 2001. Kevin Keegan is immediately above Gerrard on the list with exactly 100 goals. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Liverpool are three goals short of recording 1,000 in Premier League history. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>A win today will give Liverpool their best ever start to a Premiership season after five games beating the 12 points out of a possible 15 they amassed in 1993-94. <br>  <br></li>
              <li>Three points in this game will also give the Reds an 11th straight home league win - a feat last achieved in November 1985 when they won 13 in succession. Aston Villa were the last team back in January to leave Anfield with a point. </li>

              <p><br>Yeah I rem tt game when crouch scored with a shot that was deflected so high over the keeper. But he scored a second in the game and the goals started to flow <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>this is precisely the reason why liverpool has not won the league for past 18 years.</p>
              <p>3 points gained from man utd and they give it away to stoke city.</p>
              <p>worse, while chelsea is playing man utd, it is the best opportunity to stretch the lead.</p>

              <p><br>that goal is because of the rubbish kuyt, he was offsided and the lineman thought he touched the ball before it entered the goal. therefore, goal invaild.</p>

              <p><br>Dossena not bad leh to me. he is one of the better left back i ever seen in recent liverpool years. although true enough, riise is really good in his long shots and crossing, but he's slow in cutting into defenders, and don really know how to attack as a wing back. but this dossena different, he does know how to cut, and attack well, just abit of problem with his getting back and the way he play when he attack. torres seem to be suffering from 2nd season blues huh? lol</p>

              <p>this is precisely the reason why liverpool has not won the league for past 18 years.</p>
              <p>3 points gained from man utd and they give it away to stoke city.</p>
              <p>worse, while chelsea is playing man utd, it is the best opportunity to stretch the lead.</p>

              <p><br>i totally agree with you. so stupid of liverpool to do that. fight so hard for that 3points against man utd, and when they got, they lost it easily to teams like stoke -.-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i desperately hope liverpool can have a world class winger. really. riera not bad, but his pace still need improvement. we need someone of quaresma playing style, can cut into defenders and is very pacy.</p>

              <p>stoke played the right tactic. negative approach, but right tactic.</p>
              <p>only team like arsenal could deal when visitor try to park a bus in front of their goal post. a few one-two is the only way to lure the defenders outta their hole.</p>

              <p><br>but when you call yourself 1 of the top 4 of the best league in the world, you should be able to break this kind of tactic employed by this kind of teams. im sure chelsea aresenal or man utd wont have problems dealing with this stoke team we faced.</p>

              <p>With a goal difference of 5-2 after 5 games, how can this statistic belongs to a team that stands atop of EPL? Even the bottom teams perform better - entertainment wise.</p>

              <p>Liverpool? I don't know where they belong! But not in football arena, perhaps they should go back to shipyard building or churning out 3-chords hits.</p>
