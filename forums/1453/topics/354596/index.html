              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has agreed a two-year contract extension at Anfield, keeping him at the club until at least 2013.</span></p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>The 28-year-old had two years to run on his current deal but has committed to the Reds until beyond his 33rd birthday on a deal approaching £150,000 a week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manager Rafael Benitez told the club's official website: "Steven's new contract is fantastic news for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Steven has once again shown his commitment and it was an easy deal to agree. As soon as we offered him the option he said yes.</p>
              <p>"There were no problems at all. He wants to stay for life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This deal sends out another clear message that we are moving forward as a club. To know we have a player of Steven's quality with us for many more years is a great boost for the club and the fans.</p>
              <p>"He is clearly a player who inspires those around him and, even though he is playing very well at the moment, I still think his best years are ahead of him."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gerrard said recently: "I'm really happy at the club at the moment, in fact I have never been happier at any time throughout my career and I would happily sign for life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am playing in a top team, I am playing with world-class players and I believe that with this manager, going forward, we can be successful."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After Benitez signed his own new contract in March, the way has been clear for the Anfield boss to secure deals for a string of his top stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is understood that Benitez, now with more control over his budget and transfer policy, is preparing deals for Jose Reina, Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Arbeloa, Dirk Kuyt, Daniel Agger, Fernando Torres and Jamie Carragher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has already tied up deals for several of his backroom staff, including assistant manager Sammy Lee, first-team coach Mauricio Pellegrino, goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero, fitness coach Paco de Miguel and chief scout Eduardo Macia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the jewel in the crown is Gerrard. Once again there has been speculation of a summer bid from Real Madrid, but Gerrard has frequently made it clear he has no desire to play anywhere but Anfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the announcement on Friday of his new deal can only boost the feel-good atmosphere around the club as they chase Manchester United at the top of the Premier League.</p>
