Fitness training was a big part of Ayesteran's duties.<br><br>The end came when Ayesteran refused to appear in Liverpool's official squad photograph last week, an act Benitez saw as a further sign of his lack of commitment.<br><br>Our source said: "There was no going back after the photo incident. Rafa was incensed that such a scene took place in front of the whole squad.<br><br>"It is very sad. The two men have worked together for 11 years and were very close."</div>
