Certainly there are no plans to exit an acquisition we have not even bought yet.<br><br>'It (DIC) is a very serious investor with considerable resources at its disposal and the ability to take a long-term view.<br><br>'Equally, we believe that we understand the responsibilities that come with owning Liverpool Football Club.<br><br>'DIC has made it clear that, should a deal be concluded, it would not interfere in the day-to-day running of the club.'<br><br></blockquote></div>
