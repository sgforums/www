The players are not playing at the role they are familar with, they dont know if they should go all out to attack or to defence in numbers.<br><br>Guess its largely due to the manager who's lost too. Not knowing what to do and how to make use of the strong points of individual players. Players are given role where they are totally not familar with. Midfielder became defenders.... strikers became wingers.... left winger is made to play right.... end up the player dont even know which leg he supposed to kick the ball with.<br><br>new blood is needed... and we do have new blood but the ones taken in were based on a moment of brilliance in the world cup.<br>Serial killer... think the only one he killed is his scoring ability.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever since i knew abt soccer when I was not even 6, Liverpool has been my team for the last 21 years...I am now 27 and it pains me to see Liverpool in such a state.  Deep down in my heart, I know people are mocking, laughing the great once was.  Liverpool was great, to me, it IS still great becos of the club itself.  It irks me and pains me to see Liverpool struggling to beat teams like charlton etc.. but to me, LIVERPOOL is always GREAT! Regardless whether it wins or loses, it will always be a GREAT TEAM becos simply it is LIVERPOOL. This is the real KOP spirit.  And of cos, I understand all the brothers here, I really want us to win but lets not forget why we supported LIVERPOOL in the first place (maybe its just myself), its not becos we won things, but becos of who it is. But....I really do hope we can be champions again.<br><br>GoalKeeper: I think Kirkland is good, very good and young.  Dudek is steady enuff albeit a few glaring mistakes but he should be reliable enuff till Kirkland is ready to step into regular football.<br><br>Defence: Hypia is still good enuff for a few seasons. What he needs is someone young and fast like Mexes.  In my view, GH should buy at least 1 more central defender, Mexes: a promising one and if money permits, buy someone who is more matured and experienced like Walter Samuel (hahaha, i know its quite impossible but someone like him lah).  As for right back, I think we have enuff in Carragher and Finnan, not forgetting Ostemobor.  At left back, I think that we should buy Lizarazu at free transfer. Riise is good for the first choice but sometimes he is caught dead when he attacks. Lizarazu provides experience, though in attack, at 35, he should be lacking.  Of cos if GH can find someone who is younger, the better.<br><br>Midfield: When the hype of Kewell was high, I was not really happy. True Kewell is good. But he is not someone like Kaka, Rivaldo, Zidane. What we really need is a central midfielder, a playmaker who can make things happen.  We have very fast wingers in Smicer, Kewell and I can tell you DIOUF makes a very good winger though he was bought as a striker.  Murphy is definitely a player that must stay. He is too good to be allowed in other premiership teams. If we can have Kewell on the left, Murphy/Diouf/Smicer on the right, Gerrad and a playmaker in the central midfield, we would do good.<br><br>Striker: What can I say. Owen is currently one of the best. Despite playing only 34 games,he got 17 goals. considering our season, that is a good haul of 1 in 2 games. Although Heskey doesnt score many goals, i felt he is very much unfairly criticised. He does bring alot to the team in other areas but I wuld not be surprised if he leaves.  if cisse comes, then I would be very excited to see a team of Owen, Cisse, Baros (though he must improve on his finishing) and Pongolle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we need a play maker. Someone who runs from deep and take a crack at goal or make a through pass to someone running into the box.<br><br>forget about Heskey heading it down for Owen to chase.... that's totally useless these days.<br><br>Personally I felt that the problem with Liverpool is the midfield and they dont have this idea of attacking is the best form of attack.
