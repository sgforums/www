            <div class='col-md body'>away game vs marseille to decide their uefa fate. i think it'll be tough given their current state. they had difficulty containing marseille ie drogba even when woody was around. a draw will be a good result, but this game will really be a test of character for the squad. good to know that viana finally given his chance to play. their away form has been abysmal this season, and sbr has to look into that as we have more away games left than home.<br><br>but you'll never know. there's only one alan shearer. and laurent robert.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reds, according to recent interview with alan, it has been confirmed that if he were to pick one from the two, he'd pick uefa cup. but realistically, marseille isnt easy meat at their home &amp; sbr has very limited resources to choose from. as for me, i think marseille is going to go through and hopefully nufc discovers some sort of away form and get the 4th. that's still an uphill battle. you shouldnt worry as much as me since the last game is at anfield.<br><br>poolm, i'm still surfing everyday, recently hooked on friendster.com but not so much anymore. been going to 3 badm tournaments in the last 2 mths, not so much luck (semi, 2nd, 3rd). anyway, nobby's sale is 100% bobby's decision. nobby decided to play for peru after he signed a new contract, and that pissed sbr off. nobody from the toon army camp wants nobby to leave. ambrose cant even produce a half as decent cross as nobby. and 1.5 million for a peruvian captain and one of the best crossers in epl is a rather silly price. but sbr is the manager and he makes the decision. hopefully he doesnt make another silly decision during this crucial time of the season.<br><br>cheer up poolman. everybody has their fair share of problems. just enjoy life whichever way it may lead you to. the strong arent the ones who always win, but those who get back up after they fall. c'est la vie.</div>
