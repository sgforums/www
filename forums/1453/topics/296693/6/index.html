            <div class='col-md body'>IMO i think Poll played really well, and this match cud have gone either way right from the beginning. Quite a num of times when i was really on the edge of my seat. they were controlling play es in the 2nd half. It's just their final ball and very prone to counter attack. Rooney could have made it 2-0 , after united 1st got hold of the ball in their own half. but yea good match</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool has always lack imagination upfront in recent times. They need a vision man, and Gerrard is not it, in fact Liverpool has none. They move well and close up the spaces well but when they arrived, they are like lost lambs.<br><br>Liverpool comes a pauper, time and time again. The Liverpool character has been missing for a long time. Maybe it's time to join the likes of Nottingham Forest...into oblivion...for the good of football. It is better to kill off the misery now rather than witnessing heartaches after heartaches.<br><br>I am a longtime Liverpool fan, but Liverpool of today just do not rekindle the fire of yore.</div>
