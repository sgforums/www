Have you ever stopped to wonder what she wanted to be when she was a little girl?<br><br>Something must have happened to turn that woman onto the streets.<br><br>Maybe it was alcoholism, maybe it was a family that just didn't care anymore. It's difficult to tell.<br><br>For the FA Cup, it's quite easy. It was clearly Reading's fault.<br><br>The FA Cup used to be the finest cup competition in world football. It's unique because it's entirely unseeded and it's open to every single football club in England, from the lowliest village team to cash-drunk Chelsea.<br><br>For the smaller clubs, it was a shot at greatness, a chance to humiliate the big boys. For football's aristocracy it was a chance to deliver glory to the fans.<br><br>Not any more. Reading's decision to play a weakened side against Manchester United at Old Trafford has made a mockery of everything the competition was supposed to stand for.<br><br>I can just about understand a relegation-threatened side saving themselves for a dogfight, but Reading? Reading?<br><br>What on earth was the intention of playing the reserves?<br><br>They're not saving players for a relegation battle, they're not mounting a push for the title and, unless I'm seriously mistaken, they haven't been ravaged by a gruelling Champions League campaign.<br><br>Reading have been a revelation in the Premiership this season. Their squad of battle-scarred journeymen and hungry youngsters have caused the established sides all kinds of problems this season.<br><br>And Steve Coppell should be a nailed-on certainty for Manager of the Year for the work he's done there.<br><br>So why did he withdraw so many of his key players before a clash with Manchester United?<br><br>The argument is that Reading need to preserve their squad for the league.<br><br>Really? What would you rather have if you were a Reading fan - a glorious win at Old Trafford that you could wax lyrical about for years to come, or the pleasure of finishing seventh instead of ninth?<br><br>BRIEF RUN<br><br>A brief run in the pointless and uninspiring Uefa Cup or the memory of turning over one of the world's best teams on their own turf?<br><br>As it was, Reading's reserves held the league leaders to a credible draw, which rather begs the question: What could they have done with a full strength team on the pitch?<br><br>Could they have won the game? We'll never know now.<br><br>Reading's dismissal of the FA Cup is symptomatic of everything that's gone wrong with English football in recent years.<br><br>It's not just Reading, though given their safe position in the league their behaviour is the most surprising.<br><br>Scores of clubs have weakened their line-ups for the FA Cup. We've placed too much emphasis on the league and not enough on what makes sport so desperately addictive: The quest for glory.<br><br>Since when did making money become more important than actually winning something? We reward the failure of fourth place in the league with a chance to make a fortune at the cash-trough of the so-called Champions League.<br><br>The enormous and unbalanced TV revenues mean that the difference between 17th and 18th is now the difference between fiscal stability and a financial apocalypse.<br><br>When a club like Reading looks at the proudest competition in the history of club football and says, 'No thanks', it should ring out like an alarm bell throughout football.<br><br>What right do Reading have to dismiss it as a mere trinket?<br><br>There is only one way to save the FA Cup from an uncertain future, wandering about obscurely like a rain-soaked bag-lady.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Take that Champions League place away from whichever one of the super-rich Big Four that drops away from the title race and give it to the FA Cup winners.</span><br><br>If Reading had a chance of breaking into the European elite, do you think they'd have played their reserves?<br><br>If a place at the feeding frenzy was at stake, do you think the stadiums would be half empty for cup games?<br><br>Football can take Reading's attempted capitulation in one of two ways.<br><br>It can heed the warning and take urgent steps to sanctify a competition that was once the envy of the world. Or it can turn its face to the wall and ignore it for another year.<br><br>Don't hold your breath waiting for change. This is the English FA, after all.<br><br># The writer is a freelancer based in the UK.
