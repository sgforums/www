            <div class='col-md body'>FOWLER CONFIRMS LIVERPOOL EXIT<br>Sporting Life 11 May 2007<br><br>Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler has confirmed that his contract at Anfield will not be extended beyond this season.<br><br>The striker's deal runs out in the summer and he has been told by manager Rafael Benitez that he is free to leave the club.<br><br>Fowler will play against Charlton on Sunday in his last match at Anfield in a red shirt, and could also feature in the Champions League final in Athens on May 23.<br><br>He said: "Obviously it will be an emotional day for me but I want everyone to know I am still completely focused on what I see as two very important games ahead for the club.<br><br>"Firstly I want to play well and win against Charlton to help us finish third, and then there is the preparation for and hopefully playing a part in the Champions League final.<br><br>"I will think about everything else after that because I don't want anything to interfere with such an important match.<br><br>"I also want people to know I have not even thought about my future beyond Liverpool.<br><br>"The manager explained the situation to me this week and I wasn't a bit surprised to be honest.<br><br>"But everyone knows I've treated every game back at Liverpool in exactly the same way and given all I could for the team, and that's going to be the case in the last two matches as well."<br><br>Fowler, speaking to the Liverpool Echo, said: "At least this time I will get a chance to say goodbye properly because I was gutted the way it happened last time."<br><br>Fowler first left Anfield under a cloud to join Leeds when Gerard Houllier was manager.<br><br>He added: "Since I've been back the support I have had from the fans has been tremendous, it's been even better than it was first time around.<br><br>"Maybe you appreciate it even more when you've been away and missed it so much, but I'll never forget the reception they gave me and will always be thankful for it.<br><br>"I just hope I can finish with a few goals and a Champions League final win. That will be the perfect way to end the season for me."<br></div>
