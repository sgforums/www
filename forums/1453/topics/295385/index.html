            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading the Liverpool FC web site on why Ah Ben was not blasted for rotation policy recently.<br><br>I guess I add some comments on what actually went right.<br><br>1. Removal of Momo<br><br>Momo have been with Liverpool for one season.<br><br>It is amazing how he struggle to blend in with the team.<br><br>It is evident how he performed during the Newcastle united match.<br><br>I believe he is now gift-wrapped for Jan 08 transfer.<br><br>2. Revival of Crouch and Return of Kengster<br><br>Crouch have been in "strange" cold storage by Ah Ben since the beginning of the season.<br><br>It may have been due to his comments to the press to be in the 1st team at the start of the season that pissed Ah Ben off.<br><br>But, he is, in fact, very very useful in holding the ball up front and creating havoc for the defenders.<br><br>Despite Ah Ben's severe prejudice against robo, robo have actually saved Ah Ben's ass quite a lot of time that now Ah Ben have reversed his decision to offload him.<br><br>As for Kengster, although he dun deserve any medals for MIAing in the sick bay, I have to admit he have added strength on the left wing and his combination with Riise is a headache towards any opposition.<br><br>I just hope he dun return to the Liverpool sick bay after getting his re-contract.<br><br>3. Return of form for Captain Stevie<br><br>His assists have made HUGE difference in making goal galore for Liverpool.<br><br>So, Liverpool fans have to thank Maclaren if Liverpool can win the EPL title this season.<br><br>4. Super sub Babel<br><br>He have become the last burst of fire for Liverpool in the last 10 - 20 minutes.<br><br>If you need a change of pace, he is there to turn it on and score some goals in the process.<br><br>But, he does not really perform well for the full 90 minutes.<br><br>5. Discovery of who fits where<br><br>By this stage of the season, Ah Ben should more or less know where to deploy his players after so much mis-fit in the beginning of the season.<br><br>With the players comfortable in their best position, they have played better and with more passion.<br><br>6. Torres<br><br>I think he comes as a HUGE gambling success after Cisse and Kuyt have both failed to deliver.<br></div>
