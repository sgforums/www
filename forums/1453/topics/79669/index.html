As reported, he's bound for Birmingham.  Can't fault his commitment; but other than his 1st season, he did not prove his worth in the Reds shirt.  So his departure shd not be missed... on the field, ie.<br><br>Next to go is rumoured to be Diouf - likely to Marseille.  In fact, read tat his no.9 shirt will be given to Cisse - expected to be a good addition *fingers-crossed*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm expecting more to depart - hopefully no nasty surprises.  On the other hand, we shd be buying sensibly - in fact, anyone amongst Dawson, Mexes, J. Barton, SWP, Malbrounque, Duff, VDV, Aimar, Rosicky will be welcome.<br><br>Any other updates n rumours are welcome too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Juz to beef things up, here's wat I juz read fm LFC's Transfer Talk (writer = Ginuwine): -<br><br>*********<br><br>It seems we're transferring out 6 players (Diouf, Heskey, Cheyrou, Biscan, Diao and Henchoz). Now from what I have been hearing and people have in fact been discussing, the replacement players are outstanding.<br>We know the Cisse deal is done. He will probably replace Diouf @ number 9.<br><br>I also have it on good authority that GH has come to some agreement with van der Vaart. I mentioned this story two years ago, and it will finally come about.<br><br>However, this one im not sure about, and its about Ballack. The rumoured deal is Hamann + 6M. Now imagine what our midfield would look like?<br><br>Kewell Gerrard Ballack VDV<br><br>It would be hard to compete against us in Europe with that quality.<br><br>It seems that Ballack and Owen Hargreaves are coming up a lot in transfer rumours. One post on KopTalk mentions that Ballack has indeed been shown around Melwood. One of the two is definitely a smokscreen for the other, and with no developments on the contract of Hamann, I believe these links are true.<br><br>Imagine the possibilities with that midfield, especially the way Gerrard has played this season. I'm beyond excited.<br><br>Owen will sign a contract extension for 2 years. So with Cisse, and Pongolle and Baros as backup, our strikers are sorted.<br><br>The only thing I believe that needs to be sorted is the back four. Hyypia has been a new player since we gave the captaincy to Stevie. He looks a lot more comfortable and seems to be focusing now strictly on his defensive duties. However, he is getting up there in age and probably has 2 or 3 seasons max left in him. I believe the recruitment of Mexes and Dawson shall work out perfectly, with Dawson being given 2 to 3 years to develop as Hyypia's replacement. For all those people who believe Dawson is unproven, just remember he is the England U21 Captain. That is a strong position for such a young player.<br><br>That makes 5 players in. The 6th I believe shall be Joey Barton. He is hard-working and shall be one of our top substitutes during next season.<br><br>These players seem like the strongest links and doesnt it work out perfectly that the exact number of players we're getting rid (6) of is the exact number we're bringing in (6)? Just look @ the quality difference:<br><br>In:<br>Cisse<br>VDV<br>Ballack<br>Mexes<br>Dawson<br>Barton<br><br>Out:<br>Diouf<br>Biscan<br>Cheyrou<br>Diao<br>Henchoz<br>Heskey<br><br>I am quite confident on these 6 incoming transfers. With no denials on either sides, there is truth to them.<br><br>As you all know by now, my favourite transfer speculation surrounds VDV. Two years ago, I did mention that Litmanen was sent to Ajax as part of this deal.<br><br>I don't believe there is any truth to the Zidane rumours, neither the Kezman rumours (unless Baros decides to leave us).<br><br>Let's wait to see what happens. July 1st is the day!<br><br>Oh yes, one thing I forgot to mention. I believe the Rosicky news is true as well, but depends on the acquisition of Ballack and/or VDV. If one falls through, I feel Rosicky will be broughtin for 7M.<br><br>**********<br><br>Well, these are still rumours...dun flame me if they turn out false.  But if lucky-lucky they come true...dun say I never tell u 1st!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers!<br><br></span></span></div>

Those Senegalis cannot play in EPL la !<br><br>Biscan , if possible sell him also ! But if want to keep him , don't play him ! That's the safest !<br><br>Traore ?

Barton was released by Everton early in his career and joined Manchester City when Kevin Keegan spotted his potential in August of 2001.<br><br>His sudden rise in profile resulted in him winning an England under-21's call up for the European Championships qualifier against Portugal at Goodison Park. He scored on his debut that night but couldn't stop the visitors going away with a 2-1 win.<br><br>He is not expected to be the only new signing to arrive at Anfield this summer in what promises to be a very busy period for players coming in and going out of Liverpool.<br><br>********<br><br></span></span></div>
