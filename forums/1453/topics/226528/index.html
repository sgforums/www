            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"><br>tribalfooball.com - December 19, 2006<br><br>Liverpool midfielder Luis Garcia has pleaded with fans to accept his attempted tricks and flicks.<br>"I hear everything the fans shout," Garcia told Liverpoolfc.tv of the groans that sometimes accompany a failed flick or back heel. "I don't like it when they blame or boo me, but it's something I have to live with. I understand they get frustrated when my pass doesn't go through.<br><br>"I get frustrated myself, I hate it when there's a back heel which doesn't work or a pass which is cut out but I can't stay frustrated long.<br><br>"This is the way I play and I have to get on with the game. I want the fans to understand I am trying, that if something I do doesn't work, if I give the ball away, it's not because I don't care.<br><br>"Every play I do is because it's the best thing I can think of at that moment, and, as a player, you've normally got to follow instinct. It's not because I want to show off.<br><br>"I'm trying to close that big gap between the best of me and the worst. If I'm playing it's because the boss thinks my best is greater than my worst, that the best things I do can change something and the worst is not so bad he cannot have it on the pitch but sometimes people make me feel it is.<br><br>"People like a player who doesn't lose the ball and also like a player who does something that's nice to see, but how many players do both? Zidane - not many others. That's why you need different players, someone like Xabi who can keep the ball, and someone like me who sometimes loses it because I'm trying the more difficult pass. I'm trying to learn when to do it and I think I'm much better than in my first season." </span></div>
