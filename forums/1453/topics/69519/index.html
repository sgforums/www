            <div class='col-md body'>How can you do that in Anfield. But the fact that it has happened shows the kind of frustration the fans has of the current regime. I din't remember having that kind of response from the supporters during Evans era. I really think you shouldn't boo your team especially LFC.<br><br>We should get the message across through other means like...waving white handkerchieves (Barcelona style) to signal the discontent with le boss or simply write a petition to LFC board. We're entitled to do that ya know, who's the one paying and finiancially supporting the club anyway.</div>

Anything has been done to change the management team ?No !<br><br>Looking at the LFC.TV forum , i would say 98% of the supporters , said they would do without GH , do you think the Club saw nothing ?<br><br>All because nothing had been changed , the boos came in ! I would bet if GH has been sacked from day 1 , i would doubt we will hear any boos !<br><br>All i wanted to see , is a decent Liverpool team , playing simple , effective football ! Not the kind of rubbish they delivered even with a win !<br><br>Rubbish - in a sense , so predictable ! So predictable that even i know Dudek will roll the ball into Hyypia , Hyypia look up , spotted Heskey , and dumped one long high ball into Heskey , whether or not it's accurate !<br><br>What's the problem with passing the ball on the ground ?<br><br>We Liverpool fans , from 1980 , for me , had seen Liverpool won comfortably , playing simple , effective football ! Now GH wants the players to change all that , and losing ! We can't take that obviously !<br><br>Why change a winning formula ?<br><br>The Liverpool fans had seen Arsenal , MU and even Chelsea now , playing the kind of football , which the Old Liverpool roams England and Europe with ease , of course they boo la !   'Cos Arsenal , MU and Chelsea tells the whole world , playing ground ball won games , not aerial tactics !<br><br>Why can't GH listen ?</span></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's always easy to blame the manager when the team is not performing?  What shouldn't the players are to be blamed too?!<br><br>GH does need to shoulder some blame when he persistently fielding players that are not performing; example the black, French defender and the Senegalse players (I don't even bother to find out the exact spelling of their names to post it here).<br><br>But shouldn't the strikers and midfielders be more accurate in their shooting?  It's no good having 20 to 30 attempts at goals when the one that matters did not come!  If MO and SG had performed to expectation and kept out of injury, we would have been comfortable at 4th and fighting for 3rd.  But they didn't and yet they threaten to leave the team if we don't qualify for CL.  Shame on these two!!!<br><br>Anyway, have we forgotten this very same manager that had brought us 5 trophies in one calendar year?!!  Didn't many of us (you) hailed that he was the one to bring us back to glory?<br><br>It's a team sports; everyone plays a part!!</div>

In G.Houllier's case , he make some shrew purchase , no doubt again , he did played some players , but at the wrong position at most of the time !!!!! And played some wrong tactics against the wrong team at the wrong time ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>A successful team is a team that not only the first eleven can play and deliver , even the second eleven from the reserves  can even play to the standard if chances is given !<br><br>Example : A.Reyes ! He merely played two full games and score two goals against  Chelsea !</span><br><br>Saha went to The Scums and created some impact for The Scums !<br><br>'Cos they were played at the right time with the right tactics ! And both team played ball on the ground , not in the air !<br><br>Premier League has no time for team to play WIMBLEDON-TYPE of football , if they insist ...join Sunderland and Winbledon then.... from the lower division ![/size]</span><br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">At this moment, guess we've got no choice but to bear with our "unlucky" performances week-in-week-out.<br><br>To be fair, I thot we weren't tat bad in the last 4 games - esp. those without EH.  Agst P'mouth, we did attack right fm the start n tat's how we scored so early...but perhaps, tat's how we became complacent too.<br><br>I'm not doubting EH's commitment - if u watch him, he did run his socks off - but with him around, we tend to hoop the ball upfield n tat only exposes the weaknesses of our frontmen - one too clumsy, the other too short - how to score leh?!<br><br>Perhaps GH is right to say we're "unlucky" - created chances but can't score - but he failed to see the shortcomigs of our strikers.  Do u know basing on the number of chances we created this season, we shd've topped the EPL table by a mile?<br><br>To me, this season is already a write-off...but I hope it wun turn out any worse.  In other words, our 1st and foremost target has to be the 4th spot and a CL place.<br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">I think the chances we created do suggest tat we're playing more positively this season.  Of course it's useless if they do not end up in the net.  So I think this is one major problem which GH has failed to address, amongst others.<br><br>Looking at our bunch of strikers - only Owen is proven but he's injury-proned n is often marked-dead by opposing defenders.  Playing EH is a step back as he has failed us more often than not despite his effort.  Baros and Pongolle are potentials but still raw.  I think he did try to get Cisse over in January but failed.  So I guess we've to live with the inept finishings for the rest of the season.<br><br>Having said tat, I believe we're good enuff to seal the final CL-spot.  This is crucial for many reasons - financially, and to attract good players.  Whether GH is involved next season is really not for us to decide...altho I think the pressure will be too great for him to stay, esp. if we ended up empty-handed again.<br><br></span></span></div>
