            <div class='col-md body'>he is running outta idea to make this team a formidable one.<br><br>in the last couple of seasons, anfield no longer has the intimidating aura around them, like how old trafford is to man united.<br><br>however, from a realistic point of view, considering how they currently fare on the premiership table, i dont see there is a need for the board to make such a decision.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so the logical thing to do is to wait for the close season and remove all the craps in this team: manager and players. But it's sometimes a wonder what a different manager can do under similar circumstances. One very good example is Fulham, under Chris Coleman, they played very well with the same players he inherited from Tigana. Maybe, we should consider a change in manager first.<br><br>Afterall, all the players were bought by GH, training and selection of the players also by GH. He must be answerable, he's the boss.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My impression of O'neil is that he's a modern thinking manager.<br><br>Of course, GH is one too. He thinks very hard on how to play players in wrong positions, how to transform LFC into FLFC (French Liverpool Football Club), excuses for LFC record signing fumbling chances after chances, reasons for playing long balls and last but not least how to convince people that this is not the fifth but only the forth season he's in control.

Its not like Liverpool has been on the top 3 flight for the pass few years.<br><br>I think its time the fans and the press to recognize that Liverpool is just not the same team it was in the 70s and 80s.<br><br>They need to realise that Liverpool juz ain't with the same league as the big clubs anymore.<br><br>In fact I think this "Oh of coz liverpool should be genuie tittle contenders coz they are Liverpool" mentallity is woefuuly embedded as much as that of the media hype thats has been going on about GH getting the boot</div>
