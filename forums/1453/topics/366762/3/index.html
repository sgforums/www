              i'll be lying if i say i'm not disgusted by mr-O (O=zero)!
              
              not good with words but i've no problem finding articles tat expresses my feelings in the same wave-length:-
              
              OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
              
              After four years fighting Owen's corner regarding his careers decisions, I now have nothing else to say in his defence. I always thought Owen was 'one of us', but it now seems I was wrong. When Michael Owen signed on the dotted line for Manchester United, he didn't sign for a rival club, he sold his soul to the devils.
              
              The signing was not only a major surprise, it was also arguably one of the most controversial transfer of all time.  Think Nick Barmby, Paul Ince and Luis Figo.  Those players signed for massive rivals of their former clubs, but none of those players come through the youth ranks of the club.
              
              Whilst Michael Owen was raised in Chester, he played for Liverpool from a young age and was indoctrinated in the whole ethos of Liverpool football club, something which makes signing for 'that' club all the more shocking.
              
              When Gerrard flirted with leaving the club on two occasions in the last decade, he made it brutally clear he would under no circumstances play for Manchester United. It's just not the done thing, same as Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, etc would never wear the Liverpool red.
              
              Owen's comments have only served to rub salt in the wounds and show his true colours: 
              
              "Manchester United, you automatically think winners, you think trophies, you think the stadium, the massive fan base, but until you sign you don't really let yourself get carried away,
              
              "A few days ago I never really had it in my wildest dreams,
              
              "In the last few years I had an idea that the manager obviously thought I had something, so I always clung to that hope that he would ask me to come and play for him one day."
              
              Michael Owen was idolised by Liverpool supporters and a whole generation of "Owen's" and "Michael's" named in his honour will now be ruing the day they were given their title.
              
              The goalscoring debut in 1997 against Wimbledon, the 'wonder goal' v Argentina in the 1998 World Cup 1998, the stunning 2001 treble season culminating in the the coveted Ballon d'Or award, and everything in between and since are about to be eliminated from the history books and memory banks as far as Liverpool supporters are concerned. 
              
              Early signs from Manchester suggest he isn't the most popular man on that side of the M62 neither.  Since he signed on Friday, the club Megastore has yet to receive a single request for an Owen shirt, with many supporters doubting his ability and resentful of having an ex-Liverpool man in the team.
              An employee at the club shop said: "We haven't got his number yet, which might have had an effect. We are not expecting a big demand even when that is known. 
              "As far as I know, no one has asked for it". 
              
              Whilst I have not had the misfortune of naming a child 'Michael' or 'Owen', I did around a decade ago win two goldfishes which I named 'Fowler' and 'Owen'.
               
              One of the goldfish died a few years ago and I was unsure which one it was until now. The one remaining is named after Robbie Fowler a man who was, is and always will be a Liverpool legend; the other is sadly gone forever.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              here's another for our most forgettable "hero" (aka zero) in recent club history:-
              
              OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
              
              I think itâ€™s fair to say Michael Owen has well and truly burned his bridges with any Liverpool supporters who might still have had any affection left for him, now that he has committed the ultimate treason by signing for the mancs. 
              
              While I will admit that seeing the puke inducing pictures of his smiling face as he posed in their shirt was a little bit surreal, to be honest I really couldnâ€™t care less about him or the mancs.
              
              In fairness, Owen gave us 6 or 7 years of great service and his goal-scoring record for us speaks for itself but I lost all interest in him after the way he left us. Not only did he lead the fans on but he also led the club on as he ran down his contract and then flew off to join Real Madrid as soon as they fluttered their eyelashes at him, the fact that we were embarking on a new era under a new manager meant nothing to him. This guy has more faces than a second hand clock shop, the kind of guy who wears mirrored sunglasses with the mirrors on the inside!
              
              How his move to the mancs might be received by Liverpool supporters wonâ€™t have even entered his thinking. Apparently he had a choice between joining the mancs and joining Hull City, which shouldnâ€™t have been any choice at all. One club tries to play good football with honesty and integrity in the finest traditions of the game, the other one plays at Old Trafford!
              
              I would normally genuinely wish any of our former players well when they move on to other clubs, but certainly not in this case. He may have once been a Liverpool player but he is now a manc and I despise everything about that club at a genetic level. Since leaving Liverpool, Owenâ€™s career choices have been one disaster after another and Iâ€™ll be very happy if this one turns out the same way.
              
              I have little sympathy for the guy because Owen has only ever cared about Owen and seemed to view supporters as a necessary nuisance. Even at Newcastle he was initially welcomed him like a new messiah by the Loony Toons, but he had little interest in living up to their expectations. On the rare occasions when he was actually fit enough, he would fly into training by helicopter and fly off again as soon as it was over with no interest in mixing with his team mates or supporters.
              
              At Liverpool he scored a lot of goals and gave us some great memories, but he was always a cold fish who often seemed to treat playing for Liverpool as a stepping stone to playing for England and despite his goals and his ability he never really bonded with The Kop. When you think about it, he was a product of our youth system who went on to become one of the best strikers in the world at one time, so all of the ingredients were there and if he had, had the right mentality he might well have gone on to be one of our greatest ever players.
              
              But Owen was always far more interested in becoming the next Bobby Charlton then he was in becoming the next Kenny Dalglish, so maybe itâ€™s appropriate the he is now with the mancs!
