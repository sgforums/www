              Former footballer Tony Cascarino believes that Glen Johnson's defensive frailties are responsible for Liverpool FC's poor defensive showing so far this season. Is he right or wrong?
              
              Liverpool have conceded 7 goals in 4 league games this season. In his column, Cascarino argued:
              
              "Itâ€™s no coincidence that the Liverpool defence has conceded more goals since he [Johnson] has joined the club...their rigid backline has been exposed due to Johnsonâ€™s suspect positional sense".
              
              Cascarino also waded into the Johnson/England debate:
              
              "Capello may have claimed that Liverpool new boy Glen Johnson is one of the best right-backs in the world and I would agree with that in terms of his play going forward but defensively heâ€™s still lacking.
              
              "Johnson has got to defend far better as in the last few internationals the opposition have found space in behind him on numerous occasions. I have seen a lot of Johnson and...he is still liable to defensive lapses".

              <p>knn Slaven Bilic also say England's weak link also Glenn Johnson , but playing for Liverpool , Glen can leh ... quite solid .</p>
              <p>Croatia's goal partly oso Geln's fault , he allowed that winger to get past him and cross ..... and they got that consolation goal by Eduador .</p>
              <p>But overall , Glen is 9/10 solid for L'pool for me .</p>

              <p>It's a team game. Attack as a team, defend as a team. IDK but most of the replays I watch of Liverpool conceding aren't due to Glen's suspect positioning or poor defending. I would rather pinpoint the situation at the center of Liverpool's defence -- i.e Centerbacks and Central Midfield. </p>
              <p>With the loss of Alonso, an integral reader of the game, most attacks are not being cut off, like they used to. Mascherano is good. Damn good, but he doesn't read it as well as Alonso does. Maybe Gerrard has to step back into the middle as a temporary solution, if Aquilani can't bring us the goods. And that's a big IF.</p>
              <p>I'd say it's a little myopic to point the defensive blame at mostly Glen. He's a good lad. He's brought a lot more goals and creativity, that we've not seen from a Reds defender for a damn long time. For that, I actually applaud his arrival.</p>

              <p>It might be that because Johnson is always upfront that Carragher has to cover a wider area at the back when opponents counter attack.</p>

              <p>i remember reading a report on him before when he was still at chelsea, during his youth days he was playing as a striker, thats why maybe as we all can see, his offensive abilities far outweighs his defensive ones.</p>
