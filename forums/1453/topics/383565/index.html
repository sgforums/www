            <div class='col-md body'><p>Liverpool must always do things 'the Bill Shankly way' - Rafa Benitez<br>Reds gaffer admires founder of the famous Anfield 'boot room'…<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has marked the 50th anniversary of the appointment of predecessor Bill Shankly by insisting that the club must remain true to the values the great Scot.<br><br>Benitez also revealed that the appointment of Sammy Lee as his assistant was a deliberate attempt to connect with the club's past.<br><br>"When we decided to bring in Sammy we had someone who knew the philosophy and the ideas of the club," the Spaniard explained to reporters at a press conference today. <br>"Everything has changed in football and everything is different in society nowadays.<br><br>"Life is different. Everyone has iPods or (Nintendo) Wiis and in a hurry to do things. But still we try to have the same ideas as Shankly.<br><br>"When people talk about the 'Liverpool Way', it was always to win. We try to do this and that is our priority if possible. We try to do things properly, like Shankly did.<br><br>"One of the things we did after Sammy came was to change a little bit of decoration at Melwood. We now have a lot of photographs of former players, the legends and the managers and quotes from different people. <br>"We have been trying to bring this spirit. It is much better now. When people come to training now, they can look around and it is an inspiration to them. It would have been an honour to have met him, 100 per cent.<br><br>"Now all we can do is our best to make sure the mentality and the passion is always the same. That is the key to making sure the club stays at a good level, the level Bill Shankly wanted it to be at."<br><br>Benitez acknowledges that he did not know very much about his legendary predecessor when he first arrived at Anfield, but he soon began to pick things up.<br><br>"I didn't really know much about him before I came but I started reading books about him and made sure that I spoke with a lot of people. I kept reading all those little phrases and sentences," he added. <br>"But I also listened to an old radio interview he did, over and over again when I was at home or when I was in my car. I struggled at first with the accent but once it all became clear, I was really impressed with his ideas.<br><br>"He was so ahead of his time. He was talking about training sessions and if it had been raining and the players were wet, he would tell them to be careful and he would look after them, make sure they recovered properly and ate the right food."</p></div>

              <p>I suppose Shankly was the father figure who demanded nothing less than success, yet provided nothing short of concern?</p>
              <p>Wow, lets hope Benitez didn't suddenly softened eh? Anyway, for sure we won't be seeing him skip or dance to a goal anytime soon...</p>
