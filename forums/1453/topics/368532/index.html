              <p>The 29-year-old is back in boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=28"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez</span></span></a>'s squad after a year-long loan at Hertha Berlin and figured in last night's opening pre-season friendly against St Gallen.</p>
              <p>Voronin played in the first half of a 0-0 draw and is clearly intent on reviving his career at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "He did really well in Germany last season, scoring plenty of goals, and he has told me that he wants to stay at the club and fight for his position.</p>
              <p>"I have told him that will be difficult with <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></span></a> and Steven Gerrard as our first-choice strikers. But he realises this and the players we have in the squad.</p>
              <p>"But he also knows that this club always plays more than 60 games a season and that means there are opportunities. He will fight for his place.''</p>
              <p>Voronin signed for Liverpool on a free transfer from Bayer Leverkusen in 2007 but, after recovering from an ankle injury, was shipped out to Berlin a year ago.</p>
              <p>He scored 11 goals in 21 league games for Berlin, who finished fourth in the Bundesliga, just missing out on Champions League qualification.</p>
              <p>If Hertha had made it to the Champions League, they would have had the finances to pay a £6million fee for the Ukrainian.</p>
              <p>Benitez would certainly be prepared to sell Voronin now to boost his transfer budget and another loan could be possible.</p>
              <p>But Voronin is at least being given the chance to show he can be a viable back-up striker.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "Voronin is doing well. Last pre-season he also did really well for us and then when he went on loan he had a very good season in Germany with Hertha Berlin.</p>
              <p>"He has game intelligence, which is something we are always looking for.</p>
              <p>"At this moment he is a Liverpool player. But it depends on him, he is continuing to work hard and is playing well so he will have a chance.</p>
              <p>"It is good to have him back. When we signed him we were looking for a player who could play 'between the lines' as a second striker with quality.''</p>
              <p>Benitez was also impressed with the quality of new signing <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=23650"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></span></a> against St Gallen, the England defender making his debut as a second-half substitute in an unfamiliar left-back role at the AFG Arena.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool chief said: "Glen played at left-back because we do not have too many options there at the moment due to injuries.</p>
              <p>"I asked him to play on the left and he did really well. The team as a whole did well but everyone was watching Glen and he was good.''</p>
              <p>Johnson almost scored within minutes of coming on and was pleased with his debut.</p>
              <p>He said: "It felt fantastic out there, it was nice to get my first 45 minutes.</p>
              <p>"Now I can get on with it. The boys have made me feel really welcome from the start and I enjoyed getting out there and putting in a performance with them.</p>
              <p>"It's been brilliant at the training camp, I have loved every minute of it and I am looking forward to the season ahead.''</p>
              <p>The absence of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=14505"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Aurelio</span></span></a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=14357"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Andrea Dossena</span></span></a> meant Johnson filled in at left-back, and the new boy is only too happy to adapt.</p>
              <p>He said: "I have played there before, though not recently. But I have been training there for the last few days and I quite enjoy it.</p>
              <p>"I was very disappointed not to have scored with the chance I had. I want to score every opportunity I get and I should have done better.''</p>
