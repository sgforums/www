            <div class='col-md body'>Benitez set to finally welcome back Kewell<br><br>Harry Kewell is expected to return to full training at Liverpool next week.<br><br>The Australia midfielder has not kicked a ball for the Anfield club this season after picking up a groin injury while playing for his country in the Asian Cup in the summer.<br><br>It was the latest in a series of injury setbacks for the former Leeds player, but manager Rafael Benitez is now hoping Kewell can prove his fitness and press for a place in the first team squad.<br><br>Benitez told liverpoolfc.tv: 'Harry has been working really hard with the physios and next week he could be training or running with the rest of the first team.<br><br>'Harry is very important for us. A player with pace and ability who can score goals is always going to be important.'<br><br>This could well be the last chance Kewell gets to extend his stay at Liverpool. Several teams were interested in his services during the summer, but Benitez wanted to give the former Leeds winger every chance to prove his value to the club.<br><br>But if Kewell fails to establish himself in the squad this time, he is likely to be surplus to requirements at the end of the season.<br><br>Despite heavy spending on bringing new wide midfielders to the club in Ryan Babel and Yossi Benayoun, Benitez insists Kewell still has a role to play at Anfield.<br><br>He said: 'It's clear he's someone with great quality and experience and we need these kind of players for the rest of the season.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Benitez is keeping his fingers crossed that Fernando Torres does not aggravate an ankle injury when he plays for Spain this weekend.<br><br>The Liverpool striker was restricted to just a light training session with his international team-mates earlier in the week, but he is expected to figure in Spain's crucial clash with Denmark on Saturday.<br><br>Benitez, who wants the player fit for his first Mersey derby at Everton on Saturday week, added: 'It is a risk but I know he wants to play because they have such an important game for Spain.'<br></div>
