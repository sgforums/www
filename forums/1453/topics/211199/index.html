It will be his FIFTH attempt to take control of Liverpool.<br><br>A source told the Daily Post: "There are definitely two or three parties involved in the ownership of the club, but it would be wide of the mark to say the club will be sold on Thursday. It will take longer for arrangements to be made."<br><br>It is understood that private investors are ready with funding to help pay for the new stadium. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Not 1 , Not 2 But 3 TakeOver Bids Wonder If LFC Management Sell The Club To Others If Really Sold.............And Arsenal Also Get TakeOver Then Next Year EPL Will Be 1 Of The Most Exciting EPL Season</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Updated: Sep. 20, 2006<br>Liverpool supporters surprised at takeover talk<br><br>Liverpool supporters have spoke of their surprise over reports of an imminent takeover bid for the club.<br><br>Directors from the Liverpool board could meet tomorrow to debate potential takeover bids, according to reports in a local newspaper.<br><br>Multi-millionaire businessman Steve Morgan, who has been linked with a takeover of the club before, was reported by the Liverpool Daily Post as one of the bidders.<br><br>The club has previously been linked with major investment or a takeover, with Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra - who is facing a military coup in his own country - and American Robert Kraft among the names suggested.<br><br>David Moores, a member of the family which founded the Littlewoods shopping empire, is currently the majority shareholder at the club.<br><br>Les Lawson, secretary of the official Liverpool Supporters Club, said the latest development had come as a shock.<br><br>He said: 'This has come completely out of the blue. The situation has been going on for nearly three years and it is about time a line was drawn under it.<br><br>'Either David Moores says he is not prepared to sell his shares or they accept a takeover bid. But it has to be the right person - it should not just be about money. We believe this is a special club and we would prefer a Liverpool supporter, someone who has a feeling for the club.<br><br>'But it has got to come to a head soon.'<br><br>The takeover speculation comes as Liverpool prepares to reveal details of how it will fund a new Â£180 million, 60,000-seater stadium. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Steve Morgan no chance ...... if he got chance , a few years ago he tookover liao .<br><br>Think Liverpool looking for partnership , rather than 100% being taken-over . Think they like to have someone who is willing to pump in money , but not fully control the destiny of the club , someone who is willing to be silent-partner . </span></div>
