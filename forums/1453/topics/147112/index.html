"I have nothing against the French league," he said in response to interest from Lyon and Monaco, "but I consider the leagues in England and Spain to be the best ones."<br><br>Houllier's move will extend a saga that Baros had hoped to resolve with a move to the Midlands today. Liverpool will not grant the striker his wish unless Villa now match Lyon's offer, either in monetary terms or by adding Nolberto Solano to the proposed deal, while Baros's reluctance for a reunion with Houllier will continue to place the Anfield club's transfer plans on hold. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Now let's hope Villa panic n agree the deal tat incl.

Houllier was one of the reason why Owen became disillusioned at Liverpool and decided to leave, even though Rafa was brought in. And now Baros? Houllier prefer Heskey than him at Liverpool even though Baros is the more lethal striker.<br><br></div>

"I have nothing against the French league," he said in response to interest from Lyon and Monaco, "but I consider the leagues in England and Spain to be the best ones."<br><br>Houllier's move will extend a saga that Baros had hoped to resolve with a move to the Midlands today. Liverpool will not grant the striker his wish unless Villa now match Lyon's offer, either in monetary terms or by adding Nolberto Solano to the proposed deal, while Baros's reluctance for a reunion with Houllier will continue to place the Anfield club's transfer plans on hold. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Now let's hope Villa panic n agree the deal tat incl. Solano *fingers crossed*</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></span></div></blockquote>I think o'leary would give up baros rather than solano</div>
