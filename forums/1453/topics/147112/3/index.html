He should go for players that suits the team not short-gap measures. First we were linked with this player, the next thing we are linked with next , I am really puzzled what is going on behind the board. However, after all this quieten down, I hope our scoring problems is solved and we carry on playing good football and winning games especially the important ones. That is most important. </div></blockquote>Precisely. He actually bought players in positions which we are already quite strong, for example the left and central midfield. Not forgetting that Mark Gonzalez is also a left midfield player. Waste all those efforts and money in bringing these players when they should be concentrating on strengthening the weaker positions, like right midfield and central defence. In the last 2 weeks, they frantically search for a right midfielder. Practically all quality right midfielders in weaker teams are being linked with Liverpool. The clubs are clever.

If Liverpool have stick to their nerves, they could have sold Baros at 6.5 million with Solano in the package. Can't they see that Villa is desperate for a striker? Yet, when they saw Villa looking at other targets, they panic and decided to do business with Villa. I thought that they want to offload Baros fast so that they can get Owen. I expect them to table a bid for Owen on the day Baros was sold. But they did not. So it really baffles me why they panic sold Baros at all when they don't really need to sell him urgently. He isn't unhappy. He is not towards the end of his contract. We don't really have a surplus of strikers. And he is still a quality striker to have in the squad.

They really made a huge loss on that player. And to think that we could have gotten Figo for just 2 million, they felt that he is too expensive. Confusing.</div>

Gonzalez is a left-footed winger. Here's his info link http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/040501/1/140k.html<br><br>Yes. Baros is not in Rafa's plan. But we don't really need to sell him urgently right? He is exactly Owen's case. But look at how RM does it. It's either 16 million or nothing. He can sit on the bench but that's not our problem. I thought they would have stick to their 7 million asking price unless they really need the money to buy someone else. But that didn't happen. So I wonder why they sell him so urgently. We could have use Baros as a bargaining tool for future dealings.<br><br></div>

People wants our players for less than the asking price. We sell. When clubs ask for a little more than we want to pay. We reject. If the player is someone really good, I really don't mind paying a few million quid more. But it doesn't seem to be the case here.</div>
