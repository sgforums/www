            <div class='col-md body'>I'm back after a week of break. Ok. I was wrong about Owen. He did, or was forced to, go to Newcastle. While I am disappointed he did not come to Liverpool,  I guess Liverpool was right not to give RM 16 million for a player we groomed and sold for half that price. Anyway, I thought this whole saga was Owen's fault again this time. Doesn't he ever learn his mistakes? Going to RM was a mistake. Now he is making the same mistake of going to Newcastle. Now Newcastle is top of my 'to be relegated' wish list. I would love to see Owen's face when that happens. Anyway, even if they are not relegated, it is difficult to see them getting into Europe next year.<br><br>Enough about Newcastle, what about Liverpool. Overall, I am really not happy with the way they (whoeever, Rafa or Parry) deal in this transfer business. They bought players who we don't really need urgently, sell players who we may need, and go stingy on players who we need. Buying Zenden (even though he is free) is a waste of money. We have more than enought cover over there. Warnock can play there, Riise can play there and Kewell too. We sold our top scorer in Baros. I thought by selling him, we can go all out to get Owen. But apparently not. So we are sort of back to square one as last season. If one of them is injured for a year, we will be short of strikers.<br><br>But probably the worst is the right midfield. That is a problem for Liverpool for many years. Diouf was asked to play there and failed. Heskey too and failed. Garcia is too light weight. Nunez is not good enough. Then a good right midfielder comes along in Figo. He said he wants to come here. Good. RM wants 2 million. And what did Liverpool do? Sorry, either free or no deal. What is this!?!?!?! In this day and age, who can you buy for 2 million pounds? Checking at the transfers, David Connolly from Leicester to Wigan for 2 million. Wtf is he? Why can't we just splash 2 million for Figo? He would have solve the right midfield problem, albeit temporary 1 or 2 years. But at least now we have someone good playing there.  So now we have to wait until January before we have a chance to deal again. I am really not happy with the way Liverpool does their business.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Rafa Benitez lost his plot regarding the transfer market , look at how many players he signed and how desperate he wants to sign players. He should go for players that suits the team not short-gap measures. First we were linked with this player, the next thing we are linked with next , I am really puzzled what is going on behind the board. However, after all this quieten down, I hope our scoring problems is solved and we carry on playing good football and winning games especially the important ones. That is most important.</div>

He did, or was forced to, go to Newcastle. While I am disappointed he did not come to Liverpool,  I guess Liverpool was right not to give RM 16 million for a player we groomed and sold for half that price. Anyway, I thought this whole saga was Owen's fault again this time. Doesn't he ever learn his mistakes? Going to RM was a mistake. Now he is making the same mistake of going to Newcastle. Now Newcastle is top of my 'to be relegated' wish list. I would love to see Owen's face when that happens. Anyway, even if they are not relegated, it is difficult to see them getting into Europe next year.<br><br>Enough about Newcastle, what about Liverpool.
