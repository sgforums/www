            <div class='col-md body'><br>Rafael Benitez wants new contracts sorted out for his top stars before the end of the current season.<br><br>The Liverpool boss is aware of interest in Anfield's finest performers and has already discussed the situation with new owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks.<br><br>Top of Benitez's list are skipper Steven Gerrard, Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso and key defender Jamie Carragher.<br><br>It was initially believed that Benitez saw solving the contract problems as a major job for the summer to be completed by the beginning of next season.<br><br>But now the Reds chief has indicated he wants players to sign on the dotted line before the current campaign is concluded, which Liverpool fans hope will be in a Champions League final in Athens on May 23.<br><br>It is the urgency on Benitez's part to complete the deals that is something of a surprise.<br><br>The Spaniard clearly wants the current squad satisfied before he starts his summer spending spree, having been promised substantial funds by the new owners although his only words on the subject at present are: 'We are talking now to the players.'<br><br>But now the 47-year-old is in a hurry to make sure Gerrard and Carragher - the local boys at the heart of his side - are tied down to new deals sooner rather than later.<br><br>Under FIFA rules, players can buy themselves out of the final year of their contracts, and that could see Alonso being free to leave in the summer and Gerrard and Carragher in the next two years.<br><br>Other players are also likely to be involved in new discussions, including goalkeeper Jose Reina.<br><br>Reina said today in a Liverpool Echo interview: 'We will be speaking to the new owners over the next few days, but I've said many times now I'm really happy at Liverpool and I want to extend my contract.<br><br>'The key for any growing team is not only to improve with new players, but also to make sure the key players and the spine of the side stays together. Then you can build an even stronger team around this. That spine is here at Liverpool.<br><br>'The project will be to build a team which is massive and can win many things. The new owners have said before they make transfers they first of all want to prepare new deals.<br><br>'Then I'm sure they will think about the summer. At this moment, the future looks brilliant. I've not met the owners yet, but I'm sure it will happen soon.'<br><br>Benitez is also preparing his summer shopping list, and significantly he did not rule out a move for Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o, who this week has gone on record as saying he would love to play alongside Gerrard.<br><br>Benitez's reaction was: 'Samuel is very clever, normally everyone wants to play alongside Steven (Gerrard) or Xabi (Alonso). But we can talk about players in the next few months.<br><br>'But Samuel Eto'o is a good player, and so is Stevie. It would be normal they would want to play together. But it is just speculation, at the moment it means nothing.'<br><br>Benitez has revealed that Fabio Aurelio's operation to repair his damaged Achilles tendon took place yesterday and was a success. He is expected back in action for pre-season training.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good time to put a test on the player's commitment to the club's ambition .... also another indication , sad indication that some will not be offer an extension , players like Fowler , Zenden , and even Sparky Gonzales !<br><br>Those who were given time to show what they can do , and yet not delivering the goodies .<br><br>One definitely on the move will be Sinama Pongelle .... who has said he is happy at Recreativo !<br><br>We shall see the sentiments and ruthlessness of Rafa .</div>
