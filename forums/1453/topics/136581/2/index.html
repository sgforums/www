Such ambiguity need not exist in the 1st place.  Put it tis way, let's say no rules hv been set yet....n u got 2 choose between the defending champs and the best-finisher in the league for the final spot in UCL - who is the obvious choice!? or rather....is there a need 2 choose at all!? So I glad common sense is finally in place!<br><br>The fact tat such a man-made "loop-hole" is allowed in the rule-books is itself a mega embarassement to all concerned....I really applause UEFA for admitting it now, albeit a little 2 late!<br><br>While some of u may like 2 continue harping on the D/Champs' rite 2 defend the Cup (whether LFC or not is irrelevant 2 me), I like 2 point out tat they hv already been victimized for having 2 go thru the qualifiers nxt yr - tis again, I like to re-emphasize, shd not hv been the case if UEFA have foreseen the "loophole" much earlier (say, after Real's case) and amended it there n then.  But nope, I ain't gonna start on tat at all! </span><br></span></div>
