By definition, that is also the case here.<br><br>"There were no discussions actually on where they should enter the competition because everybody was of the opinion they should be given the opportunity but they have to start from the beginning.<br><br>"They could not be allowed to get into the 32 for example."<br><br>But while there is joy for Liverpool, there has been disappointment for Manchester City.<br><br>The Uefa Cup spot which Liverpool had earned for finishing fifth in the Premiership will not transfer to another English club so City, who would have been next in line, will not be in Europe.<br><br>Uefa insists the saga which has dogged it since Liverpool finished fifth domestically and then won the Champions League will never be repeated.<br><br>"The Uefa executive committee decided to amend the regulations for the future editions of the Champions League, so that the holders will have the right to defend their title and therefore qualify automatically," said a statement on the organisation's website.<br><br>The new system is in marked contrast to 2000, when Real Madrid won the Champions League but finished outside of Spain's qualification positions.<br><br>On that occasion fourth-placed Real Zaragoza were relegated to the Uefa Cup.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The UEFA did not amend the rules as they expected the local FA to make the decision of choosing between the league 4th finisher and UCL champion to participate in the next UCL. In Real Madrid's case, the Spanish FA chose Real Madrid over Zaragoza. Thus the onus was on the English FA to choose between Everton and Liverpool.<br><br>However, they did not expect the English FA to "play cheat", ie chose Everton and then rallied the G14 to appeal to UEFA for Liverpool to be included too.<br><br>The common sense and spirit of the sports is to uphold the rules, which was overwritten in this case. Zaragoza and their supporters must be feeling hugely unjustified. The other 4 English teams that qualified for UCL are also rueing the fact that they have to share the allocated funds with Liverpool.<br><br>This reminds me of the Rooney dive that earned Man Utd a penalty and ended Arsenal's undefeated run.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool should be allowed in...<br><br>The name Champions' League itself already tells all its a place for the Champions.<br><br>If the champion cant be allowed to defend the trophy, then what's the point of the whole format? just let every team join and fight it out till there's an eventual winner? And i think every team will want to beat Liverpool in the most coveted competition to show that they're better..<br><br>At least the panel didnt allow Liverpool in at the expense of Everton. They did very well and deserve their place. I can imagine chaos in Merseyside if that happens...<br><br></div>
