FIFA changed the regulation after the last world cup to compel the defending champions to play the qualifiers. Uefa implemented similar rules, but only for national teams. It seems another set of rules apply for club tournaments.</div>

Look at France...winner in 98.....KO in first round in 2002. Dat's why FIFA change the rules so that only the best teams at that time will play.  CL is played every yr..not much changes can be expected in between seasons. I mean there could be drastic changes to a defending champion...but dats very unlikely to happen very often. So, the high standard of winning needed by the defending champion should still be there. Dats why its best for the champions to qualify automatically.<br><br>I mean as champions every team would like to beat them. Its no use becoming a champion if the previous winner is not ard.</div>
