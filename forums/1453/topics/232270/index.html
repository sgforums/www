            <div class='col-md body'>One day, our beloved Senior Minister went to Thailand and had lobster for dinner with the Thai King. After SM had finished, he asked the King....<br><br>SM: Your Highness, what can you do with this lobster shell?<br>King : We cannot do anything with it, we just throw it away.<br>SM: Oh, no. In our country, we send it to the factory and produce prawn crackers.<br><br>Then SM had an orange. After he had finished, he asked the King.<br>SM: What can you do with the orange skin?<br>King : We cannot do anything. We just throw it away.<br>SM: Oh, no. In Singapore, we send it to the factory and produce orange jam.<br><br>Then SM asked for some chewing gum. After he had finished, he put it on the plate and asked the King.<br>SM: What can you do with the chewing gum?<br>King: Oh, no. We just throw it away.<br>SM: In Singapore, we send it to the factory to produce condoms and then send it to Thailand.<br><br>SM was about to leave but then the King asked him...<br>King: What do you do with the condom when you finish using it?<br>SM: We cannot do anything. We just throw it away.<br>King: In Thailand, when we finish using the condom, we send it to the factory to produce chewing gum and then send it back to Singapore!!!<br><br>And that is the reason why chewing gum is banned in Singapore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Beng: Up in Smoke  (Contributed by Wyman Lye)<br><br>Long time ago, a rich Singapore tycoon wanted to know how happy a man could be if he was given one wish.<br>He paid 3 people to test out his experiment:<br><br>The rules were:<br>1. Each person could only have 1 wish.<br>2. They will be left on a deserted island for 30 years.<br>3. Food, but not liquor would be provided.<br><br>The first contestant, Billy Klinton (USA) asked for the 30 prettiest PLAYBOY centrefolds: " So I can make the most beautiful babies in the world."<br><br>The second contestant, Jon Mayjor (UK) said, "I want 30 years' supply of booze."<br><br>The last contestant ,Ah Beng (Singapore) said," I want 30 years' supply of Saa-lim (Salem) cigarettes so I can smoke until I song-song"<br><br>30 years later, the 3 contestants came back for a press conference.<br><br>Billy had with him 200 chidren and 30 estranged women. He remarked, " It has been a long sexual experience for me and I was wondering whether anyone care to buy a child. I will even throw in the mother for free !"<br><br>Jon, hanging on to a bottle of beer, was suffering from a hangover but he managed to utter these words. " God save the Beer ! The Queen can drink sea water. "<br><br>The last contestant, Ah Beng, hugging onto cartons of Salem shouted, "Ni na beh! Buay kee gia lighter!!!" (@#$*! Forgot to bring lighter!)<br></div>
