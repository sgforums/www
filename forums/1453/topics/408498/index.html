              <p>Goalkeeper Cavalieri will hold talks with Italian side Cesena after our Europa League play-off first leg with Trabzonspor.</p>
              <p>His likely departure follows the arrival at Anfield this week of 
              stopper Brad Jones, who was not signed in time to be eligible for 
              Thursday's Europa League clash.</p>
              <p>Hodgson told his pre-match press conference: "Diego has done a marvellous job for the last three years.</p>
              <p>"He's a very good goalkeeper and a very good person, but he made it 
              clear to me at the start of the season that after three years of 
              watching Pepe play every week he might, if he's not careful, lose his 
              goalkeeping ability or his status as a first-team goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>"He made it clear he'd like to leave and find a club where he'll be 
              able to play on a regular basis, so we set about the task of finding 
              someone we thought would be as good a complement to Pepe Reina as 
              Cavalieri has been.</p>
              <p>"That's why Brad Jones has come in. He's the man we've chosen to back
               up Reina, put him under pressure and, most importantly, be ready to 
              play.</p>
              <p>"Diego will travel to Cesena after the game tomorrow night for a medical."</p>
              <p>The Brazilian's departure wouldÂ make Jones the recognised number two 
              to Reina, and he is likely to feature regularly if we reach the Europa 
              League proper.</p>
              <p>Hodgson added: "We aren't in the Europa League group stage yet but if
               we were to succeed in doing that there's a chance someone like Brad 
              will get a game on a reasonably regular basis. That would give Pepe the 
              chance he needs to rest. But first we need to get there."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, quizzed on whether rumours linking Babel with a move to 
              Wolfsburg was accurate, Hodgson said: "No, there's none there. I'm 
              afraid we're in the realm of speculation. You know better than I how 
              many stories you're getting every day, and many of them are unfounded 
              and many are attempts from people to get their players in the spotlight.</p>
              <p>"We've had no written or formal offers for Ryan Babel and he's a player who I'm expecting to play for us."</p>
              <p>With two weeks of the transfer window remaining, the gaffer is not 
              ruling out more activity - and backed up Christian Purslow's suggestion 
              that there could be 'one or two' new faces on top of Jones.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "The Brad Jones situation has been under control for 
              some time so I think he was talking about adding one or two other 
              players to the squad (on top of that).</p>
              <p>"We need 25 players in our squad like everyone else. We need the 25 
              players to play Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and Carling Cup. 
              Arguably you wish you had a few more.</p>
              <p>"Any player that leaves this club will have to be replaced. We aren't
               in a situation where we can just let players go without replacing them.
               That's if they are in our plans for the 25 man squad."</p>
              <p>Elsewhere, Hodgson was delighted with news that Martin Skrtel has signed a new contract at Anfield.</p>
              <p>He said: "Very good. Everything's looking very positive in that 
              respect at the moment. I've got a very good squad of players. I was 
              fearful I'd lose a few but things are looking so much better. I'm very 
              pleased that the players who've done so well for the club in the past 
              are still here."</p>
