              Following in the footsteps of previous winners Gary O'Neil, Linvoy Primus and Wes Brown, Fulham man Murphy has simply continued where he left off last season and been a major contributing factor in the Cottagers' amazing seventh-placed finish. 
              
              The 32-year-old scored a vital header which earned Fulham a 1-0 win over Portsmouth and kept the Cottagers in the top flight in 2007-08 and Murphy has gone from strength to strength this term. 
              
              He has been an ever present for Fulham in the Premier League this season, scoring five times - for what can only be described as the most improved team in the top division. 
              
              Murphy has been Hodgson's midfield kingpin - driving the Cottagers forward and he is the one that Fulham look towards to dictate the pace of the game. But the former Liverpool star, who no argument about it, is in the form of his life, is not only Fulham's metronome, he also works like a Trojan breaking up the opposition's attack. 
              
              The Cheshire-born star loves to 'get his foot in' and he is widely regarded as one of the best passers of a football in the country. 
              
              Fulham chief Hodgson, who himself is shortlisted for TEAMtalk's Manager of the Year award, picked Murphy up in August 2007 from Spurs for an undisclosed fee and he can't have made too many better signings. 
              
              Murphy has bounced back from indifferent spells with Charlton and Tottenham but he's been worth his weight in gold and only the sublime talent of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have limited Murphy's England caps to just nine and he is a worthy winner. 
              
              A close second is Anfield's unfashionable trooper, Dirk Kuyt. 
              
              He's not as pleasing on the eye as Murphy and has had his detractors, but Kuyt's had a tremendous season with Liverpool and it's hard to think of a top-flight star who gives more than the Dutchman. 
              
              His work-rate is unrivalled and his versatility is also a major reason why Rafa Benitez rates him so highly, but Kuyt, who has signed a new contract, also has his fair share of class. 
              
              With 51 appearances to his name this season Kuyt has been a model of consistency and he's also chipped in with 15 goals as Liverpool grabbed second spot in the Premier League and reached the Champions League quarter-finals.

              <p>For me, the unsung hero for Liverpool is Benny.</p>
              <p>Cos he have scored a lot of critical goals where most of his team mates have given up or throw in the towel.</p>
              <p>Another player recognised for his contribution is Alonso.</p>
              <p>His passing was the difference and created a lot of goals for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Kuyt was very important also but I prefer he move forward some more to score more goals.</p>
              <p>Another guy that created a miracle and not recognised at the end of the season is manager Harry Redknapp.</p>
              <p>He have performed the impossible task of pulling spurs from bottom of the table at mid season to mid table.</p>
              <p>That is an impressive feat for any manager.</p>
              <p>He earned my respect for it.</p>
              <p>As for Ah Ben, he have to learn his lesson the hard way on the way of tinkering.</p>
              <p>But, credit should be given to him and the players for delivering the results with such a thin squad.</p>
