            <div class='col-md body'>actually Liverpool by qualifying for the finals of the Carling Cup is assured of a place in UEFA Cup next season cos Chelsea and Man Utd would most probably qualify for Champion's League together with Arsenal and a fourth placed team (likely to be a blue jerseyed team from Merseyside <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br><br>Liverpool should therefore just concentrate on Champions League above everything else.  It would be unprecedented if Liverpool wins the Champions League and finish below fourth cos England would effectively have 5 reps in the Champions League!</div>
