            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek has had his entire medal collection stolen after a burglary at his home.<br><br>The Pole, who was surprisingly left out of his country's World Cup squad, returned from holiday to discover that over 120 items - including his Champions League winners' medal from 2005 - had been stolen.<br><br>The thieves also stole his car and a number of other personal possessions.<br><br>A spokesman for Liverpool FC said: "A lot of this stuff which has been stolen is irreplaceable and you can't put a price on it. Jerzy is obviously devastated.<br><br>"We are talking about the memorabilia of someone's career and also a lifetime.<br><br>"Jerzy was made famous by what he did in the Champions League (he saved the decisive penalty from AC Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko in the shoot-out) and for someone to have gone into his house and stolen it is despicable.<br><br>"On behalf of the club and the player we would ask anyone with information to contact either us or Merseyside police."<br><br>A police spokeswoman said: "Merseyside police is investigating reports of a burglary at a house in Caldy, Wirral.<br><br>"The burglary was reported by a friend of the owner on Monday, June 19 and was thought to have happened within the last week while the homeowners were away on holiday.<br><br>"The homeowner arrived back in the country late on Tuesday night and police officers will be speaking to him today to find out exactly what has been stolen, although it is known that a black Porsche Carrera has definitely been stolen.<br><br>"There were a large number of distinctive items of memorabilia stolen which obviously have sentimental value to the owner.<br><br>"If anyone spots them being sold on the internet or in the local shops or in their local pub, it will be obvious that they are special items.<br><br>"We would urge anyone who spots them on sale to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."<br><br>y would someone steal his medals<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
