            <div class='col-md body'>Baros form and goals in Euro 04 has attracted many of Euro's Head Honchos and Real Madrid ahs firmly made a offer to Baros to join them.<br><br>In Liverpool FC, we already have Owen, Baros and the newly recruited Cisse in the ranks. This certainly spells goals in the department. But who will forge a deadly partnership is still anyone's guess. Owen's form in Euro has been uneventful but his assists is undoubted in some of England's goals.<br><br>And while Cisse comes in with a fantastic goal scoring record in the French League, it remains unclear whether he'll made a blast in the first Season.<br><br>So, whilst the competition is healthy up front... Baros has stated that he won't be happy for long on the bench. What Ah Ben will do to solve this? While it's many player's desire to play in a  Real Madrid jersey... I personally think Baros should stay where there's more hunger in Liverpool to win Silverwares than in Real. Any which way, Real already has Raul and they need a target man instead of another forward in the mould of Baros.<br><br>What say you guys?<br><br><strong>From Skysports dotcom:</strong><br><br>Liverpool forward Milan Baros has confirmed he has been made an offer to join Real Madrid.<br><br>The Czech Republic international increased his stock at over the summer when topping the goalscoring charts at Euro 2004, but his future at Liverpool is in doubt.<br><br>Baros was a fringe player under former Reds boss Gerard Houllier and he has yet to speak to Rafa Benitez about his role at Anfield next term.<br><br>The 22-year-old said during Euro 2004 that he would not accept a place on the bench on Merseyside, and it would appear as if his comments filtered through to one of the candidates for Real's presidential race.<br><br>Lorenzo Sanz has set his sights on landing Baros, and is claiming a deal will be struck if he beats Florentino Perez to the high-profile role, and the Czech star has confirmed he has been sounded out about joining Real.<br><br>"Real Madrid have made a concrete offer but it is still a question of discussions," Baros told Czech TV.<br><br>"It is only an offer. I still have a contract with Liverpool and go back there on July 19."<br><br>Sanz is standing against Perez, and businessman Arturo Baldasano in Real's forthcoming elections.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it will be a wrong move if we let Baros go... dunno whether he will play ahead of Owen but we need depth in the striking department... esp when Owen suffers his annual injury(hope not)...<br><br>yes we need Baros more than Real Madrid... and if he wants 1st team football, i think he will have a tougher time getting it at Real when u consider he's fighting for 1st team with the likes of Ronaldo, Raul, Morientes...</div>

Both Owen and Baros need big man as partner so it looks like it is either Cisse-Owen or Cisse-Baros.<br><br>But if Cisse is injured, die!  So, maybe they should bring Erik Meijer back!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
