              <h2>HODGSON WELCOMES GERRARD COMMITMENT</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson has welcomed captain Steven Gerrard's
               decision to publicly commit himself to the club.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old midfielder, who has been linked with a summer 
              move to Real Madrid, backed Hodgson's plans, welcomed the arrival of new
               signing Joe Cole and said he was looking forward to playing alongside 
              his England team-mate.</p>
              <p>And that has delighted Hodgson, who has met Gerrard only briefly 
              since taking over from Rafael Benitez on July 1.</p>
              <p>"It's a great piece of news," said the 62-year-old Englishman.</p>
              <p>"There won't be anyone in Liverpool who isn't delighted to hear 
              that.</p>
              <p>"I'm really pleased about it because I've got great respect for 
              Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>"He's a player who I was really looking forward to working with 
              when I came to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"It seems now with that commitment that this will happen. It 
              gives everyone a boost without question.</p>
              <p>"It will be a tough season, with a lot of matches and the 
              disappointment of last season is going to take a while to dissipate, but
               it is very good that our best player is still going to be playing at 
              this club.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully with the signing of Joe Cole - and if we are lucky one
               or two others, to boost the squad - we will be going into this season's
               competition, maybe stronger on paper than we were last season."</p>
              <p>Gerrard said in the <em>Liverpool Echo</em>: "(Joe Cole) is a great
               signing for us. I know Joe well through the England set-up and have 
              seen first hand just how good a player he is.</p>
              <p>"I've told him what a great club this is and I'm sure Joe's the 
              sort of exciting talent our fans will love to see."</p>
              <p>Of his own future, he said: "I made it clear that I simply needed
               to concentrate on the World Cup and then have a decent holiday with my 
              family.</p>
              <p>"I wanted the chance to meet Roy Hodgson privately and having 
              done so, I'm very impressed with his plans for the future."</p>
              <p>Hodgson had earlier said: "Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard did
               a good job in selling the club to Joe at the recent World Cup.</p>
              <p>"He was undecided about what he wanted to do and to be fair it 
              takes a bit more selling to persuade a Londoner who has played all his 
              life in London to move up to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"The simple solution would have been to stay in the London area."</p>
              <p>He added on talkSPORT: "I am pleased to get the player because it
               is very important to try to improve our squad as much as we can in 
              order to reach the high goals we have set ourselves.</p>
              <p>"It is also pleasing the reaction of the fans has been as 
              positive as our reaction, so at the moment that is perfect.</p>
              <p>"Now it is up to Joe to show on the field he is the right man."</p>
              <p>Carragher, meanwhile, feels the signing of Cole proved a point to
               their Barclays Premier League rivals who maybe thought the club were on
               the slide after a disappointing seventh-placed finish.</p>
              <p>"It's great news and it is a message that Liverpool mean 
              business," said the 32-year-old.</p>
              <p>"We have signed a top international player who has been really 
              important for Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"A lot of clubs wanted to sign him but it is a real coup that he 
              has chosen to come here and you have got to give the manager and the 
              board a pat on the back for convincing him to come here.</p>
              <p>"Every supporter that I have spoken to is absolutely delighted 
              and all the players are the same - it's given everyone a boost, just at 
              the right time.</p>
              <p>"It has been a long summer and we have been in a transitional 
              period but now the World Cup is out of the way, we can start to look 
              forward again.</p>
              <p>"The fact we have got him has given everyone a boost around the 
              city. It's good news again and, hopefully, there will be more to come.</p>
              <p>"It's the kind of signing that we needed to make."</p>
              <p>Fernando Torres has also been heavily linked with a move away 
              from Liverpool - and Hodgson has already spoken to him as he nurses the 
              injury he suffered in the World Cup final.</p>
              <p>"I met Torres last Wednesday in Ibiza, albeit briefly," said the 
              manager.</p>
              <p>"He told me the groin problem was not anything to worry about, it
               was something which would clear up with rest on holiday.</p>
              <p>"We are hoping he will come back fit and well."</p>
