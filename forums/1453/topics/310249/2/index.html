              <p>U heard about typical Liverpool away game's Counter Attack ?</p>
              <p>Ya , that's what happened .</p>

              <p>Inter tried too hard for Serie A matches , and caused those injuries and disrupt their UCL rhythm .</p>
              <p>Inter tonight playing basically a 70% fit team .</p>
              <p>Inter's red-card not the most crucial for this defeat .... with 11's , Inter still not fancy by me for a win .</p>
              <p>When u see Hyypia , Carra , and Skrtel inside our team sheet , and 2 full-backs .... and 3 defensive midfielders ( Lucas , Mask and Gerrard ) , u know the outcome .</p>
              <p>Of course our El Nino was the sole man upfront ...Babel ? He was a make-shift defensive midfielder today . <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>what an anti-climax ending to the game, watching the reds simply passing the ball around for the last 20 mins. was hoping that with so many goal cushion, they would entertain me with some good football.</p>
              <p>nevertheless, lady luck is shining on liverpool in this tournament given that they need a one-man advantage to score some goals. inter also have themselves to blame for some dreadful finishings which you can only see in pre-torres liverpool.</p>
              <p>just hope there is no hangover and complacency after this easy win.</p>

              <p>anyway, even with 2 goals advantage, i think <strong>reina</strong> has saved the day for liverpool.</p>
              <p>he made at least a couple of stunning saves which would easily changed the climate of the game.</p>
              <p>any other day, the ball would have surely crossed the line.</p>

              <p>Way to go Liverpool. Just hope that the four English clubs don't meet each other until the semis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the strength of the EPL, UEFA should consider introducing a 5th English side into Champions League!</p>

              <h1><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=515845&amp;cc=4716">Mancini wants to quit Inter at end of season</a></h1>
              <p>MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini said on Tuesday he wanted to leave the club at the end of the season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 43-year-old coach made the announcement after the Italian champions were knocked out of the Champions League last 16 after losing 1-0 at home to Liverpool and 3-0 on aggregate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Despite having another four years on my contract, the next two and a half months will be my last guiding Inter,' he told a shocked news conference.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I have told the boys and it's right to tell everyone. It is a decision I have taken and it does not depend on the defeat tonight.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was no official statement from Serie A leaders Inter and there had been no hint he would make such an announcement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The former Fiorentina and Lazio coach has been prone to making hot-headed decisions and earlier this season refused to speak to the press for a week because he was angry at reports saying Inter had been fortunate in several refereeing decisions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inter romped to the Italian title under Mancini last season and are six points clear this term. However, they have limped out of the Champions League at the first knockout stage for the second successive season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mancini, Inter coach since July 2004, added that he wanted to leave Inter with another scudetto and an Italian Cup in the bag.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inter, who celebrated their centenary at the weekend, also won the 2005/06 title but it was awarded to them in a courtroom after Juventus's demotion for match-fixing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Earlier this season Italian media reports said Inter owner Massimo Moratti had held talks with former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho but the club and the Portuguese denied it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talking about the Liverpool defeat, Mancini said playing both legs with 10 men for a time made life impossible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Obviously playing 10 against 11 is the biggest problem and if you are trying to recover a match you can not do that,' Mancini said, adding that the refereeing in the second leg had not been even.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'In the first half there were four tackles from behind from Liverpool defenders that were never punished.'</span></p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>sore loser! mancini must have thought UCL referees must be as kelong as italian league referees who alway on their side.</p>
