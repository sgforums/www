Owen does not interest us either.'<br><br>Former Real boss Queiroz was more complimentary about Luis Figo, who is set to leave Madrid this summer, but insists no contact has been made with the former world player of the year.<br><br>'Figo is a fantastic player, who has the quality and professional attitude to still play in any team,' said Queiroz. 'But there has been no negotiations.'<br><br>Queiroz also reassured United fans that Real have made no approach regarding Cristiano Ronaldo, whose representative has confirmed that the Portugal winger is prepared to wait for a revised contract.<br><br>Ronaldo is two years into a five-year deal with the Red Devils but having moved to the club as an unknown 18-year-old in August 2003, he now feels he deserves parity with the other top earners at the club.<br><br>'He still has three years to go on his contract so we will see what happens,' Luis Correia, business partner of Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes, told reporters.<br><br>'He will travel to Portugal with his team later this month so maybe a deal will be sorted out then.<br><br>'Of course, he is a top player and will attract interest from other clubs, but he is just concentrating on his football at the moment.'<br></blockquote></div>

Saha is crap, RVN is not on form, and Rooney aint a profilic scorer, more like he is being groomed to be the next Scholesy in the "hole" position, so Owen would be a fine addition to Manu's squad.

Crouch is useless, only that he offers a different dimension in the attack, and that is if u wanna play like Everton. Pongelle, somehow was brilliant in the WOrld Youth Cup for France years back when he was the top scorer and if i'm not wrong, he set a goalscoring tournament record. ManUtd wanted him, but Gerard H snapped him out, and his progress ever since was almost non-existent. Mellor, wouldnt be able to play for any of the top 10 teams in the EPL, and the only reason he is in the team, is that he is a Scouser. As for Morientes, i think he is quality.. Cisse?? Less said the better, he's just a sprinter version of Heskey.. Powerful but technically retarded.</div>

He also created assists around the box for the other team mates. I duno where were u with the recent LFC matches were played cos obviously you weren't watching it. We have seen Crouch showing the nerves to evade tackles with dribbles. I do think he has adapt pretty well la.<br><br>But I have admit tho.. goals per match ratio.. Owen is still very much lethal than all the strikers we have in the squad now.</div>
