            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United have declared an interest in bringing Michael Owen to St James' Park, while Manchester United have denied claims from Real Madrid that they have also enquired about the England striker.<br>The former Liverpool forward has been linked with a move back to the Barclays Premiership after being pushed down to fifth in the pecking order at Real Madrid.<br><br>Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd told official club website, www.nufc.co.uk: Â“We have had a discussion with Madrid but won't be commenting further on any speculation.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, a Real Madrid spokesman said: Â“Newcastle are very interested in Owen. They are following him closely and are showing the most concrete interest.<br><br>Â“However there are other sides showing an interest, including Manchester United.Â”<br><br>Owen, through his advisors SFX, admitted last week that there had been Â“brief dialogueÂ” with three or four top-flight clubs with a view to one of those teams bringing him back to England after one season in Spain.<br><br>The 25-year-old insists he is happy to stay at the Bernabeu until the end of his contract in 2008, despite his first-team chances having diminished still further with the summer signings of Brazilian forwards Robinho and Julio Baptista.<br><br>He has no regrets about his time in Madrid so far and is confident when he does return to England he will have improved his game.<br><br>Â“Regardless of what happens this summer, I would like to return to the Premiership one day,Â” he wrote in his column in The Times.<br><br>Â“Already I feel that my time abroad has matured me and I believe that when I do return, it will be as a better player.Â”<br><br>Owen revealed the signing of Baptista Â“put in motionÂ” the process of his advisors looking into the possibility of a move back to England at the start of a World Cup season.<br><br>He added: Â“Knowing the importance of World Cup finals year, [Real] said that if there was a possible transfer that suited everyone, I had their permission to explore it, but there was no pressure to make any decision that did not suit me.<br><br>Â“This information was conveyed to a small group of clubs and we have until August 31 to see if anything happens.<br><br>Â“Mentally, I am preparing for another season with Real and if I do find myself on the bench at the start of the season, I will do everything possible to force my way into the starting XI and I know I will be given a fair chance to do this.Â”<br><br>Owen, who scored 16 goals in 26 starts for Madrid, added: Â“I look back on the past year with a lot of good memories.<br><br>Â“People ask me if I was disappointed that Liverpool won the European Cup while Real Madrid won nothing. I was delighted for Liverpool Â– especially for the fans and my many friends there.<br><br>Â“But if I had to make the decision again, I would still have chosen Real. It is an experience that has developed me as a player and as a person.<br><br>Â“I have enjoyed learning from new training regimes and watching some of the world's best players at close quarters.Â”<br><br></div>
