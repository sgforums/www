I don't think Robbie Fowler can forget how to score, if you've scored 150 goals you canÂ’t learn a lot," he explained.<br><br>"It's more important to practise giving good boxes into the box, good passes. If you are creating the chances, what more can you do?"<br><br>Err, score, Rafa?<br><br>Certainly the Spaniard's lassiez-faire attitude towards the art of scoring does not appeared to be shared his exasperated skipper.<br><br>Speaking after a host of missed chances had resulted in Pool's elimination from the Champions League, Gerrard said: "I think it's a lack of confidence. We'll keep working at it and we'll have some extra shooting practice in training."<br><br>While Peter Crouch was Liverpool's culprit-in-chief against Benfica, he remains the only striker at Anfield to have scored this season, while the team itself has netted just four times in nine matches.</blockquote>*shakes head*</div>

There are probably two on that list to move on.<br><br>'[Luis] Garcia has scored a lot of goals so maybe there is a bit of leeway there but Liverpool need to score.<br><br>'The Michael Owen situation - he shouldn't even have been allowed to go (to Real Madrid in 2004).'<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has been linked with a return to his former club Real Madrid and Inter Milan but Thompson hopes he stays to continue his work at Anfield.<br><br>Thompson added: 'Maybe it is his spiritual home, Real Madrid, but it is not the place for him - he could be out of a job in six months.<br><br>'He is only just starting at Liverpool and getting the backing of the board. He has still got a job to do. 'Inter Milan may be more worrying, he may get a few more years there, but I hope he stays at Liverpool.'<br><br>Former Liverpool striker Ian Rush also hopes to see the club bounce back under Benitez's charge.<br><br>Rush said: 'It is disappointing to be out of Europe but it's all about getting ready to compete with Chelsea in the league and next year's Champions League now.<br><br>'Benitez is a great manager and hopefully Liverpool can get two or three new players.'<br></div>
