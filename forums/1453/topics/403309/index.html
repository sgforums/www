We scored, but we missed a lot of chances. We still need to get the feel of the ball," he explained.<br><br>"Villa and I have said we understand each other perfectly and hopefully we can play together again, although we've always said that if we don't then it doesn't matter as long as the team works well.<br><br>"Jesus Navas got to the by-line well and we spent most of the game camped in their half. And scoring in the first-half helped the side a lot. Our gameplan is clear."<br><br>He added: "Our defeat against Switzerland was already water under the bridge, we talked about it and it's not logical to look back. We played in the same style as we played against Switzerland, we attacked and played short passes.<br><br>"This first group of games is very difficult, we still have a match to play against Chile. Being world champions is a long way down the road.<br><br>"Not just for any national squad, but in terms of time as well, there is a long time to go before the final and there are many matches to play before then. At the moment we are focused on Chile, beating them and moving on to the next round."<br><br>Meanwhile, as the England squad squirm and wilt under the intense spotlight of their domestic media, Torres is pleased with the way in which the Spanish press are reporting matters from his side's camp.<br><br>"We are very happy with the press back home. They have shown their support to the team since day one," he said.<br><br>"The rest of the world are waiting for us to make a mistake, they doubt our style of play, but I don't feel that they have any reason to do so."</span></div>
