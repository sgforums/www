            <div class='col-md body'>I think it depends on how you want to judge the player.<br><br>If you are looking for someone who can get you 30 goals a season, then Crouch is obviously not the best person to do so.<br><br>But if you are looking for a big target man that other players can play off to, then Crouch is perhaps one of the best in the world at that.<br><br>The problem with Liverpool is that they are relying on Crouch for the goals. They don't have a natural goal poacher that can benefit playing off Crouch and bang in the goals.<br><br>So until Liverpool  find someone like Scvchenko or Michael Owen to play alongside beanpole, I don't think the criticism for Crouch will ever stop.</div>
