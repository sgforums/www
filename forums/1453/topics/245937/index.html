"So I would be satisfied with a goalless draw, although 1-0 would be much better.<br><br>PSV have been slipping domestically of late, having failed to win in three games now. They still lead Ajax by three points, and Koeman implored his players to wipe the slate clean ahead of the Liverpool game.<br><br>"The problems we have in the Dutch competition are in the background for a few days," said the former Ajax and Benfica coach.<br><br>"We have to be proud to be in this Champions League competition. Every sportsman wants to compete at the highest level."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Don't Let PSV Fool You - Benitez</strong><br><br>Liverpool coach Rafa Benitez sent out a much expected warning on the eve of the quarter-final first leg against PSV at the Phillips Stadion.<br><br>"Don't let anyone be fooled into thinking that PSV will not fight with everything they have got to get into the last four," he said in the press conference on the eve of the game.<br><br>"We will not underestimate them. They beat Arsenal in the last round and they are top of their league.<br><br>"Whatever their supposed problems are with form or injuries, they will fight for this with everything they possess, have no fears about that.<br><br>"They will know how important the Champions League is and they will fight for everything, fight to win with all they have.<br><br>"They have some defensive problems, but you never know whether that can help you.<br><br>"Alex [who will miss out with a Hamstring problem] is an important player for them and they have some problems with Kone too, but sometimes you can bring in players who do not usually play in the first team, and they do better than those they have replaced. That is also a danger.<br><br>"We have had them watched recently, and we saw them when they lost 5-1 at home to Ajax. A shock, but they tried to play three men at the back and they conceded goals.<br><br>"But normally they have great balance and do not concede many, and they score plenty. They will be trying to get back to that level of performance."<br><br>He also spoke about the meeting with club owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks yesterday: "It was an important meeting in terms of the future of the club and it went well.<br><br>"We spoke about our ideas for the future and everything was positive. I think this club has a brilliant future."<br><br>Asked if it meant he would be handed a handsome transfer budget, he smiled and said: "We have a big Champions League game against PSV to concentrate on and now is not the time to talk about money."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PSV Eindhoven v Liverpool: PreviewPA<br><br>Rafael Benitez has warned his Liverpool stars not to be fooled into believing Champions League rivals PSV Eindhoven are in disarray.<br><br>PSV have injury and form problems and saw their lead at the top of the Dutch league cut to just two points after Ajax's win at home to Heracles on Sunday.<br><br>But with the pressure mounting on PSV boss Ronald Koeman, Liverpool boss Benitez refuses to be sidetracked from his task of plotting the Anfield club's passage into the semi-finals.<br><br>Benitez said: ``Don't let anyone be fooled into thinking that PSV will not fight with everything they have got to get into the last four.<br><br>``We will not underestimate them. They beat Arsenal in the last round and they are top of their league.<br><br>``Whatever their supposed problems are with form or injuries, they will fight for this with everything they possess, have no fears about that.<br><br>``They will know how important the Champions League is and they will fight for everything, fight to win with all they have.<br><br>``They have some defensive problems, but you never know whether that can help you. Alex is an important player for them and they have some problems with (Ivory Coast striker Arouna) Kone too, but sometimes you can bring in players who do not usually play in the first team, and they do better than those they have replaced. That is also a danger.''<br><br>Key defender Alex is out with a hamstring problem despite attempts back in Brazil to produce a miracle cure. The experienced Michael Reiziger is sidelined for the rest of the season with a groin injury.<br><br>But defender Carlos Salcido was back against Breda, despite complaints from Mexico that PSV were not treating a mystery injury properly. But he was fit enough to complete the full match at the weekend.<br><br>PSV also had Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes back from injury in that match.<br><br>Benitez said: ``We have had them watched recently, and we saw them when they lost 5-1 at home to Ajax recently. A shock. But they tried to play three men at the back, and they conceded goals.<br><br>``But normally they have great balance and do not concede many goals, and they score plenty. They will be trying to get back to that level of performance.<br><br>``They also have problems with their goalkeeper, but with strong defenders in front of whoever plays there, we know they will still be very difficult to beat.''<br><br>He added: ``PSV had people at Anfield to watch us, and they will have seen us score four against Arsenal, who they beat in the last Champions League round.<br><br>``But I do not think that will make much difference to their thinking. They know already that we are a good side and a dangerous team.<br><br>``And they will also know that they have to play very well at home and score goals because they know that when they come to Anfield it will be a difficult game for them.''<br><br>Benitez must decide whether to stick with the system and personnel responsible for the 4-1 win over Arsenal at the weekend, a team the Spaniard considers plays in a similar style to PSV.<br><br>The use of Peter Crouch up front and Steven Gerrard in a free central role behind the big striker could have been a preview for how Liverpool will play in Eindhoven.<br><br>Benitez will certainly have his big guns available again. He rested Steve Finnan and Sami Hyypia at the weekend and will have Craig Bellamy back from injury.<br><br>Crouch accepts that he must wait to see whether his goal-scoring spree will ensure him a place in the starting line-up.<br><br>But he reckons PSV will be worried: ``We have produced a big win against a class side like Arsenal, and that will worry Eindhoven. And if we get a few players back fit then we have a good chance of winning there.<br><br>``We all have confidence. It will be a big, big game and we must produce a top performance.''<br></div>
