              <h3>JOE COLE hopes he's already made a season-defining contribution at Anfield by 
              convincing skipper Steven Gerrard to stay at the club.</h3>
              <p>A day after Cole penned a four-year Liverpool deal, Gerrard ended speculation 
              about his future.</p>
              <p>The timing was no coincidence, and should new boss Roy Hodgson revive the 
              Merseysiders that whirlwind 24 hours will be seen as decisive.</p>
              <p>Cole, who'll make his debut in today's friendly with Borussia Monchengladbach, 
              said: "I hope that I did play a part in making Stevie stay.</p>
              <p>"Stevie knows what I can do. We have played together for England for 10 years 
              right the way through.</p>
              <p>"I am looking forward to playing alongside him and our relationship is going 
              to be important.</p>
              <p>"I will play anywhere though I hope it is central with him - with one of us 
              going forward and the other pivoting.</p>
              <p>"I can't talk about tactics but the manager knows what I can do on the left 
              and the right. But it will be nice to be close to him.</p>
              <p>"At Liverpool this year is about consolidating and moving on. There are 
              players here who will get into any team in the world.</p>
              <p>"I had conversations with Stevie and 'Carra' and everything about they said 
              about Liverpool impressed me. We are a part of a club that can do something 
              special. If you win a trophy here, one of the big ones, it will be immense."</p>
              <p>Cole believes he is heading to Merseyside with the club on the brink of 
              getting back among the elite.</p>
              <p>"I went to Chelsea at the right time when Roman Abramovich had just come in," 
              he said. "Hopefully, I have come to Liverpool at the right time too.</p>
              <p>"Expectations are low because the previous management, however successful it 
              had been, had come to an end and had become stale.</p>
              <p>"Roy has come in with fresh ideas and shaken the place up. I knew Roy was well 
              respected and that if you talk to people in the game they will tell you what 
              a good coach he is. I am not just saying that but he is nice, he gets his 
              message across and though I have only been here a few days, I have seen him 
              coach in three different languages. That's impressive when you see it. He 
              knows his football and I can talk football to people for ages."</p>
              <p>And Cole believes he'll have more freedom to express himself after two 
              frustrating years at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>He said: "The fans at Chelsea loved me and I can't thank them enough for that 
              but I need to feel loved when I am on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"The manager has to want me there. I don't so much need an arm around the 
              shoulder as for managers to remember that in the positions I play you are 
              going to lose the ball sometimes.</p>
              <p>"You only need to do one thing right; one clever pass, one little bit of skill 
              that can change a game but to do that you need to feel relaxed and calm."</p>
              <p>Cole says that wasn't the case at Stamford Bridge last season.</p>
              <p>"I had a year out through injury and was trying too hard because I felt that 
              if I didn't do something in the first 20 minutes I would be off. You can't 
              play in my position with that kind of pressure."</p>
