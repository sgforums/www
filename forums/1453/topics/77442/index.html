Lost to a better team.<br><br>As for liverpool opinion..thats jus some minority saying la. Noone look down on liverpool but do hope they play better football and improved. Newcastle is catching up on them le...even plying better.<br><br>I think it's the manager.....<br>Liverpool has a strong tradition N shld be challenging for glories instead of hoping to land a champions league place which they may suffer also even if they got in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway from what I observed,Ferguson seems to be on better terms with Houllier.After the match,they would shake hands,talk a bit of co-ck and have a laugh.But not with Wenger,you hardly see the two even shake hand.The last two matches between Arsenal and MU,they just shook hands(looks very unwilling to me for both parties)and then fu-cked off,no joking around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>6 yrs in charge oredi rite Houllier? Still have not build a strong squad. Abit below expectation really.<br><br>They should sign David O leary.<br>He's a good manager......jus look at Leeds when he was in charge and when there's not so much financial problem. Then look at Aston Villa now.<br><br>I think if he goes to watever club wif enuff resources for him....he will do a gd job.</div>
