            <div class='col-md body'>RAFA COUNTS THE COST<br><br>Liverpool Manager Rafa Benitez is sweating on the fitness of four of his players after they picked up injuries during Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Fulham at Craven Cottage.<br><br>The Reds were beaten by a second half goal from Fulham substitute Clint Dempsey, but Rafa was more concerned with the condition of some players who had been the recipients of some over zealous challenges.<br><br>"I have four players injured," said Rafa. "Pepe Reina has a shoulder problem, Mark Gonzalez and Alvaro Arbeloa have ankle problems and Momo Sissoko has a knee injury. We will have to wait and see how they all are."<br><br>Benitez was particularly unhappy with a headbutt by Fulham Captain Michael Brown on Xabi Alonso that went unpunished. He said: "It's clear for everybody to see this incident and how the officials didn't see it is unbelievable."<br><br>On the game itself, Rafa defended his decision to make nine changes and pointed to a number of missed chances that might have seen Liverpool win the game.<br><br>"We had five clear chances in the first half which should be enough to win the game. If you want to win matches you have to take your chances, it's as simple as that. They had two chances and scored one goal."<br></div>

I can count easily with my 2 hands how many chances he missed so far this season. It's unforgivable really.<br><br>I was hoping to see inept Fulham going down but to see them winning against Liverpool has make me absolutely furious, furious with both Benitez and Fowler.
