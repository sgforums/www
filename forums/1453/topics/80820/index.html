            <div class='col-md body'>England ace Owen Hargreaves has revealed that if he was to leave Bayern Munich, the club he'd most like to play for would be Liverpool.<br><br>The 23-year-old midfielder admits he would be interested in moving to the Premiership in the summer after the Euro 2004 finals and has pinpointed Anfield as the destination of his choice.<br><br>"After seven years I'm starting to feel that I want to play elsewhere," he said. "Sometimes you just know when it's time to move on and take a new step. That time might be now or maybe it will be after another season. But I'm very excited about the next few years and thinking where I might end up.<br><br>"The Premiership, in particular, is brilliant and the fans are fantastic and just to be there every week would be a dream for me. I'd also be very much closer to my family because it's quite possible that, if I got transferred, my parents might move from Canada and return to England."<br><br>"Liverpool, with a new manager, will be looking to strengthen their squad. With one or two new players they could be a very talented team. The basis is already there with Stevie Gerrard and Michael Owen. That would be a great destination for me, and I think I would fit in really well.<br><br>"Arsenal are a wonderful team. I've seen a lot of them this season and they've definitely been the best team in Europe; it's just a shame they went out to Chelsea in the Champions League. I'd love to play for them but I just don't know if they need any new players.<br><br>"Manchester United are in a bit of transition and Chelsea have a wad of money to spend on who they want. If I had carte blanche to choose I would say I'd be a good fit at Liverpool."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I beg to differ Poolman.<br><br>The only similiarity between Hargreaves and Murphy is their industrial like attitiude. But Hargreaves certainly has a edge over Murphy due to his sound first touches and passes.<br><br>Though Hagreaves does not posess the pace on the turn... his passing and vision reminds me of the days when LFC perform poetry on the field with their slick passing, one touches. Also, Hargreave's European exploits with Bayern Munich will do good to LFC if we are to challange for European honours again.<br><br>But whether or not Hargreaves is to be recruited remains to be seen with the uncertainly with the manager's position looming ahead still.</div>
