I come here because I believe that this team does not have limits.<br><br>"There is a great establishment of players, many internationals, and that is what, in the end, has made my decision.<br><br>"Pepe said to me that I must come here. He has spoken wonders to me and he has done a lot because I'm now here. I hope that everything he told me becomes reality."<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More info about this youngster from a fan from Denmark</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">glace84 @ Koptalk forum:<br><br>Hey guys.<br><br>I'm from Denmark and i happen to have seen Daniel Agger play for Brondby many times. <strong>All the hype about this kid is only because he's the real deal. I havent seen an as talented danish player at this age in a very long time.</strong><br><br>He had his debut last season at the age of 19 when brondby sold their centerback andreas jakobsen to Southhampton. Many questioned the teams ability to cope without him but then this young kid started playing in the first team. Daniel Agger was his name as you can quess an he took the danish league with storm and he was very influential in Brondby winning the championship the same year.<br><br>When Martin Laursen and Per KrÃ¸ldrup was injured he also got his debut for the danish national team where he was told to step in. Even at this level he also managed to establish himself. <strong>As you might have seen he also played against England where he kept a certain Wayne Rooney very quiet even though he scored a meaningless goal in the end with the danes already a couple of goals up.</strong><br><br>So I can assure guys that this buy would be a steal. 5.5 million pounds is quite high in the danish league because of the limited finances in danish football so this sum is definetely the maximum we are gonna pay.</span><br></div>
