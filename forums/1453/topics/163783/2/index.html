            <div class='col-md body'>for the left side. i think kewell can play as a CM or a supporting striker. zenden n gonzalez on the right side. risse will be left back like now. either warnock or traore can be sold. if wanna keep both of them then riise will be back up LM. like zenden is out for the season then riise got chance. anyway its good to buy players who can take up various roles</div>
