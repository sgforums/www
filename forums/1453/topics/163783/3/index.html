Spartak are understood to have quoted Â£11m for the 25-year-old centre-half, though the English clubs are unlikely to offer more than Â£4.5m.<br><br>Vidic has a buy-out in his contract in Moscow at that amount entitling him to move, though the player would have to trigger the clause by asking for a transfer and agreeing to compensation for the remainder of his deal.<br>Rafael BenÃ­tez has drawn up a list of other centre-halves should his pursuit of Vidic falter, with <strong>Brondby's Daniel Agger </strong>believed to be his principal target. The 21-year-old Denmark international would cost about Â£4.5m, around half of the money likely to be granted to the Liverpool manager next month. The Argentinian defender <strong>Carlo Coloccini</strong>, currently at Deportivo la Coruna, will only be considered on loan. BenÃ­tez is similarly active in pursuit of a right-sided midfielder. Coloccini's compatriot <strong>Luciano Galletti</strong>, a fringe player at Atletico Madrid since joining last summer, is being considered only on a temporary basis.<br><br>Liverpool are hoping that they will be granted a work permit for the Chilean winger Mark GonzÃ¡lez in the new year now that they have struck a deal with Albacete. The original loan move was delayed by the Home Office after Chile were ranked two places outside Fifa's top 70.<br><br></div>
