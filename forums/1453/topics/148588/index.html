Gonzalez has been playing his football in Spain with Albacete who were relegated at the end of last season.<br><br>Rafa's knowledge of the Spanish scene immediately encouraged him to move for a man who would have been an important addition to our squad.<br><br>To secure a work permit you have to demonstrate that the individual will make a significant contribution to the development of the game in this country.<br><br>I find it odd to have people saying he is not good enough, but there we are. Gonzalez is injured at the moment and was coming in a slightly unusual deal. That was probably a factor, but we are nevertheless disappointed.

I do not have to renew my contract until the end of the season, until June probably.<br><br>'The club could go four or five months to decide what they want to do with me, whether to sign a contract or let me go somewhere.<br><br>'But for the moment I want to stay [in the Premier League] and to play here because the Premier League is very exciting for me. Everybody loves it right now.<br><br>'But it's not in my hands. It is down to the manager and the club. Of course, if I had the chance of another contract at Villa it would interest me.<br><br>'I was very pleased with this club when I moved here and you see the response when I still try to do my best for this club.'<br><br></span></span></div>
