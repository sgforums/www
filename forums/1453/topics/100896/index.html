            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Indeed Man U got very arrogant especially during its so called hey days in the 1990s and early part of this century. That era was really the golden period for the team and they reigned unchallenged and supreme in the EPL and also did well in Champs League.<br><br>During this time, not only the club and Fergie but also the fans and supporters became very cocky and arrogant, teasing not only the Liverpool but also other supporters and at times going over the top.<br><br>From a personal perspective and point of view those were bad days and I really prayed and wished that if not Liverpool, another team could rise to the scene and be a worthy opponent to Man U and wasnt it just sickening to see them get trophy after trophy and victory after victory?<br><br>Looking at this scenario, it reminds me of something like the cold war last imt between the old Soviet Union and America. Last time cos of the presence of the USSR, the power in this world was balanced and in fact I felt it was better that way. Now with USA as the sole superpower, America could become very arrogant and cocky, if they are not already like that.<br><br>Like the EPL, there must be also a balance of power. Man U became so arrogant cos they were previously the sole power, in the 1990s and early 21st Century. Now that Arsenal has arrived on the scene, I really hope that Arsenal and even better other clubs can come onto the scene and challenge the dominace of Man U.<br><br>In a way it really seems to me that Arsenal are the answer to my prayers and that they have come to knock Man U off the summit.<br><br>This is rally a huge relief for the Anybody But Utd group as Man U were so powerful at 1 stage that it seemed that nobody would ever be able to touch them and they were going stronger and stronger.<br><br>If other clubs especially Liverpool can rise up and challenge that will be so much better as it will make for a much more competitive EPL.<br><br>I do notice nowadays that the Man U fans are not so cocky anymore and in fact they do not seem to want to acknowledge that Arsenal are rising. This really gives me the impression that they are very clever and smart to boo and jeer others when they are on top but do not want to take the flak when the tide turns and the boot is on the other foot.<br><br>I presonally do not really mind Arsenal rising up cos for one thing, they help to balance the power in the EPL and wipe the smile off Man U faces especially from that on Fergies face. Moreover from my personal experience and observation, Arsenal fans are not so cocky and arrogant.<br><br>At the same time I do wish to urge caution in writing Man U off prematurely, Arsenal have not won the title yet and Man U are not completely out of the running. Arsenal must still win more EPL titles to confirm their status as the superpower of the EPL.<br><br>Just my $5 worth.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to offence or spark a war with MU fans. Juz my own opinion. MU players are arrogant and they cannot take loses like a gentleman. Recently, they start to play some rough &amp; dirty football too. In Arsenal match, they should have at least 3 yellow card in the first 30mins. The referee is quite bad. I am not against MU or support whatever teams. I juz love to watch football matches or other sports, and this is my own observation. This team is getting bad to worse.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Though it might be the case that it is the so called human nature to so called become cocky and arrogant when in such a fine position like Man U was in the 1990s and early 2000s, there should still be no justification for that kind of behaviour, behaviour which even someone in a good position can do without and eradicate.<br><br>Though I might not be completely correct, the Liverpool fans might not be saints or saintly but from my observation they are generally not as bad as the Man U fans.<br><br>And in case one thinks that success and modesty cannot go together and that is is just human nature to be arrogant and complacent when in a good situation, one only has to see one of Liverpool's greatest ever managers to know that a successful person can be modest and humble. That person is Bob Paisley. In some areas he was even more successful than Ferguson (in terms of European Champions Cups won and also in terms of trophies per season ratio) but I must be unaware of something if anyone labels him arrogant.<br><br>One can see that he is one of the best if not the best examples of someone who can be succesful but modest. Another thing is that he was also seldom if ever complacent. According to what I read about him, after winning the title he would tell his team that last season was history and next season is all that matters and urge his team to focus on the season ahead.<br><br>In fact Shankly himself was not an arrogant fella either. Shankly was outspoken and more outspoken than Paisley (who was somewhat of a quiet character actually) but didnt behave in a way that can be deemed as cocky (as far as I know and as far as I have read and researched).<br><br>Having written this it might be good that Liverpool hired Rafa instead of Mourinho (who was rumoured to have been approached to lead Anfield) as it continues the tradition of "modest" Liverpool managers.<br><br>And on a personal note, I have very seldom if ever jeered the fans of other EPl teams even when my supported team does well or beats them. There is a difference between celebrating and enjoying a victory and being cocky and spiteful to other teams and their fans. One can definitely achieve the former without the latter.  Cos my motto is to be gracious whether in victory or defeat.<br><br>And about being anti Man U, perhaps if one personally experienced the kind of brickbats that the Man U fans throw at others one will understand and comprehend why this kind of mentality is taking place.<br><br>And since the above mentioned thread that came from a neutral party did state that Man U seems to be arrogant, there has to be some truth in it isnt it?<br></div>

I don't deny the fact that some of the antics he got up to over the years r unbecoming n did blow up in his face. But so did Wenger with his proclaim of Arsenal going undefeated a few season back n his myopic view when it concerned his own players' behavior n disciplinary records.<br><br>But it seems every time some articles concerning the Devils come out. The ABUs will jump onto the bandwagon n so do most of the Reds fan here. Perhaps before u comdemn Man U fans or their club regarding their arrogant behaviour or quotes, u shld check ur own behaviour to see whether they r becoming of a gentleman.</div>

As a football fan, wld u call tat game a great footballing game which under normal circumstances, both teams are more than capable of showing?!<br><br>It's more like a great shame!
