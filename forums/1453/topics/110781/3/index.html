BUT we let a 10 men Man U won!<br><br>Benitez took a gamble to start with Morientes and Pellegrino and lost evey penny. Why not start with Pongolle then sub Morientes? Morientes ask to be taken off cos he is NOT fit which is a fact as he truely lack of match fitness. He is here to stay, he got tons of chances to play. Baros has also just return so it's a good having 2 new strikers. Why not play a 4-5-1?<br><br>Next DUDEK!! is he the legitimate son of Fregie or what!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> EVRY TIME we play Man U, he give free goals..... look at the goal from Rooney, I just can't help thinking why a top class keeper gets down so slowly. Who pay his salary I begin to wonder.<br><br>Luis Garcia... (shakes head... ) a total disgrace to the number 10 jersey. If Baros played with his head down. Garcia played with his head in his shorts. Morientes would have a clear shot on goal IF he passed. What he did? takes a shot with 2 defenders in his face. What the hell is he thinking? he can penetrate players with his shots? He really needs to bring his brain to the field. Good cross from Nunez, with the smallest angle in the world and the keeper covering the angle he choose to shot into the side netting (I'm not surprise that it went into the side netting cos thats where its going to go) when he has the option of Baros in the middle and Biscan arriving.<br><br>Benitez STOP relying on too many Spanish. Not all are good.<br><br>When Man U down to 10 men, what Reds do? fall back and defence. Even my dad who watched the game with me thought Reds a playing time wasting tactics. When Man U attack with the ball, they fall back into their own half.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> What's this? attacking football? too afraid to attack a 10 men Man U? The players are all over the play... Troare end up on the right at one stage.<br><br>all I can say is, it a total diappointment watching Liverpool last night.</div>
