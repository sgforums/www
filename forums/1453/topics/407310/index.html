              <p>Crisis club Liverpool told prospective buyers on Thursday night to
              put their money on the table as the battle for control of Anfield
              intensified.</p>
              <p>After a remarkable week that has seen suitors circling the
              debt-laden club, Liverpool made it clear it was time for the posturing
              to end and for formal bids to be lodged.</p>
              <p>Far East businessman Kenny Huang remains the front-runner to take
              control, but suggestions that his bid was funded by the Chinese
              Government were denied on Thursday, just as the club prepared for the
              game which saw them comfortably cruise into the next round of the
              Europa League.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Boardroom battle: Questions remain over 
              Yahya Kirdi (left) ability to see through a purchase, while Kenny Huang 
              (right) is the front-runner in the fight for
              Liverpool</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Huang, head of sports marketing company QSL Limited, has made
              contact with Liverpool’s negotiating team, as well as the club’s
              bankers RBS, but reports he was a front man for China’s overseas
              investment arm, China Investment Corporation (CIC), met with a
              mystified response in his homeland.</p>
              <p>Huang, who is determined to drive through a deal that would see him
              pay off the club’s substantial debt, has boasted that his consortium
              will allow manager Roy Hodgson time to bed in and provide a substantial
              war chest to attract top players to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Huang’s emergence on the scene has also been credited with a
              significant role in persuading both Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres
              to stay.</p>
              <p>Doubts over his funding have cast a cloud over those promises, but
              did nothing to quell that debate over whether an arm of the Chinese
              Government should be allowed to invest in Liverpool.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Of the other names claiming to be close to a deal to wrestle the
              club from the grip of American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett,
              Sportsmail understands the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and American
              investment company The Rhone Group have both been ruled out, after
              struggling to raise the necessary funds.</p>
              <p>Canada-based Syrian tycoon Yahya Kirdi continues to push his claims,
              though there is still a degree of scepticism over the way he has
              evidently negotiated directly with Hicks and Gillett, rather than the
              pair’s representatives.</p>
              <p>In a significant development, it was confirmed that the Americans no
              longer have the final say over which bid should be selected to launch a
              new Anfield era.</p>
              <p>When RBS reluctantly sanctioned a refinancing deal with Liverpool’s
              deeply unpopular owners in March, it was on two conditions. They had to
              put their joint 100 per cent holding on the market and agree that any
              decision on new owners would be taken by the board overall, rather than
              themselves.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>At least on pitch matters are sorted: David Ngog
               and Steven Gerrard got the goals on a comfortable night for Liverpool 
              against Macedonian minnows</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Commercial director Ian Ayre, chief executive Christian Purslow and
              chairman Martin Broughton make up a five-man board with Hicks and
              Gillett and will have an equal share of power when it comes to
              determining who should take over.</p>
              <p>As reported in Sportsmail earlier this week, Huang is convinced he
              would sail through the Premier League’s new directors and owners test,
              given his substantial financial backing, business record as the first
              graduate from mainland China to work on the New York Stock Exchange and
              sporting background as a prominent figure in Chinese basketball and
              baseball circles.</p>
              <p>Once a formal offer has been made, the bidder would have to meet
              Premier League bosses and convince them that they have the funds in
              place to complete a purchase and have a sustainable business plan.</p>
              <p>However, with human rights groups sure to be uneasy about China
              effectively owning the club, it would fall to the British Government to
              adjudicate as such a decision would fall outside the Premier League’s
              remit.</p>

              <p>News that the race to unseat Hicks and Gillett was hotting up came
              at the end of a day shrouded in uncertainty over the Chinese
              businessman.</p>
              <p>The Financial Times website quoted a spokesman for CIC as saying
              they had never heard of Huang, adding that there was ‘no way’ the fund
              would get involved in such a high-profile, symbolic and potentially
              risky deal. The website also cast doubt on the global reach of Huang’s
              company.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0930F8FC000005DC-862_306x423.jpg" alt="Staying: Fernando Torres has committed his future to the club despite the continued uncertainty" width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p>There were mixed feelings among fans who flocked to Anfield last
              night for the match against Rabotnicki, with some supporters expressing
              profound reservations that their club could be taken over by an arm of
              a government with a questionable human rights record.</p>
              <p>Steve Naylor, from the Wirral, said: ‘I think it’s wrong that anyone
              from China can come in and buy this great club of ours. This club
              belongs to the people of Liverpool, not someone coming in with money
              from China.</p>
              <p>'It saddens me greatly to see what is going on. First the Americans
              mess us up and now the only people that can save us are the Chinese?
              It’s fans that should be running this club.’</p>
              <p>However, many were more pragmatic, with one, Jay Williams, saying:
              ‘I’d take anyone’s money at the moment to get out Hicks and Gillett.
              This guy supposedly has the backing of China so he’ll have some funds.
              That’s what we need right now, cold cash to get us up and running
              again.’</p>
              <p>With the Premier League requiring 10 days’ notice before conducting
              a rigorous investigation into any would-be new owner’s background, any
              deal is unlikely to be completed before the start of the new season.</p>
              <p>However, the optimists at Anfield believe any deal could well go
              through in time for Hodgson to make use of his likely transfer windfall
              before the window shuts at the end of the month.</p>
              <p>Any speedy deal could, however, require more transparency from Huang about his backers.</p>

              <h1>What's the vibe on Red Revolution?<br></h1>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0498092F000005DC-64_87x84.jpg" alt="Angus Fraser" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <h2>Angus Fraser (former England cricketer)</h2>
              <p>I’m a bit 
              nonplussed. It seems football is moving further and further away from 
              the people. I obviously want Liverpool to do well and we are all very 
              keen to see some stability after what has happened in the last few years
               but you do wonder where all this is going to end. Sometimes it seems as
               if the club are a franchise being traded around and that’s not 
              something I’m comfortable with.</p>
              <h2>Paul Tomkins (Author of Dynasty: 50 Years of Shankly’s Liverpool)</h2>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0AB359D5000005DC-467_87x84.jpg" alt="Paul Tomkin" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <p>I’ve had contact with hundreds of Liverpool fans on the issue. 
              Opinion seems split between concern over an association with a country 
              that has human rights issues, and excitement over the large amounts of 
              money they might bestow. Being owned by the Chinese Government’s 
              investment arm would present great commercial potential but political 
              issues.</p>
              <h2>Andy Burnham (former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and an Everton fan)</h2>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0AA33E8D000005DC-355_87x84.jpg" alt="Andy Burnham" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <p>The nature of the link between the companies and the Chinese 
              Government raises questions. The exact nature of the link would need to 
              be fully examined. The English game surely wants to avoid situations 
              like we’ve seen at Liverpool, Manchester United and Portsmouth. Lessons 
              have to be learned.</p>
              <h2>Ian Broudie (Lightning Seeds front man)</h2>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0774620F000005DC-532_87x84.jpg" alt="Ian Broudie" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <p>The Premier League is open to all sorts of investors and you 
              could question every one of them. Russian oligarchs, Middle Eastern 
              families who control entire countries. As for my club, you feel any sale
               away from the two American clowns is a step in the right direction. It 
              may prove not to be, but I’m very pro the move.</p>
              <h2>Pete Reilly (The View lead guitarist)</h2>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0AB35984000005DC-181_87x84.jpg" alt="Pete Reilly" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <p>I don’t care where the money comes from, to be fair, as long as
               they keep Roy Hodgson, give him some money before the deadline and get 
              us back to where we belong. That may sound harsh but football is far 
              from lily-white so bring it on. It all looks positive to me.</p>
              <h2>Dave Kirby (Playwright and Liverpool fanatic)</h2>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-0AB35928000005DC-243_87x84.jpg" alt="Dave Kirby" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <p>The feeling is anyone will do as long as we get away from the 
              Americans. Before former chairman David Moores and his chief executive, 
              Rick Parry, sold us down the river, we could be choosy about who owned 
              us. Not any more. Personally, the ethics would concern me but no-one 
              cares.</p>
              <h2>Craig Phillips (Big Brother 1 winner)</h2>
              <div class="eightySevenRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300740-003440E700000258-973_87x84.jpg" alt="Big Brother winner Craig Phillips" width="87" height="84"></div>
              <p>I’ve been a fan all my life and I go along with the consensus 
              that this is a great move. I remember, three years ago, the fans were 
              behind the Americans and that theirs was better than the offer from the 
              Middle East. But Hicks and Gillett have put us in the red and such is 
              the ill feeling toward them that we’d welcome any sort of takeover. 
              Anyway, we have a huge and old Chinese population in the city. They’ll 
              be happy.</p>
