              <h1>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez ready to risk wrath of Everton with move
               for Steven Pienaar</h1>

              <p>Liverpool are ready to risk the wrath of neighbours Everton with a 
              move for influential midfielder Steven Pienaar.</p>
              <p>The skilful South
               African has emerged as one of the best players in the Premier League 
              but his contract runs out in 14 months and Everton are yet to tie him 
              down to a new deal.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/20/article-1267611-092CFAB0000005DC-829_468x286.jpg" alt="Steven Pienaar" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Key figure: Steven Pienaar has emerged as one of
               the best players in the Premier League</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Sportsmail revealed in January that Tottenham and Chelsea were 
              interested in the 28-year-old, valued at about £10million.</p>
              <p>Now 
              Liverpool have emerged as strong admirers, despite Everton's reluctance 
              to sell to their fiercest rivals. The Anfield club have been encouraged 
              by news of the unresolved contract talks, although Everton are preparing
               a new offer that would put Pienaar on a par with their top earners at 
              about £50,000 per week.</p>
              <p>Pienaar's agent Ivan Modia said: 'At the 
              moment we are looking at 
              every situation and it will be sorted one way or another before the 
              World Cup.</p>
              <p>'We have had some interest expressed from clubs in Europe but we 
              haven't talked to them because everything must go through Everton 
              because he is under contract.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/20/article-1267611-092D664C000005DC-26_468x505.jpg" alt="Steven Pienaar" width="468" height="505">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Interesting: Steven Pienaar has also caught the 
              eye of Tottenham and Chelsea</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'It is possible (Pienaar could 
              leave) but it is also possible he will stay at the club. I am not saying
               he is leaving the club because that is not true.</p>
              <p>'We are in talks
               but I think it would be disrespectful to Everton [to elaborate] because
               we have a good relationship with the club. Negotiations have been 
              ongoing since the start of the year but it has not been an intense 
              process.</p>
              <p>'We are talking and are patient. We are waiting to 
              see what is going to happen behind closed doors. What I think is there 
              are two different options. One is to get a new contract but if he did 
              not he would be looking for a solution. He goes to the World Cup this 
              summer and that would be a good way for Everton to make money from it.'</p>
              <p>Everton manager David Moyes warned: 'Pienaar is at a club that really 
              suits him and sometimes a player has to decide what is best for him. 
              Everton has been good for Steven. If anybody wanted to leave, they'd be 
              poorer for it.'</p>
