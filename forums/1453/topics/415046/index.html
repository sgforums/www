              <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Defender banned for Wigan</h2>
              Wigan will be without suspended defender Steven Gohouri for the visit of Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League.
              <p>Gohouri came back in to the Latics side at Blackburn on Saturday after a period out with a calf strain, but picked up his fifth booking of the season and is banned for one match.</p>
              <p>Emmerson Boyce is a week away from being fit and available as he continues his recovery from a hamstring injury, while James McCarthy (ankle) is not expected to be back in action until January at the earliest.</p>
              <p>Boss Roberto Martinez believes his side could be coming up against Liverpool at the worst possible time.</p>
              <p>The Merseysiders travel to the DW Stadium in good form having won their last three Barclays Premier League games, including an impressive 2-0 triumph over champions Chelsea on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson's side made a poor start to the season but have since hoisted themselves out of the relegation zone and Martinez feels if the Latics are to halt the Reds' momentum, they will need luck to be on their side - something that seemed to desert them in their 2-1 defeat at Blackburn on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"It is probably the worst moment to play them,'' Martinez said. "Looking at the Liverpool side now, they play with huge energy and confidence - they were a joy to watch against Chelsea and you can start to see Roy Hodgson's hand on that side.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes in football you need to be lucky and have a little bit of luck when you play the top sides, it is really important.</p>
              <p>"I think we need to carry on with what we are good at, be stubborn, show good arrogance on the ball and make sure that we show we are playing at home.''</p>
              <p>Defender Glen Johnson is set to return to Liverpool's squad for the short trip.</p>
              <p>The right-back missed Sunday's win over Chelsea with a minor groin problem but has trained and manager Roy Hodgson will have to decide whether to replace youngster Martin Kelly, who impressed against Carlo Ancelotti's side.</p>
              <p>Central defender Sotirios Krygiakos is absent with tonsilitis and Joe Cole is still sidelined by a hamstring injury but Fabio Aurelio is fit after a long lay-off, while Ryan Babel has recovered from bruised ribs but will be eased back in by Hodgson.</p>

              <div class="gp-body" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
              <h2>Rodallega earns point for Latics</h2>
              Liverpool's four-match winning run was halted by a lively Wigan at the DW Stadium as Roy Hodgson's side faded badly after taking an early lead.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite being given an early advantage by Fernando Torres' third goal in four days, the visitors lost their grip on the game midway through the first half and never regained it.</p>
              <p>Wigan equalised through Hugo Rodallega in the 52nd minute and finished the better side as the Merseysiders appeared to feel the exertions of beating Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday.</p>
              <p>That will be a concern to manager Hodgson, who has complained about the depth of quality in his squad, with a trip to Stoke next up on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The draw meant Liverpool missed the chance to move into the top five - a scenario which seemed a distant prospect just a few weeks ago with the Reds mired in the relegation zone until they put together three league wins to add to a victory in Europe.</p>
              <p>It must also have annoyed Hodgson because, as they did against Chelsea, his side began strongly with Sunday's man of the match Lucas Leiva unleashing a 25-yard strike which Ali Al Habsi just managed to tip over.</p>
              <p>The next time the visitors attacked the goalkeeper was given no chance by a clinical Torres.</p>
              <p>An unusual statistic for this season is that all Liverpool's league goals, apart from their opening match against Arsenal, have either been scored or provided by Steven Gerrard and Torres.</p>
              <p>The Reds' star duo demonstrated why their partnership is so successful in the seventh minute when Gerrard was given far too much time to carry the ball through midfield.</p>
              <p>His perfectly-weighted 30-yard pass allowed Torres to outpace Gary Caldwell and fire across Al Habsi into the far corner of the goal.</p>
              <p>It was the 26-year-old's first away goal since March 21 and, considering his prolific record, only the 17th in 41 matches outside Anfield.</p>
              <p>The simplicity of that strike was contrasted by their next move, which saw Gerrard, Torres and Dirk Kuyt combine before the captain volleyed over from the Dutchman's header.</p>
              <p>Torres was looking at his dangerous best and when Antolin Alcaraz stumbled he was clean through only for referee Peter Walton to pull play back for a non-existent foul.</p>
              <p>Charles N'Zogbia looked Wigan's best outlet and he thought he had equalised in the 33rd minute when he seized on Lucas' weak pass and played a one-two with Rodallega to tap home but his team-mate had already been flagged offside.</p>
              <p>A Ronnie Stam pass intended for Rodallega at the near post rolled agonisingly wide of the far upright as Wigan finished the half on the up.</p>
              <p>Raul Meireles was replaced by Jonjo Shelvey for the start of the second half and the teenager's first contribution was to give the ball away to Rodallega but his forward pass to N'Zogbia was too strong.</p>
              <p>The Colombian was not so wasteful moments later when Jose Reina could only palm Stam's low cross into his path and he gratefully fired home left-footed.</p>
              <p>Wigan sensed their chance as Liverpool's play became increasingly ragged and Martinez sent on young forward Victor Moses for Jordi Gomez.</p>
              <p>Kuyt's strike from Shelvey's deflected shot was half-saved by Al Habsi before it crossed the line but the Holland international had come back from an offside position and it was ruled out.</p>
              <p>It was a brief rally as Stam again found room down the right to cross and Martin Kelly had to hack away at the far post under pressure from Tom Cleverley.</p>
              <p>Gerrard's shot 10 minutes from time crashed down off the crossbar but not over the line with Al Habsi beaten as the game became end-to-end.</p>
              <p>But it was Liverpool who were grateful for the final whistle as Mohamed Diame and N'Zogbia both forced low saves out of Reina.</p>
              <p>The result may prove to only be a blip in Liverpool's recovery but Hodgson cannot allow his side to lose any momentum having built up so much confidence over the last three weeks.</p>
              <p>Wigan may ultimately have been disappointed with a point, having won the corresponding fixture last season and finished so strongly, but it at least avoided a third successive league defeat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <li id="quotes"><strong>Hodgson: We didn't deserve to win</strong>
              <p> </p>
              Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson does not think Liverpool did enough to win their match against Wigan, claiming his players looked lethargic.
              <p> </p>
              "We didn't deserve to win the game. I thought we looked tired today, our passing was not anywhere near where we expect it to be," said Hodgson.
              <p> </p>
              "We had a bright start and bright finish but I think we can be more than happy with a point. The goal was a wonderful piece of play from two outstanding players, a marvellous pass and a wonderful finish which put us on the front foot.
              <p> </p>
              "But we didn't capitalise on that. We had a spell where we were pretty much in control but from the start of the second half we invited Wigan on to us all the time by consistently giving the ball away.
              <p> </p>
              "As a result they took advantage and scored an equalising goal. We did a little better towards the end and we were unlucky with Steven's shot which hit the underside of the crossbar.
              <p> </p>
              "But it would have been harsh on Wigan had we won it and they can probably feel the 1-1 result flatters us more than them.''
              <p> </p>
              The former-Fulham manager named the same team which beat Chelsea so impressively on Sunday, although Raul Meireles was forced off due to sicknesss.
              <p> </p>
              "We have got five injuries at the moment, that is what we have and are using. Meireles was sick. I don't know how long it will take him to recover but he was complaining of it just before the game.
              <p> </p>
              "He wanted to play and took some tablets and that got him through the first half but there was no option but to bring him off. Hopefully we will get some players back soon and that will help us.
              <p> </p>
              "Now we have to work hard to get people back in the right physical and mental frame of mind. We always knew this was going to be a tough test, they are not a bad team at all.''
              <p> </p>
              Roberto Martinez was delighted with Wigan's performance, and said his players were disappointed not to come away with all three points.
              <p> </p>
              "The first 15 minutes we were not in the game at all and we got heavily punished as you would expect against world-class players,'' he said.
              <p> </p>
              "But after that I was extremely pleased with the way we controlled the game, imposed ourselves and created chances.
              <p> </p>
              "You feel when you do that against Liverpool you expect to get the reward of three points. I am extremely proud of the players. It would have been very easy to feel sorry about themselves and allow Liverpool to win the game.
              <p> </p>
              "They are really disappointed and frustrated in the dressing room and that fills me with pride and it shows you the characters we have at this club."</li>
