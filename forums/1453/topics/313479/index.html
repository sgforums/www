              The Reds secured a second 1-1 draw at Arsenal in the space of four days, which severely dented the Gunners' Premier League title hopes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              Despite so many changes by both teams with perhaps one eye on Tuesday's second leg of their European tie at Anfield - Benitez made eight - there was in the end little to choose between either side.
              <p> </p>
              Substitute Andriy Voronin had a superb chance to win the match for the visitors with a late volley, while at the other end Arsenal pressed continually during the closing stages.
              <p> </p>
              The Reds boss is all too aware at this level that games can turn on a single incident - maybe such as when a moment of brilliance from captain Steven Gerrard set up what could yet prove to be a crucial away goal in last Wednesday night's first leg of their European tie.
              <p> </p>
              'You know always that the small things can be the difference,' said the Spanish coach.
              <p> </p>
              'When you play against the top sides, you know a player can change the game, or there can be a mistake in a free-kick, in a one-versus-one situation.
              <p> </p>
              'At the end, the difference between the draws and the wins, or if you lose are the smaller things and the influence of the top-class players.'
              <p> </p>
              Should the two sides draw 1-1 again on Tuesday night and remain unable to be separated after extra-time, then the right to play either Chelsea or Fenerbahce in the semi-finals of Europe's elite club competition would be decided on spot-kicks.
              <p> </p>
              While the Liverpool manager - whose men knocked Chelsea out on penalties to reach the final last season - insists the shoot-out is a 'lottery', Benitez feels it comes down as much to keeping a cool head under pressure as it does natural talent.
              <p> </p>
              'I believe sometimes it is more the heart than the quality of the players,' said the Liverpool manager. 'We will have some good players taking penalties, so I do not think we will practise too much.
              <p> </p>
              'You know which players will be good when they are called from the halfway line. It is not just quality. It is important to be calm and to know what to do.
              <p> </p>
              'When you talk about top-class players, with quality and experience in these situations. Sometimes they can be really good at 18, sometimes at 31 a player is not cool on penalties, so it depends on each one.
              <p> </p>
              'I will not be thinking about penalties. We will be trying to use our experience during the game and not go to penalties.'
              <p> </p>
              Benitez added: 'If we need to go to penalties, then they have quality and we have quality too. The penalties are really a lottery.'
              <p> </p>
              Benitez handed French youngster Damien Plessis his debut at the Emirates Stadium yesterday, and left leading scorer Fernando Torres on the bench along with Gerrard.
              <p> </p>
              Recalled England striker Peter Crouch did not disappoint, as the giant frontman proved a real handful before eventually opening the scoring with a well-worked goal three minutes before the break.
              <p> </p>
              Ironically, though, it was the beanpole striker who was then caught the wrong side of Nicklas Bendtner when he equalised for Arsenal in the second half.
              <p> </p>
              Nevertheless, it was still a fine performance by the 27-year-old. Liverpool have offered Crouch a new deal, but as yet have had no response.
              <p> </p>
              'Peter Crouch is a very good professional. That is the reason why we offered him a new contract,' Benitez said. 'I have confidence he will sign. I know the player wants to.'
              <p> </p>
              The Liverpool manager observed: 'At the moment, we are playing with only one striker, but we can play with two. It is not a problem.
              <p> </p>
              'If you are in a team which wins trophies you know you can be an important part of that squad. I know Peter is happy here and that he wants to play. But that is football.
              <p> </p>
              'We have offered the contract and we need to wait.'

              The Liverpool boss engineered a 1-1 Barclays Premier League draw with the Gunners at the Emirates on Saturday that all but finished the north Londoners' title challenge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              Being out of the title race is a situation Benitez and Liverpool have accepted weeks ago, but the Spaniard now believes that Arsenal and manager Arsene Wenger are in the same boat.
              <p> </p>
              That makes tomorrow's Champions League quarter-final second leg a winner-takes-all showdown for the two English giants.
              <p> </p>
              And the outcome of the tie will dictate the success of failure of both clubs and their managers this season.
              <p> </p>
              Benitez, with a priceless away goal from last week's engrossing 1-1 draw in the first leg, said: 'If they want to win a trophy then it must be this game because it will be very difficult to win the Premier League.
              <p> </p>
              'Before the game on Saturday they knew they had to win to stay in the title race.
              <p> </p>
              'He (Wenger) changed five players, but had to bring back his big players trying to win the game.
              <p> </p>
              'Maybe afterwards he felt that the race for the title is over. But then United drew at Middlesbrough, so he will maybe think that their chance has returned.
              <p> </p>
              'But I still believe this game at Anfield will be the most important match they have if they want to win a trophy.'
              <p> </p>
              Benitez added: 'We are confident. We have been playing well in recent games and have been getting the results. The performances have been good. That is what we have been looking for at this stage of the season.
              <p> </p>
              'But we are not favourites, not with the the quality players they have. But this will be different from the first leg, because playing at Anfield is a massive difference.
              <p> </p>
              'And they need to win. It could well be an attacking game. It is important for the club and for me to progress. We have been working hard to get to this point all season, so it is important for all of us.
              <p> </p>
              'Maybe they cannot win the title now, but with Manchester United drawing on Sunday there is still a slight chance. But I do not expect Arsenal to be thinking about the title now, just the Champions League.
              <p> </p>
              'The Champions League is massive for them, that is what they will be thinking about.
              <p> </p>
              'But we are in good form, our players are doing well and we have fresh legs.
              <p> </p>
              'And for us, we need to score. Arsenal can always score away so we cannot think of a 0-0.'
              <p> </p>
              But although Benitez believes Arsenal are experienced despite the suggestions that they have too many youngsters, he predicts that they could suffer just as Chelsea did in the famous 2005 semi-final at Anfield.
              <p> </p>
              He said: 'You could feel the atmosphere against Chelsea in the semi-final, and I expect that to be the same this time. Our fans can also hold the key.
              <p> </p>
              'I saw Chelsea affected by the Kop, it was clear. Hopefully it will be the same again.
              <p> </p>
              'It is easy to say that you (Arsenal) do not have any problems with big crowds in away games of this importance. But when you have to face our fans for 90 minutes on top of you, then it is not easy for the majority of players.
              <p> </p>
              'They have been here before. But the difference is the Champions League, it's knock-out now and that is the difference.
              <p> </p>
              'This is our only option if we want to win anything. It is important for us, we need heart but also brain.'
              <p> </p>
              Benitez will only be missing winger Jermaine Pennant from his squad as the former Arsenal man picked up a hamstring injury at the Emirates on Saturday.
              <p> </p>
              Daniel Agger and Harry Kewell are long-term absentees, and Benitez will recall all the big guns rested at the weekend.
              <p> </p>
              Javier Mascherano, suspended for the league game at Arsenal, will definitely return.

              Former Arsenal winger Jermaine Pennant will miss Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final second leg against the Gunners at Anfield on Tuesday.
              <p>Pennant sustained a hamstring injury in Saturday's 1-1 Barclays Premier League draw at the Emirates and is out of the tie, also delicately balanced at 1-1 after last week's first leg in north London.</p>
              <p>Daniel Agger and Harry Kewell are both still long-term injury absentees but otherwise manager Rafael Benitez has a full complement to chose from and will bring back the host of senior players rested for Saturday's match.</p>
              <p>Javier Mascherano, suspended for the league clash, is certain to play.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, boss Rafael Benitez has insisted the Champions League is Arsenal's only chance of winning a trophy this season.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool boss engineered a 1-1 Barclays Premier League draw with the Gunners at the Emirates on Saturday that all but finished the north Londoners' title challenge.</p>
              <p>Being out of the title race is a situation Benitez and Liverpool have accepted weeks ago, but the Spaniard now believes that Arsenal and manager Arsene Wenger are in the same boat.</p>
              <p>That makes Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg a winner-takes-all showdown for the two English giants.</p>
              <p>And the outcome of the tie will dictate the success of failure of both clubs and their managers this season.</p>
              <p>Benitez, with a priceless away goal from last week's engrossing 1-1 draw in the first leg, said: "If they want to win a trophy then it must be this game because it will be very difficult to win the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"Before the game on Saturday they knew they had to win to stay in the title race.</p>

              <p>"But I still believe this game at Anfield will be the most important match they have if they want to win a trophy.''</p>
              <p>Robin van Persie is back in contention for Arsenal ahead of the Champions League quarter-final second leg.</p>
              <p>The Holland striker had been struggling with a thigh muscle problem and missed the 1-1 Barclays Premier League draw against the Reds at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday but has been included in the 18-man squad which travelled to Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Gunners manager Arsene Wenger rested several players at the weekend, and is likely to recall leading scorer Emmanuel Adebayor, Alexander Hleb, Gael Clichy and Philippe Senderos to the starting line-up.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Abou Diaby is available as his suspension is only domestic, but full-back Bacary Sagna (ankle) and Tomas Rosicky (hamstring) remain sidelined, while luckless striker Eduardo is out for the season with a broken leg.</p>
              <p>Defiant Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has declared his team's season remains very much alive on both fronts as they head into the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Wenger accepts the Gunners have been through a "dip'' with just two wins from their last 11 games, which has seen them overtaken at the top of the Barclays Premier League by both Chelsea and Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Liverpool would seem to have the upper hand in their European tie, having drawn the first leg 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium to bag themselves a crucial away goal.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were again unable to get the better of the Reds for the second time in a week during their league encounter on Saturday.</p>
              <p>However, as leaders United failed to beat Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on Sunday, Wenger is in no doubt his men still have every chance of wresting the title away from Sir Alex Ferguson's side, whom they face at Old Trafford this weekend.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager insisted: "I still believe we will finish champions in the Premier League. The result (at Middlesbrough) helped a lot.</p>
              <p>"If they had won, I would have thought we could not (win the league) but, now, I still believe we'll do it.''</p>
              <p>Wenger continued: "We did have a dip recently, it's true. We can't deny that. But football is strange sometimes.</p>
              <p>"It is possible we can win the last five games. Of course, I said that before the Liverpool game as well, but I said five games and one draw would make it.</p>
              <p>"It is compulsory that we win at Old Trafford if we want to win the championship.''</p>

              <p>Liverpool comes into this match as favourite.</p>
              <p>Unless stevie comes to super form, Liverpool would have a hard time to contain a hungry and desperate arsenal.</p>
              <p>The more hungry team will win.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have not win the CL medal before.</p>
              <p>They stand a higher chance of winning through strong desire.</p>
              <p>I will try to watch it as this may be the LAST champion league match for Liverpool at Anfield as I will not be mio-ing next year for CL soccer.</p>
