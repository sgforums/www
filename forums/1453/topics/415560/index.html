              <p>Liverpool's medical staff have reacted with anger at news that Steven Gerrard could miss the Premier League clash with West Ham, criticising England for playing the midfielder for as long as they did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/1117/stevengerrardwalksoffvfra20101117_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Steven Gerrard trudges off with physio Gary Lewin" width="275" height="155"> </div>
              <p>Gerrard limped off after 85 minutes of England's 2-1 defeat to France at Wembley, to be replaced by goalscorer Peter Crouch, after injuring his hamstring in a challenge with France midfielder Yoann Gourcuff.</p>
              <p>Almost immediately, two members of Liverpool's backroom staff used <em>Twitter</em> to vent their frustration in the latest bout of club vs. country arguments, hinting that the club were given assurances that their skipper would not play a full part in the friendly match.</p>
              <p>Darren Burgess, Liverpool's head of fitness and conditioning, said: "Unbelievable from all associated with England and English FA with regard to SGs (Gerrard's) injury. Completely ignored agreement and past history. Completely amateurish and now we pay for their incompetence. Absolutely disgraceful."</p>
              <p>Liverpool physio Chris Morgan also commented: "Stevie getting injured ... more evidence if it was needed of why I hate internationals."</p>
              <p>Fabio Capello, however, insisted he played Gerrard for longer than the hour because Gareth Barry had an ankle problem and Rio Ferdinand had picked up a muscle problem.</p>
              <p>Capello said: ''We spoke with Steve and he said he would play one hour, but after Barry's injury we had some problems. That was the reason he stayed on the pitch. If it's possible, the players will play the time we agreed with the club. But Barry was really injured so we needed someone senior on the pitch because it was a really young team. He said he was good. We're upset about what happened to Steve, of course.''</p>
              <p>The England coach did admit Liverpool had requested Gerrard not play more than an hour.</p>
              <p>He said: ''They asked that he can play one hour if it's possible. They can't decide how long a player plays with the national team. If it's possible, he'd have played an hour.</p>
              <p>''I understand why they're upset and I'm also upset. The problem is that, when you play this game on Wednesday after a lot of Premier League, Europa League or Champions League games, it's possible there might be an injury for a player. The Premier League, every time, is a tough league for the players.''</p>
              <p>The news worsened for Liverpool after it was revealed that midfielder Dirk Kuyt aggravated an existing ankle problem while away on international with Holland against Turkey.</p>
