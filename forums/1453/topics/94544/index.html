            <div class='col-md body'>3-0 baby... yeah~ and josemi was rested...<br><br>i think bentiez has been rotating the players well enough, because i get to hear things like this or that player has been rested and still we're still winning games.<br><br>maybe its early to say but at least we started better than last season! the game against man utd and bolton, just a dud. maybe more duds to go but this is benitez's first season, let him test water first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What a good victory we had, we bounced back well .  Alfonso and Gracia are excellent signings as they have showed us so far . With Nunez and Gerrard coming back soon,  our future is very bright.</div>
