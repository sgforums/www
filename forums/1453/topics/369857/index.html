              <p><br>Liverpool recorded their first victory of the pre-season campaign with an emphatic 5-0 win over Singapore on Sunday afternoon.<br><br>Andriy Voronin put the Reds into the lead on the stroke of half-time with a deflected shot from distance before Albert Riera increased the visitors' advantage courtesy of a close-range volley shortly after the restart.<br> <br>Krisztian Nemeth helped himself to a late brace, with a Fernando Torres goal sandwiched in between as Liverpool went goal crazy in the Far East to claim the Lion Cup.<br> <br>A pre-match rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone rang out inside the Singapore National Stadium before the game got underway, with the away side sporting their stylish new black away strip.<br> <br>Rafa Benitez took the chance to partner young centre-back Mikel San Jose with Jamie Carragher and handed Daniel Agger a role at left-back.<br> <br>After a tentative opening, Ryan Babel had the first opportunity of the game when he nodded David Ngog's cross goalwards, but Singapore goalkeeper Hassan Sunny was able to make a comfortable save.<br> <br>Noh Alam Shah saw a low strike blocked by Diego Cavalieri on a rare sortie forward from the home side, though Ngog was inches away from breaking the deadlock at the other end when he sent a looping header narrowly wide of the far post from Andriy Voronin's centre.<br> <br>The young French striker was looking lively and he was unfortunate to see a shot on the turn deflected over the bar by Baihakki Khaizan on the half hour mark, after some excellent link-up play involving Yossi Benayoun.<br> <br>For all their possession, the Reds were struggling to break down a stubborn Lions rearguard.<br> <br>However, the visitors finally opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time when Voronin's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Daniel Bennett to beat Sunny and put Liverpool into a well deserved lead heading into the break.<br> <br>Benitez made three changes during the interval, with Peter Gulacsi, Emiliano Insua and Riera replacing Cavalieri, Mikel San Jose and Babel.<br> <br>The Reds started the second period quickly and Benayoun clipped an attempt just over the bar from inside the box prior to Riera doubling Liverpool's advantage.<br> <br>Mascherano's deep cross from the right picked out the Spain winger, who chested the ball down and drilled an unstoppable volley beneath Sunny on 54 minutes.<br> <br>The Reds opted to make wholesale changes on the hour mark, with Torres taking to the field, much to the delight of the local fans who cheered his every touch.<br> <br>It wasn't long before Liverpool furthered their lead. Substitute Dirk Kuyt pounced on a wayward header before crossing for Nemeth, who dispatched a clinical shot into the bottom corner from 12 yards.<br> <br>With just under 15 minutes remaining, Xabi Alonso was handed his first-run out of pre-season after recovering from the ankle injury that had kept him out of the clash with Thailand.<br> <br>Moments later, the visitors made it four and it was the goal the whole stadium had been praying for as Torres got his name on the scoresheet.<br> <br>Kuyt was again the provider, racing into the box from the right and squaring across goal to give the Reds' No.9 the simple task of tapping home from close-range.<br> <br>The Dutch ace made it a hat-trick of assists on 83 minutes when he directed Agger's pass into the path of Nemeth, who headed beyond the Lions' replacement custodian Lionel Lewis to make it 5-0 and put the seal on a fine evening's work for Liverpool.</p>

              <p>I just find it very... I dunno how to put it. Government want Singaporean sports to be pushed to the next level. But they don't even want to pump a single cent into it. How to see SG soccer team qualify for WC2010, can't even hire a proper coach because of funding.</p>
              <p>So much so even locals have turned to foreign sports like BPL, NBA, or even the MLB (Major League Baseball) for 'entertainment and idolism'. No faith in local sports team.</p>
              <p>Maybe SEA games, let alone Olympics, look at our own Olympic stars, if there's any.</p>

              <p>Give some credits to the Singapore players, they played well tonight to hold up the attack from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The reason why we are leaking goal is that Raddy switched from defensive to offensive so it leave holes at the back.</p>
              <p>As for the Liverpool players, they did not play well in thailand cos they have too many tom yam soup and they were in holiday mood.</p>
              <p>They woke up tonight and decided to play well.</p>

              <p>I just find it very... I dunno how to put it. Government want
              Singaporean sports to be pushed to the next level. But they don't
              even want to pump a single cent into it. How to see SG soccer team
              qualify for WC2010, can't even hire a proper coach because of
              funding.</p>
              <p>So much so even locals have turned to foreign sports like BPL,
              NBA, or even the MLB (Major League Baseball) for 'entertainment and
              idolism'. No faith in local sports team.</p>
              <p>Maybe SEA games, let alone Olympics, look at our own Olympic
              stars, if there's any.</p>

              <p>maybe parents also have to shoulder a small part of the blame.. how many of them will let their children play sports as a career?</p>

              <p>Give some credits to the Singapore players, they played well tonight to hold up the attack from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The reason why we are leaking goal is that Raddy switched from defensive to offensive so it leave holes at the back.</p>
