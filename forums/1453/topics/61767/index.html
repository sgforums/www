Owen might just holding up and see if Liverpool has what it takes to win major trophies.<br><br>Tho He had denied to leave, the first article illustrated the potential events might happen if the current squad are not good enuff to win trophies.<br><br>On the commercial end, it'll be disastrous for LFC to lose Owen for free if he still hasn't sign soon. That will be alot worse than when we lost Macca for nothing to RM.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>For the squad, definitely he will be miss since the majority of the goals past Seasons relies heavily on him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow... the way Liverpool plays mirroed to the tactics employed by GH. But credit to him, he has recently adopted a more attacking approach. But the front two's movement and play is still very much left to desire.<br><br>Heskey is deployed machiam like the gd O' days of Centre Fowards... just that he can't score a decent one. I do like to see more of Pongolle in action along with Owen. At least it's not gonna be predictable and these two speedsters do made opp defences edgy.</div>
