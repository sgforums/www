            <div class='col-md body'>02 August 2006 - Souce From KopTalk<br><br>Liverpool are preparing to table a fresh bid for Feyenoord hitman Dirk Kuyt.<br><br>The highly-rated striker has told his current employers that he wants to make the switch to Anfield despite genuine interest from Old Trafford.<br><br>Reds boss Rafael Benitez is confident of landing Kuyt although he doesn't directly mention his name. Naturally his words could apply to anyone but it's no secret that the 26-year-old is Rafa's top target.<br><br>Rafa said: "We're continuing to work. Maybe it's too late for the Champions League qualification round, but there is one month left and thatgives us the time to sign the player we need.<br><br>"I think we still need an extra striker, just in case. I'm happy with the strikers we have but I think we need another and I'm confident we'll sign one."<br><br>Both clubs have so far failed to agree a fee for the player but Liverpool are prepared to up their most recent offer.<br><br>We've tried to get some quotes from the player's agent Rob Jansen but he's chosen not to go on record with anything relating to his client at this time. That could change though so look out for him resurfacing soon.<br><br>Chelsea's recent link with Kuyt appears to be idle speculation which has either been fed out by Stamford Bridge insiders or Feyenoord themselves. If Chelsea were genuinely interest the fee would rise and that would end our interest. Feyenoord could have fed this claim out to try and put pressure on us to meet their asking price.<br><br></div>

"We went a long way to doing that and Dirk was open to that, but we knew that the chance was he would leave if his dream club came in.
