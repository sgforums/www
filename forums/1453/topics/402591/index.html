              <p>Liverpool will resist all attempts to snatch any of their players 
              until they have a new manager in place.</p>
              <p>And that seems certain to 
              happen within the next week, with sources at Fulham confirming last 
              night they have lost all hope of holding on to Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
               dismissed claims of offers for Fernando Torres and Yossi Benayoun last 
              night, by insisting they have not had an approach for any player, and 
              made clear departures would have to be agreed by the incoming boss.</p>
              <p>Spokesmen
               at Anfield have maintained their official position that they will not 
              be rushed into appointing a successor to Rafa Benitez, and will consider
               every possible detail of every viable candidate before making an 
              announcement.</p>
              
              <p>But yesterday, a senior figure at Craven Cottage acknowledged that 
              the London club now has no chance of persuading Hodgson to stay, with a 
              formal approach imminent.</p>
              <p>The Mirror revealed last week that a 
              Liverpool board meeting on Friday has rubber-stamped a move for the 
              experienced manager, and formal contact is expected to follow.</p>
              <p>Fulham
               are aware of that interest, and after talks with their manager before 
              he prepared to fly out to the World Cup, they are now resigned to losing
               him.</p>
              <p>Talks over a contract, security of tenure should there be an
               Anfield takeover, and size of budget will proceed over the next week, 
              and an official announcement could be made by next Wednesday or Thursday
               if agreement is reached.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has spoken to his Fulham board, 
              and conceded that he would find the offer to manage at Liverpool too 
              hard to turn down, despite his affection for the Craven Cottage outfit.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
               are ready to double his contract and also provide massive bonuses for a
               top four finish - which is the minimum requirement this coming season, 
              after Benitez finished in a disastrous seventh place during the previous
               campaign.</p>
              <p>They will also offer a minimum of £12million in cash to
               spend on new players, plus all money raised from sale of players the 
              new boss deems surplus to requirements.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are determined 
              though, not to let any players leave until the new manager is in place, 
              to allow him the chance to decide if he wants to keep them.</p>
              <p>Fernando
               Torres is reported to be the subject of intense interest from Chelsea, 
              with sources from the London club suggesting a £50million bid could 
              follow.</p>
              <p>Yossi Benayoun has also been linked with a £5.5million 
              move to Stamford Bridge, amid suggestions that the player has already 
              agreed a £75,000 a week contract.</p>
              <p>But a spokesman for the Anfield 
              club said last night that no offer had been received from any club for 
              any of its players.</p>
              <p>And officials were adamant that even if 
              Chelsea do bid for Torres it will be turned down flat, with Liverpool 
              determined to keep hold of their prized assets.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has 
              indicated to close friends that the first thing he will do if agrees to 
              take the job on Merseyside will be to persuade Torres and skipper Steven
               Gerrard to stay.</p>
              <p>He may be more accessible though, to allowing 
              Javier Mascherano to leave, particularly if he can get the £40million 
              Inter Milan are rumoured to be ready to offer for the defensive 
              midfielder.</p>
              <p>Hodgson would be confident of finding a replacement 
              for an essentially negative role at that price, with money to spare to 
              make much-needed attacking signings.</p>
