              <p>PSV Eindhoven defender Jan Kromkamp returns
              to Anfield insisting his former club can do the Champions League and
              Premier League double.</p>
              <p>Kromkamp, 28, had a short spell at Liverpool two years ago and
              claimed an FA Cup winners' medal against West Ham as a second-half
              substitute in the Cardiff final.</p>
              <p>And he then made his PSV debut in the Champions League against
              Liverpool in Holland in the 2006-07 season - a 0-0 draw - while also
              playing in the return at Anfield, won 2-0 by the eventual finalists.</p>
              <p>The full-back is certain of Liverpool's general improvement
              since then, and said: "They can copy what Manchester United achieved
              last season in winning both the European Cup and the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"They certainly have the quality. In fact, even when I was here
              I believed they were capable of winning anything they took part in.</p>
              <p>"Having watched them a few times on TV this season, I can see
              their confidence is high and they are certainly able to win both the
              major tournaments."</p>
              <p>Kromkamp will face his old club on Wednesday having just
              returned from a knee injury that has kept him out of action since
              April.</p>
              <p>He continued: "I believe Steven Gerrard is one of the best
              players in the world and Liverpool have strength in every position.
              This is going to be a difficult game for us.</p>
              <p>"They have quality and are very strong. It is hard to find a
              weakness because they have been a big club in Europe for several years
              now.</p>
              <p>"We know they have a strong defence and are difficult to break down. But we will try."</p>
              <p>PSV have left star midfielder Ibrahim Afellay behind in Holland,
              the Manchester City target still out with a toe injury. It was decided
              against giving the 22-year-old a pain-killing injection to allow him to
              play.</p>
              <p>Coach Huub Stevens, the former Schalke boss, is equally as
              impressed by Liverpool and accepts PSV face a severe challenge, having
              already lost their opening Group D match 3-0 at home to Atletico
              Madrid.</p>
              <p>He said: "Keeping a clean sheet is one of the most important things for us on the night.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool are very strong, they can play with two strikers or
              with just one but three attacking from behind. You must respect them as
              they are such a strong team and tactically very good.</p>
              <p>"If it is Fernando Torres and Robbie Keane playing up front
              together we may put 11 defenders on the pitch! But we will have to work
              hard to contain them, whatever system they use.</p>
              <p>"Every game at this stage is very important to us. After losing
              our first match in the group that is obvious, we will be trying to make
              sure that we save our European campaign.</p>
              <p>"We have to learn from the mistakes we made in the 3-0 home defeat by Atletico, we cannot make similar mistakes here.</p>
              <p>"I also agree that Gerrard is one of the best midfield players
              in the world, but Liverpool is not only Gerrard. The name is Liverpool
              FC, not Gerrard FC.</p>
              <p>"We have studied many Liverpool matches, not just the Stoke
              match when they were held at Anfield. We have learned that they make a
              lot of chances and it is up to the players I put out to do to them what
              Stoke did.</p>
              <p>"But we do not lack self-confidence, no fear, we are looking forward to the challenge."</p>
