            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JLennon:</div><div class="quote_body">I have supported Everton since the days of Lineker (who was only there only for a short while). I have also taken pride that in Merseyside, supporters of both EFC and LFC can stand side by side without the ugly animosity that underly many rival city clubs.  One can also appreciate that within a family in Liverpool, loyalties sometimes split between Reds and Blues.<br><br>I have always had utmost respect for LFC for their history, their achievements and their teams.  To that extent, I do not and will not write anything derogatory or insulting about them simply because such remarks are unwarranted.<br><br>It is thus to my dismay that I find some LFC fans in Singapore arrogant and condescending of the achievements of EFC this season (the words 'laughing stock' are familiar but who has the last laugh?).  Credit should be given where credit is due.  Let's face it, the league never lies but its up to the teams to play to their own strengths.<br><br>EFC had a simple strategy from the beginnning, that is to avoid the drop (given the exodus of one 27 mio pounds striker in return for a 0.5 mio pounds striker).  To avoid the drop, EFC made sure they took points from all lesser teams (such as Palace, WBA etc) and if possible, sneak points from the bigger teams (such as Man Utd).  It is a culmination of this strategy and luck (LFC did not take advantage of EFC's lapses in the course of the EPL) that propelled EFC to the exalted position of 4th on the table.<br><br>EFC had to adopt a stringent budget due to its burgeoning debt and its to the credit of Moyes and Bill Kenwright that the books of EFC are slowly in the black.  One of you mentioned that EFC have more cash to play around. Gosh, since when??? LFC have been spending endlessly these few seasons unlike EFC whose biggest buy lately is a 6 mio pound ineffective striker.<br><br>Sometimes the LFC guys don't know how lucky they are to be able to support their team in numerous cup finals these few seasons.  The last cup final that I could get behind EFC was the 1995 FA Cup final where we beat Man Utd 1-0 and that was 10 years ago.  Should EFC qualify for UCL first round, I will definitely get a ticket to Goodison for a live match.  So be it if we get thrashed by Barca or Real but at least we are there.<br><br>I was rooting for LFC to beat Milan in UCL but in the light of all these EFC abuse, I'd rather stay neutral.</div></blockquote>Me a Everton fan too ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Don't believe ?<br><br>Neville Southall<br><br>Kevin Ratcliff<br>Derek Mountfield<br><br>Paul Bracewell<br>Peter Reid<br>Pat Nevin<br>Kevin Sheedy<br><br>Graeme Sharp<br>Gary Linekar<br><br>Adrian Heath<br>Alan Harper<br><br>Let me think about the rest of teh squad , it has been 20 years liao ..... can only think of this squad .<br><br>Not really a Big Fan la , just that admire most Gary Linekar , follow him since Leicester , Barcelona days .<br><br>Honestly , Everton were a great team that time , L'pool were very close behind them , MU sucks that time .
