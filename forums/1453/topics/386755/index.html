              <p>Ah Ben fielded a bunch of spiritless players for the match.</p>

              <p>one question i'm always curious to ask..</p>
              <p>how is rafa always the blame? all he can do is field in a team, give some team talk and motivate the players.but ultimately, it's still the players who have to live up to expection..</p>
              <p>even if we have all the worldclass coach here. what miracle can they do to make a under-performing team like liverpool to win all the matches? this is all that liverpool have alr, we are very limited in good players and there's nothing much we can do this this bunch of players until rafa really signs some more great players. there's no point shooting rafa. more 'bullets' aimed at rafa will only cause more chaos to LFC, why not just stand as a team? unity gives us strength, our support will motivate the team.</p>

              <p>yes i understand. IMO, it's the team that needs to shoulder more of the blame. the manager can motivate the team in the dressing room. but its the captain that needs to pull the team together on the field. there is nothing much the manager can do once the team is on the field. and i feel that gerrard isn't doing a very good job as a captain to motivate the team( relative to last season). and i will also blame liverpool's lousy luck.</p>
              <p>i guess liverpool needs some strong CB, a fast and creative winger plus a tall and strong CF to complete it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>kuyt is really quite hopeless IMO. he is slow, his touches are bad, there is no creativity. the only plus point about him now is his determination. lucas is doing the basic job well, but that's not what liverpool wants. liverpool are a big historic club, we want a influencial midfielder rather than one that is average.</p>
              <p>babel's, voronin's and dossena's time is over in liverpool.they just dont cherish their playing time to prove themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lets hope there is some tide-turning-signings made in this jan transfer window</p>

              <p>anyway this is my pick for liv.</p>
              <p>carragher, dagger, johnson, aurelio</p>
              <p>benayoun, gerrard, aquilani, reira</p>
              <p>   torres, ngog/kuyt/babel</p>
              <p>i feel that liverpool needs a stronger midfield with gerrard playing a deeper role, allowing aquilani to do what he is best at. rather then the conventional torres-gerrard link--- this is because every team has found a way to break this link down, thus crippling liverpool's attack. benayoun and riera provide much creativity and space on the flanks. gerrard and aquilani are well-known for long shots. the striker behind torres can serve as a distraction to lure defenders away from torres. and torres.. nothing needs to be said about his qualities.</p>

              <p>The team sheet was decided by Ah Ben before the match commence.</p>
              <p>Liverpool DO have players that can WIN the match against Reading.</p>
              <p>The anger and fustration against Ah Ben is that he is fielding a ultra-defensive formation and fielding off-form players to start the match.</p>
              <p>The difference is the spark that come along when Benny is fielded but all too late.</p>
              <p>I understand that there is some fans that all behind Ah Ben and felt that he is being made the scapegoat.</p>
              <p>But, the reality check is that he BOUGHT all the useless players and his insistence to use the useless players is the downfall for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>You can say that Liverpool have limited resources.</p>
              <p>But, have the players that Ah Ben bought during last two season impressed ?</p>
              <p>He have basically wasted 20 million to buy a injured player that recovered too late to save the Liverpool season.</p>
              <p>By the time he can make an impact, I believe Stevie and Torres would have left in disgust.</p>

              <p>i think many people here are too biased against rafa. i thought he did what anyone would have done in his place against reading.</p>
              <p>it wasnt an ultra defensive formation so i dun really know whats the argument about. and off-form players? starting line-up : reina, carra, srktel, darby, insua, aurelio, kuyt, gerrard, lucas, torres, ngog. 4-4-2</p>
              <p>really which off these is actually off-form and u could actually replace them with some1 better other than lucas?</p>
              <p>contary to what you may believe, rafa i feel was trying to win the game trying to attack. in theory this squad rafa fielded against reading i feel is already an overkill.</p>
              <p>his substitutions - ngog for aqua, aurelio for benayoun. to get more creativity in the pitch and perhaps kill off reading.</p>
              <p>carra and srktel did ok. though for the 1st goal srktel could have done more.</p>
              <p>darby did well i feel, insua had a terrible nite. perhaps aurelio shd come back more often to double team the reading rw.</p>
              <p>gerrad was off-form i feel. his passes were majority mis-placed. lucas as usual giving the ball to the reading players. torres could and should have won more headers.</p>
              <p>overall the team did badly.</p>
              <p>but we must understand that reading played freaking well last nite. coupled with the fact that the pool players were very lethargic thus the result. tactical-wise i wouldnt blame rafa for last nite. the players have themselves to blame.</p>

              <p>i agree with you. its the team that performed badly. and its exhaustion to be blamed.</p>
              <p>anyway, want to get this clear. i am not a pro-rafa or anti-rafa scouser. i'm just trying to be fair and judge him objectively..</p>

              <p>Ya la xingg , sounds like it's the team that must be fault for not winning or losing .</p>

              <p>i am not totally pinning the blame on the team. rafa share the blames too.</p>
              <p>what i want to point out is that most people are blaming rafa ENTIRELY.which IMO, is unfair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what i'm against rafa now is his hands on the transfer market. most are right, his buys in the recent years did not make much impact. he could have done better.</p>
              <p>but other than that, i'm quite ok with him.</p>
