            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Liverpool to seal Pennant signing </strong><br><br>Liverpool are close to sealing a <span style="color: red;">Â£6.2m</span> swoop for Birmingham winger Jermaine Pennant, according to a report.<br><br>Birmingham revealed earlier on Tuesday that they turned down a Â£3.5m offer for the 23-year-old from Liverpool.<br><br>Now the Press Association has been told by a source close to Blues that an improved bid has been accepted with Pennant now set for talks at Anfield.<br><br>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said on Monday there "could be another two players in by the weekend".<br><br>One of those now seems certain to be Pennant, and it is claimed that Holland international Dirk Kuyt will be the other - if the Reds can negotiate Feyenoord down from their Â£12m asking price.<br><br>The Press Association's report says Liverpool have already failed with a player-plus-cash offer which would have seen Jan Kromkamp and Jerzy Dudek going to Feyenoord.<br><br>Pennant's arrival would solve Benitez's search for a right-sided midfielder, with his first choice, Sevilla's Daniel Alves, proving too pricy at Â£12m.<br><br>The Birmingham player is much cheaper, even after the Championship club negotiated the fee upwards because they knew they had to give Pennant's old club Arsenal a quarter of any cash receieved for him.<br><br>Blues boss Steve Bruce said earlier: "There has only been one bid of around Â£3.5m but we don't want to sell him for that."<br><br>They reportedly wanted Â£8m, but have settled for Â£6.2m, even though St Andrews managing director Karren Brady had said the player would not be sold at all.<br><br>Pennant's agent declined to comment on Tuesday evening.<br><br>The England Under-21 international, who joined Birmingham from Arsenal for Â£3m in April 2005, would join Wales striker Craig Bellamy at Anfield as Benitez looks to invest in young British talent.<br><br>But in Pennant, the Liverpool coach would be purchasing one of football's most notorious players.<br><br>In 2005 the midfielder become the first footballer to play in the Premiership while wearing an electronic tag. He had served 21 days in jail after being found guilty of drink driving while banned and having no insurance.<br><br>Originally Pennant had been banned from driving for 16 months in 2004 after being seen travelling in the wrong lane in Paddington, west London.<br><br>Also in 2005 it was reported that Birmingham sent the player home from training after he turned up under the influence of alcohol. And in a seperate incident that year, Pennant was alleged to have become involved in an argument with a man outside a restaurant on the Greek island of Zante, which led to the man punching him.<br><br>In 2003 Pennant was sent home from an England Under-21 training camp for breaking a curfew.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haiz, bo pian, first choice hard to get. Have to fall back on second option.<br><br>I dun understand, why not go for Fulham's Steed Malbranque? He's now being "cold-storaged" by Chris Coleman, not a bad player and I think he plays for the right. Last of all, I think can get him less than 6m pounds.<br><br>It's sad the entire world knows Liverpool needs a right winger and then they want to milk Liverpool for all its worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
