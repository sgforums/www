              Bryan Trubey, the American architect who designed the new Dallas Cowboys stadium, has hailed the prospective new home of English Premier League club Liverpool as a triumph.
              
              Trubey led his company HKS' design of a new stadium for the club, owned by American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks. Hicks also owns the Texas Rangers Major League Baseball franchise and has worked extensively with HKS. 
              
              "We've worked with Tom for over ten years, so I have a relationship with him like I did with (Dallas Cowboys owners) the Jones family," said Trubey. "He's always been a visionary owner that's totally open to almost anything, and so it was the same kind of experience and you can see the same quality of design work is playing itself out."
              
              In the case of Liverpool's new stadium, the construction of which is currently delayed by the club's failure to secure funding, that manifests itself in The Kop, a standalone behind-goal stand with 18,500 seats. The Kop at Liverpool's current stadium, Anfield, has carried the name since 1906, and is probably the most famous soccer stand in the world.
              
              "Creating a venue that's supportive of the team that's there but intimidating to those that visit it is one of the key elements of design," added Trubey. "You can see it a lot in the Liverpool design â€“ as much as in anything we've done â€“ the big design driver is The Kop. Man, what a spiritual experience the first time I went to a game there. That group of fans is over the top and unique in the world, and it was an instant inspiration to me to drive the whole design off of that. We obviously had to do a lot of things to be sensitive to the park and the community with exterior form too, and we've done that. But that powerful group of fans, that's probably the number one most phenomenal experience I've had in sport globally. I've been to a lot of places in the world, but that was easily the number one experience."
              
              Within hours of leaving his first game at Anfield, Trubey had drawn up sketches including what he describes as a "monolithic structure, disproportionately large." The rest of the stadium, which will hold a total of 60,000 seated fans, is distinctive in itself, but Trubey makes no secret of the fact that he sees The Kop as unique. 
              
              "Some ideas happen over time, because they're more complicated, but some are like an epiphany and they seem so right that you'd almost have to ignore them not to listen to them," he said. "That whole thing is a good example of how a really good designer or architect can enhance an existing experience thatâ€™s evolved over a hundred years, take it into a new building and put it on steroids."
              
              Despite the continuing delays, the design concept itself was, according to Trubey, a triumph for the company. "Although they're having a little bit of difficulty - like everybody is right now -  with financing, that was a hugely successful project for us. It's gotten a lot of critical and popular praise."

              <p><span class="smallheadline"><strong>New stadium is one step closer</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow says the <a href="http://www.thisisanfield.com/2009/09/14/liverpool-confirm-80million-sponsorship-deal/"><span style="color: #800000;">new shirt sponsorship deal with banking giants Standard Chartered</span></a> can pave the way for the new stadium plans to begin life again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Reds’ plans for a new 60,000 seater stadium on nearby Stanley Park were put on hold as a result of insufficient funding and the recession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However Purslow says the £20million a season deal with Standard Chartered, which was <a href="http://www.thisisanfield.com/2009/09/14/liverpool-confirm-80million-sponsorship-deal/"><span style="color: #800000;">officially confirmed this morning</span></a>, gives the club a bright future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said, “The overall financial health of our football club is a key ingredient of being able to get the stadium project back up and running.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“This is a huge step forward for the club financially and that can only be helpful to create the conditions in which we can restart the stadium project.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is also the possibility that Standard Chartered would bid for naming rights of the new stadium to raise more cash for the club, similar to how <a href="http://www.thisisanfield.com/tags/arsenal/"><span style="color: #800000;">Arsenal</span></a> play at the <em>Emirates Stadium</em>.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Naming Rights for new "Anfield" = gbp 250m</strong></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> reports that Liverpool co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett are planning to sell the naming rights to the club's new stadium for an unprecedented £250 million.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hicks confirmed recently that he and his partner were aiming to secure a deal that would be "the most attractive in the world", saying that they would target a globally recognised company.</p>
              <p>On top of the recently sealed £20m-per-year shirt sponsorship with Standard Chartered, this latest news signals something of a recruitment drive as the Americans seek to wipe away the club's debts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The proposed new stadium in Stanley Park is presently on the backburner with the Merseyside outfit around £300m in arears, but the owners believe their bold plan will provide a huge boost for the 'New Anfield' project.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is understood that Hicks and Gillet plan to underwrite some 50 per cent of the construction costs through the sale of the new venue's naming rights, in a deal that would surpass all others of its kind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This venture is sure to attract attention in the wake of Newcastle United's move to rename St James' Park and Chelsea's controversial plans for Stamford Bridge, but the Kopites may be more understanding given that the plans are for an entirely new stadium.</p>
