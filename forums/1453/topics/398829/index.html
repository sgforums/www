              <p>roy hodgeson managed switzerland and inter milan before mind you. it is not like he lacks experience in managing a top club before. even roy evans and houllier did not finish lower than top 6 unlike rafa 7th. this is the worst season for liverpool for 3 decades? hodgeson was in the game much earlier than rafa also.</p>
              <p>also dutch league isnt same as EPL/BPL.</p>

              <p>The key players for Liverpool was bought under advice of Pako and not Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben's track record of buying players when he cried for getting full control sucks.</p>
              <p>What Ah Ben did was to exchange good players with sub-standard players with the funds he was given.</p>
              <p>Even given with good players, he refused to play them when he have them or played them out of position to boost his little ego.</p>
              <p>His ego was also at stake when the players were outspoken against him.</p>
              <p>For past few season, his backside is saved mostly by Benny, Torres and Gerard.</p>
              <p>It pained me to see Liverpool with players played out of position and medicore players still being fielded for every match.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have done what he can do with Liverpool and he cannot bring Liverpool any foward with the existing squad.</p>
              <p>There is also no confidence of him bringing any good players as he have proven himself to be a failure with player transfer.</p>
              <p>Keeping him will bring more harm as he will keep on commiting his old mistakes.</p>
