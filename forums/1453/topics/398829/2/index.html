              <p><br>true.. and i agreed with ur points..</p>
              <p>@ times, Rafa always deployed unsuitable players @ different positions..</p>
              <p>for example, Javier as RB.. when he has Degen perfectly fit..</p>
              <p>i really nth to say.. haha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and earlier on, he kept depolying Degen as a Right-Midfield.. when he can try using El Zhar..</p>
              <p>it seems like he is trying to prove ppl tat the stuns he used is successful but it proved otherwise.. haha..</p>

              <h1>Jamie Carragher: What really happened at half-time in Istanbul</h1>
              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.icnetwork.co.uk/upl/icliverpool/feb2006/9/9/00076BAD-C805-13FE-81CC0C02AC1BF824.jpg" border="0" alt="Jamie Carragher celebrates with the supporters in Istanbul" width="200" height="244"></div>
              <p><em>AT half-time in the 2005 Champions League final in Istanbul, Jamie 
              Carragher found himself staring into the abyss.</em></p>
              <p>AC Milan had just produced a spell-binding 45 minutes of football to
               leave Liverpool trailing by three goals to nil.</p>
              <p>All hopes of winning a fifth European Cup had seemingly been 
              extinguished as Carragher and his team-mates walked into the dressing 
              room for Rafa Benitez’s half-time team talk.</p>
              <p>Here, in an exclusive extract from Carra: My Autobiography, 
              Carragher talks for the first time about what exactly went on during 
              that mythical 15 minutes and how Benitez’s inspirational intervention 
              helped change the course of football history.</p>
              <p>PEOPLE ask what was going through my mind in those moments before 
              half-time.</p>
              <p>As I walked towards the dressing room, I was suffering from a 
              depressing combination of despondency and humiliation.</p>
              <p>I couldn't bear to lift my head up and glimpse the faces in the 
              crowd, or the banners and red jerseys scattered around the Ataturk.</p>
              <p>I looked towards the floor and saw nothing but endless dejection. My
               dreams had turned to dust.</p>
              <p>I wasn't thinking about the game any more. My thoughts were with my 
              family and friends. I was so sorry.</p>
              <p>Daft, seemingly trivial ideas scattered themselves across my mind, 
              such as 'What will everyone at home be saying about this?'</p>
              <p>The thought of going home a laughing stock disturbed me. It would 
              have felt like the whole city, the whole country, even the whole world 
              was taking the mickey out of us.</p>
              <p>There was a sense of shame to go with my sorrow. The Liverpool fans 
              had taken over the stadium and there was nothing we could do to make 
              amends.</p>
              <p>I almost began to regret reaching the final. All defeating Juve and 
              Chelsea had achieved, it seemed, was to allow AC Milan to outclass us 
              and possibly secure the greatest ever margin of victory in a European 
              Cup final.</p>
              <p>They'd beaten Barcelona and Steaua Bucharest 4-0 in the 1994 and 
              1989 finals, and now I feared we'd create history for the wrong reasons,
               at the receiving end of a record defeat, by five or six. Keeping it at 
              3-0 and at the very least restoring some respectability was all that 
              mattered to me now.</p>
              <p>Nothing was said by the players as we returned to the dressing room.
               A mythical 15 minutes in the Liverpool legend was upon us, but it 
              didn't feel that way.</p>
              <p>The trickiest test in such circumstances is ensuring you don't give 
              up.</p>
              <p>It would have been easy for us to accept our ambitions were in 
              tatters, that nine months of toil were going to end in catastrophe.</p>
              <p>Mentally we were all over the place, but I knew it wasn't in my 
              nature to accept this fate. No matter how bad it was, we were going to 
              have to face up to our responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, there was at least one sane head in the room prepared 
              to restore our battered spirits.</p>
              <p>In that Ataturk dressing room Rafa Benitez cemented his place in 
              Anfield folklore.</p>
              <p>My admiration for his handling of the situation is unlimited. Rafa's
               conduct rarely changed, regardless of the circumstances. His calm 
              demeanour was never required more than now.</p>
              <p>Privately, he must have felt the same as us. He too couldn't have 
              failed to think about his family, or what the people of Spain would be 
              making of his side's battering.</p>
              <p>Here he was, still struggling with his English, trying to instruct 
              us to achieve the impossible.</p>
              <p>“Good luck,” I thought to myself.</p>
              <p>He showed few signs of emotion as he explained his changes, but the 
              speed with which he made a series of tactical switches showed how sharp 
              he still was.</p>
              <p>First, he told Traore to get into the shower. That was the polite 
              code for telling a player he's being subbed.</p>
              <p>Djibril Cisse was told he'd be coming on to play on the right side 
              and was already getting kitted out.</p>
              <p>As Djimi removed his shirt, an argument was brewing between Steve 
              Finnan and our physio Dave Galley. Finnan had damaged a groin and Dave 
              told Rafa he thought he should be subbed.</p>
              <p>Finn was distraught and pleaded to stay on. Rafa wouldn't budge.</p>
              <p>“We've only two subs left because we've already lost Kewell with an 
              injury,” he explained. “I can't afford to make two now, and if you stay 
              on I've lost my last sub.”</p>
              <p>Traore was told to put his kit back on.</p>
              <p>Then, as if struck by a moment of clarity, Benitez made an abrupt 
              decision.</p>
              <p>“Hamann will replace Finnan and we'll play 3-5-2,” he explained, 
              displaying an assured conviction in his voice which, temporarily at 
              least, gave me confidence.</p>
              <p>“Pirlo is running the game from midfield, so I want Luis and Stevie 
              to play around him and outnumber them in the middle so he can't pass the
               ball.”</p>
              <p>The swiftness of this decision confirmed to me he may have 
              considered this formation earlier. The same set-up had worked in Turin, 
              although that had been a purely defensive strategy.</p>
              <p>“OK,” part of me was thinking, “forty-five minutes too late, but we 
              got there in the end.” Given the circumstances, it was still a brave 
              move.</p>
              <p>With both Cisse and Hamann now preparing to come on, there was only 
              one problem.</p>
              <p>“Rafa, I think we've 12 players out there now.”</p>
              <p>Djibril would have to wait a while longer for his introduction.</p>
              <p>When we emerged from our desolate dressing room, I wasn't encouraged
               by the look of steely determination on the face of Maldini as he led 
              his side back out.</p>
              <p>There were claims after the match of premature celebrations in the 
              Milan camp at half-time.</p>
              <p>I was upset on their behalf by that pack of lies. Traore gave an 
              interview after the game suggesting the Italians were cocky at 3-0, but I
               think he was naive in his answers and it was twirled into a fairy story
               by the newspapers.</p>
              <p>It simply didn't happen. Milan were far too professional for that. 
              There was no way their captain, with all his experience, was going to 
              allow anyone in his dressing room to take victory for granted.</p>
              <p>Nothing I saw suggested Milan were already popping champagne. I have
               too much respect for them even to suggest it.</p>
              <p>Even if they did, privately, believe they had both hands on the cup,
               who could blame them?</p>
              <p>As I headed back into the arena, I was sure Milan were going to win,
               so were the forty thousand Scousers in Istanbul, so why shouldn't they 
              have believed it?</p>
              <p>I could hear “You'll Never Walk Alone” in the distance, and as I 
              exited the tunnel it grew louder. It wasn't the usual version of our 
              anthem, though.</p>
              <p>There are different moments when The Kop summons Gerry Marsden's 
              classic. Before every home game it's a deafening rallying cry, as if to 
              inspire us to perform and frighten our opponents into submission.</p>
              <p>If we're winning in the closing stages of a huge match, it will be 
              sung again, this time in celebration.</p>
              <p>But there are other occasions the words of the song have greater 
              meaning, and at half-time in Istanbul the fans were singing it in 
              sympathy more than belief.</p>
              <p>There was a slow, sad sound to it, almost as if it was being sung as
               a hymn. The fans were certainly praying on our behalf.</p>
              <p>To me, it was the supporters' way of saying, “We're still proud of 
              what you've done, we're still with you, so don't let your heads drop.”</p>
              <p>There was probably a hint of a warning in there too, as the walk 
              back to my position felt like a guilt trip: “Don't let us down any more 
              than you already have.”</p>
              <p>Our coach Alex Miller's final instructions at half time were for us 
              to “score a goal for those fans”.</p>
              <p>That was the mindset we had. Get one and pride might be restored.</p>
