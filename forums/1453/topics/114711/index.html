            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Interesting topic fm TNP:-</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">LIVERPOOL captain Steven Gerrard is undoubtedly one of the most influential footballers in the English game.<br><br>And at Vicarage Road, that reputation was enhanced when he scored against Watford to seal Liverpool's place in the final of the Carling Cup.<br><br>'He's a key player for us,' the manager said. 'When he plays, he plays well and the team does well.'<br><br>Now, is that really how it is? We say it's this and that.<br><br>Let's wind back the clock. Back to September when Gerrard broke a bone in his foot. It was a serious injury and it put him out until November.<br><br>However, here's food for thought. As reported by PA Sport, it was during the time when he was hobbling around that Liverpool had one of their better spells of the season.<br><br>In fact, Liverpool's record this season clearly shows Benitez's men doing better when Gerrard was sidelined - if average points per game can be used as a yardstick.<br><br>So, what gives?<br><br>Is Gerrard truly Liverpool's talisman and liberator - the guy who can break the shackles which have kept them from challenging Chelsea, Arsenal and United?<br><br>Or is he, when at the helm, steering the ship off course?</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Hmmm....food for thot?!</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is mentality of most of the players.<br><br>Especially in the midfield section.<br><br>There is still a slacker mentality in the Liverpool to play good or lousy when they like it.<br><br>Steven Gerrard is often the scapegoat for lousy performance as his contribution is evident for every match.<br><br>So, if he have a off day, the rest of the players will follow suit and not getting the blame.<br><br>Although we may purchase the best and proven striker in the world in Nando, if the rest of the team is not hungry and feeding past glories, Liverpool will be struggling for 4th placing every season.<br><br>It is like having the re-run of GH era, with the Spanish flavour.<br><br>Liverpool still need a English Hard core midfield to distribute the play.<br><br>Drop Garcia for once.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">As far as tis season is concerned, the oni player I miss is Xabi Alonso!  There's no doubt he played a major part during Stevie's absence.<br><br>And when both Alonso and Stevie are in the team, the responsibility is shared such tat when one is off, the other can still keep the team going.<br><br>Now w/out Alonso, we seem to rely too much on Stevie - players tend to pass the ball to him.  So once he's not in-the-mood, we really look lost!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>But like kops21 said - football is a team game, we simply cannot rely on 1 or 2 players.  I really hope Beni is aware of it and to correct the mentality of the team sooner rather than later! </span><br></span></div>
