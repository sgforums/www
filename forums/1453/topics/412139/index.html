              <span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="color: #333332;">Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson was again left to defend out-of-form striker Fernando Torres after his disappointing performance against FC Utrecht.<br><br>The Reds were held to a goalless draw in Holland on a frustrating night for the Anfield club and especially for the Spanish striker, who was unable to add to his one goal this campaign.<br><br>However, Hodgson was quick to defend the World Cup winner and stated that he was pleased with his performance as well as his side’s point.<br><br>The Reds boss told reporters: "I thought it was a good point, we knew it would be a tough point. We gave them a couple of chances through individual errors, but in terms of shape and the way we played I have nothing but praise for my team.<br><br>"Fernando is still seeking that elusive goal and there were a couple of good opportunities but unfortunately it didn't happen for him.<br><br>"He is getting closer, and it will come right for him. It was another good 90 minutes under his belt and he will be better for it.”
              
              </span><br><br><span style="color: #333332;">The striker appeared to be complaining of a knee problem as he went straight to the team physio after the full-time whistle, but Hodgson was quick to play down suggestions that the Spanish star had picked up an injury. <br><br>He added: "I didn't spend the whole 90 minutes watching one player or obsessing about him and whether he picked up a knock or not, I have to concentrate on all my players and I was satisfied with the team performance.<br><br>"Utrecht were as aggressive and determined as we knew they could be and we had to be at our best to keep them out tonight and we did.<br><br>"A point, which gives us four points now is more than satisfactory, and a draw is a more than satisfactory result.<br><br>"I think maybe a win for us would have been harsh on Utrecht because they deserved something from the game, so I am satisfied with the result, and our position in the group now.<br><br>"It was a good game and they are a good team, it was not a dull game where nothing happened, and I think it is quite easy to see why they have such a good home record," concluded the Liverpool manager.</span><br></span></div>
