He is a good player, an aggressive player, and he is getting more used to English football now.<br><br><strong>"He played very well at centre back last week. I knew he could play there because he spent a year in that position with Malaga. Of course he can also play on the right of the defence as well so he gives us different possibilities.</strong><br><br>"He was unfortunate last season because he had so many injury problems, but if he can stay fit then he will be an important member of our squad this year."<br><br>there! they are relatives, one way or the other!!!!</div>
