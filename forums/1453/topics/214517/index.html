            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Stoke have tied up the signing of Liverpool midfielder Salif Diao on a three-month loan after agreeing what percentage of his wages to pay.<br><br>The 29-year-old agreed to the switch over the weekend and trained with the Potters for the first time on Monday.<br><br>Now, the two clubs have come to an agreement over how much of Diao's Â£40,000-a-week wages Stoke will pay and the Senegal international is in line to make his debut in Saturday's trip to face Leeds.<br><br>Diao admits his career at Liverpool is over after falling out of favour at Anfield and he sees the move as a chance to prove people wrong who have labelled him a flop.<br><br>"My career at Liverpool is over, but not my career in England," he told the Stoke Sentinel.<br><br>"I feel I have something to prove, especially in England, because apart from my first year at Liverpool I have been unlucky with injuries.<br><br>"Sometimes you read in the papers that you are a flop and that hurts you a lot.<br><br>"I'm a very proud person and that's one of the reasons I want to stay in England. I know I'm a better player than you have seen."<br><br>"I love the passion of the people here and I want to stay in this country long-term instead of moving abroad."<br><br>Diao also insists he has no problem dropping down a division to the Championship.<br><br>"Sometimes you have to go down to be able to jump higher. I've already done that before and I am just happy to be here. I am impressed by everything, and everyone was happy for me to be here," he added.<br><br>Potters boss Tony Pulis claims the signing proves just how ambitious the club are, despite their lowly position in the league.<br><br>"He is only on loan, but I still hope this is the kind of signing that will convince people how serious the club is about our future ambitions," he said.<br><br>"We are absolutely delighted to sign a player of Salif's quality and we are extremely grateful to Liverpool for agreeing to the deal.<br><br>"Salif is a lovely kid and one, hopefully, champing at the bit and with something to prove to our benefit.<br><br>"He can play at the back, but I see him more as a midfielder for us. He's an all-action type of player, very competitive and a good passer of the ball.<br><br>"We've done our homework and checked him out fitness-wise as you'd expect. He seems to be 100 per cent and is on course to be in Saturday's squad for Leeds away. </blockquote><a href="http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_1582363,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_1582363,00.html</a><br><br>Let's wish him all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
