            <div class='col-md body'>according to Pires, he's gone...<br><br>as reported in Football365<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pires: 'Vieira has decided to go'</strong></span><br><span class="small">Monday August 09 2004</span><br><br>Arsenal winger Robert Pires has revealed that Patrick Vieira has already decided on a move to Real Madrid.<br><br>Pires' admission came as Arsene Wenger gave Vieira until this weekend to make an announcement on his future plans amid continued interest from the Spanish club.<br><br>Although Vieira has made no public statement about his plans so far this summer, Pires would appear to have already conceded that his friend is set to leave Highbury.<br><br>The Arsenal winger admitted: ``His sale will leave a huge void in the middle of our side, but we can adapt to a life without his leadership.<br><br>``All the players wanted Patrick to stay. But he's made a choice and we respect that. We can all understand why he's decided to go to La Liga.<br><br>``I'd just wish him all the luck in the world at the Bernabeu.''<br><br>Pires' comments, which appeared in yesterday's edition of Scotland's Sunday Herald newspaper, were reported by the author of his autobiography, Xavier Rivoire, a respected French journalist.<br><br>Two potential stumbling blocks still remain - Arsenal may still hold out for rather more than Real are prepared to offer in a transfer fee and Vieira has yet to agree personal terms in Spain.<br><br>Indeed, reports have indicated that the Spanish club's opening offer to the midfielder was well short of what the existing 'galacticos' earn.<br><br>However, the move looks increasingly likely and Pires' comments are the most revealing indication yet of the potential next chapter in the ongoing saga.<br><br>After all, Wenger has now admitted he would allow Vieira to leave the club - at the right price - if he handed in a transfer request this week, even though he still wants him to stay.<br><br>``Only he can come out and clarify the situation now, and he needs to do that very quickly,'' said Wenger after his side's Community Shield win against Manchester United, without the injured Vieira.<br><br>``His commitment is not a question mark for me, he has always been outstanding in that. But before the start of the season, we want the captain to be focused on what the team wants to achieve.<br><br>``I want him to be part of the future of this team, but I want him to be clear in his mind, whether his heart is with us or not.<br><br>``My intention is clear, for him to stay and us to keep him. But if he chooses not to stay, then we have to find different solutions. I am positive that we can do well.''<br><br>Spanish newspapers today interpreted those remarks as effectively throwing in the towel, given that Real rarely, if ever, fail to snare their leading transfer target each summer.<br><br>With three weeks of the transfer window still to run, no official announcement is expected until after the first leg of Real's Champions League qualifying round tie against Wisla Krakow this week.<br><br>However, Arsenal appear to have already begun the search for midfield reinforcements, with West Ham bracing themselves for an official bid for Michael Carrick.<br><br>Wenger, who has admitted his interest in Carrick, has nevertheless played down reports of a move for Portugal's Euro 2004 star Maniche.<br><br>``Have I looked at him? Not really, no. I was at the European Championships and I saw him play, but I knew about him before. You can ask Porto, I have never made an inquiry about Maniche,'' he said at the weekend.<br><br>While many Arsenal fans would be loathe to lose Vieira, former Arsenal captain Tony Adams believes that now may be the right time to sell the 28-year-old midfielder.<br><br>He told the Sunday Herald: ``Patrick's only got a year or two left at the top level. Looking at the way he runs, basic physiology will tell you that.<br><br>``I believe that one leg is three centimetres longer than the other. As a result, I don't think he'll be playing into his thirties, at the top level anyway.<br><br>``Arsene [Wenger] would be thinking 'okay, you can probably do another three years but what are we going to get for you then?'<br><br>``Actually, the loss of Dennis [Bergkamp] would worry me more than the loss of Patrick. The way Dennis plays and what he's done for the club, he'll be virtually impossible to replace when he retires [next summer].''</div>
