              <p>SO sad to see Liverpool like that , they looked like minnows against Man City .</p>
              <p>No sparks , no creations , no penetrations , no organisations , no control , etc .....</p>
              <p>Lucas , once again , cannot make it in a Liverpool jersey la .</p>
              <p>Why are we sticking with Dirk Kuyt and Lucas ?</p>
              <p>And Ngogu ?</p>

              </div>
              <span id="divAdnetKeyword">Adam Johnson starred for Manchester City as Roberto Mancini's side beat Liverpool 3-0 at Eastlands to claim their first Premier League win of the season.<br><br>Carlos Tevez scored twice and Gareth Barry scored after combining with new signing James Milner to open the scoring for the home side.<br><br>Liverpool were denied a route back into the game by a Joe Hart double-save as City finished looking convincing victors.<br><br>Mancini handed a debut to James Milner but Mario Balotelli would have to wait for his Premier League bow due to a knee injury. Joleon Lescott returned to the side at left-back but there was no place for World Cup winner David Silva in the City attack.<br><br>The visitors handed Fernando Torres a first start of the season but travelled to Eastlands without Javier Mascherano, whom manager Roy Hodgson suggested had been left in the wrong frame of mind amidst speculation surrounding his future. Lucas instead partnered Steven Gerrard in central midfield in a positive 4-4-2 formation, with new signing Christian Poulsen on the bench.
              
              <br><br>City were playing in front of Sheikh Mansour for the first time and the man who has shelled a fortune into the club had to wait just 13 minutes for evidence of a return on his investment as five signings of his regime combined to put Mancini’s side ahead.<br><br>Adam Johnson, who had earlier fired just wide with a fizzing effort from 25 yards, played a through ball into Milner in the penalty area, and the club’s latest arrival pulled the ball back for fellow former Aston Villa man Barry, who coolly slotted past Reina for the opener.<br><br>The home side did not let up as Tevez latched onto a long ball and flashed a shot into the side netting a minute later and Barry set about doubling his tally, but his long range effort failed to trouble Reina as it flashed well wide of the target.<br><br>It was a difficult opening half an hour for Liverpool as they were unable to keep possession for long periods, but David Ngog finally forced a diving save from Joe Hart with a low but tame shot to the England international’s left just over 10 minutes from the interval.<br><br>The hosts threatened twice in quick succession as Adam Johnson went closer still with a low drive and a piece of trickery from Tevez almost saw him carve an opening, but Steven Gerrard would have the final two chances of the half, missing the target from distance on both occasions.<br><br>Liverpool failed to seize the initiative after finishing the half on a high and fell further behind seven minutes into the second period after conceding a corner as another Adam Johnson effort was deflected out of play for a corner.<br><br>Micah Richards leapt highest to head Adam Johnson’s resulting set piece towards goal and Tevez ghosted in front of Reina – who looked to have the header covered – to make the faintest of connections and help the ball through the Spain international’s legs.<br><br>Only then were Liverpool belatedly sparked into life, and City can only thank a combination of the frame of the goal and Hart for keeping them ahead by two goals.<br><br>Gerrard was once again at the centre of the visitor’s attack and tried his luck with a thunderous drive that beat Hart but cannoned back of the post.<br><br>City failed to clear and from the resulting melee the England custodian denied Ngog before quickly recovering and flying to his left to stop what looked to be a certain goal for Torres.<br><br>Liverpool looked to have gained a foothold in the game but any hope of getting back into the contest disappeared when City added a third from the spot with less than 25 minutes to go.<br><br>Adam Johnson, City’s liveliest player throughout, danced into the area and deceived Skrtel, who slid and made contact with the winger who went down, leaving Phil Dowd no choice but to point the spot.<br><br>Skrtel was perhaps lucky to stay on having already been booked for a first half challenge on Johnson, but Liverpool’s luck ended there as Tevez stepped up and sent Reina the wrong way to add a third.<br><br>Liverpool continued to probe and Torres showed a flash of what he is capable of when fully fit, pivoting past Richards and dragging a shot across the face of the goal, but it proved to be the Spaniard’s last act as he was replaced by Ryan Babel on 78 minutes.<br><br>Babel was immediately involved, picking the ball up on the left-hand side before cutting inside and seeing his deflected shot skid off the surface and away from goal via another Hart parry.<br><br>Tevez received an ovation as he was replaced by Jo with five minutes to play, while Yaya Toure was also subsituted for Pablo Zabaleta and Liverpool brought on youngster Dani Pacheco in place of Milan Jovanovic.<br><br>The Argentinian may have scored twice but Johnson will take the majority of the plaudits after a star performance that punished Liverpool throughout.<br></span></div>
