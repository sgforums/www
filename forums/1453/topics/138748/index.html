They have plans to move to a new 3,000-capacity stadium in Oswestry.<br><br>:: They play in the village of Llansantffraid, population 1,000, where the local railway station shut down 50 years ago.<br><br>:: In their former guise as Llansantffraid FC, they won 10 Welsh Village Cup titles.<br><br>:: TNS completed their spectacular ascent through the domestic Welsh ranks by winning the Welsh Premier title in the 1999/2000 season. Their second league title arrived this year.<br><br>:: Striker Marc Lloyd-Williams plundered 34 league goals last season, a new club record, and became the first player to score 200 career goals at the top level of the Welsh league. He had brief and unsuccessful spells in England with Stockport, Halifax and York.<br><br>:: Midfielder Steven Beck played in the same Everton youth team as Wayne Rooney.<br><br>:: TNS play in green and white hoops, similar to Celtic's kit.<br><br>:: Former Liverpool striker Ian Rush is a non-executive director of TNS.<br><br>:: Centre-back Steve Evens is the current Welsh Premier player of the season.<br><br>:: Llansantffraid became TNS in 1997 after securing a sponsorship deal with a locally-based communications company.</blockquote></div>
