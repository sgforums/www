              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Babel has revealed he would be interested in a loan move to Ajax when</span> the transfer window reopens in January, while Riera made only his first start of the campaign at Bolton last weekend. <br>  <br>Benitez insists both players will get chances to shine over the coming months - and that it will then be down to them to seize the opportunities which come their way. <br>  <br>"Albert and Ryan both want to play," said Benitez. "They play in the same position and so have to compete with each other, which is good for us. <br>  <br>"The message is very simple. On the pitch all of the players have to prove something. <br>  <br>"Ryan knows he cannot go now, so he has to impress. He is a good player and we know he has talent. It's important for us to talk with him and see how he progresses over these months. <br>  <br>"With the World Cup at the end of the year the majority of our players will want to impress and if they do well in each training session they will have more chances."</p>

              Albert Riera admits that he had a bust up with Rafa, which has left rumours that his Liverpool future could be in doubt. The Spaniard has dismissed this notion, insisting that he was unhappy at not starting the match against Tottenham (our first of the season) but the argument that followed, which is now forgotten, was more out of his desire to play than any disrespect to anyone else, as he explained:
              
              'I was angry and had a flare-up at Benitez, but the day I don't get angry for being a substitute I will retire.
              
              'Benitez is a special coach who defends his own. I know he is with me, because he said so.'
              
              Riera has been linked with a move to Barcelona, like so many Reds, but he wants to stay at Anfield and will now look to force his way back into the first team.

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez believes Liverpool can build on last month's dramatic victory over Bolton Wanderers by embarking on an unbeaten run in the Barclays Premier League.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">After losing two of their opening three fixtures, a late </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> goal secured a 3-2 triumph over the Trotters and ensured all three points headed to Anfield in the last fixture before the international break. <br>  <br>Now Benitez is backing his side to gain momentum from the win - and has insisted it is far too early in the season for anyone to be writing off the Reds' title aspirations. <br>  <br>"The team as a team has not played at the level we can, but hopefully the win against Bolton will be a lift for us," the boss told his weekly press conference at Melwood. <br>  <br>"When you are not doing well you always need character - and the players showed character against Bolton. <br>  <br>"We controlled the game and although we conceded two goals, we scored three and came from behind to win. That is very positive and hopefully it will be a different situation for us now." <br>  <br>Asked what he felt the reason was behind Liverpool's mixed start to the campaign, Benitez replied: "Two things. One was expectation - when we finished last season with 86 points, I think everybody was expecting this year to be ours. <br>  <br>"But the message is always the same - we have to think about one game at a time, try to get three points and then see what our position is each week. <br>  <br>"You cannot win titles in September, so you have to go to January and see where you are, and then April and May is when you will fight. <br>  <br>"The other thing was that pre-season was difficult with a lot of players returning at different times. <br>  <br>"We tried to manage the situation and then we had another international break, so we didn't have too much time. Then we started against Tottenham, who are doing well, so it was difficult." <br>  <br>Benitez is predicting a much more open title race this campaign, and added: "You don't want to lose two games, especially early in the season, but clearly this year will be different. <br>  <br>"The teams at the top fighting can beat anyone, so I think you will see some top teams lose games." <br>  <br>Barclays Premier League new boys Burnley are next up for Liverpool as the Lancashire side travel to Anfield on Saturday. <br>  <br>The Clarets will arrive in L4 having already beaten Manchester United and Everton this term - and Benitez knows they will provide a stern test for his charges. <br>  <br>"Burnley are a good team and have a very good group of players who know each other very well," said the Spaniard. <br>  <br>"When you see a new team in the Premier League playing the way they are, it shows the manager is doing a good job and it will be a tough game, like always in the Premier League. <br>  <br>"They have beaten Manchester United and Everton and that shows they are doing well, so you never know - anything can happen in football. <br>  <br>"We have a lot of confidence and are sure we can win, but I think that maybe they will feel they can get some points too." <br>  <br>Benitez revealed Brazilian full-back </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/aurelio/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Aurelio</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> could come into contention for Saturday's encounter and is hopeful of his international stars returning to Melwood with a clean bill of health. <br>  <br>Meanwhile, the manager was quizzed on England's World Cup prospects after the Three Lions secured their place in next year's finals after beating Croatia 5-1 at Wembley on Wednesday night. <br>  <br>"I think there are three or four countries who have the power and the quality to win the World Cup, and England are one of those teams," said Benitez. <br>  <br>England's cause was aided by excellent performances from Anfield duo </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/johnson/"><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. <br>  <br>Gerrard helped himself to a brace of goals, while Johnson claimed another assist in the comprehensive win. <br>  <br>"Glen has been really good for us since the very first day and also for England," enthused Benitez. "You can see his offensive mentality and his crossing is really good. <br>  <br>"I was surprised to see some criticism the other day. He is a very good player. He can improve and he knows this - he is someone who is keen to learn. <br>  <br>"He is so good attacking that sometimes it is difficult for the defenders of the other team to stop him than it is for him to be worried about the defence. <br>  <br>"He can improve in defence, but he is a decent defender and very good at attacking. He has a very good balance and his understanding of the game is good." <br>  <br>Gerrard's double came from his makeshift position on the left on midfield - but Benitez believes his captain is good enough to operate in any role. <br>  <br>He said: "I have been for talking about Steven's best position for years, but he is a very good player who can play in any position. <br>  <br>"He is doing well for England on the left and if he plays in the middle or as a second striker he will be good too. <br>  <br>"In playing Gerrard on the left, I think Steven knows he has freedom and can go inside. <br>  <br>"Capello is doing a fantastic job and he has a very good team who are organised."</span></p>
