              <h2>BENITEZ TO DISCUSS ANFIELD FUTURE</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez heads into a meeting with new 
              chairman Martin Broughton this week which could well decide his future 
              at the club.</p>
              <p>A 2-0 defeat to Chelsea in their final home Premier League match 
              of the season finally put paid to hopes of securing Champions League 
              football next season, the first time they had missed out on Europe's 
              elite club competition since they finished fifth in 2002-03.</p>
              <p>It also meant Liverpool will finish the season with their lowest 
              points tally in five years, since accruing 58 in Benitez's first 
              campaign in charge back in 2004-05.</p>
              <p>Benitez would not comment on increasing speculation that his 
              future lie elsewhere, having been linked with a summer move to Juventus 
              since January.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard is keen to stay on at Anfield but after years of 
              what he sees as broken promises from the club's co-owners Tom Hicks and 
              George Gillett, who officially put Liverpool up for sale last month, he 
              remains to be convinced he will be given the resources to carry out the 
              massive rebuilding job which needs to be undertaken.</p>
              <p>Benitez has been disappointed Broughton, appointed by the 
              American duo to oversee the sale of the club, has not spoken to him 
              about the future.</p>
              <p>That situation will be rectified before their final league match 
              at Hull on Sunday and what is said in that meeting could have a crucial 
              bearing on whether Benitez stays.</p>
              <p>"I will have a meeting with the chairman in a few days," said the
               Liverpool boss.</p>
              <p>"I have four years of a contract [left] so we will see.</p>
              <p>"The fans want to know (whether Benitez will be in charge next 
              season) but I want to know what is going on next week against Hull.</p>
              <p>"Always in the past two years, the manager here has been taking 
              responsibility for everything.</p>
              <p>"The reality is that if you compare with other teams in terms of 
              money, power and the option you have in the market, so you can analyse 
              carefully and then you have answers.</p>
              <p>"The fans are very clever, they know what is going on. It is very
               clear that things are like this now and still we have to carry on going
               forward.</p>
              <p>"Next season we have to do almost everything perfect and if we 
              make one or two mistakes we don't have the possibility to react, so it 
              is more difficult for us.</p>
              <p>"We will prepare for the next game (at Hull) and then start 
              thinking about things for the future."</p>
              <p>Benitez rejected the suggestion the half-hearted post-match lap 
              around Anfield after the equally lacklustre defeat to Chelsea was his 
              farewell to the supporters.</p>
              <p>"We have to say thank you to our fans, as always, because they 
              have been very good," he explained</p>
              <p>The victory over Liverpool was never in doubt from the moment 
              Didier Drogba latched on to Steven Gerrard's disastrous 33rd-minute 
              back-pass.</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard's close-range goal nine minutes after the interval 
              from Nicolas Anelka's cross finished off a side who looked a spent force
               after their 120-minute Europa League semi-final exit to Atletico Madrid
               on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Had it not been for goalkeeper Jose Reina the scoreline could 
              have been worse as the Spain international denied Florent Malouda and 
              Michael Ballack and also made a smart double save from Anelka and then 
              Salomon Kalou.</p>
