              <p>The Chinese investors trying to buy Liverpool
              have pledged to rival Manchester City and Real Madrid by making them one of the biggest spenders in world football.</p>
              <p>The
               cash-strapped club would also be made completely debt-free and American
               owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett have been warned not to expect a 
              windfall from the deal.</p>
              <p>The bid fronted by Kenny Huang also 
              promises to exploit the huge Asian market and follow through on promises
               to construct the long-delayed new stadium.</p>

              <p>Marc Ganis, whose Chicago-based company Sportscorp has helped form 
              the investment group, said it first contacted Liverpool chairman Martin 
              Broughton on Monday, a day after reports of a possible bid first 
              surfaced.</p>

              <p><span>The Chinese investors four objectives are...</span></p>

              <li><span>To make Liverpool debt free;</span></li>
              <li><span>make a significant equity investment and construct the long-delayed new stadium to replace Anfield;</span></li>

               an Asian initiative to expand Liverpool's fan base and commercial 
              activities with the goal of creating new economic value for the club

              <p>'We haven't submitted a formal proposal but we submitted the broad 
              parameters of what a proposal would look like to see if it would be 
              welcomed, and it was,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Liverpool are and always 
              should be one of the highest-spending clubs in all of football. And our 
              financial models presume Liverpool will be at or near the top in 
              spending on players every year.'</p>
              <p>A company called QSL Sports would be controlling owner of the limited liability corporation that would own Liverpool.</p>
              <p>QSL
               is co-headed by Huang, a Hong Kong businessman, and Guang Yang, 
              executive vice president of Franklin Templeton Investments and chief 
              investment officer of the China Life/Franklin Templeton Fund.</p>
              <p>Ganis
               said those two would be the only owners involved in the management of 
              the club. Other investors would be passive, and each would own no more 
              than 20 per cent.</p>
              <p>China Investment Corp - the country's sovereign 
              wealth fund - would not have a direct ownership stake in the club. 
              However, Ganis said it may be part of an investment vehicle organized by
               Yang and his financial team that would have a passive ownership 
              interest.</p>
              <p>'What is not one of our goals in the enrichment of the 
              existing owners,' Ganis said. 'If we submit a proposal and it is 
              accepted, it would be focused on the future and not the past.'</p>

              <p>Barclays have told potential bidders they will have to show they have
               the financing to go through with the proposals. After QSL's interest 
              emerged, former Syrian footballer Yahya Kirdi claimed on Wednesday that 
              he was fronting a consortium of investors from the Middle East and 
              Canada that was close to completing a takeover.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have won
               18 English league titles - but none since 1990. Beset by infighting 
              between Hicks and Gillett plus player injuries, they failed to qualify 
              for this season's Champions League, losing tens of millions in revenue.</p>
              <p>But,
               amid the promise of a takeover, captain Steven Gerrard and star striker
               Fernando Torres have decided to remain with the club under new manager 
              Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Ganis said any deal would not close until well 
              after the summer transfer window ends on August 31, and Hodgson has 
              already come to terms with the fact he can't spend immediately.</p>

              <p>Hicks, whose MLB team the Texas Rangers were auctioned this week in 
              US Bankruptcy Court in Fort Worth, bought Liverpool with Gillett three 
              years ago in a deal valued at £271million. Hicks said he wants £600m to 
              £800m for the club, whose known debt last stood at £236m.</p>
              <p>Ganis said his group will not meet the owners demands.</p>
              <p>'If
               anybody wants to, good luck,' he said, without disclosing what his 
              group is willing to bid. 'We know what we would be prepared to do. If 
              somebody else wants to look at it in a different way, it's their money. 
              That would be their business, not ours.'</p>
              <p>His group aren't 
              concerned about high-spending owners in the Premier League, who include 
              Manchester City's Sheik Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Chelsea's Roman 
              Abramovich.</p>
              <p>Ganis said the Financial Fair Play rules that begin 
              for European football this season will help curb extreme spending on 
              transfers.</p>

              <p>'That creates certain constraints that many observers feel are
              quite responsible and will reduce the risk of irrational money being 
              spent,' he said.</p>
              <p>Ganis said that they have been 
              impressed in many ways with the manner in which Liverpool are being 
              operated.</p>
              <p>'From what we have seen from afar, many of the people 
              currently running Liverpool are doing a good job,' he said. 'There 
              shouldn't be an expectation there would be a mass upheaval if we submit 
              and are approved.'</p>
              <p>Ganis and the China-based group began forming 
              last spring as a potential investor with another group that evaluated a 
              potential investment in Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Ganis contacted the Royal 
              Bank of Scotland, which holds Liverpool's debt, and was put in contact 
              last week with Broughton and Barclays Capital, which is attempting to 
              sell the club for the co-owners.</p>
              <p>QSL, in conjunction with the 
              Chinese government, owns and operated two professional sports leagues 
              and one minor league. QSL also owns sports publications and in September
              will roll out an all-sports website.</p>
