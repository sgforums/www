              The Liverpool fan jailed for the attempted murder of a Bulgarian man in 2005 has received a pardon from the Justice Secretary Jack Straw.
              
              There has been a sustained campaign for the release of Michael Shields ever since he was jailed for 15 years for the attack on Martin Georgiev on May 30, 2005 in the Black sea resort of Golden Sands Bulgaria.
              
              Shields was convicted in July 2005 after being found guilty in a Bulgaria court of attacking Georgiev in a drunken brawl in the small coastal resort. The 22-year-old was in Bulgaria as he travelled home from Istanbul, where he had watched Liverpool win the 2005 Champions League.
              
              Shields had always protested his innocence and in 2006 his sentence was reduced from 15 to ten years. In November of the same year he was returned to the UK and placed in HMP Hindley in Wigan. Straw had refused to pardon him in July.
              
              Reports suggest Shields will be released from prison almost immediately.
              
              His solicitor, John Wheate, said the Liverpool fan was "absolutely ecstatic" when given the news earlier today.
              
              His parents had been told of the decision in a telephone call with Straw.
              
              "I don't know if Michael has been released yet, but I can confirm he has been pardoned and will be released today," Wheate said. "His parents spoke to Jack Straw earlier this morning, and I have spoken to Michael myself.
              
              "At first he couldn't believe it after all these years and knockbacks. But now he is absolutely ecstatic, and so are his family."
