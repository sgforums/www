            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">"Sven-Goran Eriksson is giving serious consideration to starting the World Cup with an experimental line-up that places Jamie Carragher in midfield and has Steven Gerrard pushing into attack behind Michael Owen. The previously untried 4-1-4-1 system would have no place for Peter Crouch and is likely to be deployed for the first time when England take on Hungary in a friendly at Old Trafford tonight...Yet it is Carragher's possible inclusion that will provoke the most intense debate, the Liverpool defender having had to undertake a crash course in <strong>a role that he has never played</strong> before.<br>." The Guardian</span><br><br>what d'ya think? will he excel in a `makelele' role?<br><br>i think the reporter did not check his notes well. i digged up my resources and carra, when he's a wide-eyed kiddo in the reds shirt, actually is listed as a midfielder in the liverpool bio/stats record! obviously he found his calling in the heart of defence, but that's even after a spell in the l/r back position as well.<br><br>ynwa<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Carrick and Jenas do not have the requisite 'hardness' of a holding midfielder. Butt would have been suitable. Carragher should do fine but question is whether he is able to retain possession in the middle of the park and spray the right passes. Tough job......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, it's true that Carragher played in that position before when he was under Houllier's reign. In fact, he has played all back four + def mid position before. And at his best as a CB. rather amused that The Guardian wasn't ware of that.<br><br>Not that Carragher may not be up to the mark but I felt Sven is trying to die die fit his favourite players in. Looking at form, Terry and Carragher looks gd on paper but Sven may like to put Rio back into the centre and pushing Carragher up as def mid. It's not a time to please everybody Mr Sven.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i still feel that englands best defensive midfielder at the moment is scott parker.. i really like him alot, and i felt very sad that he didn't get his chance under mourinho and yet they went to buy essien whom i think parker is better.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind you guys , Carra begins his footballing career as a midfielder , that was when Greame Souness was manager , he was a defensive midfielder , and a free-scoring midifielder , his favourite team he likes scoring against is Aston Villa . he just can't stop scoring against Villa .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And when GH and Roy Evans took over as co-manager , Carra was then deploy as a cover for the central defender role , and he excel all the way .<br><br>I can still remember that was when he was still a 18 years old lad .<br><br></div>
