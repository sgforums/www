            <div class='col-md body'>Sianz.....<br><br>I'll just comment the entire team played well. Cisse was caught by surprise with that ball, cannot blame him.<br><br>I just felt that Rafa, once again, showed too much respect to the "top teams", ala Chelsea, Man U, Arsenal and Tottenham even. His objective was to first contain the opposition, then try to create a few chances here and there and hopefully 'Pool can score.<br><br>Alas, 'Pool, in the tactic of containing the other team, have lost their own composure and way of attacking. Being caution is good, but I feel it's better to try to score first rather then prevent the other side from scoring first. How long can your defence last? I thought Liverpool's attack can be very impressive, especially during their run of wins where their passing was so smooth, fast and awesome to watch.<br><br>Oh well, at least I console myself on two points:<br><br>i)Man U can only perform on "big" matches. They are still crap against the average teams. Don't be surprised if they lose to another midtable team again.<br><br>ii)I betted on Man U. $20. Either my heart or my money. Win-win situation!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LFC strikers were very very poor. How did Cisse miss that open goal oppourtunity??? He should have scored and that would have changed the game dramatically. Crouch tried but wasn't good enough. Morientes was as effective as the fourth official on the sidelines.<br><br>The zonal defence caught Liverpool out again from a set piece. It was a good header from Rio but bad marking from the LFC defence. How can he be allowed a free header in the dying seconds of the game??<br><br>A draw at the end will have certainly been a fairer result, but football is never always fair and the results don't always give a true reflection. Bragging rights have gone to OT for now, but LFC must pick up and move on. 2nd place is certainly still very much in their hands.<br></div>
