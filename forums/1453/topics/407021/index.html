              <h1>Liverpool takeover bidder Kenny Huang promises transfer spree and new stadium if he can oust Americans<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Chinese businessman Kenny Huang has pledged to invest heavily in Liverpool  should his ownership bid succeed.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/02/article-1299678-0AA90E8A000005DC-418_306x407.jpg" alt="Jianhua " width="306" height="407">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Promises: Huang has big ideas for Liverpool</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The head of Hong Kong-based investment company QSL Sports Ltd has 
              been in talks with Royal Bank of Scotland for some time over buying out 
              the Reds' £237million debt.</p>
              <p>That would give him 'a ridiculously 
              large amount of leverage', a source said, in order to be able to force 
              out unpopular owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the spending would not stop there as Huang, whose interest is 
              described as 'remarkably serious', is keen to get a deal done in order 
              to be able to furnish manager Roy Hodgson with money to spend in this 
              month's transfer window.</p>
              <p>In addition, he will also turn his attention to finally getting 
              Liverpool's new 60,000-seater stadium built in Stanley Park after three 
              years of inertia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'He wants to get it done quickly so investment can come this summer,'
              said a source close to the bid.</p>
              <p>'Liverpool need investment in the playing squad and infrastructure 
              and Huang wants to build the stadium.</p>
              <p>'The club has an outstanding reputation but does not have the 
              infrastructure to keep with it and make it grow.'</p>
              <p>Huang is backed by one of the wealthiest investment funds in the Far 
              East and is well known in China for his interests in baseball and 
              basketball, last year buying a 15 per cent stake in American NBA side 
              Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In the Red: Liverpool's American co-owners owe RBS about £237m </em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He was first linked with a buy-out at Liverpool two years ago but 
              believes now is the time to make his move.</p>
              <p>Huang is making all the right noises to get supporters on board but, 
              although the majority will be delighted to see the back of Hicks and 
              Gillett, the fans will be wary of grandiose promises.</p>
              <p>The American owners made similar claims when they assumed control at 
              Anfield just over three years ago, with Gillett insisting there would be
              a 'spade in the ground (for the new stadium) within 60 days'.</p>
              <p>That particular boast, like many others, remains unfulfilled while 
              investment in the squad has gone backwards during their tempestuous 
              reign.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/02/article-1299678-0A9F2DA8000005DC-711_468x303.jpg" alt="David Ngog (right) celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Rabotnicki " width="468" height="303">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Underway: David Ngog (right) celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Rabotnicki in the Champions League last week</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The pair put the club up for sale in April after admitting they had 
              taken Liverpool as far as they could and independent chairman Martin 
              Broughton was appointed along with Barclays Capital to find a new buyer.</p>
              <p>However, Huang bypassed that process completely by going straight to 
              major creditors RBS.</p>
              <p>He hopes by making an offer which will see the bank receive most of 
              their money back he can stay one step ahead and force Hicks and Gillett 
              out of Anfield.</p>
              <p>'By going to RBS you can leverage a large amount of pressure that no 
              one else can on the owners,' the insider added.</p>
              <p>'It is a deal which has no interest in shareholders, meaning there 
              will be no profit for Hicks and Gillett.'</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/02/article-1299678-0A9F5B04000005DC-783_468x286.jpg" alt="Liverpool fans " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Reds alert: Liverpool fans have taken issue with the owners</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Gillett informed RBS last week that he was in advanced negotiations 
              with Syrian businessman Yahya Kirdi.</p>
              <p>However, this has been viewed as a stalling tactic in an attempt to 
              delay the bank's considerations.</p>
              <p>If RBS decide to turn down Huang's proposal - and no new viable 
              bidders are forthcoming - they have the option of calling in their loan 
              in October.</p>
              <p>It would then be classed as 'distressed debt' but with the transfer 
              window, by then, having closed Liverpool would be a much less attractive
              proposition to investors.</p>
              <p>Huang is believed to have already spoken to senior figures at Anfield
              to express his seriousness about a buy-out and in the hope that his 
              message will filter down to help persuade top stars like Fernando 
              Torres, who returned to training today after his post-World Cup break, 
              the club does have a better future.</p>
