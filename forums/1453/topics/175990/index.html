            <div class='col-md body'>after that miss at Old Trafford , all Liverpool fans would like Cisse's head chopped , some might thought that signing of Fowler seem to come to the end of Cisse , not really la ...... Fowler is the straight replacement for Mellor .<br><br>It's a straight forward solution , sent Mellor out on loan , for two years or so , get Fowler to play 2 years or so ..... by the time Mellor matured into a great player , and come back , Fowler can pack his bag .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

However it didn't even get as far as that as the player has so far failed to reach an agreement with Deportivo regarding his severance package so the medical that had been pencilled in didn't take place.<br><br>"It will be difficult," said the boss. "We were talking with Deportivo but at the end there were some problems so we decide to go forward and to use the players that we have at this moment.<br><br>"Now we are talking with Deportivo. Sometimes you try to do some things and it's not easy. In this case we were talking about Mark Gonzalez in a swap for Victor but at the end we had conversations with Real Sociedad about Mark and now Mark can go to Real Sociedad.<br><br>"In this moment we are thinking about this month, these games (this transfer window). At the end of the season we will see (about Victor) but at this moment we don't have an agreement and we don't have any idea about the summer." </span><br><br><img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/36/36_19_1.gif"> Another setback in the search of a winger .</div>
