            <div class='col-md body'>Hamann had always been underrated. I would go as far as saying had Liverpool not brought him on for the finals at Istanbul  and Cardiff, we would have kissed those trophies goodbye. He was the man who freed Gerrard up. And to me, he is a footballer's footballer. No showboating, nothing glamorous about him. But he works hard, gives his all in every game and is one the best passers of the ball. In my book, this unsung hero is one of the best holding midfielders in the world.<br><br>But Rafael Benitez knows that to give him a regular place in the first XI would mean that younger, up and coming players like Sissoko might have to be sidelined. Hamann is 33, and no doubt age has caught up with him. I am positive Benitez recognizes him as one of the best players in the squad but alas for the future of the squad, he knows he cannot rely on Hamann for even the short-term future and therefore has to shift the spotlight on fresh young talent to take over the holding roles.<br><br>Whether he stays for another year  or keaves for another club during the transfer opening,  I'm not too sure. He knows in his heart that he has to make way for young blood.<br><br>Cheers to one of my favourite players in the English Premier League.</div>

That explains alot of respect and trust between himself and Super G. He can simply bo chap Super G and 'allow' him to go.<br><br>Besides Super G, I say Alonso is the next impressive signing. Sissoko is very very near but Alonso beats him in the consistency dept. he plays deep, passes hellava accuracy and range, allowing Super G to comes into the attacking third.</div>
