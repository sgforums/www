            <div class='col-md body'>i think this is a bad appointment. the board could have done so much more in getting a better manager. hitzfield would be better. cuper is also available. but it's all too late i guess.<br><br>heard that souness is the guy who destroyed pool in the early 90s. is that right? he's never managed a successful side, except for rangers (and scottish league only consists of 2 teams basically). imo, this is a mistake. but it could be a way to get rid of primadonnas eg. dyer, bramble, robert etc. hopefully it turns out well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believed many of the Newcastle fans are just as bewildered as Neutral fans when it was announced that G. Souness is appoointed as manager.<br><br>Newcastle does has a pool of exciting talents of old guards and youngsters and their attcking football has been exciting at times but not defensively strong. Perhaps Souness will address that issue right away and with his defensive background in his palying days while with The Kop... the back should tighten up.<br><br>But what's with Newcastle's decision to bring him in? Surely, they could have choose a more established manager who can bring them to Europe and archieve great success in EPL. It's a decision that look hastliy made.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm afraid for the worst. call me pessimist if you would, but to me, souness is nothing but a has been. ok he did win trophies with pool when he was a player. hell.. even ruud gullit was european player of the year. that doesnt guarantee any success being a manager now does it. i've won trophies for badminton. can i coach? no! i can teach people how to play, but i myself have to admit that i cant coach a badminton player, nvm a team.<br><br>in fact, i think some of the best managers are only so-so players during their playing days. check out fergie, mourinho. i dont think wenger played soccer professionally since he was a professor. i dont know what fat fred (the chairman) is thinking. but obviously he's a shallow minded guy. i know bruce was protected by the brum board and o'leary by villans. but c'mon. the club doesnt need a person who can be brought over easily. what next? howard wilkinson as asst manager? apparently fat fred only looks for the easy way out. there are good managers that are available out there. i think i'd even take venables over souness.<br><br>anyway i'd expect dyer to be on his way out, along with other moaners eg. robert. may be we'll have a training bust-up or two plus a couple of player roasting in front of the public/press. damn, the season's gonna be an interesting one.</div>
