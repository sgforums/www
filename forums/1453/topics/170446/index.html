'Whoever makes the decisions to play the games as close together as they are obviously does not understand football.<br><br>'After the first game, you are risking everything.<br><br>'Muscle injuries occur when muscles are tired, so you are going into the second on a wing and a prayer and then you get beyond the second one, you are in the hands of the gods with injuries because we will, like everybody else, suffer injuries over this period.<br><br>'Who decides to play these games? If this is the best they could come up with, I suggest they go into another job, because this is not conducive to good football being played or the well-being of the players.<br><br>'People pay good money to watch football, they buy season tickets, they buy hospitality - whatever the ticket costs, it's a fortune to them - and they are not seeing their players perform to their best levels because too much is being asked of them.<br><br>'They will be trying to say it's the way Christmas has fallen or New Year has fallen, but there must be something better than all these games all at once.'<br><br>Souness, who has previously complained about the number of international friendly games for which he is required to release players, is finally starting to see good news on the injury front.<br><br>The Scot has been able to name five of the men missing in recent weeks - Celestine Babayaro, Stephen Carr, Steven Taylor, Emre and Charles N'Zogbia - in his squad for the trip to Anfield.<br><br>Although with his side having won their last two games against Arsenal and West Ham, Souness may resist the temptation to rush too many of them back too soon.<br><br>With Scott Parker suspended after reaching five yellow cards, Emre could be pressed into service, while Babayaro could take over from Robbie Elliott at left-back.<br><br>Central defender Taylor has been training after an initial setback in his recovery from a dislocated shoulder, although further damage could mean surgery which will sideline him for up to 10 weeks.<br><br>Meanwhile, Souness moved to add his own dismissal to suggestions that Â£9.5million winger Albert Luque could be on his way out of Newcastle after just four months.<br><br>Real Madrid and Barcelona have reportedly expressed an interest in taking the former Deportivo La Coruna player back to his native Spain.<br><br>A torn hamstring has limited Luque to just four appearances this season, but following chairman Freddy Shepherd's insistence that he is going nowhere, Souness added his view.<br><br>He said: 'Someone has taken a flier on a story and as far as I'm concerned, it's a load of nonsense.' </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 games in 8 days is definitely a lot to ask from the players. I think apart from Chelsea, most clubs will struggle to put out fresh players by the time they play their 3rd game!<br><br>I think it's too much and they should revise the scheduling. Why not start the league earlier by a week? or end it later by a week? or divide the 4 games into 2 parts, eg. 2 "2 games over 4 days" kind of fixtures? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for Liverpool struggling over the festive season as mentioned by Poolman, I think they are going to find it very difficult this time round too. Newcastle, Everton, WBA, Bolton and Tottenham. LFC are going to be pushed to their limits.</div>
