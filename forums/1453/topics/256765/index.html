            <div class='col-md body'>Gerrard backs Rafa revolution<br><br>Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard has backed Rafa Benitez's plans to overhaul the current Reds squad.<br><br>Even before their UEFA Champions League final defeat to Milan - Benitez had decided major surgery on his team was needed.<br><br>Only a handful of players that started in Athens on Wednesday could remain next season and Gerrard, who is set to sign a new long-term contract at the club, insists a major overhaul is required.<br><br>"You have to look at how we have performed in the league over the last couple of years and it's just not been good enough," said Gerrard in the People.<br><br>"We haven't been able to match Chelsea or United over a season and that's disappointing for a club like Liverpool.<br><br>"You can't get away from the fact that changes need to be made - things need to happen for us to go to the next stage of competing with Chelsea and Manchester United for the league.<br><br>"Winning the league next season has to be a priority for me, the manager, the players and the newpeople in charge. It has been a long time since this club won it and we have to give it a better go.<br><br>"The way to do that is to sign world-class players and now the takeover has been sorted we hope to see that happen.<br><br>"I know Rafa is having meetings with them all the time and he is telling them what he wants.<br><br>"Since the takeover happened you can feel the optimism, you can feel the fans' excitement and the players and staff are no different - we are all looking forward to the future with great optimism but we need to see things happening.<br><br>"There will definitely be changes. The future is still really bright here. It has been well documented that the people in charge are going to strengthen the team and they will build the club and take it to the next level which, as a player, is a really exciting prospect.<br><br>"This team will be strengthened because I'm sure, like me, the manager doesn't want to go through the disappointment of reaching a Champions League Final and losing again.<br><br>"The Champions League Final is one of the biggest games you can play in, so I'm heartbroken. But I have to move on quickly.<br><br>"It's going to be difficult for a while but we have a vital England international coming up, so I have to try to pick myself up and get it out of my system.<br><br>"At the moment it's difficult to describe how bad I'm feeling.<br><br>"You have to look forward to the next game and, luckily for me, that's Friday with England against Brazil followed by the game in Estonia.<br><br>"That's a Euro 2008 qualifier which we must win and that will help take the focus off losing in Athens.<br><br>"But I'm not kidding myself - I know that losing to Milan will hurt me for a long time.<br><br>"But as captain of this club, I know we'll be back. I know I will lift many trophies.<br><br>"It's now going to be down to the experienced boys, not just me, to get this out of our systems.<br><br>"We have to bounce back next season, improve domestically and give the European Cup another really good crack."<br></div>
