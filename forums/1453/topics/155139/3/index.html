            <div class='col-md body'>No one is brazil...So attack and defend like a team..You want to attack Chelsea you leave spaces behind get ready for a counter attack from the wingers..We squeeze the midfield forcing you to go wide,meaning moving your wing backs up and when you do that..Chelsea wingers ill get behind you and start running.. Look all the goal today came from the wings..What does this tells you?That Liverpool did try to attack leaving spaces behind playing right into the plan of jose..Analyze dudes.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>somtimes it's also whether u have the ability to attack or not... I can now confirm liverpool is one of the luckiest team in history... their european championship is won with much luck on their side..... even though I was rooting for liverpool last night... it's quite obvious they never had the side that can hold chelsea down... so sad...</div>
