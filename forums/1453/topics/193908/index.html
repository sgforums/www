            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to the post about Peter Crouch being hopeless..<br><br>[sarcasm]<br><br>Mhm yes. I can see how a centre forward is a gone case because he cannot live without the support of his fellow team mates. Football is obviously a one-man game. Feck the team. Surely every striker from Noh Alam Shah to Peter Crouch must be expected to do a Maradonna and dribble past half the opposing team before scoring. They hence must be labelled as sh!t if they fail to score a hat-trick in such a manner.<br><br>[/sarcasm]<br><br>His horrific dancing aside, I feel Peter Crouch is undeserving of his label as a non-scoring striker. He will never be able to convince everybody of his physical appearance - he doesn't really strike terror like a Raul or a Shevchenko with his lanky frame and horselike-face. But he has put in fantastic performances for Liverpool with his seamless link-up play and who can forget that goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup? The one that broke that 85 year old jinx and helped us on our way to the final. He has also scored against the likes of Argentina and I am sure no one can argue he played brilliantly for the two warm-up friendlies. He has a surprisingly good touch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The furthest they can reach is semi, when they are a goal or two behind they like chicken running without head. That's where the captain play a big role.<br>In recent WC, they never came back from a goal down. This time is still the same cos they still meet Brazil in the semi and brazil is a team can turn the game around. I only feel that England striker is abit lack as compare to Brazil unless the can out run their Midfield which is less likely provided they field five men and one striker up front.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beckham is hands down the best dead-ball specialist and you can see that most of his crosses are textbook perfect and comes right out of the training ground. A pity that Michael Owen does not really have the height to meet those balls.<br><br>However, though pretty much everyone acknowledges Beckham's work rate and stamina, many do not believe he will be the man to drag England up should they encouter rough sailing ; trailing a good team like the Portugese  or Brazil and etcetera. Yes, this man is not Steven Gerrard for Liverpool. But please do not forget that it was Beckham's late free kick against Greece during the 02 WC Qualifiers that ensured their place in that tournament.<br><br>Jamaica played shittier than the Singapore Lions (and that's saying alot) last night. But still, it's clear that many of the England players are around their peak at this point of their lives, and let us England fans hope they carry this form into Germany come Monday. Pretty much everyone in the first XI played well and I would say my lingering concern lies in Michael Owen whose sharpness has been lacklustre simply from a lack of game time. But he too is getting better.<br><br>The England starting XI is a brilliant team on paper, consisting many  of the world's finest. However, it's true when you look beyond the first eleven there isn't much strength in depth unlike the Dutch and the Brazilians, with the exception of their back four. Therefore, it is crucial that throughout the duration of the World Cup they do not fall prey to injury or it is pretty much game over. I don't buy into the shit that Walcott will be England's saviour should they be trailing a fellow world power with no Owen or Rooney.</div>

How well he can be depand on how much experiance he gain from this world cup. Everybody know Owen and Rooney well enough, they will be the man to mark.<br>If they cannot find the way through the defence you need someone like Joe or Aaron to cut through their defence. Every world cup will create an unknown to be a super star, those who are already a big name normally find it difficult to make it through cos they already study how you play and what you can do. Hopefully this round will be Aaron and Theo chance to shine.</div>
