            <div class='col-md body'>Wigan boss Paul Jewell faces a selection <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crisis</span> that could lead to a surprise line-up for tomorrow's JJB Stadium clash with Liverpool.<br><br><span style="color: red;">If Henri Camara fails to return from the African Nations Cup in time for the lunchtime showdown, it will leave the Latics without an out-and-out striker. </span><br><br>To add to Jewell's woes, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jason Roberts is suspended, David Connolly and Lee McCulloch are injured, while on-loan Neil Mellor cannot play against his current employers. </span><br><br>It means versatile Swede Andreas Johansson seemingly playing on his own in attack, even though Jewell is reluctant to play a 4-5-1 formation.<br><br>The 41-year-old did so in last week's 1-1 draw at Bolton, but as he concedes, it was a case of 'needs must' and he appreciates it is not a system that suits his players.<br><br>Jewell has hinted at a trick up his sleeve, which could lead to Paul Scharner or Damien Francis playing behind Johansson, especially the latter as it is a role he occasionally carried out with success at Norwich.<br><br>'We're up against it, but we've worked on things this week and the players will be well briefed,' commented Jewell.<br><br>'We're certainly not going to feel sorry for ourselves. We will have 11 players out there who will be committed, and we will see what we get out of the game.<br><br>'But we need everybody fit and available because we've injuries and a couple of suspensions.'<br><br>Even if Camara does return in time, it will then be a question of his physical condition after playing the closing 21 minutes of Senegal's third/fourth place play-off defeat to Nigeria yesterday.<br><br>Jewell concedes there are plans in place to ensure he returns, but he also appreciates they may not go to plan.<br><br>'We just want him back asap,' insisted Jewell. 'If we can get him back so he can play some part or be in the squad against Liverpool, then we will endeavour to do that.<br><br>'We will try and pull out all the stops, but I don't want to build up my hopes too much.<br><br>'We've had difficulties just trying to get hold of him, with someone from the club having spoken to his uncle.<br><br>'There's been talk of them returning to Senegal for a big reception, so I don't know what's happening.<br><br>'I know Henri wants to get back quickly, but it's quite political with the Senegalese, and we don't want to jeopardise his future with them.'<br><br>There had been a suggestion the Barclays Premiership players would be pulled out of yesterday's game in order to return to their clubs.<br><br>But Jewell added: 'I don't think that would have gone down too well with Senegal because they take their national team very seriously, and quite rightly so.<br><br>'But we've a plan of action. The club have him booked on flights to try and get him back, so we are hoping all goes well and he will be with us before tomorrow.'<br><br>Jewell has another dilemma as right-back Pascal Chimbonda is due to miss his first Barclays Premiership game of the season in serving a one-match suspension for collecting five yellow cards.</div>
