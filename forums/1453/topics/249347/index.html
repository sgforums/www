            <div class='col-md body'>Cisse remains in the dark over his future<br><br>Djibril Cisse admits there has been no dialogue between Liverpool and Marseille about where he will be playing next season.<br><br>The France international is on loan at Marseille from Liverpool until the end of the season, and the club have an option of buying the striker this summer.<br><br>But his form has been patchy and he has recently been dropped to the bench by coach Albert Emon.<br><br>Cisse has also had to endure whistles from both the Marseille and France national-team crowds in recent months.<br><br>He admits he is in the dark about his future.<br><br>'It is necessary that the three parties - Liverpool, OM and myself - get together,' he said.<br><br>'Nothing has been scheduled for this. Therefore the question has not arisen. There is a date, May 15, by which the purchase option is closed but there is still no discussion on this subject.<br><br>'I saw on Sunday that people were sending me to New York. The other day, it was an English club. It is really a bit early to be going to New York.'<br><br>Cisse claims he has been affected by the reaction of the Marseille crowd, who appear to be disappointed at his lack of goals this season.<br><br>Since returning in December from a broken leg, which he suffered just prior to the start of last year's World Cup, he has scored only four league goals.<br><br>But he is not ruling out staying at Marseille, adding: 'It depends on the coming days, and what happens.<br><br>'It is obvious that being whistled at in all the matches is not what I expected and what I want to live with. But if that is sorted out, why not?<br><br>'Whistles or not, I do not care about that. There are seven matches left and then another season starts. You can judge me on a full season.'<br><br>The former Auxerre striker added in L'Equipe: 'I have had six months out - you need the same time, maybe a little more, to rediscover your level.<br><br>'I am not Superman. I cannot find my level in three months.<br><br>'The whistling hurt me, and they hurt my family. Over in England, the supporters are so different - they get behind you even more when things are not going well.'<br></div>
