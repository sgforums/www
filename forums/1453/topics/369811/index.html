            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>More than 1,000 turn up to get a glimpse of the Liverpool hero<br></strong><br>THE Greeks had Zeus, the Romans Jupiter, Liverpool have Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres.<br><br>While club captain Gerrard has spent his entire career at the club, young Torres from Madrid has crossed into the realm of godhood among the club's fanatical fans.<br><br>It is not just those in England and Spain who worship the Spanish forward.<br><br>At yesterday's autograph signing session at Velocity @ Novena Square, more than 1,000 fans turned up decked in the famous red to pay homage to Torres and cheer Jamie Carragher.<br><br>Anfield's newest No 9 has taken Merseyside by storm, his 24 goals in the league (33 in all competitions) for Liverpool in his debut season in 2007/08 making him the first player since Robbie Fowler to score more than 20 in a season.<br><br>The fans who packed Novena Square belted out Liverpool anthems of praise for Torres and Carragher as their chariot for the day, a black Mercedes Vito, turned in off the road and onto the promenade in front of the mall.<br><br>It was clearly Torres that everyone wanted to see. Even when the emcee called for a louder rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone, all the crowd would do was chant "Torres, Torres".<br><br>The flash bulbs from the countless digital cameras hardly dimmed as the two players walked on stage.<br><br>The emcee gushed, "A perfect striker does exist at Liverpool. It's you."<br><br>Torres raised a roar, and endeared himself even more to the faithful when he responded: "No, no. There is no perfect striker. I have fantastic team-mates who provide the assists for me to score. I work for my team-mates, not myself."<br><br>The crowd loved it, breaking out in the Torres song that is sung so lustily at Anfield, Liverpool's No 9 must have felt loved.<br><br>The 25-year-old sat in the centre of the stage, with burly bald men in conspicuous black shades standing watch. He smiled as a lucky few were allowed to approach him.<br><br>He shook hands and spoke freely while signing autographs and taking pictures, he broke into the widest grin when one fan screamed a greeting in Spanish.<br><br>Two fans came bearing gifts. One offered up a pair of tiny pink shoes with the name Nora written on the soles, for Torres' new-born who came into the world on July 8, another presented a bodysuit to him, also for his girl.<br><br>Torres accepted them with a big smile.<br><br>Then, as suddenly as they came, Torres and Carragher were ushered away.<br><br>Carragher walked briskly to the vehicle, Torres smiled, waved and gave the thumbs up to his screaming legions.<br><br>"They're human beings," said the emcee.<br><br>Not to the fans, who clearly felt they were in the presence of a Liverpool god.</p></div>
