We talked about who we had in the squad and ideas for the future.<br><br>"They were nice people and good businessmen. That is a good mix, they can then do the right things for the club in terms of money and how we grow.<br><br>"It could be a problem of inflated fees now, but I am happy with my scouting department and we are doing a good job now without any big money.<br><br>"We have enough money to do business now and if we have more in the future it could be easier. If we have two players we like and one is more expensive, maybe now we can consider signing him.<br><br>"We are doing the right things now and maybe we will not need to spend big money in the summer."</div>

Maybe Rafa's standard is too high. But still, I hope to see the next best thing coming from Rafa soon.<br><br>It's just like playing FM.
