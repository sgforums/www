            <div class='col-md body'>Source : Goal.com USA senior editor Andrew Giffen<br><br>Americans Krafting A Liverpool Takeover?<br>9/15/2005 5:54:00 PM<br>"First it was American tycoon Malcolm Glazer treading on fans' wishes and strong-arming his way to control of Manchester United, but now it appears Liverpool could be the next to crumble.<br>Reports out of England's Daily Mail indicate the Kraft family is on the verge of investing in the defending European Champions--as much as a 30% stake to start.<br><br>The Krafts are the investor/operators of Major League Soccer's New England Revolution, who currently carry the best record in MLS. The Kraft family also acted as investor/operators for the San Jose Earthquakes from 1998-2001.<br><br>But the Krafts are best known as owners of the NFL's New England Patriots, winners of three of the past four Super Bowls. Both the football and gridiron teams play at state-of-the-art Gillette Stadium, the $325 million development and construction of which the Krafts oversaw.<br><br>A move by the Krafts would come on the heels of Manchester United's May takeover by Malcolm Glazer, who owns the NFL Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the 2001 Super Bowl Champions, although it is unclear how the Krafts would finance a possible takeover bid.<br><br>The Kraft family's patriarch, Robert Kraft, was instrumental in helping the Boston/Foxboro area become one of nine host cities for the 1994 World Cup in the United States. In addition Kraft carries a glowing reputation for his community involvement, something the reclusive Glazer is not known for.<br><br>But the Krafts may face competition from Thai media tycoon Paiboon Damrongchaitham, chariman of ThailandÂ’s largest multimedia group GMM Grammy. Damrongchaitham is expecting to resume investment talks with Liverpool next month.<br><br>If the Glazer-United saga is any indication, however, expect fierce outcry from Reds supporters."<br><br>My view: Majority of the Reds supporters i've spoken to are actuallly quite excited by the news. First of all,  30% is not  take over.  Secondly, the Kraft family will provide the much needed cash injection as well as good marketing ideas and strategies to promote the Liverpool Brand which has gone stagnant over the years despite us winning the UEFA Cup in GH's era as well as the Champions League last year.<br><br>Any thoughts after reading the article?<br><br></div>

ManU was listed in UK but Liverpool FC was privately owned by a few major shareholders.<br><br>David Moores is the biggest shareholder of LFC right now and chairman of the board.  He holds more than 50% of the shares in LFC(not sure how much). ..therefore Liverpool belongs to him.<br><br>If the Kraft family really buys 30% of the shares in LFC, they will be just another major shareholder and probably can send some representatives to sit in the board of directors together with David Moores and the rest.<br><br>But in essence, Kraft's proposal to buy 30% of LFC's shares will not enable them to take over LFC (although after they get the 30% shares, they might tempt David Moores to sell more shares to them until they eventually owns more than 50%)<br><br>But a lot of Reds fans in UK are desperate for more investors who has good business acumen to come in... partly because LFC wants to build a new stadium, the project stalled because of the enormous amount involved.<br><br></div>
