              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafa Benitez spoke of his disappointment following the 1-1 draw with Lyon on Wednesday evening - but insisted Liverpool can still qualify for the Champions League knockout stage.</span></strong></p>
              <p><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/babel/"><span style="color: #000000;">Ryan Babel</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> fired the Reds into an 83rd minute lead at the Stade Gerland, but Lisandro Lopez struck an equaliser for Les Gones with just seconds of normal time remaining. <br>  <br>In order to progress into the last 16, Liverpool must now beat both Debrecen and Fiorentina, and hope the Italians drop points at home to Lyon next time out. <br>  <br>"We are really disappointed because it was a great opportunity for us," Benitez told his post-match press conference in France. <br>  <br>"We had some chances, but again it was a late goal against Lyon that made a massive difference. <br>  <br>"Clearly it is difficult for us to qualify, but not impossible. We have to win our game and see what happens in the game with Fiorentina and Lyon. Then we will approach the last game. <br>  <br>"We have a chance and the main thing is to play well against Debrecen and then see what the situation is for our last match." <br>  <br>Benitez dismissed claims Lyon's equaliser came as a result of Liverpool pushing forward in search of a second goal. <br>  <br>"If you analyse the goal we conceded, we had a lot of players in position and we were not in a bad position," he said. <br>  <br>"We made a mistake, but not because we were too high or trying to attack. We were trying to control the game, but we couldn't. <br>  <br>"But football is like this - sometimes you need luck, and we didn't have it in the end." <br>  <br>The boss admitted he was pleased with the spirited performance of his players, in spite of the current injury situation at Anfield. <br>  <br>And Benitez revealed the Reds could welcome back </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/skrtel/"><span style="color: #000000;">Martin Skrtel</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> for Monday's home clash with Birmingham City. <br>  <br>"I think we had too many problems before the game, so I am quite pleased with the performance of the players," he said. <br>  <br>"We had many players in different positions, and they did well. <br>  <br>"I think it will be good to analyse the performance of the team. The players will see we were working very hard and had many chances and that is positive. <br>  <br>"The players know if they work as hard as tonight they will win matches. <br>  <br>"Hopefully we will have Skrtel available for the next game and we can manage things in a different way." <br>  <br>Quizzed about the fitness of </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, who played for 87 minutes in the South of France, Benitez replied: "I think he was okay. When he is playing with pain it is not easy. <br>  <br>"He was inconsistent because he was having to stop and start again, but we have some time and we will be working with him."</span></p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez today warned his players of the danger in losing focus as they head to Hungary knowing results elsewhere could decide their Champions League fate.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds flew out to Hungary, aware that any hope of Group E qualification depends on the scoreline in Italy between Fiorentina and Lyon. <br>  <br>If Fiorentina win, Liverpool are out regardless of their result against Debrecen. <br>  <br>Asked if he would be following events in Italy, Benitez said: "The message has to be to just concentrate on our game. We will know, maybe we'll have some information, but we have to focus on our job. <br>  <br>"A lot depends on Fiorentina and Lyon, but the main thing for us is to concentrate on our game and see what happens. <br>  <br>"We have to prepare our game because we don't have any influence over the other one. If we can do our job and win, we'll see. <br>  <br>"I think we can do it. We have some players coming back from injury, so hopefully with a bit of luck we can progress. <br>  <br>"It's football, so you never know. We'll see if we can keep going in the Champions League."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafa Benitez is confident both </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/johnson/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/agger/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Daniel Agger</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> can play key roles for Liverpool in Debrecen despite injury concerns over the weekend.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Johnson was set to play against Man City on Saturday until tests on the morning of the game revealed he was not 100 per cent. <br>  <br>Agger did start but departed on a stretcher following a clash of heads which left him needing five stitches. <br>  <br>Both are in the 18-man squad for Tuesday's Group E clash, and Benitez told his pre-match press conference: "If we decided to bring them here it's because we think they can play. We will train (on Monday night) and then we'll see. <br>  <br>"You know that for us it's important now to have players coming back from injury. You talk sometimes about players being available but not ready, but at least if they are training we have more options." <br>  <br>Another player present and correct on the plane to Hungary was </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> following a groin problem. <br>  <br>He played his first full 90 minutes since October 4 on Saturday and Benitez is hopeful any injury troubles are now behind the England man. <br>  <br>"He was tired the other day but it was a difficult game," said the boss. <br>  <br>"When you are more or less three weeks without training with the team, to play 90 minutes is not easy. He was a little bit tired but I think he will be okay for Tuesday." <br>  <br>On when Liverpool fans can expect to see </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> in action again, Benitez added: "He is improving. We were talking before about three weeks. He still needs time but he's working with the fitness coach and physios every day. We cannot put a deadline on it but he's doing well." <br>  <br>Journalists from around the world were present as Benitez gave his pre-match thoughts. An Italian reporter wanted to know if summer signing </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/aquilani/"><span style="color: #000000;">Alberto Aquilani</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> would feature in Hungary. <br>  <br>The gaffer said: "Aquilani is in the squad so he can play. It depends. The team has some players in his position now - Gerrard coming back and the two midfielders (Lucas and Mascherano) doing well, but he'll have his chances. <br>  <br>"We want him as soon as possible but we have to manage with the squad." <br>  <br>The Hungarian press pack were also out in force, with one journalist asking why their young goalkeeping hope </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gulacsi/"><span style="color: #000000;">Peter Gulacsi</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> was not in the squad. <br>  <br>Benitez said: "We are really pleased with him. He's a fantastic keeper and a really good lad.

              <p>ok, so the reds are out. ~sigh~</p>
              <p>i think this season is a write off, given our league position, unless something miraculous happens.</p>
              <p>my take is rafa's penultimate season will be next season, if he cannot sustain a challenge in the major competition next year, he will be out. i know many will call for his head to roll this season, but poolman is correct, there are too many injuries, amongst others that prevented rafa from fielding his strongest team.</p>
              <p>well, shit happens...so we can only look forward.</p>
              <p><em>btw, i watched the barca - milan match on telly. barca is a class act. sleek passing and their 2nd goal is superbly set-up.</em> </p>
