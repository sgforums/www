              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafael Benitez is hopeful </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/mascherano/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> will be fit for next weekend's showdown with Chelsea after the midfielder was ruled out of Tuesday's Champions League clash in Florence with a hamstring injury.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Spaniard revealed that the Argentina skipper missed this morning's flight to Tuscany as a result of a problem he picked up during a recent training session, but is confident the Reds have the personnel available to cope against La Viola. <br>  <br>"He was shooting in training and felt something in his hamstring," Benitez told his pre-match press conference. "He went to see the doctor straight away and we found he had a small problem in his hamstring. <br>  <br>"It could be two or three days, but we are not sure. <br>  <br>"It is not a problem because I think we can manage with Stevie or another player. To lose a player like Javier is not good. But we will find solutions, whether it is with Gerrard or someone else." <br>  <br>Ahead of the clash Fiorentina coach Cesare Prandelli has heaped praise on Benitez, describing him as a 'role model'. <br>  <br>The Reds boss admits he is flattered by such comments and was eager to repay the compliment. <br>  <br>"First of all, I'd like to say thank you to Mr Prandelli. <br>  <br>"He has done a very good job. I was watching some games and they have been doing very well. They are well organised and know what to do; how to attack and defend. <br>  <br>"They are in a good position now, but I think they can do better. To be in the Champions League is a big success for them and hopefully it will be the same this year." <br>  <br>Asked about </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">' current form and whether he is the best striker in the world, Benitez said: "I think Fernando is a very good striker and he is scoring goals now. He is on fire. <br>  <br>"But the Champions League is different to the Premier League, so we will see. He is one of our key players and hopefully he will be one of our key players tomorrow night. <br>  <br>He added: "He is a great striker but when we talk about all these great strikers like Ibrahimovic and Eto'o it depends on the weekend, because one week, one is in form and two weeks later it is someone else. <br>  <br>"I just think they are all great strikers." <br>  <br>Torres' hot-streak has been a major factor in Liverpool's recent winning run. <br>  <br>Benitez has been pleased with his side's attacking threat of late and is confident they will soon complement that with a return to their defensive best. <br>  <br>"We are winning and creating chances, so when you are attacking and attacking, sometimes you have problems in defence," he said. "We need to find the balance and we will try to improve. <br>  <br>"We are good enough in attack but can improve in defence and that's something we will try to manage in the next two or three weeks and try to get more clean sheets."</span></p>

              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez admitted his side paid for their first-half mistakes after Stevan Jovetic's double condemned them to a 2-0 Champions League defeat in Florence.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds dominated the second period against the Italians but paid the price for a lacklustre opening 45 at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, leaving the boss frustrated by his side's start to the proceedings. <br>  <br>"It's true, we didn't play well," Benitez told his post-match press conference. "We had too many problems and made too many mistakes. <br>  <br>"We had to change everything in the second-half and then it was different, it was much better. <br>  <br>"In the first-half they were on top of us. We knew it would be difficult, they were doing well but we were doing everything badly. <br>  <br>"Fiorentina have done a very good job. They were pressing around the pitch and we were too nervous, making mistakes. If you make mistakes you pay for them." <br>  <br>Despite missing leading scorer Alberto Gilardino through suspension, Fiorentina looked impressive in the attacking third. <br>  <br>Asked if he was surprised by the ability of two-goal hero Jovetic, Benitez said: "No, we knew about him. <br>  <br>"We knew he was good. We watched some games and at this level you know the player. Jovetic was playing in the middle and doing well." <br>  <br>Having endured a disappointing first period, Liverpool stepped up a gear after the interval and were unlucky not reduce the arrears. <br>  <br>Benitez admits he was pleased with his side's second-half efforts and is confident they will bounce back. <br>  <br>"We were talking about our mistakes and how to improve," he said. "We tried to find solutions and wanted to channel things in a better way." <br>  <br>Asked if he thought his side could recover in time for Sunday's showdown at Chelsea, Benitez added: "I think so. I think it will be totally different. <br>  <br>"Hopefully you will see the Liverpool you saw in the second half and we will be better."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Two first half goals from Stevan Jovetic secured all three points for the home side, and even though the Reds improved after the break Carragher admits they can have no complaints with the final outcome. <br>  <br>"We never performed well enough and we know that," he said. "We were slightly better in the second half but it still wasn't good enough. <br>  <br>"Nothing went to plan really. It was a massive game for them and a massive game for us but they seemed to be more ready for it from the start. <br>  <br>"It's something we have to sort out but fortunately there are still four games to go in the Champions League so we have time to put things right." <br>  <br>Skipper </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> was also left baffled over Liverpool's first half display - a 45 minute period which Rafael Benitez has labelled his side's worst in European competition. <br>  <br>"We never turned up for the first half," admitted Gerrard. "There was a reaction after the break but at half time we deserved to be losing. <br>  <br>"We were second best all over the field and that was disappointing."</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafa Benitez has confirmed </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/gerrard/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> will be available for Tuesday's Champions League encounter with Lyon at Anfield - but </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> will not figure against the French side.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The duo sat out Saturday's Barclays Premier League defeat to Sunderland after</span> failing to recover from knocks sustained while on international duty. <br>  <br>However, Gerrard trained with his teammates at Melwood this morning and will be included in the squad for the clash with Les Gones. <br>  <br>The boss told a pre-match press conference at Anfield: "Steven is fit. He has been training so hopefully he will be available tomorrow. <br>  <br>"It is important as we have had some problems with injuries since the start of the season, so having Gerrard fit is a big boost for us." <br>  <br>Meanwhile, though Torres will sit out the fixture with Lyon, the boss is hopeful he'll be able to call on the services of the Reds' No.9 for Sunday's meeting with Manchester United. <br>  <br>Benitez added: "Torres is still not ready. Hopefully he will be for the weekend, but not for this game." <br>  <br>Having had several players pick up injuries while on international duty, the manager believes Liverpool's season has been disrupted by injury worries - but he is confident fans will see a much improved Reds side over the coming week as his squad returns to full fitness. <br>  <br>"The problem is that some of the players were not available in pre-season and afterwards at the start of the season," he said. <br>  <br>"I am happy with the squad and they are working very hard. We have some quality, but also some injuries so if everybody is fit, we have a good squad. <br>  <br>"The majority of the players are the same as last season. We had 86 points last year and I think we will be in a similar situation if we start playing well. <br>  <br>"Hopefully we can get everybody fit and we can start playing better and winning games." <br>  <br>The news of Gerrard's return comes as a boost to Liverpool as the Reds prepare for two important home fixtures with Lyon and Manchester United this week. <br>  <br>But Benitez believes his players cannot allow themselves to look beyond the meeting with Claude Puel's men. <br>  <br>He said: "Every game is an important game for us, so we cannot think about the second one. We want to win tomorrow and that's it. <br>  <br>"We have to play against Lyon and if we beat them, it will be a different situation on Wednesday. So we have to concentrate just on this game." <br>  <br>Lyon arrive at Anfield having suffered their first defeat of the season at home to Sochaux on Saturday. <br>  <br>However, the Ligue 1 side have been the dominant force in French football over the last decade and though they may not have been able to transfer that superiority to the European stage, Benitez is well aware they will be a difficult proposition for his charges. <br>  <br>"We know Lyon are a good team," said the Spaniard. "They have good players and experience in the Champions League, so it will be a tough game. <br>  <br>"We have had some scouts watching their games, so we know they are a very good team who are well organised. It will be tough game for us and if they progress in the competition, they will be tough for anyone. <br>  <br>"Again I will say, we are talking about a good team with quality and experience in the Champions League, and they will have extra motivation. Hopefully it will be extra motivation for our players too and an interesting game."</p>
