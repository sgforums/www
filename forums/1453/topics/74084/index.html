            <div class='col-md body'>GH have given Biscan a good reason why he should be playing in Midfield.<br><br>At least a free kick will be given when he try to pull his opponent's pants off.<br><br>GH have gladly show the Liverpool players what they cannot do in the past season.<br><br>Biscan - not a defender<br><br>Diouf - not a winger, like that how to be a serial killer<br><br>Kewell - cannot play on the right wing or middle, he have not master the playmaker role<br><br>Heskey - cannot play any where BUT for England<br><br>Owen - cannot gamble with taking penalty for the REDs. He is a good player but he need to move on to grow. Liverpool is holding him down as there is no competition.<br><br>Fowler - can not be GOD of Liverpool. He is getting his boots back in Man City, but he is waiting for his silly drunken way to get him into more trouble.<br><br>David James - should use his hand to tackle Playstation 2. what to say ? he make it to the England Team.<br><br>Arsene Wenger have brought out the hidden talents of his players,<br><br>GH have shown his players what the worst career option possible in football.</div>
