And he now believes there is once again a level playing field for him to fight for his place at Liverpool.<br><br>"It's clear when a new manager comes in, everyone's chances are equal again with others," Babel told the club's official website.<br><br>"It is positive for me and maybe everybody who was in a difficult situation.<br><br>"I hope this is a chance for me to establish myself, but the first test for me is to work hard in every training session and try to show what I can do. In the end, it is the manager's decision if he uses me or not.<br><br>"I am very confident and positive - I feel well and have been training well. Hopefully it is just a matter of time before I can get some confidence back to finally show everybody what I can do."<br><br>Babel is also looking forward to playing through the middle as a striker more frequently than he did whilst Rafael Benitez was in charge at Anfield.<br><br>"The manager has told me he would like to use me up front more than normal, so hopefully that will give me enough chance to show how much I like that position," he said.<br><br>"I was very pleased to hear this. I have always said my ambition was to play in that position, but at the same time I am very realistic.<br><br>"Fernando is very important for the club and he will always be our No.9, but you know you can also be very important for the club too if you are used well.<br><br>"It will be a long season and we will need every player. Hopefully I can give the confidence and the trust back to the club that they have shown in me.<br><br>"The only thing you ask for as a player is for a fair chance, then you know what you can do.<br><br>"There are different opinions about what a fair chance is. Some people will say one game or 15 minutes is a fair chance, but I think every player needs a couple of games in a row to get used to the players and the pace of the game to adapt and show what they can do. That is the same for me."<br><br>Babel has clearly been impressed with Hodgson since the Englishman's arrival from Fulham, and feels that there is a new spirit of optimisim present at the club.<br><br>"It's going very well. It's been great working with the new manager and staff. There are also some new players who have come in and the mood within group is wonderful," he explained.<br><br>"I think the way of playing has been changed a little bit and the new manager has a bit of a different vision to the former manager.<br><br>"I think that is maybe what Liverpool needed - a different change. It's very positive.<br><br>"I am very excited. Like I said, a lot has changed since the new manager has come in. We have new physios, new staff and new players - everything is new. <br><br>"We've also changed some rules and I think it is working positively for the group."</span><br></span></div>
