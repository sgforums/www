              <p>Liverpool owner John W Henry has hinted that he is unlikely to splash the cash in the January transfer window, indicating instead that the squad will be rebuilt at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/1115/damiencomolliandjohnwhenry20101115_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Damien Comolli and John W henry" width="275" height="155"></div>
              <p>Henry challenged Liverpool's existing players and manager Roy Hodgson to make the most of what they have for now, pointing to the club's 2-0 win over Premier League leaders Chelsea as evidence of what is possible if everyone pulls in the same direction.</p>
              <p>But he also called for patience from fans, particularly when judging Hodgson and his team, claiming it will take time to return Liverpool to the top of English football.</p>
              <p>Speaking to fan website <em>Red and White Kop</em>, New England Sports Ventures figurehead Henry said: "The club has gone through a very difficult period and the period has not ended. We saw a certain team on the field against Chelsea last week that showed what they can do. We also know how competitive the EPL is this year. There are no guaranteed matches any longer for any club. This club can be better. Blaming the manager or any one particular player is simply wrong. This club needs to play up to their potential every match. If they don't, they won't win.</p>
              <p>"That said, we have work to do and must invest in this club to improve it on the field. Can that be successfully done in January? A number of people I've talked with doubt it. Most people seem to think it will be the summer before we can really begin to improve. So the players - all 11 each week - have to be on the same page every match and have to live up to the history and respect this club has engendered - no matter what."</p>
              <p>Henry explained that he has moved to appease concerns from players that the club can no longer match their ambitions.</p>
              <p>He said: "I've been greatly impressed by them personally. They are all exceptionally bright and they all want to be here. The question they have had, rightfully so, is whether or not the club is going to go in the right direction. They all want to see that. I have been very forthright about our philosophy and about what we are going to try to achieve. Some would prefer a quick fix. Others prefer to focus on the long-term and that is very difficult for most players."</p>
              <p>Henry said he is expecting Damien Comolli, the club's first director of football strategy, to help the club's long-term prospects through improved output from the club's academy.</p>
              <p>"We need 'top four' young players," Henry said. "They will not produce a quick fix but our philosophy in football will be based on the long-term. That is what has made Arsenal and Manchester United so strong. They understand something we understand in Boston - to be consistently strong on the field you must have a consistent flow of young talent that has been nurtured and developed the right way. We will focus on that. That is also the philosophy of Damien Comolli."</p>
