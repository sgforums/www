              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Why lie? Rafael Benitez has plunged his 
              Liverpool future into doubt with claims about the club's transfer policy</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool
               manager Rafa Benitez has opened the door to an Anfield farewell by 
              accusing the club of breaking promises over new signings when he signed a
               five-year contract last summer.</p>
              <p>Benitez, who is being 
              actively pursued by Italian giants Juventus, effectively put himself on 
              the market by drawing comparisons between his current situation at 
              Liverpool and when he walked out on Valencia in 2004 after he and the 
              Spanish club clashed over control of transfers.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard 
              will lead out his Liverpool team for their final home game against 
              Chelsea on Sunday knowing that a victory could help bitter rivals 
              Manchester United overtake their own record of 18 league titles.</p>
              <p>But
               it is his own future that dominates the build-up to the match from 
              Liverpool’s point of view, following Thursday’s dismal Europa League 
              exit against Atletico Madrid.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: ‘I decided to 
              sign an extension because the squad was good and the money was going to 
              be there. But the conditions changed.</p>
              <p>‘We’ve had a bad season
               and hopefully things will be different in the future, but at the moment
               I can’t talk about the future because I don’t know what’s going on.</p>
              <p>‘I
               left Valencia (for Liverpool in 2004) because conditions changed. It 
              was not a question of my money that I stayed at Liverpool. I said No to 
              other massive offers. I decided to stay under certain conditions and 
              they have changed.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Down and out: Dirk Kuyt sums up Liverpool's 
              season as he collapses to the Anfield turf</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>‘The players share the same frustrations. I know how they feel 
              because I’ve been talking to them all season. The season has not been 
              good, that is clear. We know why and what has to change.’</p>
              <p>Benitez’s
               stance has exasperated Liverpool, who insist his job is safe despite a 
              fourth season in a row without a trophy, and that has encouraged 
              Juventus who want to take him to Turin.</p>
              <p>But with Liverpool 
              certain to demand compensation and the manager himself not sure about 
              taking Juve’s offer, the matter may not be resolved as quickly as the 
              Italians would like. </p>
