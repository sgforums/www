            <div class='col-md body'>Dudek desperate to leave Liverpool<br><br>Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek wants to leave Liverpool 'at whatever cost', insists he will not play another game for the club and has accused manager Rafael Benitez of talking 'rubbish'.<br><br>The 32-year-old was a hero for the Anfield club in last season's Champions League final against AC Milan, playing a key role in the penalty shoot-out as Liverpool lifted the trophy for the fifth time.<br><br>But he has since fallen behind both Jose Reina and Scott Carson in the Anfield pecking order, and wants first team football to protect his place in the Poland team for this summer's World Cup finals in Germany.<br><br>'My time at Liverpool has reached its end. Nothing can change that,' Dudek told The Sun.<br><br>The Pole believes Liverpool want Â£3million for him, but said: 'If someone buys me for Â£3million, Liverpool will have pulled off the transfer deal of the year. I am 33 in March. I have no idea how they came to such an absurd figure.<br><br>'It's the latest lot of rubbish from Benitez. Even if he wants to play me in a Liverpool match, I don't want to play for this club any more.<br><br>'I can't see any point talking further with Benitez. It's a waste of time. I have decided to leave Liverpool at whatever cost and I won't change my mind. Benitez just makes the frustration deeper.<br><br>'I didn't go to play against Luton in the FA Cup last Saturday especially to make it clear to Benitez I am not interested in being the club's second-choice keeper.<br><br>'Why doesn't he behave like a decent person for once in his life and start treating me in a proper way, like I always have him?'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I kind of sad to see him said not wanting to play for Liverpool.<br><br>I know he needs play time in order to make it for WC2006 but what to do.... Ah Ben puts him last in the order even after Carson.<br><br>I do hope he can get a good club and continue to perform for the new club.<br><br>Thank you Dudek for giving us the Champion League medal. Thank you.</div>
