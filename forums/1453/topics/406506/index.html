              <h1>Fernando Torres is staying at Liverpool, insists Roy Hodgson, but

              <p>Javier Mascherano wants to leave Liverpool, the club's manager Roy Hodgson has 
              confirmed.  </p>
              <p>Hodgson has been speaking to the Reds' key figures 
              since taking over from Rafael Benitez at Anfield and while captain 
              Steven Gerrard has indicated he wants to stay, Argentina skipper 
              Mascherano is keen to move on, with reports linking him with a reunion 
              with Benitez at Inter Milan.  </p>
              <p>Hodgson has had more positive news
               from Spain striker Fernando Torres, who has confirmed his intention to 
              return to the club on Monday and to remain at Anfield.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/27/article-1298055-090E863F000005DC-981_468x263.jpg" alt="Relief: Liverpool fans will be delighted with the news star 
              striker Torres is to stay" width="468" height="263">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Relief: Liverpool fans will be delighted with 
              the news star striker Torres is to stay</em></p>
              <p>'Yes, he wants to leave the club,' confirmed Hodgson when asked about
               Mascherano. 'He has made that perfectly clear. I think he wanted to 
              leave a year go.</p>
              <p>'He wants to leave now but he is contracted
               to Liverpool so whether he leaves or not will be our decision.'</p>
              <p>Recent speculation suggested Torres was keen to play Champions League
               football this season and was considering his options. </p>
              <p>Hodgson 
              said that was not the message the club had received from
              the Spain striker. 'As far as I know he is looking forward to coming
              back here; he is back on Monday,' said the Englishman. 'He is enjoying
              a holiday - a well-deserved break as he has not had one for three
              years.  </p>

              Hodgson he wants to leave</em></p>
              <p>'He is spending a lot of time with his family, keeping a low profile
              and as far as I know he is not really speaking to anyone.</p>
              <p>'But he has told us that he is looking forward to Monday, looking
              forward to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for
              Liverpool next season.</p>
              <p>'That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are 
              erroneous.'</p>
              <p>Sources in Italy have said that Inter Milan - managed by former 
              Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez - will formalise their interest in
              Mascherano and Anfield team-mate Dirk Kuyt once they have finalised a 
              £24million move out of the San Siro for Manchester City-bound Mario Balotelli.</p>
              <p>Benitez
               agreed not to sign his former players for three months when
              leaving Liverpool for Inter Milan this summer, but an exception is
              likely to be made for the unsettled Argentina captain.</p>
              <div style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Inter
               president Massimo Moratti hopes a bid of £25m would be enough to snare 
              Mascherano, who is already too expensive for Barcelona's liking.</p>
              <p>Holding
               on to Mascherano always looked unlikely after Hodgson failed
              to make contact with the Argentina captain several times since the
              World Cup.</p>
              <p>Mascherano had his differences with Benitez in
              the past but their relationship was far more amicable during the
              Spaniard's last year at the club and Inter offer him the chance to play
              Champions League football this season.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The move suits him
              from a lifestyle point of view too, with fellow Argentinians Javier
              Zanetti, Esteban Cambiasso and Diego Milito playing for Inter. That
              almost caused him to leave last summer before Benitez managed to
              persuade him to stay.</p>
              <p>City, Chelsea and Spanish giants Barcelona, have been 
              linked with moves for Torres ever since Liverpool ended last season in a
               disappointing seventh spot in the Barclays Premier League, and 
              relinquished their spot in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Eastlands boss 
              Roberto Mancini raised the prospect at the weekend of a bid for Torres, 
              who was said to be unhappy with life at Anfield.</p>
              <p>However, the 
              striker now appears to have followed fellow superstar Steven Gerrard in 
              committing his immediate future to the Reds.</p>

              <p>just my opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>masch gets a lot of card and does quite a bit of tackles untimely.. resulting in many fouls and red cards.. hence what liverpool need now is a box to box midfielder which can win balls and create opportunities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on the other hand, great that torres is staying</p>
