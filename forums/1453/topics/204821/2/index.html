            <div class='col-md body'>Bros,<br>Zenden was playing in center midfield the last few seasons of his middlesbrough career. So it's not for some recently-made decision by rafa to play him there. Anyway our left side is already overcrowded with riise, aurelio, gonzales, kewell and warnock.<br><br>On the match, the worst player was kronkamp. He had no communication whatsoever with the centerbacks and he seemed lost throughout. His passing was wayward (saw the backpass he gave to reina?eesh...), marking non-existent... i can go on and on... He's like the right-sided traore who, finally, left the club. Heck, he's no better than josemi who didn't last more than 6 mths. Our most consistent, unsung hero, finnan would have definitely done a better job. Too bad he's approaching the wrong side of 30.<br><br>About the new signings, gonzales is still too soft. So much for the hype about his pace. Didn't see him try to take on defenders much, huh? Aurelio's not bad. Still needs to develop understanding between defenders though. Bellamy was the best among the lot. His determination can't be doubted.<br><br>Overall, can't blame the new boys. Its their first premiership game. Blame fowler for missing one or two sitters. Blame gerrard for his occasional wayward passing considering his high standards. Blame hyppia for being too slow and tackling aimlessly at times. Blame sissoko for not protecting the defenders like he does so well often. Blame carra and riise for getting injuries so early on in the game.<br><br>Bottomline, focus was too much on the champs league. And overconfidence. Tonight, the whole team sucked.</div>
