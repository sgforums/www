            <div class='col-md body'>Inbound Feyenoord striker Dirk Kuyt has been speaking about his dream move to Liverpool.<br><br>The Dutch ace has agreed terms with the Reds after both clubs finally reached an agreement on how his transfer fee would be paid. (agreed a <span style="color: red;">Â£9million </span>fee for the player )<br><br>Talking about the move, Kuyt said: "For me, Liverpool is sure to be the dream club I was looking for.<br><br>"There was more interest from abroad but for me there was nothing of the calibre of Liverpool, a brilliant club with an enormous reputation, fantastic support and a fabulous history.<br><br>"It is an honour to play for a club like that.<br><br>"I leave Feyenoord with mixed feelings. I have experienced three great years in Rotterdam, despite us not winning any major prizes. The crowd continued to adopt a positive attitude in spite of that.<br><br>"Feyenoord supporters are the sort of fans any club would like to have in their stadium. I will always respect that, as I respect all the people at the club. That is why I consider it an honour that the chairman wanted to see me back at De Kuip [one day]. That is an expression of appreciation.<br><br>"I wish the players, coaches and all fans a great deal of success this season. From England I will continue to follow everything that happens at De Kuip."<br><br></div>

I've seen him score goals.<br><br>"I think if he settles in, which I think he will settle in quite quickly as he's Dutch - if he does, Liverpool could have the final piece in the jigsaw.<br><br>"They've got Bellamy, they've got Kuyt, they've got Crouch, they've got Fowler and when you've got those players available you're always going to score goals.<br><br>"I think he [Rafa] will [keep everyone happy]. That's the way it is now [with big squads]. Chelsea have got great players as well on the bench. I think a sign of a great team is when you've got two strikers playing and if they're not doing the goods, you've got two strikers on the bench who can come on and do it .<br><br><span style="color: red;">"If you're the opposition and you do really well for sixty minutes and you see one go off and another quality striker coming on, your head must go down. </span><br><br>"I think it's great that you can have at least four quality strikers in the side and that's what Liverpool have got now."</span><br><br><img src="http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_17_1.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This Kuyt is a safer bet , in terms of his physical abilities .<br><br>I remember he was deployed as a centre forward doing all those headings and shieldings , the type of penalty box fella during the World Cup .<br><br>I don't see Kuyt and Crouch together in the first team sheet , one of them has to give way .<br><br>Depending to the different tactics .<br><br>Most likely this season , Kuyt will be used as a cover for Crouch , and at the same time , understudy the English game through some feather-weight matches .<br><br>That's how i see .<br><br>We just can't throw him in into the English game without letting him learn about the pace , and physics of the English game .</div>
