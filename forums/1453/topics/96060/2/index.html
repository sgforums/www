            <div class='col-md body'>I thought LFC played a lot better tonight than they did against Man U and Olympiakos.<br><br>I was pleased that Benitez dropped the under performing Hamann.Diao did pretty well coming in for the German.<br><br>Defensively,they were OK,although I thought Josemi had a nightmare at right back.He was exposed for pace far too many times by Duff, Drogba and even Gallas in the first half.On the other hand,Traore played well at left back.The goal they conceeded was a good goal.Full marks to the delivery from Lampard and the finish from Joe Cole.<br><br>Chelsea are proving to be a really tough team to beat this season.There is no shame for the LFC players,they lost to a better team tonight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cole fires Chelsea past Liverpool<br><br>Joe Cole's second-half strike gave Chelsea a 1-0 victory against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge to keep them snapping at Arsenal's heels at the top of the English Premiership.<br><br>In the absence of Liverpool's injured skipper Steven Gerrard, the substitute did his chances of starting for England against Wales in the World Cup qualifier next Saturday no harm when he half-volleyed in a Frank Lampard free-kick in the 64th minute.<br><br>Blues striker Didier Drogba limped off injured 38 minutes in and without a specialist forward on the bench, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho sent on Cole to deputise up front.<br><br>The midfielder did not let his manager down and extended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season while condemning Liverpool to a fourth straight away defeat.<br><br>"I have been trying to get in the box more and it's easy to score when I get service like Frank's cross today," said Cole.<br><br>"Now we are right up there with Arsenal and we just have to keep going."<br><br>The game pitted Mourinho, who masterminded Porto's success, against Rafael Benitez who guided Valencia to the UEFA Cup title, both managers new to their posts and under pressure to deliver trophies.<br><br>Mourinho fielded the same side for the third consecutive match. The Blues were buoyed by their 3-1 defeat of Champions League winners Porto on Wednesday, when Liverpool slumped 1-0 at Olympiakos.<br><br>Reds right-back Josemi, charged with marking Damien Duff, clattered the Republic of Ireland winger in the first minute but Duff soon had the better of his opponent, regularly rounding the Spaniard as Chelsea had the better of the opening exchanges.<br><br>Lampard had more space than he thought when Drogba rounded Jamie Carragher to slip the ball into the box 12 minutes in.<br><br>But the England midfielder's turn and snapshot sent the ball harmlessly wide of Chris Kirkland, who performed well on his return to the Liverpool goal in favour of Jerzy Dudek.<br><br>The visitors failed to create sustained spells of pressure and were limited to a few half-chances from crosses.<br><br>Reds striker Djibril Cisse rattled the Blues eight minutes before the interval though when he skirted across the top of the penalty box, but under pressure from right-back Paulo Ferreira, he curled his powerful low shot just wide.<br><br>Mourinho was forced to change his plans a minute later, sending Cole into attack in place of the injured Drogba.<br><br>Lampard missed futher chances just before the break when he stooped to head a right-wing Ferreira cross wide and could not get a full touch when sliding in to meet Duff's low centre from the other side just before the break.<br><br>Both sides increased the tempo in the second half and Kirkland had Harry Kewell to thank on 57 minutes when the Australia midfielder headed a goalbound Cole shot off the line.<br><br>But Cole did not have long to wait to get on the scoresheet.<br><br>With his only remarkable intervention in the game, Salif Diao brought down Alexey Smertin 30 yards out.<br><br>Lampard crossed the free kick in low for Cole who, running across the face of goal, side-footed past Kirkland.<br><br>In search of an equaliser, Benitez introduced Euro 2004 top scorer Milan Baros, Steve Finnan and Dietmar Hamann, but it was to no avail as Chelsea completed an seventh clean sheet in eight Premiership matches<br></div>
