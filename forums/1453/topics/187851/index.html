            <div class='col-md body'>What does he have that the other strikers don't have?<br><br>What Garcia has among the strikers at the moment is intelligent unpredictability.<br><br>Cisse clearly has little of it. Garcia tends to do the unpredictable making it difficult for goalkeepers or even defenders to defend against him. I mean when he gets the ball, I think even the Liverpool teammates have no idea what he's likely to do, much less the opposing team. Cudicini just stood there and let Garcia shoot. He had no idea what to do. Remember Richard Wright the Everton goalie who came out and Garcia lobbed him for the 2nd goal? I think if Cudicini had come out the same thing would have happened. Anyway the shot was a looping one.<br><br>So what Garcia has is football intelligence and unpredictability. All the trademarks of a key "peripheral" type player.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I believe every team should have one of these enigma type players.<br></div>

Not first team. Not to be sold. Not a key player. But still sometimes wanted by the team.<br><br>Good as a foil or substitute when games become too fixed into a certain pattern.<br><br>He does have a place in the team.

            <div class='col-md body'>he is really an unpredictable player..<br><br>he can make u love him by scoring important goals, eg vs Juve, Chelsea(twice!) n ars (though we lost the game)...<br><br>yet he can do stopid things at times, like not passing at the right moment, miss simple chances, dribble too much..<br><br>he will never be an important 1st team player but we do need him to give fresh ideas at times..<br><br>he can win or lose a match for u.. even Rafa said he has learnt to live with that so i guess he wun be sold unless a real good bid comes in...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Liverpool boss admits he can't control Garcia<br>tribalfootball.com - April 26, 2006<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez admits he's given up trying to help Luis Garcia find more consistency.<br>Benitez said: "When you have a player like Luis, you know he is always going to try and do things. All I tell him is make sure it's as close as possible to their box, because it's less dangerous for us.<br><br>"I keep reminding him - many times! But you have to accept he will always try something different. He isn't a player you can just tell to play an easy pass inside, and it is good for the supporters to see that.<br><br>"You know he is going to miss some easy goals. But then again, he will get some fantastic goals, and last season he ended up with 13.<br><br>"Of course you try and change him and there are days when he will have a really good game. You have to accept it will be a risk.<br><br>"If you are wondering what to do to change things during a game, you can play a centre-back as a centre-forward - or use Luis Garcia!"<br><br>He added: "It is a lot more physical in England and difficult for some - but Luis is very clever. When he is playing as a second striker it is tough for defenders to stop him, because he will get behind the centre-back to pick up the ball.<br><br>"He certainly gives me plenty of options and when the things he tries do come off, obviously it gives him a lot more confidence. You sometimes hear the supporters are disappointed but he will just keep trying again and again." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Garcia is a good player for LFC. When struggling to break down defences, or when the team is playing too predictably, throwing Garcia on might just do the trick. He's the kind of player that can cause problems. Not to mention the occassional spectacular goals and his knack for scoring very important goals.<br><br>Until we find another player similar but maybe more consistent (Aimar,Riquelme or Ronaldinho?(Long shot i know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ), I think its good that LFC keeps Garcia.</div>
