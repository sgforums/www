              <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Liverpool seeking Blues boost</h2>
              <div class="byLine">One of the biggest games in the Premier League has lost some of its sparkle by Liverpool's recent fall from grace. However, with new owners now at the Anfield helm, the opportunity presents itself to pull off a real morale boost by beating champions and league leaders Chelsea.</div>
              <p> </p>
              Liverpool have seemingly turned a corner in recent games as they have beaten Blackburn and Bolton to edge themselves out of the relegation zone after falling to defeats against Blackpool and Everton. But with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></span> still looking short of form, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Joe Cole</span></span> out injured and manager <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span></span> still tipped for the sack before Christmas, there is a lot of work left to do.
              <p> </p>
              The Reds face a Chelsea side who are an imposing prospect for any team, struggling or otherwise. Thus far they have eight wins out of their ten league games, with only three goals conceded, and play a confident brand of attacking football that has made them the envy of most of Europe. With the likes of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Florent Malouda</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ashley Cole</span></span> in the form their lives, Chelsea have strength all across the pitch (and on the bench). At Anfield, they will once again miss Frank Lampard, but the most worrying observation for the Liverpool scouts might be how well Chelsea have coped without him.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Liverpool to watch: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></span></strong>. The right-back was at Stamford Bridge for four years, but failed to make much of an impression after joining for more than £6 million from West Ham. Highly rated as a youngster, various Chelsea bosses would not put their faith in the defender, but an £18 million move to Liverpool, via Portsmouth, has seen him emerge as first-choice for club and country. Fast and athletic, Johnson is a typical modern day full-back, but has struggled with the defensive side of the game. Chelsea's left side will test his abilities to the fullest.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Chelsea player to watch: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Petr Cech</span></span>.</strong> The fact that Chelsea have only conceded three goals this season often gets overlooked by the fact that they have scored 27. The defensive side of the game is less glamourous, but Cech revels in keeping clean sheets and, after a few seasons of criticism, he is now looking back to his very best. Tall and commanding, Cech is capable of the spectacular and has the full trust and respect of the defenders in front of him. A misfiring Liverpool strikeforce will certainly find him a tough challenge to overcome.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Key battle: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span></span> v <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">John Mikel Obi</span></span></strong>. Gerrard's league form has not been as impressive as in recent seasons during Liverpool's recent crisis period but he has weighed in with three goals in his 10 games for the club thus far and bagged a hat-trick against Napoli in the Europa League. He may be a little tired from his midweek efforts, but he will be giving everything to ensure that his side continues their rise up from the bottom of the table. Mikel, who has started every game for the Blues so far, will be charged with tracking Gerrard's runs and breaking up their attacking play. Strong and powerful, the Nigerian may not get as far forward as he does for his country, but he plays a vital role for his club.
              <p> </p>
              <strong>Trivia:</strong> Both sides met five times in five years in the Champions League from 2004-2009 and also played in the League Cup twice in that time. The total aggregate score over those five years reads: Liverpool 23, Chelsea 29.</div>

              <h2>Champions defeated at Anfield</h2>
              Fernando Torres produced a striker's masterclass to score twice as Liverpool inflicted only a second defeat of the season on Premier League leaders Chelsea.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Torres has a liking for playing the Londoners at Anfield, as his six goals in five matches against them at home shows.</p>
              <p>Chelsea were heavily linked with a summer bid for Torres but it never materialised and manager Carlo Ancelotti said he did not need to buy the striker as he was satisfied with his own forwards.</p>
              <p>However, Torres was more than happy to give a display of his quality to the Blues boss, whose side had conceded only three goals in 10 league games prior to kick-off.</p>
              <p>It was always likely the result would come down to who took their chances and with Didier Drogba left on the bench until the second half, Torres was given a head start.</p>
              <p>He did not need a second invitation and in addition to his two expertly-taken first-half goals he was a constant threat to the Chelsea defence</p>
              <p>Torres has been short of form this season but he has always been able to produce a performance against Chelsea at Anfield over the years and this was no different.</p>
              <p>It took just 11 minutes for him to reopen old wounds with a classic piece of finishing courtesy of a cross from Dirk Kuyt, making a welcome return after a month's absence with an ankle injury, on the left.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman chipped a pass over the head of John Terry and Torres took one touch before firing past Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>Having looked short of confidence this season the 26-year-old appeared to spring to life, immediately going on a short run and firing wide.</p>
              <p>Possession was fairly even but Liverpool created the best chances, having a penalty shout dismissed when Terry's clearance bounced up on to Yury Zhirkov's arm from which Raul Meireles shot at Cech.</p>
              <p>Torres did not give the goalkeeper any such chance with his second just before half-time with a strike even better than his opener and reminiscent of his first ever goal for the club - also against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Meireles dispossessed Ashley Cole in the centre of the pitch and rolled the ball out to the Spaniard on the left of the penalty area.</p>
              <p>Cutting inside he curled a shot around Branislav Ivanovic and inside Terry and the far post.</p>
              <p>It was a fitting end to undoubtedly Liverpool's best first half of the season, which was as much down to excellent organisation at the back as Torres' potency up front.</p>
              <p>With Jamie Carragher, restored to centre-back, barking the orders the hosts limited Chelsea to one shot on target - and that a weak Salomon Kalou header straight at Jose Reina.</p>
              <p>Drogba's arrival for the start of the second half was inevitable but the Ivory Coast international's first shooting opportunity saw him curl a 30-yard free-kick well wide.</p>
              <p>Ramires headed over and Zhirkov's shot was turned around the post by Reina, who also produced a brilliant close-range stop to deny Florent Malouda.</p>
              <p>Having got themselves into a winning position it was now a question of holding on to it for Liverpool as Chelsea ramped up the pressure.</p>
              <p>Torres may be paid to score goals but the sight of him hoofing the ball into the upper tier of the Centenary Stand was testament to the determination of everyone to hang on at all costs.</p>
              <p>Kuyt almost wrapped things up 15 minutes from time only for Cech's outstretched leg to divert the ball wide.</p>
              <p>Chelsea knew it was not to be their day when Nicolas Anelka's shot squeezed under Reina, whose slight touch deflected the ball up on to the bar and then Carragher cleared from the lurking Drogba two yards out.</p>
              <p>The win moved Liverpool into ninth, the first time they have been in the top half since the opening weekend of the season, after three successive Barclays Premier League victories.</p>
              <p>They are still not in a position to challenge Chelsea at the top of the table - where they still have a two-point lead over Manchester United - but they proved, on their day and with Torres on form, they remain a match for any side.</p>
              <p>It seems a corner has now been turned in Roy Hodgson's reign, and with matches to come against Wigan, Stoke and West Ham there is a real chance for them to restore some of the damage done by their poor start to the season.</p>

              <p>I agreed that Kelly was more impressive than Johnson.</p>
              <p>Lucas was playing better when he fight for the ball.</p>
              <p>But, Maxi have the tendency to be missing most part of the game.</p>
              <p>As for Kuyt, I understand now why he is Ah Ben's favourite as he is still reliable and hardworking when the rest of the team disappoints.</p>
              <p>I think Babel should leave in Jan 2011 as he is still not given any chance under Ah Roy.</p>
