            <div class='col-md body'>[<strong>Robson against Beckham captaincy</strong><br><br>Ex-England captain Robson says Beckham is not a real leader<br><br>Bryan Robson believes David Beckham should not be England captain at this summer's World Cup finals.<br><br>West Brom manager and former England skipper Robson says Steven Gerrard or John Terry are more suited to the role.<br><br>In his autobiography, which is entitled Robbo and is being serialised in the Mail on Sunday, he says: "Becks would not have been my choice as captain.<br><br>"Gerrard and Terry are more natural leaders and have the aggression most managers like in a captain."<br><br>Robson added: "Beckham is not a leader on the pitch.<br><br>"To my mind, Terry has probably edged ahead of Gerrard as the best choice.<br><br>"He leads by example, is an excellent organiser and has the presence that everyone in the team will respect. He also scores goals, a great bonus for a defender."<br><br>He also warned against over-hyping England's chances in the showpiece tournament in Germany this summer.<br><br>Robson, who was known as Captain Marvel during his playing days, said: "The danger is that the country will get carried away and raise expectations too high.<br><br>"But I do believe we have a chance in 2006 - probably our best chance since 1990.<br><br>"This team, with the back-up we have as well, has the potential to go all the way. It reminds me of our Italia 90 side."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is a problem with Bryan Robbo , it's not a problem to me .<br><br>Beckham is fine with me , he has been leading since Pete Taylor appointed him as one , Ericsson also stick with him .<br><br>Captain or no Captain , it doesn't matter to me , it's just a symbol .<br><br>Leadership on the pitch ?

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">stevie g or terry will definitely make a better captain than bakeham ... however i can't see a change so close to the wc finals ... it'll probably be his last stint as the captain since sven's gonna get the boot after this ...<br><br>on a side note i think england has the players to be a chance for the trophy but not the coach, which is a pity ...</span></div>
