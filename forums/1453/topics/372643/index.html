              <p>Speaking to the official website Rafael Benitez said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“We have nearly done the deal subject to a medical. He is a player with experience who can hopefully help us in defence.</p>
              <p>“He has experience in British football and Rangers. After that with Frankfurt and the national team. He’s a good player in the air, strong and aggressive. We were looking for a player with experience.</p>
              <p>“He will have the medical this week, it has to be before the weekend</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool have today completed the signing of Greek international defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos from AEK Athens.</strong></p>
              <p>The 30-year-old has put pen to paper on a two-year deal with the option of a further year after successfully completing a medical. <br>  <br>Trikala-born Kyrgiakos began his career at the Panathinaikos academy in 1996 before being loaned out to Greek second division club Agios Nikolaos. <br>  <br>He was recalled by his parent club in 2001 and the powerful centre-back quickly established himself as a regular member of the Panathinaikos first team, helping them to a Greek league and cup double in 2004. <br>  <br>In January 2005, Kyrgiakos acquired his first taste of British football as he joined Glasgow Rangers on loan. <br>  <br>After clinching the Scottish title and League Cup, the deal was made permanent in the summer of the same year as the 6ft 4ins defender agreed a one-year contract at Ibrox. <br>  <br>The Bundesliga was his next destination with the tough-tackling stopper sealing a transfer to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2006, where he spent two seasons before joining AEK last summer. <br>  <br>A knee injury kept Kyrgiakos out of Greece's historic triumph at Euro 2004, although he started each of his country's three matches in the same tournament four years later. <br>  <br>In total, he has won 50 caps for the Greek national team.</p>

              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez believes Sotirios Kyrgiakos will prove to be a 'very good signing' for Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>The Greek centre-back has put pen to paper on a two-year deal with the option of a further year to complete his transfer from AEK Athens. <br>  <br>Speaking to Liverpoolfc.tv, Benitez revealed the reasoning behind his decision to swoop for Kyrgiakos <br>  <br>"He is a tough defender who is strong and good in the air. He has a strong character and we were looking for these things," said the Reds boss. <br>  <br>"He can score goals and will be a threat from corners and free-kicks. He's very strong in defence but he will need time as always to settle into the Premier League. He will be a very good signing for us. <br>  <br>"We knew the player when he was with Rangers and we've been watching videos of him at Frankfurt and the national team. Our scout department had a lot of information. <br>  <br>"We've talked about the things he's done before and the things he'll have to do for us. It was good. He knows what we want and he's ready to work." <br> <span style="color: #000000;"> <br>Benitez feels the acquisition of Kyrgiakos will be of benefit to young defenders such as </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/kelly2/"><span style="color: #000000;">Martin Kelly</span></a> and Daniel Ayala - with the manager confident his starlets can learn from the experienced 30-year-old. <br>  <br>He said: "It will be positive. I was talking with Ayala about this. When the young players see someone with experience it is positive because they can learn from them. <br>  <br>"It also means they have more time. If they have to play some games they can but they are not under pressure."</p>

              <p>He added: "I know that there have not been many Greek players who have been successful in the English game, so I feel that I have something to prove for my country, that we can play at this level.</p>
              <p>"For me it is a chance to have success at the very top. I was injured when Greece were European champions in 2004, these things happen in football. So I have plenty of motivation to do well in the <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://sgforums.com/category/leagues/premier-league"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Premier League</span></span></a></abbr> and help <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://sgforums.com/category/clubs/liverpool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Liverpool</span></span></a></abbr> to be successful.</p>
              <p>"I had a few disciplinary problems in Scotland, but not too much. I feel I have learned now how to be physical in this style of football."</p>

              <p><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/kyrgiakos/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sotirios Kyrgiakos</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> believes</span> he can draw on his previous title-winning experience and help Liverpool in their quest for Barclays Premier League glory.</strong></p>
              <p>The powerful centre-back, who made his Reds debut in the reserve clash with Blackburn Rovers on Thursday, has lifted championships in both his native Greece and in Scotland with Glasgow Rangers. <br>  <br>Our new No.16 feels the two seasons he spent north of the border will stand him in good stead for the challenges that lie ahead in England. <br>  <br>"I have a little experience of winning titles from my previous career in Greece and in Scotland," Kyrgiakos told the LFC Weekly Magazine. <br>  <br>"I won one title with Panathinaikos and two in Scotland when I played with Rangers. I hope that the experiences I had in Scotland will help me begin well at Liverpool. <br>  <br>"I believe that I have the qualities needed to play in the Premier League. <br>  <br>"My time in Scotland will help because it is a similar style of football to here. It is true that the Premier League will be more difficult than the SPL because the game is faster here and there are more quality players. <br>  <br>"In Scotland you had Rangers, Celtic and Hearts and it was very rare for us to lose to anyone - and if we did it was normally to one of those two teams. <br>  <br>"In England, everyone is capable of beating everyone else." <br>  <br>Kyrgiakos was a keen watcher of the Premier League last season and admits he was impressed with Liverpool's second place finish. <br>  <br>Despite arriving at Anfield only just over a week ago, the Greek international believes he has seen enough to suggest the Reds have the required team spirit to go one better this time around. <br>  <br>"I watched a lot of last season's Premier League and I believe we were very close to the title," said the 30-year-old. <br>  <br>"From what I have seen this season we are equipped to go even better. In my experience of winning titles, you need a great team spirit in the dressing room and I have seen this already among my new teammates. <br>  <br>"Everyone works hard and gives everything. That is the most important thing you need for such a long battle as the title race. After that, you need to be brave and have a little bit of luck along the way. <br>  <br>"I enjoy a challenge, and this is the toughest challenge I have taken in my career so far. I am looking forward to playing in this league, but first I must prove myself to the manager in training. I know there are a lot of good players at this club so I cannot take anything for granted."</p>
