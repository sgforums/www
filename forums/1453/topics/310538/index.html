              Liverpool were bought just over a year ago by American businessmen Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</p>
              <p> </p>
              But now Gillett is close to selling out his stake to Dubai Investment Capital, while Hicks has been targeted by protesting fans who want him out of the club.
              <p> </p>
              Asked whether Liverpool's situation should be a warning to other clubs, Blatter said: 'Yes definitely. You get investors, because a club is a good investment - and they come and if the results are not as such as they have expected they go away.
              <p> </p>
              'This is definitely a risk in all the clubs. But as long as they have so many investors and specifically in the English Premier League, it is a fashion to buy a football club.
              <p> </p>
              'At a certain time they wanted to have a Formula One team or they had a personal golf course or they had horses - and now it is football.
              <p> </p>
              'That's good for football, but the community of football should pay attention to such a situation.'
              <p> </p>
              Blatter can understand Liverpool fans mounting protests.
              <p> </p>
              'I like it. They did the same at Old Trafford two years ago, but they are still going to the stadium to watch the matches,' he said.
              <p> </p>
              'We have to take care first of the game, but it can only be done with the understanding of everybody.
              <p> </p>
              'Concerning the big clubs and the money, this is a problem which has nothing to do with sport; this is economic mechanism and activities, where we have very little to say.'
              <p> </p>
              Blatter, speaking in Gleneagles following a meeting of the International FA Board (IFAB), also spelled out his intention to continue to oppose the Premier League's plan for overseas matches.
              <p> </p>
              The proposal is being reviewed after widespread opposition. But Blatter will still bring the issue to the attention of FIFA's executive committee on Friday.
              <p> </p>
              'I don't know if it is dead but I will definitely bring it to the executive committee and the congress,' he said.
              <p> </p>
              'The Premier League are the best-organised league with the most money coming in - but when you are so rich you should share with the other components of football and not try to get more.'
              <p> </p>
              Blatter also defended the decision to halt development of goalline technology by claiming the systems are too complicated, too expensive and not foolproof.
              <p> </p>
              The IFAB, football's rule-making body, ended the Premier League's hopes of introducing the technology for the 2009/10 season by freezing any further trials on separate systems being developed by `Hawkeye' and adidas/Cairos Technologies.
              <p> </p>
              Instead, the IFAB decided to push ahead with experiments with two extra assistant referees standing behind each goalline.
              <p> </p>
              Blatter said: 'It is not a change of heart. We have identified very clearly how complicated both systems are and that for the time being they are not accurate.
              <p> </p>
              'After three years of tests, we have had no conclusive results - so we have decided to stop it and put it on ice.'
              <p> </p>
              FA chief executive Brian Barwick believes that effectively ends any hopes of goal-line technology.
              <p> </p>
              He said: 'I think goalline technology is now dead in the water, and that is a disappointment to the FA - although we absolutely respect the democracy of the International FA Board.'
              <p> </p>
              Paul Hawkins, managing director of `Hawkeye', said: 'I am gobsmacked, and it's completely out of the blue. A year ago they seemed to want it; we have invested an awful lot of money - and now we have no return on that. I am livid.'
              <p> </p>
              Meanwhile, Blatter revealed there is a very real possibility of some matches at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa being played on artificial pitches.
              <p> </p>
              If the pitches at next year's Confederations Cup are deemed below standard, then artificial turf will be installed in those stadiums that do not come up to scratch.
              <p> </p>
              Blatter said: 'If there are any problems with the quality of the pitches then it's a possibility that the 2010 World Cup could be played on artificial turf.
              <p> </p>
              'This is the truth. Artificial turf is the future.'
