Chelski have completed the loan signing of Mike Riley with a view to a permanant move at the end of the season. However Man U will complain to the football league that their star man was tapped up before the transfer window was opened.  It looks increasingly likely that the move will be permanant judging by Riley's performance at Liverpool and a fee of Â£Xmillion has been agreed with Roman Abramovich.  Apparently Alex fergusion is furious at losing one of his most senior members n calls this whole thing IMMORAL.<br></span></span></div>

I wonder who would!? </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Jamie Carragher has launched a scathing attack on referee Mike Riley and urged the Football Association to prevent him officiating at future big matches.<br>Carragher was incensed by Riley's controversial decision to deny Liverpool a penalty against Chelsea at Anfield on New Years Day following a clear handball by Tiago.<br><br>The fact that the Reds eventually ended up losing a game they dominated only served to compound Carra's anger and he's adamant that Riley's error should not go unpunished.<br><br>"If the refs perform well, then they should get the big games," says the passionately spoken Liverpool defender.<br><br>"But the fact is that he influenced the outcome of another game by bad decisions. He's the same referee who made big mistakes in the United versus Arsenal game.<br><br>"What happened here and at Old Trafford could prove the difference between Arsenal winning and losing the league. Referees must be held more accountable. The FA should look at the referees who are officiating in these big games. This was a really big one and you need to have a top referee.<br><br>"Everybody knows how difficult it is for referees and that they don't get action replays but it was a blatant penalty. He was in a great position to see it. We all turned to him straightaway because he was five or six yards away and he'd put his whistle in his mouth. I don't know if he lost his nerve but he just didn't blow."  </span></span></div>
