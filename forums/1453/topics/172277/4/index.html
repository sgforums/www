No mentions about winning the EPL or the Champions League again. I think thats the way to go. Take it one match at a time. When the time is right, then talk about winning the championships.<br><br>At the same time, I don't think Rafa will come out and openly surrender the EPL title. Until its mathematically impossible, anything can still happen. You never know. You've just got to make sure you win your games. That's all the best you can do. Don't worry about what other teams are doing.</div>
