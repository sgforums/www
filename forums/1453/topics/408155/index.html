              <span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Great expectations as two giants aim to 
              silence doubters</strong></span><br><br>Roy 
              Hodgson kicks off the new Premier League season 
              as he ended the last one – with a game against Arsene 
              Wenger’s Arsenal. But whereas 
              in May he was in charge of Fulham, resting key players for their trip to the 
              Emirates a few days before contesting the Europa League final, now he is at the 
              helm of Liverpool, still 
              England’s most successful club, even if the glory days are fast receding into 
              the distance.<br><br>Taking over at Anfield is Hodgson’s reward not only for 
              working wonders at Craven Cottage, but for a lengthy career of solid if not 
              always spectacular achievement in European club and international football. 
              <br><br>His task is a tough one: the Reds lost their way alarmingly in what 
              turned out to be Rafa Benitez’s last season in charge, aiming for first and 
              finishing seventh while making early exits from every cup competition, including 
              the Champions League.<br><br>His first Premier League game as Liverpool boss 
              will also be Wenger’s 525th in charge of the Gunners, and although the Frenchman 
              has lost only 85 of those, compared with 307 wins, and has finished in the top 
              four in every one of his 14 seasons in North London, he is arguably under even 
              greater pressure to deliver than Hodgson.<br><br>‘Arsenal haven’t won a trophy 
              since 2005’ is in danger of becoming the latest football cliché, and is 
              something that no doubt irks Wenger as much as it frustrates the 
              fans.<br><br>He’s been accused of being too frugal, too stubborn, too obsessed 
              with the beautiful game and over-reliant on youth in pursuit of his principles. 
              There’s talk he’s about to commit to a new contract that would effectively bind 
              him to the Gunners for the rest of his career; but at the same time there is 
              speculation that this will be his last season at the Emirates if he fails to end 
              the trophy drought.<br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Will changes 
              bring greater staying power?</strong></span><br><br>Both squads have new 
              signings who’ll be looking to integrate and impress from the off –  including 
              Joe Cole, Christian Poulsen, Milan Jovanovic, Laurent Koscielny and Marouane 
              Chamakh. <br><br>But in an unwelcome echo of last season, both teams may also be 
              without key players - World Cup finalists, no less -  as Fernando Torres, Cesc 
              Fabregas and Robin van Persie have all been struggling to reach match fitness in 
              time for Sunday afternoon’s opener.<br><br>Injuries (and in some cases loss of 
              form) were a recurring motif for both clubs last season, and for both, their 
              prospects of improvement will depend on being able to keep their respective 
              treatment rooms unclogged. <br><br>There have also been some significant 
              departures over the summer: Arsenal have seen no fewer than four central 
              defenders move on, while Yossi Benayoun has quit Anfield and Javier Mascherano 
              could yet follow him.<br><br>Liverpool fans crave greater consistency (and a 
              little less caution) on the pitch, and greater stability off it. Hodgson’s 
              arrival has brought an air of calm and optimism to Anfield, but the ownership 
              issue remains a distraction. Arsenal fans are looking for more durability, 
              especially at the back, and less naivety, especially against Chelsea and 
              Manchester United. <br><br>It is unlikely that either manager has concluded his 
              summer transfer business, so both teams are works in progress; but this 
              weekend's most compelling fixture may offer some clues about which one of these 
              two giants has the stronger credentials.<br><br>

              from Juventus on Thursday - though not, insists Hodgson, as a replacement for 
              Javier Mascherano (who is also in contention to face Arsenal) - could start in 
              midfield.<br><br>There was encouraging news that Fernando Torres has recovered 
              from the groin injury he picked up at the World Cup, but Hodgson may prefer to 
              have him as an option on the bench than risk him from the start.<br><br>Another 
              World Cup participant, Martin Skrtel, is nursing an ankle 
              injury.<br><br><em>Possible Starting XI: Reina; Johnson, Kyrgiakos, Carragher, 
              Agger; Poulsen, Mascherano; Jovanovic, Gerrard, Cole; Ngog.</em>   <br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Arsenal</strong> <br></span><br><img style="margin: 5px; float: left; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/104500/104520_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80">Wenger admitted that playmaker captain Cesc Fabregas 
              and striker Robin van Persie were well behind the rest of the squad in terms of 
              fitness after playing in the World Cup through to the final, and would struggle 
              to be fit in time. <br><br>But new signings Marouane Chamakh and Laurent 
              Koscielny should both start, and England debutant Jack Wilshere could be in 
              contention, especially as fellow midfielders Denilson (stomach), Abou Diaby and 
              Alex Song (both calf) may be ruled out with knocks. <br><br>Nicklas Bendtner 
              (groin), Johan Djourou (hamstring) and Aaron Ramsey (broken leg) are 
              sidelined.<br><em><br>Possible Starting XI: Almunia; Sagna, Koscielny, 
              Vermaelen, Clichy; Song; Rosicky, Wilshere, Nasri, Arshavin;

              Arsenal to join Liverpool, and will feel he has a point to prove this season 
              after having been jettisoned by Chelsea, with whom he won three Premier League 
              titles. <br><br>He also endured a less than satisfying World Cup, and there are 
              plenty of critics who, perhaps harshly, still eye him with suspicion as 
              something of a luxury player who has never truly fulfilled the outstanding 
              potential he showed as a West Ham teenager.<br><br>Cole has vowed to do all he 
              can to help revive Liverpool's fortunes, and to supply the bullets for Torres 
              and Gerrard to fire. Sunday offers the perfect opportunity to start making good 
              on those promises.   <br><span style="font-size: medium;"><br><strong>Arsenal</strong></span><br><br><img style="margin: 5px; float: left; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/47400/47412_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="80">Although he has committed himself to the Gunners, Cesc 
              Fabregas is not expected to start, so there will be much interest in the 
              Gunners' new signings; but this fixture has previously brought the best out of 
              diminutive Russian forward <strong>Andrey Arshavin</strong>, and he will relish 
              the chance to produce a third consecutive man-of-the-match performance at 
              Anfield.<br><br>Having scored a stunning four goals in the 4-4 draw in April 
              2009, he also netted Arsenal's winner in last season's 2-1 victory. There is a 
              feeling that Arshavin was not as consistently effective last term as he'd been 
              in his initial half-season at the Emirates; being deployed as a makeshift 
              striker didn't help, but expectations will be high this time around. <br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br>PREDICTION</strong></span><br><br>A year 
              ago, Arsenal traveled to Liverpool for the first game of the season and thrashed 
              Everton 6-1. They're back on Merseyside to start the latest campaign, but this 
              time in the red corner of Stanley Park, where the feeling is that a new chapter 
              in the Anfield club's history is about to be written. Defensive, cautious, 
              sometimes paranoid Rafa has given way to more relaxed, diplomatic and 
              media-friendly Roy. How much difference will it make on the pitch? <br><br>Last 
              season Arsenal did the double over Hodgson’s Fulham; they also beat Liverpool 
              home (1-0) and away (2-1) and knocked them out of the League Cup (2-1). Although 
              the Reds have lost only four times in their last 17 league meetings at Anfield, 
              they’ve also won only three of their last 18 Premier League games against 
              Arsenal – which just shows you can prove anything with statistics. It's a tough 
              start for both teams; both may have to settle for a draw.<br><br>

              <p>really think the ref yesterday was crap. joe tackle was absurd, but with no intention. you can see joe's eyes following the ball. + the tackle wasn't 'heavy'. a yellow card should be given at most.</p>
              <p>gerrard has a rash tackle on someone, but not given a card. he should be.</p>
              <p>overall liverpool did great compared to last season. i don't blame reina for the blunder because if not for him liverpool would have been 3-0 or more.</p>
              <p>a point is better than none.</p>
              <p>yesterday we saw that n'gog was different from last season. i think he improved, but not really there yet. he'll prolly come good in a season or 2.</p>

              <p>joe's tackle was very much not needed, but let's move on. he had a bad debut, and we have to live on with it, doesnt matter. no point going into debate, it wont change anything. on yesterday's performance, i think we suck in the first half, but did better in the beginning of the 2nd half. then after, when we got the first goal, the concentration was only on defending, bad ; real bad i would say. that's no such thing in football, nvr stop going forward till the ref put the game to an end. by doing so, we're just telling arsenal that we're so fearful of them scoring against us, we should be the aggressor, the game is at anfield mind you!</p>
              <p>reina had a bad day, one of the worse i ever seen during his time with liverpool. he's good as almunia yesterday, totally rubbish. overall, we did not improve on last season's performance. the way roy set the players out was exactly like what rafael did. dirt on right wing, agger at left back, playermaker behind striker. what's the use of getting roy in if things remain unchanged? a disappointing display in conclusion. if the tactics were to remain like yesterday's for the rest of the season, we're still going downwards, no way up.</p>

              <p>Ah Roy have to move Kuyt forward to support Ngog and he tend to drift to nowhere.</p>
              <p>Maxi have to come to the right and Milan on the left.</p>
              <p>The fire upfront is not enough.</p>
              <p>The overall play for Liverpool have improved as they have learned to pass the ball better.</p>
              <p>The team spirit was also evident when they tried to protect the lead.</p>
              <p>Reina played well last night and the goal was like the balloon last season.</p>
              <p>We have to move on from there.</p>
              <p>Stevie have start to enjoy his game and that is a good sign.</p>
              <p>Dun expect too much from Ah Roy as he have a lot to make up after Ah Ben have left.</p>

              <p>agreed. liverpool have learned to play better as a team. but in terms of skills, they have hardly improved.</p>
              <p>the only time that was enjoyable for us(liverpool fans) were during the first half before cole was sent off. especially jovanovic. he isn't really good, but not a bad player to have.</p>
