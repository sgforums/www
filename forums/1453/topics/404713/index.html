              <h1>Steven Gerrard boost for Liverpool as Roy Hodgson reveals skipper 
              could stay at Anfield<br></h1>

              <p>Roy Hodgson has revealed he is confident Steven Gerrard will not walk
               out on Liverpool.</p>
              <p>After
               failing to qualify for the Champions League, the Reds skipper is wanted
               by Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p>The Spaniards are lining up a 
              £20million swoop for the England midfielder but Hodgson is optimistic he
               will stay after discussions with the star.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In his hands: Steven Gerrard is wanted by Real 
              Madrid</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Hodgson, who also met with fellow Liverpool legends Jamie Carragher 
              and Kenny Dalglish, said: 'I think they went splendidly. I was very 
              happy to meet the players and, of course, Kenny who I already know so 
              well.</p>
              <p>'I was delighted to see how positive they are. Everybody is 
              looking forward to the new season.</p>
              <p>'Obviously Steven and Jamie are
               the playing heartbeat of the club and it's very important we keep 
              people like that with us.</p>
              <p>'I anticipate there might be a situation
               where other big clubs will try and sign Steven, but he gave no 
              indication that he wanted to leave.</p>

              </div>
              <p>'Nobody at the club wants him to go so I will be doing my utmost to 
              make sure he stays. I am confident he will.'</p>
              <p>After staging 
              meetings with key members of his squad and the Anfield hierachy, Hodgson
               is also eager to meet with Fernando Torres once he returns after the 
              World Cup final with Holland on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The striker is a target 
              for a number of Europe's leading sides, with Chelsea lodging a formal 
              £40m offer earlier this week.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: 'Fernando is a 
              wonderful striker and I understand the fans' concerns about his future. 
              Unfortunately with the World Cup still on, I won't be able to meet him 
              face to face for another few weeks. That's just circumstance and you 
              won't hear me complaining about it.</p>
              <p>'When I do meet him, I 
              will be doing everything I possibly can to convince him that Liverpool 
              is the place to be.</p>

              <p>'If he sees progress, I am confident that he won't want to go 
              anywhere else. I think he understands the club and the city.'</p>
              <p>Hodgson
               is now considering offer a new role for academy chief Dalglish at the 
              club.</p>
              <p>He added: 'I never doubted that Kenny would leave. He's been
               offered a role, which I believe is a crucial role for the club - not 
              just  in the short term, but in the long term.<br><br>'The club will 
              benefit from Kenny's work long after I've left Liverpool and long after 
              he's left as well. He is very aware of all the players at the Academy 
              and I understand there are a few promising players emerging.<br><br>'He 
              will liaise between Melwood and Kirkby and keep me updated with any 
              developments that he deems necessary. There is a bridge between the 
              Academy and the first team that needs to be created and I believe he can
               help build that bridge.'</p>
