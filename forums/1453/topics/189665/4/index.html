            <div class='col-md body'>Nice!! At least we won the FA cup this season.<br><br>Btw, methinks the cramps are more likely to be mental than physical. Especially Kewell. I've always admired the guy's skills but lately he's proven that he's not the man for the big games. He somehow always managed to hide from the action or in more recent "big games", get injured. Oh well, he'd better buck up, else there'd be Zenden and Gonzales vying for his position next season.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Now that was an FA cup final that I have not seen in a long time.<br><br>Extra-Time? 3-3 at full time? Penalty Kicks?<br><br>Underdog leading 2-0 after 30 minutes? The favourite never leading in the game?<br><br>The 2001 FA Cup final was dramatic for the Michael Owen goals. But THIS 2006 final......man......I think it's as close as you can get to the night as Istanbul but still far far off.<br><br>Gerrard never gave up.<br><br>Liverpool started the game poorly. Misplaced passes everywhere. Over-cautious play.<br><br>Alonso had a bad game. Riise had a bad game. Kewell went missing and just like last season in the CL final he limped off the pitch a little after half time. Kewell should just admit he doesn't have what it takes for finals.<br><br>The first goal was a bad bad horrendous mistake by Alonso. Yeah I know Carragher scored the own goal, but Alonso out of nowhere with no pressure, passed the ball to the West Ham player! That was the worst mistake in a cup final that I have seen a Liverpool player make. I don't blame Carragher. But also, what the hell was it with Carragher and Hyppia changing sides in the centre? Any comment Benitez?<br><br>And then the second goal, Reina's normally fantastic handling lets him down badly.<br><br>2-0 West Ham and the fans thought it was all sewn up.<br><br>But Gerrard makes a cross and Cisse does the difficult and volleys home a goal! To be fair, Hislop was a hopeless keeper the whole game. I don't think he made a single save in open play this final.<br><br>And then it's half time.<br><br>After half time, Gerrard's determination forces a 2nd goal for Liverpool to level the score! Game on. Liverpool to go on to score the winner? Noooo......<br><br>Konchesky whips in a cross and somehow the ball is in the back of the net! Reina caught napping again. To be fair, there was a TREMENDOUS, I mean HUGE HUGE amount of luck for Konchesky's cross to have gone in.<br><br>And so it's 3-2 to West Ham. The clock ticks down. Alonso asks to be substituted. Spaniards off today? 2 minutes to go to 90 minutes, Pardew brings on Sheringham. More like a last hurrah for an old horse at 40 to break some records for appearances in finals for senior citizens.<br><br>Players going down with cramp. Full time. 4 minutes of extra time to be played.<br><br>Cisse down with cramp. I am getting ready to go to bed. It had been a poor performance by Liverpool and the defence really let the team down. They didn't deserve to win anyway.<br><br>91st minute, Gerrard gets the ball in the middle of the park, let's fly a cracker. Ball is in the bottom right hand corner. GOAL!<br><br>This has got to be THE goal of FA cup finals EVER (especially now you consider LFC won the FAP Cup). The distance he shot it was about where Alonso scored his long distance shot against Luton Town. But this time the Goalkeeper was at his line! To be fair, Shaka Hislop was as usual sleeping. Saw the ball coming late and dived too late too!<br><br>45% skill, 20% determination, 20% keeper sleeping, 15% pure luck.<br><br>So after 94 minutes of play, 3-3 the scoreline.<br><br>Extra time. Everyone pai kah (broken legs). Cramp everywhere. Cannot run liao. Want to collapse and die liao. Somehow everyone pulls through to push it to the penalty shootout. Special mention goes to Reina waking up to make that last minute save.<br><br>Special note also that Morientes cannot score a goal for nuts! He cannot even shoot properly! He really underperformed. His glory days are history.<br><br>So on to the penalties. The question on everyone's minds. Istanbul again? Has Reina truly replaced Dudek?<br><br>Surprisingly, Benitez and Pardew took not more than 5 minutes to choose their kickers and order of kicks. (They probably planned it during the extra time play)<br><br>So on to the kicks. This has got to be the fastest penalty shootout I've seen. No slow long walk up of the player to the spot. No slow interchanges.<br><br>First kick, Hamann vs Hislop. The cool german scores. Hislop guessed the right direction but a keeper like him couldn't save anything today<br><br>2nd kick, Zamora vs Reina, he dives and saves! Woo hoo!<br><br>Next up Hyppia vs Hislop. Hyppia passes the ball to Hislop AFTER Hislop dived to the right. The ball rolled to Hislop. Reminder note : Never put Hyppia up for a penalty<br><br>4th kick, Sheringham vs Reina. Sheringham buries it! No fuss<br><br>5th kick, Gerrard steps up. Star player ballooning? We've seen it time and time again. Nope. Gerrard buries it. No sweat. Cool captain<br><br>6th kick, Konchesky vs Reina. The guy who fluked the goal against Reina. Will Reina crumble? Nope! Reina saves with his trailing legs!<br><br>7th Kick, Riise steps up. He drives it down the centre, Hislop was close with his trailing legs, but no dice. Remember I said he couldn't save anything the whole day?<br><br>8th kick, Anton Ferdinand to save the day. But no one is gonna gatecrash the coming of Reina the Spanish Spiderman!<br><br>Liverpool win the FA Cup for the 7th time. This will be known as the Gerrard and Reina FA Cup final.

Penalty Kicks?<br><br>Underdog leading 2-0 after 30 minutes? The favourite never leading in the game?<br><br>The 2001 FA Cup final was dramatic for the Michael Owen goals. But THIS 2006 final......man......I think it's as close as you can get to the night as Istanbul but still far far off.<br><br>Gerrard never gave up.<br><br>Liverpool started the game poorly. Misplaced passes everywhere. Over-cautious play.<br><br>Alonso had a bad game. Riise had a bad game. Kewell went missing and just like last season in the CL final he limped off the pitch a little after half time. Kewell should just admit he doesn't have what it takes for finals.<br><br>The first goal was a bad bad horrendous mistake by Alonso. Yeah I know Carragher scored the own goal, but Alonso out of nowhere with no pressure, passed the ball to the West Ham player! That was the worst mistake in a cup final that I have seen a Liverpool player make. I don't blame Carragher. But also, what the hell was it with Carragher and Hyppia changing sides in the centre? Any comment Benitez?<br><br>And then the second goal, Reina's normally fantastic handling lets him down badly.<br><br>2-0 West Ham and the fans thought it was all sewn up.<br><br>But Gerrard makes a cross and Cisse does the difficult and volleys home a goal! To be fair, Hislop was a hopeless keeper the whole game. I don't think he made a single save in open play this final.<br><br>And then it's half time.<br><br>After half time, Gerrard's determination forces a 2nd goal for Liverpool to level the score! Game on. Liverpool to go on to score the winner? Noooo......<br><br>Konchesky whips in a cross and somehow the ball is in the back of the net! Reina caught napping again. To be fair, there was a TREMENDOUS, I mean HUGE HUGE amount of luck for Konchesky's cross to have gone in.<br><br>And so it's 3-2 to West Ham. The clock ticks down. Alonso asks to be substituted. Spaniards off today? 2 minutes to go to 90 minutes, Pardew brings on Sheringham. More like a last hurrah for an old horse at 40 to break some records for appearances in finals for senior citizens.<br><br>Players going down with cramp. Full time. 4 minutes of extra time to be played.<br><br>Cisse down with cramp. I am getting ready to go to bed. It had been a poor performance by Liverpool and the defence really let the team down. They didn't deserve to win anyway.<br><br>91st minute, Gerrard gets the ball in the middle of the park, let's fly a cracker. Ball is in the bottom right hand corner. GOAL!<br><br>This has got to be THE goal of FA cup finals EVER (especially now you consider LFC won the FAP Cup). The distance he shot it was about where Alonso scored his long distance shot against Luton Town. But this time the Goalkeeper was at his line! To be fair, Shaka Hislop was as usual sleeping. Saw the ball coming late and dived too late too!<br><br>45% skill, 20% determination, 20% keeper sleeping, 15% pure luck.<br><br>So after 94 minutes of play, 3-3 the scoreline.<br><br>Extra time. Everyone pai kah (broken legs). Cramp everywhere. Cannot run liao. Want to collapse and die liao. Somehow everyone pulls through to push it to the penalty shootout. Special mention goes to Reina waking up to make that last minute save.<br><br>Special note also that Morientes cannot score a goal for nuts! He cannot even shoot properly! He really underperformed. His glory days are history.<br><br>So on to the penalties. The question on everyone's minds. Istanbul again? Has Reina truly replaced Dudek?<br><br>Surprisingly, Benitez and Pardew took not more than 5 minutes to choose their kickers and order of kicks. (They probably planned it during the extra time play)<br><br>So on to the kicks. This has got to be the fastest penalty shootout I've seen. No slow long walk up of the player to the spot. No slow interchanges.<br><br>First kick, Hamann vs Hislop. The cool german scores. Hislop guessed the right direction but a keeper like him couldn't save anything today<br><br>2nd kick, Zamora vs Reina, he dives and saves! Woo hoo!<br><br>Next up Hyppia vs Hislop. Hyppia passes the ball to Hislop AFTER Hislop dived to the right. The ball rolled to Hislop. Reminder note : Never put Hyppia up for a penalty<br><br>4th kick, Sheringham vs Reina. Sheringham buries it! No fuss<br><br>5th kick, Gerrard steps up. Star player ballooning? We've seen it time and time again. Nope. Gerrard buries it. No sweat. Cool captain<br><br>6th kick, Konchesky vs Reina. The guy who fluked the goal against Reina. Will Reina crumble? Nope! Reina saves with his trailing legs!<br><br>7th Kick, Riise steps up. He drives it down the centre, Hislop was close with his trailing legs, but no dice. Remember I said he couldn't save anything the whole day?<br><br>8th kick, Anton Ferdinand to save the day. But no one is gonna gatecrash the coming of Reina the Spanish Spiderman!<br><br>Liverpool win the FA Cup for the 7th time. This will be known as the Gerrard and Reina FA Cup final.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeh, put simply...Gerrard dragged LFC out from the dead. Pool looked like it's always in 1st gear and never really threaten much. But thanks to Raffie's tactical switch, he promptly took out Alonso (who was injured anyway) and replaced him with a defensive minded Kromkamp. He saw that Gerrard wasn't doing too much on the right and had to switch tactics. With the Dutchman in, Gerrard was allow to spearhead the much needed attack and urgency for goals in the centre of the park.<br><br>The Hamann substitution was another gd one. His experience and no fuss passing provide stability and allowing Gerrard to do the damage up front. Hamann was there, shouting to his players to focus the job on hand.<br><br>Come back King of Finals as they say but kudos to the players and abstute tactical change by Raffie.<br><br>Come next Season, we will provide even stiffier competition to Chelsea, Arsenal and Man Utd for the EPL Champ.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
