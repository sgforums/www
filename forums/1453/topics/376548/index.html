              <p><strong>Dirk Kuyt believ<span style="color: #000000;">es </span></strong><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/johnson/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> has </span>added a new dimension to Liverpool's attack that could be key to a more free-scoring season on home turf.</strong></p>
              <p>The England full-back played a starring role in emphatic wins over both Burnley and Stoke City and the Dutch forward reckons his marauding runs down the right have made him one of the Reds' stand-out performers. <br>  <br>"I think Glen has done really well," he told Liverpoolfc.tv. "He was a big signing for us but he has shown straight from the start that he is very important - both defensively and in attack. <br>  <br>"He has scored some very good goals and provided some assists. He is probably one of the best players in the team so far this season. He is still young and I think he will only get better and better." <br>  <br>The Reds drew seven league matches in L4 last term as they struggled to break down sides looking to frustrate. <br>  <br>Kuyt believes they now have what it takes to unlock stubborn defences and hopes they can maintain their recent form against Hull City on Saturday. <br>  <br>"Apart from the Villa match, I think we have shown that we can beat any side at Anfield this season," he said. "We had difficulties last season with all the draws but now we are able to score goals in the first-half. <br>  <br>"It's really important to score as early as possible because then it will be more difficult for them and easier for us. <br>  <br>"We know the Barclays Premier League is one of the hardest leagues in the world and every team is good with some fine players. <br>  <br>"I believe Hull are a good team as well but we have to look at our own strengths and we must believe we can beat them. We must focus on ourselves and respect the opponent. <br>  <br>"We didn't start that well and have already lost twice. But we have now started to win a couple of games in a row and we want to keep that going, beginning with Hull on Saturday."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rafa Benitez today urged his players to continue their good run of form by taking three points from Hull City at Anfield on Saturday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool are on a five-game winning streak and the Spaniard wants his team to keep the run going for as long as possible. <br>  <br>"It is important, especially in the Premier League, because you cannot lose too many games. For us it is important to win, if possible, every game," Benitez told his weekly press conference. <br>  <br>"I think at this moment with five wins in a row the mentality is really good. <br>  <br>"The strikers need confidence, the team needs confidence - so we are doing well. <br>  <br>"We are scoring goals and the players are going forward with energy and determination, and it is more difficult for the defenders to stop us. <br>  <br>"Sometimes people analyse things in a short time, but I think we have to wait and see how everything settles down, because it is too early. <br>  <br>"It is always the same - people say it is better to win one game than to draw two, but I think it is too early." <br>  <br></span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/babel/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ryan Babel</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> is one man hoping to have made a claim for a starting place after his run out against Leeds United in midweek. <br>  <br>Benitez believes the Dutch winger knows what he has to do in order to become a regular. <br>  <br>"Ryan clearly wants to improve. He knows that he has been here for three years, he knows the people and defenders too, and he knows what the fans want. <br>  <br>"He is working very hard. He was very good in pre-season, so he started the game against Tottenham - because he was doing really well. <br>  <br>"After the game we needed to change something, but again he is ready and you can see he is a threat for the defenders." <br>  <br>Benitez also praised </span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/torres/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, who scored two goals against West Ham last weekend. <br>  <br>"He is improving," said the gaffer. "I had to answer questions about his fitness - people were saying he is not fully fit, he is not ready, and one week later people are saying he is fantastic; he is on fire. <br>  <br>"I think everybody can see that he is improving and doing well and hopefully he can continue doing the same for us this weekend." <br>  <br></span><a class="red" href="http://buses.sgforums.com/team/squad/johnson/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> has settled into life at Anfield very quickly and the Liverpool manager believes he can be a potent weapon in attack. <br>  <br>"Arbeloa was a very consistent full-back who was quite good at going forward and quite good at defending. I think Glen is very, very dangerous in attack," said the boss. <br>  <br>"We were trying to bring in someone who could also create something in the right direction and he is doing really well in attack for us. <br>  <br>"He goes forward more frequently than Arbeloa and also is very good at crossing and can score goals. He has already scored two goals and I think he is a very good addition in attack." <br>  <br>Meanwhile, Benitez was quick to support Hull's under-fire manager Phil Brown, whose side currently sit second bottom of the Premier League. <br>  <br>He added: "You always have to support other managers, because you know how difficult the job is. <br>  <br>"When you are winning everyone is on your side, when you are not winning it is always more difficult, but we will see what happens after this weekend. <br>  <br>"You know I always want to win, but after the game I will wish him all the best." <br>  <br>Benitez was also asked about his opinion on the idea of having an independent adjudicator in charge of time-keeping following last week's Manchester derby in which United scored beyond the allocated injury time. <br>  <br>He said: "I have spoken about using videos for disputes, so maybe if we could have someone controlling the time it would be easier for the referee to be focusing on the game."</span></p>

              <p>It's good we saw Hull's goal , from there , it's all Liverpool .</p>
              <p>Gerrard's goal is currently The season's Best goal so far .</p>
              <p>World Class strike .</p>
              <p>I didn't know Phil Brown lost some ideas against us , i thought he's a brilliant tactician , but .... too bad .</p>
