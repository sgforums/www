This season has been really good and we've competed on all fronts. If we can sign one or two players then I'm really positive that we can improve.<br> <br>"I won't talk about any figures and I can't say how much we have."<br> <br>Benitez's confidence in his current crop stems from a record-breaking campaign in which the Reds took Alex Ferguson's men all the way.<br> <br>"I'm also positive because we were talking recently about how Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard didn't play together for a long time this season," he said. "Hopefully they will play together more next season.<br> <br>"We've also got good young players like David Ngog, Nabil El Zhar, Ryan Babel and Emiliano Insua, who was playing really well, coming through.<br> <br>"We have a very good squad but we can still improve a little bit.<br> <br><strong>Rafa on the city<br></strong>When I decided to sign a new contract I did it because Liverpool Football Club is more than a club. It is the heart of the city. It is our life and for the people here it means so much. I thought I had to sign. We have to fight. We have to do it.<br>"How much can we improve? Enough to win the title? I'm sure it will be enough to compete. Like this year, we will try to compete on all fronts until the end."<br> <br>Benitez's focus in recent months has been on ensuring the club keeps hold of its star names.<br> <br>Daniel Agger, Fernando Torres, Steven Gerrard and Dirk Kuyt have all followed their manager's lead by agreeing new deals.<br> <br>"Some clubs were asking for our players so the priority was to extend the contracts of our key players," he said. "Those players who are the spine of the team.<br> <br>"We spent some money to guarantee this and now we just have to improve a little bit because we are in a very good position."<br> <br>Benitez, who signed a new five-year contract back in March, celebrates five years as Liverpool manager next week.<br> <br>And his appetite for the job remains as healthy as ever.<br> <br>He added: "When I decided to sign a new contract I did it because Liverpool Football Club is more than a club.<br> <br>"It is the heart of the city.

We will see it again when we go to Asia in pre-season.<br> <br>"I receive a lot of letters from people talking about the club. And as I said before this is more than a club."</p></div>

              i can't agree more with this....
              
              ************************************************************
              
              The potential arrival of England full back Glen Johnson is a great move by Rafa Benitez.
              
              As we all sat and reviewed last season and argued about where and how we didnâ€™t win the league after losing just two games, I think 99% of us would have agreed our two weakest positions in the starting 11 are right back and left midfield/attack.
              
              The goalkeeper, centre backs, holding midfielders and front two pick themselves in our strongest 11. I personally value Kuytâ€™s place on the right hand side and am more than happy to have Aurelio and Insua fight it out at left back.
              
              Iâ€™m not suggesting Arbeloa is a weak player, but he is one of the weakest in our best 11. Clearly if we are to win the league these two positions are what need addressing this summer. The capture of Johnson addresses one and I hope to see the attacking left midfield berth next on Rafaâ€™s list.
              
              Much speculation has revolved around a new forward and how we must sign a top class player to play alongside Torres. I completely disagree with this train of thought. We have the best front two combination in World football in Torres and Gerrard. They link up perfectly, compliment each other and provide goals in abundance, why would we break that up? I said the same last summer when we signed Robbie Keane and that completely upset the balance of the team, why would we do that again?
              
              I no longer see Gerrard as a midfielder, and with Alonso and Mascherano why would we need him in there?
              
              Maybe we do need a forward as back-up to Torres, and that forward may indeed play a large percentage of games, but by no means should a forward be signed to be first choice alongside Torres. We currently have Kuyt as back-up, Ngog is maturing, Nemeth could break through if he has a good pre-season and another signing of good quality would add depth but is not crucial.
              
              What is crucial is that we add a player to improve the wide left spot. For me, Babel can leave as of the current squad he is the only player who we can get good money for and I wouldnâ€™t be overly upset to see go. That would leave only Riera and Benayoun as left side options. Both are good enough to be in our squad but neither are good enough to be first choice in a title winning side. Hopefully we can add somebody of real quality who can compliment the other attacking trio of Torres, Gerrard and Kuyt. Somebody who can offer something different, a creative spark.
              
              Obvious candidates are Valenciaâ€™s Davidâ€™s Silva and Villa. Iâ€™m not sure Villa would come to play on the left but Silva, who can easily interchange with Gerrard and Kuyt might be just the perfect foil. He would offer something different and be somewhat of a Luis Garcia type player with added quality and creativity.
              
              At the end of the season I earmarked Johnson and Silva as my two most wanted players, both would hugely improve both our squad overall and our starting 11. Both wonâ€™t come cheap but itâ€™s nice to finally see us competing and not losing out on targets to clubs with extra financial muscle.
              
              If we offload Arbeloa, Dossena, Babel and Voronin we would have around Â£25m. Add the supposed summer budget of Â£25m and you have Â£50m. Easy enough to fund Silva and Johnson and add two more squad players to improve us.
              
              If Arbeloa does leave obviously that leaves us still with little cover at right back. If Micah Richards is available for around Â£5m heâ€™d be worth a gamble and can provide that cover and also be the fourth choice centre back we need after Samiâ€™s departure.
              
              Iâ€™d also take a punt on Tuncay from Middlesbrough.
              
              So, my summer wishlist looks a bit like this;
              
              In:
              Johnson, Silva, Richards, Tuncay, back-up forward
              
              Out:
              Arbeloa, Dossena, Babel, Voronin (and Pennant)
              
              Something similar to that wouldnâ€™t cost the earth and be within budget but still improve our starting 11 and squad immensely.
              
              What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

              <div class="quote_from">hmmm quite true. To be honest i think kuyt is very underrated. i have said it many times, he may not be a very skillful type of player but he has contributed alot, it would take a long time to replace someone on the right should he be dropped.</div>
              <p>hopefully glen johnson can be perform consistently like he did for portsmouth and england. Though we dont know how much rafa can actually spend, i sure hope to see enough funds left to bring in a left sided player such as silva or even arjen robben.</p>

              <p>I've doubts on getting Tuncay.</p>
              <p>No doubt he has proven himself, if you would want Tuncay, why not Afonso Alves?</p>
              <p>Again, Johnson is a good signing, not particularly good, but good. I also noticed the soft Right back position played by Arbeloa and the left midfield. I hope Liverpool could find the cash and put in on Silva.</p>
              <p>Regarding Micah Richards, he has the potential to become something great. But it will be a gamble. Since he is still young and learning.</p>
              <p>The second striker position could be given to Balotteli, a regular in Inter. He has good dribbling skills and good finishing. Although there are questions to his discipline, his skills are genuine.</p>
