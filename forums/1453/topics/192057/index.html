            <div class='col-md body'>Manchester United have sacked the doctor responsible for Wayne Rooney's recovery from a metatarsal injury, although the club deny his departure has anything to do with the treatment of the England star.<br><br>Dr Mike Stone has been at Old Trafford for ten years but saw his time at the northern giants ended after an internal dispute.<br><br>Stone had been overseeing Rooney's bid to get fit for the World Cup finals, giving updates to England counterpart Leif Sward, and leaves the club with the striker set to undergo a crucial scan on Thursday.<br><br>The nation's hopes are resting on the results of the test which will determine whether Rooney's rapid recovery has enabled him to partake in the group stages, with previous reports indicating he could even be ready for the opening game against Paraguay.<br><br>However Dr Stone will no longer be the man to guide Rooney to fitness after the club confirmed his departure.<br><br>"We can confirm that Dr Stone has left the club," read a club statement.<br><br>"There was a difference of opinion on a non-football and non-clinical issue, as a result of which Dr Stone felt it to be in his and the club's best interests for him to leave.<br><br>"The difference was over a non-clinical issue and had nothing whatsoever to do with any medical treatment to any Manchester United player."<br><br>Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson has always been keen to play down talk of Rooney recovering quickly, and there have even been suggestions that United do not want to see their most valuable asset turn out in Germany.<br><br>However club captain and England right-back Gary Neville has since rubbished such claims, insisting United will treat the case fairly and that they have their fingers crossed Rooney will recover.</div>
