            <div class='col-md body'>quite surprise at his choice , but come to think of it , he has his reason , one obviously reason is experience in International level , Heskey does have some good WC experiences .<br><br>See ... Rooney is much like a holding ball player , he holds the ball , and distribute from midfield , and England need one player that is as physical as Rooney , that can do similair assignment , plus experience in that level , and England really lacking a player in that calibre , and at this current stage , Heskey is the best option , can you name one better player with such experience , and can be rely on ?<br><br>And secondly , if England does need a holding player , Crouch can also do a decent job , but what happen if Crouch is injured ? Heskey will come in handy .<br><br>Heskey comes in as a versatile choice between Rooney and Crouch .<br><br>After Rooney's injury , England's strategy has to change , now it looked like England are going to play what Liverpool had done , played a holding player and the scoring duties is assignment not only to striker , but to all the players from the midfield .<br><br>Emile Heskey no good ? Can you find another player that can do a out-and-out striker , a holding player , and a winger jobs as well ?<br><br>That's my opinion la .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wenger tells Sven: Take a gamble on Walcott<br><br>Arsene Wenger has urged England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson to take a 'big gamble' by taking Theo Walcott to the World Cup.<br><br>The teenage forward joined Arsenal from Southampton in January for a fee which could rise to Â£12million, however he has yet to make his first-team debut.<br><br>Nevertheless, Wenger feels Walcott could be a potent weapon in Germany this summer, where England could have to make do without star striker Wayne Rooney.<br><br>The Arsenal boss declared: 'I think he has something special. He could be a pleasant surprise, but, of course, it is a big gamble.<br><br>'Theo is only 17 years old and it is a big pressure to have - but I would not stop Sven from picking him.<br><br>'When Sven asks me about a player, I always give him my opinion - and I regard Walcott as a big prospect.'<br><br>Wenger admits Walcott, who had been troubled by a shoulder problem in recent weeks, 'needs games' and accepted: 'At the moment we are playing so many matches that it is difficult to integrate him but he has the quality to do well.<br><br>'I have wanted for years now to be able to name at least 18 players in my squad - and if I had the choice to have a player like Walcott more involved in the A-team then I would and he would certainly have come on.<br><br>'For example, when you are 3-0 up at Sunderland rather than bringing on an older player I would say 'Okay, go on and have 20 minutes'. Then you could afford to do it.<br><br>'But when you pick the squad before the game you are thinking that it will be a very tight game and you take an experienced player because you are at a stage when every point counts.<br><br>'However, if I had room for 18, I would put in him in and then when the score is 3-0, I could put him on.'<br><br>Wenger understands Eriksson's dilemma over Rooney, the Manchester United striker having suffered a broken foot which is likely to rule him out for at least six weeks.<br><br>However, the Arsenal boss can see the reasoning behind the Swede's keenness to take the 20-year-old.<br><br>Wenger said: 'I am quite keen on that. You can afford one, but not three who are half-ready. Rooney is the exception you can afford.'<br><br>Wenger reflected: 'I have to remind you of one thing - France won the World Cup with one striker that did not score a goal. It can help the team. They (forwards) scored zero goals and before the tournament all the focus is on who can score - but France won when their strikers scored no goals.'<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I think it would be a crazy decision to name Theo Walcott..........rather name Deah Ashton,Marlon HareWood,Darren Bent,Defoe,Crouch and other not so recongized striker to be alongside owen instead of walcott</span></div>
