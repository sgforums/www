            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">It's difficult to get players when we're European Champion .<br><br>Especially when Benitez and Parry are extremely cautious about those money issues .<br><br>Those Benfica bosses also one kind . That initial 10m pounds was agreed at the first place , right ? B4 they allowed Simao to talk to LFC ? If they did agreed and last minute jacked up the prices to 13.6m, is a bit unfair in the position of LFC . </span></div>
