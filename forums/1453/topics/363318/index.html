            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Lavezzi's advisor issues warning over Liverpool bid</strong><br><br>Ezequiel Lavezzi's advisor has put further pressure on Napoli by insisting the Italian club must allow the player to speak to Liverpool about a possible transfer.<br><br>Serie A club Napoli have insisted that Lavezzi, believed to be one of Rafael Benitez's top transfer targets for the summer, is not for sale and have refused to comment on Liverpool's interest.<br><br>But on Monday, in a move which is unlikely to help push the deal to a satisfactory conclusion for either the player or Benitez, Lavezzi's advisor Eduardo Rossetto has told Napoli they must allow talks to take place.<br><br>The 24-year-old Argentina forward, who still has four years left on his contract with Napoli, scored seven goals in 30 league starts last season and is one of Europe's hottest properties. It is thought Liverpool have made an offer in the region of £20m for the player, who has also been linked with Manchester City.<br><br>Lavezzi has already written an open letter the club's fans criticising the way he has been treated and the general consensus is that he will not be at the club for 2009-10 season.<br><br>''Liverpool's proposal is true,'' said Rossetto. ''(Napoli general director Pierpaolo) Marino has met twice with FIFA agent Pablo Cosentino, who has invited him to set up a meeting in Liverpool or in Naples with the English outfit.<br><br>''Ezequiel has tried several times to speak to Marino but he has received no response. If Napoli have decided to take this extreme position, so will we. We don't want to force Napoli to sell the player but I think it is correct for the club just to consider the offer, to judge it whether it's sufficient or not.''<br><br>Lavezzi, who joined Napoli in the summer of 2007, has previously played for San Lorenzo and Estudiantes. He has two full international caps to his name and was part of the Argentina squad which won Gold at the 2008 Olympic Games.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Benitez not interested in Lavezzi</strong><br><br>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has dismissed suggestions he is trying to sign Napoli striker Ezequiel Lavezzi.<br><br>There were claims in Italy on Monday that Napoli had been approached by an agent acting as an intermediary for Liverpool over a possible £15m deal for the 24 year-old Argentina international.<br><br>And the player's advisor Eduardo Rossetto insisted that "Liverpool's proposal is true."<br><br>However, Benitez said on Tuesday: "We never contacted Lavezzi and we have no intention of doing so. We want to put a stop to these rumours."<br><br>Liverpool have also reaffirmed their position on Javier Mascherano, who has been linked with Barcelona, insisting the player is not for sale.<br><br>Benitez will no doubt be displeased to learn that Mascherano's agent claims the midfielder would like to join Barcelona.<br><br>Walter Tamer told the 'Tu diras' programme on RAC1: "If a club like Barcelona wants to strengthen its squad after having won everything and having completed a brilliant season, obviously the player is going to say yes, we want to play there.<br><br>"It would make Javier very proud that a club like Barcelona pay him attention after such an incredible year. I believe a transfer would be feasible.<br><br>"I've spoken to (Barca sporting director) Txiki Begiristain, but we have not been in touch for some time."</p></div>
