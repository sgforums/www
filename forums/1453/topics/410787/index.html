              After four league matches thus far this season, the Merseyside giants find themselves in thirteenth place, and the former Fulham manager insisted that he does not set targets.<br><br> “I find it amusing teams are discussing that after four games,” he told reporters after the match.<br><br>“That's the annoying thing. I don’t set targets. I don't know [if can win league]. Well take every game as it comes.”<br><br>Once again, star striker Fernando Torres looked lacklustre in attack, as the Spaniard’s off-colour start to the Premier League season continued.<br><br>But his manager refused to criticise his striker, before claiming that he has no concerns regarding Torres’ current form.<br><br>“I think he's working hard for the team. As we saw towards the end of game, he's a constant thorn in the side of defenders,” argued Hodgson.<br><br>“I think they [the Birmingham defenders] should get credit for sticking so close to him.<br><br>Hodgson continued: “We know he lacks match training. I'm not at all concerned about Fernando Torres, he'll get better and better. Our passing wasn't good enough to get them on the ball”<br><br>Reflecting on the match in general, Hodgson admitted that his side was frustrated by the exuberance of the home side, before conceding that goalkeeper Pepe Reina played a pivotal role is keeping the opposition at bay.<br><br>"They played extremely well the first half. We started well but around 15 minutes before half-time they really pressurized the ball well and made life very difficult for us," Hodgson told <em>Sky Sports</em> after the game.<br><br>"We were dependant on two very good saves from Pepe Reina, from two excellent crosses and headers, he made really good saves.<br><br>"I thought we kept our shape well during that period and kept working at it and I thought the longer the game went on, maybe the stronger we were getting. <br><br>"But I have got to say it was a good performance in particular from the Birmingham team but I'm not that disappointed with our performance either."<br><br>Hodgson added that he needs time to get his ideas across at Liverpool, with only four games into the season gone.<br><br>"It's early days for me, we have a lot of players coming into the team and trying to come to terms of what we are asking of them. But in the end I think it was a very entertaining nil-nil." <br></div>
