              <p>Liverpool's
               topsy-turvey summer took a dramatic twist this morning with reports 
              that a group of investors from the Middle East and Canada are poised to 
              pip Kenny Huang to a full takeover of the club.</p>
              <p>Just 24 hours 
              after the saga appeared over, with Chinese tycoon Huang laying a formal 
              bid on the table, it is understood Syria international Yahya Kirdi is in
               advanced talks with the Anfield hierarchy.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Kirdi's group are negotiating with co-owners George Gillet and Tom 
              Hicks, and are close to finalising a purchase price, repayment of debt 
              and financing for Liverpool's planned new stadium in Stanley Park.</p>
              <p>Huang's
               offer of below £300m is almost half the amount being sought by the 
              American duo which is why Gillet is understood to have introduced Kirdi 
              to senior Anfield staff and the Royal Bank of Scotland, to which the 
              club owes a reported £250m.</p>
              <p>'Liverpool is a massive football 
              club with passionate and proud fans in Merseyside and in every part of 
              the world,' Kirdi, a Unicef representative, is quoted as saying on Sky 
              Sports News.</p>

              <p>The
               unpopular Liverpool owners put the club up for sale in May, appointing 
              Martin Broughton as chairman to oversee the process. Barclays Capital 
              have also been hired to assist.</p>
              <p>Star man Fernando Torres yesterday offered some hope to the Anfield faithful by committing his future to the club. </p>

              <p>Syrian businessman Yahya Kirdi says he's in talks about a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> buyout.</p>
              <p>Kirdi, who represents a group of investors from the Middle East and 
              Canada, has said a price has been agreed and a formal purchase agreement
               "is in the final stage of negotiation".</p>
              <p>A statement from Kirdi said: "The group is in advanced negotiations with Thomas Hicks and George Gillett, co-owners of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> Football Club, to purchase 100 per cent of the club.</p>
              <p>"Agreement has been reached on all major terms including the purchase 
              price, repayment of the existing bank debt from RBS and Wells Fargo and 
              financing of a new stadium in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>'s Stanley Park. A formal purchase agreement between the parties is in the final stage of negotiation."</p>
              <p>Kirdi is a resident of Canada and a former Syria international who 
              oversees investments in Europe and North America on behalf of his 
              investor group, said the statement.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> is a massive football club with passionate and proud fans in Merseyside and in every part of the world," said Kirdi.</p>
              <p>"With additional money to improve the squad and financing in place to 
              build the new stadium, LFC will be on a solid foundation to compete in 
              the Premiership and in Europe for years to come."</p>
