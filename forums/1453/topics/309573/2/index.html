              <p>tt's why fergie is not retiring. he wants to be the one eclipsing liverpool's record and forever have his name in the folklore of man u as the greatest ever; player or manager.</p>
              <p>my worry is that he has a realistic chance of doing it. if arsenal fumble again, then we have a problem. the best scenario is for arsenal to beat liverpool in the EPL and liverpool exact revenge in the CL.</p>
