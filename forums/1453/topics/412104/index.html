              <p>What's up guys? I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on the game earlier.</p>
              <p>Like you, I was left frustrated by Red's inability to take the game to their opponents, and for much parts of the game, they appeared lightweight and detached from the game's objective.</p>
              <p>Ugh, I know.</p>
              <p>Read more here: <a href="http://aredthing.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/fc-utrecht-0-liverpool-0-1-points-earned/">http://aredthing.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/fc-utrecht-0-liverpool-0-1-points-earned</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, 'BitStream vera Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 12px; color: #555555;">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If there’s one sure thing to Liverpool’s game these days it’s how consistent they’ve become, and how lucky they are to get even a point.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Let’s not talk about how consistent the boardroom/ownership drama is getting shall we?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As always they start brightly, concede domination after 20minutes to the opposing team, allow a few scary moments in our own penalty box, and be really poor with our final ball to the strikers to make them look like they’re struggling to come back to match fitness and end the half abjectly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So many times did Meireles, as did Joe Cole after receiving the ball in a good area, hopelessly flick it off or lay it to Torres neither with conviction nor direction, and both performed direly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So many times did Liverpool’s midfielders dribble, dribble, and dribble for far too long when a simple lay off to a teammate, followed by a lung busting off-the-ball run in the hope of getting a return through-ball, was really all that was required.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">On paper, and in the first 15minutes, Liverpool were a force to be reckoned, and I say this not just historically or via paper rounds, as FC Utrecht trotted onfield likened to a bunch of groupies in their idol’s presence.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But the magical dust from Liverpool’s players soon wore off, FC Utrecht played as brilliantly as they could, and Liverpool were subjects of a disallowed goal, a veritable (Carragher-induced) penalty claim and a showcase of football that plays to the tune of “The team’s only as strong as it’s weakest link”.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; line-height: 19px; font-size: 16px;">Read more here: <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://aredthing.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/fc-utrecht-0-liverpool-0-1-points-earned/">http://aredthing.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/fc-utrecht-0-liverpool-0-1-points-earned</a></span></p>

              <p>i agree with them passing without any conviction and direction. hardly can we see a pass connect.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;">An lackluster Liverpool side were held to a goalless draw at Utrecht despite manager Roy Hodgson fielding an attacking side.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left;">Liverpool got the game underway and immediately settled down, playing a fast paced style of football in order to try and set the tempo of the game.<br><br>A few sloppy passes from Liverpool then presented the home side with the first chance of the game.<br><br>A long cross-field pass  fell to Edouard Douplan after Joe Cole’s attempted clearance, the striker then took a touch before firing wide of Pepe Reina’s goal <br><br>After ten minutes, Liverpool had their first chance of the game when Raul Mereiles showed some neat footwork to create space on the edge of the area but his shot was fired straight at Michel Vorm.<br><br>Joe Cole, Dirk Kuyt  and Mereiles then linked up well outside the home side’s penalty area before the Dutchman lofted  in a ball towards Fernando Torres but the striker was too static.<br><br>Utrecht then had a good spell of possession and created a decent chance.<br><br>Jacob Mulenga was sent through on goal and after choosing not to lob the advancing Reina, he was forced wide by Martin Skrtel and shot way wide of the goal.<br><br>In typical end to end fashion, it was then Liverpool who created a few half chances.<br><br>Firstly, after advancing down the right wing, Glen Johnson whipped in a testing cross but once again Torres was not on the same wave length as his team mate.<br><br>Johnson was in the thick of the action again just minutes later as he found some space to send in a ball which found Mereiles just inside Utrecht’s box but his header could only find Vorm.<br><br>The home side then had the ball in the back of the net following a corner as Mulenga’s nod down was volleyed in by Jan Wuytens. But the referee had blown for a foul as Mulenga appeared to lean on Jamie Carragher. <br><br>An intelligent overlap from Tim Cornelisse provided him with the chance to centre, which he did brilliantly. And it was some good goalkeeping down at his front post from Reina that kept the ball out before Martin Kelly cleared the ball to safety.<br><br>After 30 minutes, Torres showed the first glimpse of what he can do as he collected the ball deep in the opponents half before swiveling and firing at goal from a tight angle. Vorm was rooted to the spot and could only watch the ball fly just wide of the right hand post.<br><br>With seven minutes remaining in the half, the home side should have taken the lead after some very lazy defending by Kuyt. Utrecht were rewarded a corner and a half-cleared header from Kelly, Kuyt stood and watched as Dried Mertens collected the ball inside the penalty area and advanced on goal and only for some smart ‘keeping were Liverpool able to clear.<br><br>Both sides continued to battle for an opener before the half-time whistle, but neither could get the goal and after an entertaining 45 minutes, the referee blew the whistle for half time.<br><br></div>
              <p style="text-align: left;">The second half began in a fast paced manor, similar to that of the first half and it was the visitors that started the brightest during the opening minutes but they lacked invention and were unable to test Vorm.<br><br>However, they were soon pegged back as Utrecht started to dominate possession. The hosts began to pass the ball around smartly, looking relaxed on the ball and bombarded the Liverpool penalty area with testing crosses.<br><br>After a smart attack from the Dutch side, Liverpool broke away with Johnson down the right hand side who crossed for Cole. The England international was unable to control and the ball fell to Torres who steadied himself but fired a long way over.<br><br>Minutes later, Utrecht were rewarded a free kick on the edge of the box after Johnson committed a foul. From the resulting free kick, the home side gained a corner and should have scored from the set-piece. <br><br>Mertens crossed the ball deep into the box which Reina completely missed and it fell to Cornelisse who could only knee it up into the air. The ball was cleared off the line and the English side went on the counter attack.<br><br>Former Utrecht player Kuyt ventured down the right before teeing up Torres who shot from six yards out only to see his effort  miraculously turned wide from Vorm.<br><br>Both sides then exchanged possession and chances without really testing either goalkeeper but on the stoke of the hour, Liverpool defender Skrtel almost put his side in front.<br><br>Portuguese star Mereiles sent in a dangerous ball which found the head of his team mate Skrtel who headed the ball at goal but could only find the cross bar. <br><br>Three minutes later, World Cup winner Torres was gifted a glorious chance as Mihai Nesu’s backpass fell short which Torres latched on to. But the advancing Vorm forced him wide and the striker could only run the ball out for a goal kick.<br><br>Michael Silberbauer then unleashed a rocket of a shot towards Reina’s goal after Carragher had missed a clearance but it flew just wide.<br><br>On the 83rd minute, some awful Liverpool defending allowed Mulenga to sneak between Carragher and Kelly but his shot flew narrowly wide.<br><br>With time running out, substitute Maxi Rodriguez nearly broke the deadlock with a fine overhead kick but the effort flew over the bar.<br><br>Neither side was able to break the deadlock and Liverpool may feel lucky to leave Holland with a point.</p>
