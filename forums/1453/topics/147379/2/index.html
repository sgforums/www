            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CoolMyth:</div><div class="quote_body">Personal comments of the game:<br><br>Liverpool obviously still lacked the confidence and swagger to keep attacking the opposition instead of keeping possession and looking for loopholes in the defence. You can see it from all the loose balls and passes and the results in the final third of the field.<br><br>Benitez shall give even more attacking mindset to Liverpool, since they have a rather stable and good defence. Attacking through the centre does not work in the EPL, since EPL talks about hard tackles and knocks to disrupt opponents.<br><br>Chelsea is strong because they have the twin terrors of Robben and Duff. Man U and Arsenal also use the flanks very often. Liverpool kept trying to attack through the centre and it's very frustrating to see them lose the ball.<br><br>Luis Garcia at right midfield simply CMI. I hope he's a temporary option. Now, I see him as a squad player rather than a first team player. I'm surprised that they didn't use Zenden often to attack the flanks, maybe because of the boos from Middlesborough. In the end, what happen, Stevie G was on left flank, Cisse on the right.....OMG....<br><br>The entire team needs more confidence, determination and luck. Other than the wingers and the strikers, the entire team actually played well. Sissoko looks impressive though he can improve further. Alonso has those probing balls and Stevie G was all over the place. But they need to keep attacking more like in the last ten minutes.....<br><br>Disappointing result this.....I almost can't sleep last night.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>it is only a match.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents thought on the match.<br><br>I thought it was an okay match, being the first game away to a good Boro side. There is only one team that is likely to win the game and that is not Boro. However, I thought Cisse is a better candidate for a lone striker than Moro. He is slow and can't hold the ball well. But only after Moro has gone Liverpool started to play wide and won freekicks in wide areas. So I don't understand. Also, I thought with a lone striker, Gerrard was supposed to be playing in front of the midfield to support Moro. But he was too deep most of the time, especially in the 1st half.<br><br>This brings me to one question. How to accomodate 3 impressive midfielders? I thought Sissoko did very well. He is indeed going to be the next Viera. Of course we cannot leave out Gerrard. So it is either we play Alonso and put Gerrard in a more advanced role with a lone striker, or leeave out Alonso and go for two strikers.<br><br>I reckon that in home games, Sissoko or Alonso is not likely to be involved and in away games, only  one striker will be deployed.</div>
