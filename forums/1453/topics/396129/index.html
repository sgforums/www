              Spurs and City</h1>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/09/article-0-090E7996000005DC-442_233x423.jpg" alt="Liverpool Manager Rafael Benitez" width="233" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Warning: Liverpool Manager Rafael Benitez</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Rafael Benitez has warned Manchester City and Tottenham that the 
              pressure is on them to stop Liverpool from winning the race for fourth.</p>
              <p>Benitez's side host Fulham tomorrow in what may prove to be a dress 
              rehearsal for the Europa League Final.</p>
              <p>Although they will have 
              played more games, victory would put them
              level with Tottenham and one point behind City, who kick off an hour
              later at home to Birmingham.</p>
              <p>Liverpool remain outsiders to claim the fourth place Benitez
              guaranteed earlier in the season, but he hopes the pressure will tell
              on his rivals if they can win their remaining five games.</p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini was at Anfield on Thursday night to see
              Liverpool beat Benfica 4-1 and Benitez said: 'He will see our team is
              strong and he knows that they have to win their games.</p>
              <p>'You never know what they think, but they are in a good position
              and, if they lose, it will be more through their fault so they will be
              more under pressure - especially if they make a mistake in their next
              one or two games.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, it is believed that owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett
              may stand aside and appoint an independent chairman in a bid to attract
              investment. The duo's refusal to listen to a £110m offer from the Rhone
              Group for a 40 per cent stake sparked an outspoken response from
              Benitez this week.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>It came as Hicks and Gillett held talks 
              with their advisors in London ahead of a summer deadline to reduce the 
              club's £237m debts.</p>
              <p>The unpopular owners could stand aside even 
              if they do not decide to sell a stake, with British Airways chairman 
              Martin Broughton one of the business heads being considered.</p>

              can't believe it, didn't he say he was going to focus on the games rather than the speculations going on around him that he was going to leave?
              
              now he's trying to stir up a war.

              for starters(next season), liverpool should get a striker to pair up with torres to play a 442 instead of 4231.
