              The Football Association has denied that Manchester United pressurised them into not allowing Liverpool physio Dave Galley to work with England's senior side. 
              
              Galley, who works in Liverpool's academy, had been promoted from his role with the England Under 21s by coach Fabio Capello for the friendly against Holland earlier this month.
              
              But reports claim that United were not happy with Galley working with their players, and as such he has now returned to his U21 duties.
              
              However, the FA has moved swiftly to deny that they were forced into action because of pressure from United.
              
              "Dave has reverted back to the Under 21s after one game," said an FA spokesman. 
              
              "There should be no questions against his professionalism. We must be clear that there is an agreed board policy that has nothing to do with Manchester United that the medical staff should be independent, that is why we recruited doctor Ian Beasley and Gary Lewin from Arsenal Football Club.
              
              "Franco Baldini (Capello's general manager) and Rafael BenéŸ™ez (the Liverpool manager) discussed the matter and it was explained we wanted to see Dave working with the team in the friendly this month. 
              
              "We refute any suggestion that we have been pressurised by Manchester United."

              <p>According to today’s <em>Times</em> newspaper Manchester United have moved to stop a Liverpool physio working with the England national team.</p>
              <p>Dave Galley has been working as a physiotherapist in football for more than 25 years and was to join up with the England medical staff for the upcoming friendly against Slovenia and the World Cup qualifier against Croatia. But David Gill, who is the chief executive of Man Utd and a senior member of the FA board, stepped in with the end result being that Galley would not join up with the full squad and remain as physio to the Under-21’s.</p>
              <p>David Gill is believed to have suggested that the Liverpool physio would gain valuable information about the fitness of players from other teams.</p>
              <p>An FA spokesman said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“Dave has reverted back to the Under-21s after one game.</p>
              <p>“There should be no questions against his professionalism, We must be clear that there is an agreed board policy that has nothing to do with Manchester United that the medical staff should be independent.</p>
              <p>“Franco Baldini (Capello’s general manager) and Rafael Benítez (the Liverpool manager) discussed the matter yesterday and it was explained we wanted to see Dave working with the team in the friendly this month. We refute any suggestion that we have been pressurised by Manchester United</p>
