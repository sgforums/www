Where is he now?<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Extract from Liverpool's official website... of cos:<br><br>Cannock's finest export Stanley Victor Collymore became Liverpool's record signing during the summer of 1995 when Roy Evans paid Nottingham Forest Â£8.5 million for one of football's hottest properties.<br><br>Everton also made a bid for Collymore but the striker wanted to join the Reds. After an excellent pre-season, Collymore made an explosive Anfield debut with a stunning goal on the opening day of the 1995-96 season in a 1-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday.<br><br>However, in his next game at Leeds United he was injured and missed the following three games. Again though he bounced back in style with another stunning strike from 30-yards in a 3-0 win over reigning champions Blackburn Rovers at Anfield.<br><br>Despite these spectacular strikes Collymore struggled to settle. He scored just two goals in seven starts and was dropped to the bench with Robbie Fowler and Ian Rush paired in attack. Frustrated, Collymore took his problems out in the open and a controversial magazine interview, when he questioned Roy Evans tactics and criticised the club, did little to help his cause.<br><br>After a clear the air meeting with Evans, Collymore began to do his talking where it mattered and established himself as a Kop favourite. Restored to the attack, he formed an excellent partnership with Robbie Fowler. Collymore scored 17 goals and created countless others for the likes of Fowler, and played his part in a quite extraordinary 4-3 thriller at Anfield against Newcastle United.<br><br>Collymore scored twice that night including an incredible injury time winner, which proved to be his finest moment as a Liverpool player, but the season ended on a depressing low when Liverpool lost the FA Cup Final to Manchester United, and a below par Collymore was substituted.<br><br>The following season, which turned out to be Collymore's last at Anfield, was even more controversial. He found himself in and out of the side and, to make matters worse, he refused to turn out for the reserves at Tranmere Rovers one midweek evening and was fined. Another major problem was his refusal to live closer to Liverpool, and he commuted from his home in Cannock.<br><br>With the emergence of Michael Owen Liverpool cut their losses and sold Collymore to Aston Villa, the team he supported as a boy for Â£7 million. However the striker was to have further off field problems which tarnished his career. After undergoing treatment for stress Collymore moved to Leicester City but after a good start he had an argument with manager Peter Taylor.<br><br>Bradford City then took a chance of the enigmatic striker and sure enough he made an electric start with a magnificent overhead kick in the derby with Leeds United, but it all ended too early with the Bantams cutting their wage bill.<br><br>Collymore then tried his luck in Spain with Real Oviedo but after being told he was overweight and having to settle for a role on the bench he decided to quit. Sensationally announcing his decision to retire from football at the age of 30, Collymore said he was hanging up his boots "to explore other career opportunities."</div>
