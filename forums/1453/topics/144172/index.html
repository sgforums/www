            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez admits he knows little about his side's opponents in tonight's Champions League qualifier - but is confident of getting a positive result.<br>FBK Kaunas, the Lithuanian champions, are halfway through their league programme - 15 points behind the leaders - and could have the edge on the European champions in the fitness stakes.<br><br>BenitezÂ’s 25-man squad arrived yesterday straight from their Swiss training camp knowing they must not slip up in the second qualifying round first-leg clash.<br><br>Benitez said: Â“When you play against teams you know little about - we have only one video and one report - the most important thing is your own team. You just think about yourselves, how to improve, how to make things better.<br><br>Â“We do not know much about them, so we have to concentrate on our game. It was the same against TNS in the last round, if we work on our own play it will work out fine.<br><br>Â“You must work on your weak points and how to be better. I think our team is playing well in pre-season, we are scoring many goals and in the official games we have kept two clean sheets.Â”<br><br>Benitez has Peter Crouch ready for his competitive debut, and the former Valencia boss added: Â“Peter Crouch played well in his first friendly on Saturday, and we have more options. We have five strikers and that is not too many.<br><br>Â“When you are considering playing six competitions in a season you need as many players as you can find. Last season there were times when we had just one striker who was fit, at least it is better now.<br><br>Â“Players can play in different positions and that will help me now, then we need to decide about the future."<br><br>The Anfield chief refused to rule out a move for Luis Figo and underlined he is happy with Milan Baros' pre-season form, despite the striker being linked with a possible move away from Anfield.<br><br>Â“Milan is training really well, scoring goals and doing well and I am happy with the job he is doing. As for Figo, we do not have anything new to say,Â” he said.<br><br>Liverpool are also expected to give a competitive match debut to Mohamed Sissoko.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool are expected to give competitive debuts to new signings Peter Crouch and Mohamed Sissoko on Tuesday when they continue their defence of the European Cup against Lithuanian side Kaunas.<br>Boss Rafael Benitez is taking a full 25-man squad to Lithuania for the second qualifying round first leg tie following their third successive friendly victory against Olympiakos.<br><br>Steve Finnan (illness) and Djimi Traore (leg injury) are both doubts.<br><br>The Anfield chief is expected to field his strongest side possible to avoid any upsets against a team who are halfway through their own league programme and fully match fit.<br><br>Benitez has named Milan Baros in his squad despite speculation over the future of the Czech Republic striker have been rife since he was omitted from both matches against TNS in the last round.<br><br>The 23-year-old has scored five goals in pre-season friendlies, two in the 4-3 defeat of Olympiakos on Saturday.<br><br>The Spanish coach said: Â“Milan is in the squad and he can play against Kaunas, it is a possibility. He is our player, we will see what the possibilities are, we will see [on Tuesday].<br><br>Â“He is here, in the squad and can play. He is happy and training well, he is playing and scoring goals, of course he is happy.Â”<br><br>Liverpool (from): Reina, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Riise, Traore, Potter, Luis Garcia, Alonso, Gerrard, Hamann, Sissoko, Zenden, Le Tallec, Cisse, Baros, Crouch, Morientes, Carson, Warnock, Josemi, Medjani, Whitbread.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LFC.TV : <span style="font-style: italic;">Everton manager David Moyes might have expressed his fears that the Blues could be pitted against the Reds in Friday's Champions League draw but an all-Merseyside derby is exactly what Liverpool supporters are praying for.<br>Liverpool must still overcome FBK Kaunas in the return leg at Anfield before Rafael Benitez will concern himself with any thoughts about the Third Qualifying Round but in a poll on the official Liverpool website, 51% of fans claim they want to face Everton in the final qualifier.<br><br>Over 2,900 fans voted 'Yes, please', when asked if they'd like to be paired against Everton when the draw in made in Nyon on Friday.<br><br>On Thursday morning, Steven Gerrard claimed that he wouldn't be surprised if the two side were drawn against each other. "I'm sure it'd be a great occasion if we did draw Everton in the next round," revealed the club captain. "It'd be brilliant to see both clubs in the group stages but it'd be sod's law to draw each other on Friday and if it does happen, they'd be two fantastic games to look forward to. As a player, you want to play in big games and they wouldn't come much bigger than Liverpool and Everton playing off for a place in the Champions League group stages."<br><br>One person who will be hoping the two teams are kept apart however is Everton boss David Moyes. The Goodison manager yesterday told reporters: "I'm concerned about the draw, definitely. I've got clear concerns about what might happen. Of course, the decision as to who is seeded or not is nothing to do with us. We can't influence who is seeded and who is not, but I do think that it's wrong that two clubs from the same country - the same city, even - could be drawn against each other in European competition at this stage. You qualify for the Champions League in order to play teams from another country, not your local rivals. You don't usually expect to get one from your own country, let alone your own city, but there is only one club which is exposed to the fact that Liverpool have not been granted country protection, and that's Everton. That's a fact."<br><br>In a similar poll on the official Everton website, 63% of Everton supporters claimed they would like to avoid Liverpool in the draw .</span><br><br>Bring On The Toffeemen !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
