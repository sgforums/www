            <div class='col-md body'>With all the addition of the players and coach to the EPL, I am expecting more challenges next season in terms of game tactics and player's skill.<br><br>Man Utd - Dun think they can be any threat as long as Alex is still around. No more new tricks from him.<br><br>Arsenal - Was lucky that Henry is not down. Need to beef up the present squad for staying on top.<br><br>Chelsea - Most aggressive in the transfer market. Clearing house and building up new squad. Will see their strength when they tour USA. Will be a harder team to beat.<br><br>Boro - with the recent capture of players from other league, may string some surprises.<br><br>Newcastle - Still weak in the field of defence even though strengthen with purchase of new strikers. Will be the last season for Robson. I believe Alan will take over next year.<br><br>Spurs - With the major revamp in the coaching team, will be hard to see them not to stay within the ten position. May spring surprise victory against strong team like Arsenal.<br><br>The rest of the league - Dun see much news of the other team. May not have the funds to buy new players, maybe buying the ley long players from Leeds.<br><br>Liverpool - Look good on papers in terms of strike force. Midfield too dependent of Steven Gerrard - known to have mood swing. Defence too slow in reacting to pacy strikers. Dudek have stay long enough and only make an impression on the second season, known to make silly mistakes.<br><br>Phil Thompson and Sammy Lee gone.<br><br>Not sure whether the new manager will axe any excess players.<br><br>Diouf and Diao would definitely be holding on to their fat salary instead of moving on to low paying team.<br><br>Last season was relatively easy as the only team that have much changes is Chelsea.<br><br>This season will be filled with more new changes.<br><br>So, I dun think Liverpool can stay within the top three at the end of the season.</div>

That will be a break thru' eventually , but I dun see that happening this season !<br><br>We'll be a force within the next five years , maybe the EPL title will be heading to Merseyside by Benitez fourth year , not this season !<br><br>I don't care much to how Chelsea threw their money , I'm more concern with how we perform off and on the pitch ourself ! Off the pitch , we've got a terrific mamanger , we've got SG staying , Owen staying , Baros' back , and so far , Benitez has been trying to get a few new faces in , so , I foreseen a good Liverpool side for the next five years !

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun have high hopes of pool winning too, unless they start bringing in some new faces and discard trash like Diao and Biscan. But i dun know where the money is coming from after they buy Cisse. The appointment of Benitez was abit late because all the free transfers are snapped up already..... now i think only Kluivert is available on a free.</div>
