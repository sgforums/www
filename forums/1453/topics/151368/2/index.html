            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, I thought Garcia had a good game yesterday. Yes, he was still losing possession but not as much.<br><br>What's disappointing is why Xabi Alonso was not playing right from the start. Didi Hamann was playing but a pity he got hit in the head and was dizzy for the entire first half. Momo was good but he's still trying to get a hold of the situation. Stevie G was totally cancelled out by Carrick/Jenas. Did he make his trademark centre midfield runs yesterday? Not really.<br><br>Overall, fair result. But Reina is starting to scare me. KNN, miss the ball in the first half, anyhow ran out of the small box.....I hope this is not another GK jinx.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Spurs looked more dangerous going forward, but never really threatened.<br><br>LFC went close on a couple of occassions. Risse was unlucky and Cisse should have done better.<br><br>At the end of the day, Rafa should be the happier of the 2 managers. If consistency is what the LFC fans are looking for this season, I think Rafa's slowly getting it right. 2 draws away and a win at home so far, seems decent IMO.<br><br>The next 2 games will be bigger tests though. Away at Betis and the home crunch against United. I sense more draws to come.</div>
