              <p>next season, i think we will come up with something like this.</p>
              <p>but personally, i dont really like the idea of scott carson going to aston villa. rafa is going to come up with a total of 30M of transfer funds himself. plus the 20+M from owners, he'll have 50M. So guys, who do you he should go for? he already signed 2 defenders. i think he should go for wingers, players like aaron lennon, SWP or Quaresma. players who have pace or who can cut in defenders with entertaining styles. Man Utd have got Ronaldo, Chelsea have got J.Cole. we need players as such. Liverpool's playing style is way too boring to watch. it's doesnt provide that kind of entertainment that we fans seek forward for.</p>

              <p>I will never play 4-5-1 , with Torres lone front man .</p>
              <p>I will place Pennant on the right , Yossi out .</p>

              <p>this is if barry does come to pool. i believe rafa will keep faith in kuyt. babel should mature abit more by then already so his in the starting 11. babel and kuyt most probably will cut in to build a 3-prong attack. </p>
              <p>If babel is subbed, then kuyt will move in as striker role and pool switch to 442. with gerrard or barry in the centre with masch, while the sub is a pure wing player ( new signing or pennant/benayoun )<br><br>Bench : Itanje, degen, agger, benayoun, *new signing<br><br>hopefully rafa buys a good winger and the team looks strong, on paper that is. <br>This current liverpool team is definitely strong, its just that they failed to deliver on several occasions and drew way too many matches, if not they certainly are contenders for the title.</p>

              <p>i think it is too pre-mature to include people like barry into the scheme of things when he is not an official red. plan according to what we have now. also, if barry comes, it is widely believed tt crouch will head the other way.</p>
              <p>so i will reserve comment on my own 1st 11 until closer to the season when the player roster is confirmed.</p>

              <p>Disappointing signings to be honest. I was hoping we get some world-class players in the class of Torres or Mascherano but I guess the yanks are crippling Rafa's transfer funds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>Degen and Dossena are unknown quantities like Sktrel was. Hopefully they turn out to be as solid and impressive as Skrtel. And better at going FORWARD please! If they are 80% as good as Sagna or Clichy in going forward that would be great <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Barry doesn't excite me one bit. Hes a hardworker, can get up and down, pretty decent at set pieces, has a decent shot bout him, links up well with Gerrard and is consistent in producing 7/10 performances. BUT hes not world-class! Yes it is unrealistic to be expecting world-class players for every position (though Man Utd only had one or two positions without IMO), but the midfield is where games are generally won or lost. Barry just doesn't seem good enough against the big teams. We need more match winners and sadly Barry doesn't seem to be in that class of players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dream for Villa, Aguero, Quaresma, Alves, De Rossi... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> (just dreaming)</p>

              <p>true enough. liverpool signings this few seasons had been plain boring. beside the arrival of fernando torres, nothing really interests me. and esp the playing style of liverpool, really, irks me alot. althought we manage to finish 4th in both CL &amp; EPL. but still, i find that we have much more things to improve on. it will never feel good to be trash by rivals 3-0. (Manchester United) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for signings, liverpool hasnt been consistent enough thou. normally all we do is to express our interest for a certain player, but not much of actions after that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i strongly believe we need players with pace. this will speed up our counter attacks on flanks and mayb, this will prove to carry a positive effect on liverpool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Man Utd have tevez, nani, wayne, ronaldo, anderson, hargreases &amp; so on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We(Liverpool) only have S.Gerrard, Torres, Mascherano to be proud off -.-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>babel is a talent signing, but in my personally view, i find nani a better choice. much stronger in tacital views.</p>

              <h2>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez is reportedly preparing an ambitious bid for Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery…</h2>
              <p>The French international, widely tipped to star for <em>Les Bleus</em> at EURO 2008 next month, has catapulted himself to superstardom since his arrival in Bavaria last summer.<br><br>The
              25-year-old journeyman is now recognised as one of the most dangerous
              wingers in the game, alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and
              Lionel Messi.<br><br>His performances for Bayern have alerted some of
              the biggest clubs in Europe, and reports from Germany claim Liverpool
              will offer â‚¤20 million for the former Marseille man.<br><br>Benitez is
              keen to strengthen his attacking options over the summer, and has been
              monitoring a number of wide players, including La Liga stars Maxi
              Rodriguez and Albert Riera.<br><br>Ribery’s ability to play right
              across the pitch will no doubt attract the former Valencia boss, as
              will the Frenchman’s supreme understanding with Bayern hitman Luca Toni.<br><br>Benitez
              is planning to build a team around star striker Fernando Torres, and
              Ribery could prove a stunning addition alongside Dutch youngster Ryan
              Babel and Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard in the Reds’ 4-2-3-1
              formation.<br><br>However, as Bayern paid around â‚¤17 million for the
              former Marseille man only a year ago, Rafa and co may have to up their
              bid if they wish to prise one of Europe’s most exciting talents away
              from the Allianz Arena.</p>

              <p>yup, they are both full backs. but surely they have no problems operating on sides. just a matter of which side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>guys, if you all have notice .. during rafa's years, we didnt manage to beat any of the top 3 in the EPL. (correct me if im wrong, EPL NOT CL)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this surely sucks!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but rafa's side is strong at CL level thou.</p>
              <p>at least something to be prove of being a liverpool fan =)</p>
              <p>being able to bring home the CL cup in his first year manging is surely a remarkable achievment.</p>

              <p>Best left back but not in the Italy 23 man squad for Euros... I duno man lol...</p>
              <p>Degen didn't even start for Switzerland against Czech...</p>
              <p>Alonso leaving and Barry coming in.. *sigh</p>
              <p>I know ppl say Alonso no longer got form and all but I feel with him in the side at least our play have more rythme and fluidity..</p>
              <p>I really hope Barry justify his pricetag and Rafa's trust in him...</p>
              <p>Please Rafa! Someone to excite the fans? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Hi everyone. I'm here, and is please to see everyone.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think the main problem with Liverpool is not with our first XI, but the second XI. We need some wrld-class players to spare and rotate with our starters.</p>

              <p>The press have been writing Liverpool winning League title for the past 4 season.</p>
              <p>They sort of gave up last year.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will NEVER win the league title under Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>A coach that have to take half a season to finalise his team line-up is pretty weak and screwed.</p>
              <p>His presence have further influenced his player to play lousy before a CL match.</p>
              <p>His main focus is to capture as many CL cup as ever.</p>
              <p>EPL, FA Cup and League Cup were never his interest.</p>
              <p>I have faith in Ah Ben in nevering bringing the League Cup back to the cabinet cos he is not good enough.</p>
