            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, back to match discussion.<br><br>there's no way liverpool is going to win this match, even wif inclusive of Crouch as ur starting lineup! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>cos once Arsenal dominate the midfield completely, crouch will be completely isolate.<br><br>i believe wenger will know the threat of Crouch's height will be disadvantage to Arsenal players who are short. dat's why Arsenal will ensure dat no one will deliver the ball to him.<br><br>so the score will be 0-2 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>sorry bro poolman, but Gunners need the points as much as pool do so dat no one to overtake them.</div>

The title rivals square up at Anfield, with the Reds desperate to cut the Gunners' lead at the top of the Premier League. And Argentina ace Mascherano says Liverpool must outmuscle the leaders if they want to win.</strong><br><br>The midfielder said: "It's a massive game and the best thing is it will give us the chance to close the gap on the top. "It's the sort of game in which we can prove we are ready for a season-long challenge for the title. "On Sunday it is important we press them right up the field from the first minute and don't give them a minute's respite. We need to get at them."<br><br>Mascherano revealed his admiration for the stylish Gunners - and one man he is expected to come face-to-face with at Anfield. He added: "That's an easy one - Cesc Fabregas. Everything goes through him, he is the playmaker. "He is proving this season that he is one of the best in his position in the world. He's been doing well for a long time but is reaching a really fantastic level at the moment.<br><br>Mascherano also admitted that he sees his long-term future at Liverpool and wants to turn into the best team on the planet. The ex-West Ham man said: "I'd love to stay and I'll do everything I can to see that this happens. "It depends on what everyone decides at the end of the season.<br><br>"I've just got to make sure everyone's happy with my performances and they want me to stay. "From a personal point of view, I want to be here to play in the new stadium. "We are already one of the greatest clubs in the world - but with the plans for the future we could become the world great team."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think all the liverpool fans are secretly confident of beating the young gunners. Liverpool will be very fired up + home ground = almost surely liverpool will win this sunday. If cannot win, then liverpool really sux big time.</div>

The worst is to peak at the middle of season and finding no more energy again to peak at end of the season.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>even if they peaked early, even if their spirits wanes after a loss, i feel that arsenal have the quality and character to bounce straight back because u ve got to consider who is holding the reins now. Thats right, its arsene wenger, the one man all the players at arsenal look up to.<br><br>and who noes, mabbe they r just emulating the unbeatables team.</div>
