            <div class='col-md body'><p>Our record goalscorer feels Torres - who agreed a new deal at Anfield on Thursday - puts the team before personal glory by working as hard off the ball as he does on it. <br>  <br>This is something that was drummed into Rush by legendary managers such as Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. <br>  <br>"What I like about him is he doesn't give defenders time to rest on the ball," said Rush. <br>  <br>"If you close down the play like that, five times out of 10 the ball goes out of play and you've won it back. You've done your job. Of course you don't have to play that way, it depends which club you're at. <br>  <br>"I believe there are strikers who are happy to score whether they win, draw or lose. Thierry Henry for example. But I was brought up at Liverpool knowing the team comes first, goals second. <br>  <br>"My job was to make it harder for the opposition. If I could win the ball I'd close the defender down, which would make it easier for the midfield, who'd do the same for the defence. If you do it right, hopefully the goalkeeper doesn't touch the ball. We worked as a unit." <br>  <br>Torres has scored 50 in 83 appearances since arriving at Anfield from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2007. <br>  <br>His performances for Liverpool and Spain led to a Ballon d'Or nomination in 2008. <br>  <br>Rush believes such success would have been impossible without an astute footballing brain. <br>  <br>"A coach can do everything for you, but when you get on the pitch it can all change," said the Welsh great. "The difference between winning and losing is adapting, and doing so the quickest way – that's down to movement. <br>  <br>"The best strikers will adapt and think for themselves a bit quicker than anybody else. Torres does it at Liverpool now."</p></div>
