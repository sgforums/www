               Mascherano and Daniel Agger will not feature against Trabzonspor on 
              Thursday night after picking up injuries against Arsenal.</strong></p>

              <p>Mascherano sustained a pull in his calf while Agger is still 
              suffering from concussion after a ball to the face which has left him 
              with no recollection of Sunday's clash.</p>
              <p>Both players now face a race against time to be fit for Monday's match at Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Asked by reporters whether Mascherano was in his plans for the Europa
               League play-off, Roy Hodgson said: "Javier will always be in my plans 
              until the day comes when he leaves the club. And for me that will be a 
              long time in the future if I can get my wish. But he's injured at the 
              moment and won't play tomorrow.</p>
              <p>"He came off after about 80 minutes on Sunday with a slight pull in his calf muscles and has only just started to jog today.</p>
              <p>"The worry for us is that he won't be fit for Monday.</p>
              <p>"Daniel got concussed so he's not doing that well. We're three days 
              after the incident and he's still suffering from concussion and has got 
              no memory of the game.</p>
              <p>"We can only hope that it settles down in time for Monday's match 
              with Manchester City. There was never any question he'd be fit for 
              tomorrow.</p>
              <p>"He is resting. He was at the club this morning, I was talking to 
              him, but he's not able to do much at the moment because he's suffering 
              from headaches. Even something as simple as reading a newspaper or 
              watching TV can give him a headache so he needs to take it easy. I know 
              how he feels doing all these press conferences!"</p>
              <p>Mascherano's absence could open the door for new boy Christian Poulsen to make his Liverpool bow.</p>
              <p>Hodgson added: "He's in the squad. I haven't picked the team yet but 
              he's in the squad and there's a chance he'll appear tomorrow.</p>
              <p>"We'll only find out when he plays if he's fit. He's only played 
              20-25 minutes in a friendly match for Juventus. He's done a lot of 
              physical training so in that respect he's right up there with the rest 
              of the players but he hasn't played a lot of football and so is not 
              match fit.</p>
              <p>"But he's a quality player. He's been at Schalke, Seville, Juventus 
              and now Liverpool.  The players here are like the ones he's played with 
              in the past and his quality is Liverpool quality."</p>
