            <div class='col-md body'><p>Emiliano Insua has set his sights on playing a key role in Liverpool's title run-in.<br>The Argentine established himself as first-choice left-back prior to February's World Cup under-20 qualifying tournament, but since returning to the club he has been restricted to just one appearance due to Fabio Aurelio's superb form.<br> <br>He admits it has been frustrating watching the Reds hit peak form from the bench but is hopeful he can still play a part in what he believes will be an exciting conclusion to the campaign.<br> <br>"The tournament was very disappointing for me but it is important to put it behind me," said Insua.<br> <br>"I am working very hard in training and I always try to do my best for me and for the club.<br> <br>"Obviously, I would like to play in every Premier League game because I cannot play in the Champions League but I know that at a club like Liverpool there is always going to be competition for places and I just have to keep on working hard and hope that my chance will come again.<br> <br>"Hopefully I will be included in the squad to play against Fulham and if I can play then that would be even better."<br> <br>Emphatic victories over Manchester United and Aston Villa have propelled Liverpool back into the title race. Insua admits there is a renewed belief inside Anfield but insists it will all be for nothing if they fail to beat Fulham tomorrow.<br> <br>"It is exciting for us but we have to remain patient," he said.<br> <br>"We are closer to Man United and maybe we can overtake them at least for one day if we manage to win against Fulham.<br> <br>"All we can do is try to win the next game, see where that takes us and then move onto the next game.<br> <br>"I have been at Liverpool for two and a half years and I think that the last few weeks were the best since I have been here because the team got some really good results and played some really good football.<br> <br>"But now we must look ahead and try to do the same against Fulham."<br> <br>Insua could only watch on in despair as his country Argentina crashed to a 6-1 humiliation against Bolivia in midweek.<br> <br>It was a disappointing moment for everyone associated with Argentine football but the 20-year-old has still managed to find some sort of positive to take from the result.<br> <br>"I'm very disappointed about my country's result because we won on Saturday in Diego Maradona's first game in Argentina as national team manager," said Insua.<br> <br>"I don't know what happened but we ended up losing 6-1 in our worst result for many years so it is a big shock.<br> <br>"But it does show that in football, in every tournament, every competition and every game that any result is possible.<br> <br>"It was only a few weeks ago that people were saying that Liverpool could not catch Man United but now we are closer.<br> <br>"We are only one point behind and now we have to keep on going, try to win the next game and do everything we can to get into first position."<br> <br>Asked if he thought the defeat could have an affect on his club teammate and compatriot Javier Mascherano, he said: "I am sure that he will come back very disappointed about the result but he is very professional so he will put it behind him.<br> <br>"He will know that he is back with Liverpool and that it is a different situation. He will be ready for Saturday, especially because he cannot play in the game against Chelsea in the Champions League a few days later.<br> <br>"He will do his best for Liverpool, there is no question about that.<br> <br>"Sometimes it can be difficult after a long flight, especially when you only have a day or so to prepare for your next game.<br> <br>"But most planes are very comfortable these days and you are usually able to get some sleep.<br> <br>"It may not be possible to rest as well as we would like but this is a problem that we must overcome because Argentina is a long way away from England and if we want to play for our country then we just have to cope with it."</p></div>
