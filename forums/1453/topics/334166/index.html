              <p>ya, i agree. but i think a draw would be able to show what liverpool is really made up of for this season. not bad leh =) lol.<br>i guess the only problem now is to keep it up, and not let good start finishes with a bad season ending.</p>

              <p><em>Liverpool vs Manchester United</em> - Alonso was fouled by Vidic and resulted in him being sent off and we came back from 0-1 to win 2-1.<br><br><em>Manchester City vs Liverpool</em> - Alonso was tackled by Zabaleta and he was sent off. We came back from 2-0 down to win 2-3 at the end.<br><br><em>Liverpool vs Wigan</em> - Alonso was tackled by Valencia and it was his 2nd yellow. We came back from 1-2 down to win 3-2 at the end again.</p>

              at the end.<br> <br> <em>Liverpool vs Wigan</em> - Alonso was tackled by Valencia and it
              was his 2nd yellow. We came back from 1-2 down to win 3-2 at the

              <p>Alonso is the key for our comebacks :)</p>

              <p>yeah... do notice alonso is the somehow the key element to all the recent comebacks. his long pass and shooting has failed him lately, but not his charisma to induce red cards.</p>
              <p>when everyone expects liverpool to win comfortable, they dont.</p>
              <p>when everyone expects them to lose, they manage to get a win even without torres and gerrard.</p>
              <p>who still dare to bet against the reds next weekend?</p>

              <p>The strength of the Liverpool squad is in its reserve and how Ah Ben played it.</p>
              <p>The reserve have come in and created the goal for the strikers.</p>
              <p>Just played back the three matches and you know what I mean.</p>
              <p>An sunday times writer was writing about the chances of Liverpool winning the EPL this season is not easy as we need more players that can create and score goals.</p>
              <p>I agreed with him and hope that we will be able to get a rich god daddy before Jan 08 so that we can get more reinforcements.</p>
              <p>It will be a painful sight to see Liverpool level with points at the top but lose out on goal differences.</p>

              <p>valencia's  first yellow card was not deserving, let alone the eventual sending off. luck is such an essential element. just hope liverpool players dont over depend on it.</p>
