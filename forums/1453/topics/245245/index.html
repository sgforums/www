            <div class='col-md body'>Two second-half Steven Gerrard goals and a poacher's effort from David Nugent were enough to win the game but Steve McClaren's job prospects now depend on the FA turning a deaf ear to the chants of mutinous England fans in Barcelona.<br><br>During a tepid, goalless opening period, the thousands of travelling supporters gave full vent to their emotions, abusing McClaren and his underperforming team by the minute, rounding off their repertoire with `You'll be sacked in the morning'.<br><br>At that stage, sacked in the evening might have been more appropriate.<br><br>But while Gerrard and Nugent at least kept stumbling England moving forward on the road to Euro 2008, the verdict from the stands was pretty unequivocal: 'Still want McClaren out.'<br><br>Whether they get their wish is a matter of debate but as the four minutes of first-half injury time ticked down, McClaren sat in the visitors' dugout certainly looking like a condemned man.<br><br>A decent bloke and, by all accounts a damned good coach. Yet there he sat, presiding over what was quite possibly the most embarrassing 45 minutes England's long-suffering fans have ever been unfortunate enough to witness.<br><br>At a rough estimate, the team McClaren sent out to play a country whose entire population fits into Old Trafford with plenty of seats to spare is worth in excess of Â£200million. Over-valued, over-hyped and definitely, definitely over-rated.<br><br>It was 20 minutes before the England supporters turned on their team. They were lucky to get that long.<br><br>The high tempo McClaren speaks so often about was missing. Instead, it appeared as though the England team were engaging in an extended session of keep-ball.<br><br>Any break in the exhibition of meaningless passing came through Andorra's desire to tug and pull and grab an opponent, particularly Wayne Rooney, at any opportunity.<br><br>Rooney's frustration threatened to boil over. England got mad. But really, what is the international footballing equivalent of the Dog and Gun supposed to do in the face of such supposedly mighty opposition.<br><br>Starting in his preferred central midfield role alongside Owen Hargreaves, Gerrard belatedly tried to take the game by the scruff of the neck.<br><br>The Liverpool skipper forced a good save out of Andorran keeper Koldo with a swerving shot and Stewart Downing, preferred to Kieron Dyer in a team lacking injured Chelsea star Frank Lampard, did the same.<br><br>But they were sporadic efforts among a series of over-hit free-kicks, mis-placed passes and disappointing shots that sailed wide. Little wonder the thousands who travelled to one of football's citadels chanted long and loud for David Beckham.<br><br>And that was one of the least vicious taunts to roll down from the stands of a stadium that will forever be part of British sporting folklore because of the Olympic champions it crowned in Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell.<br><br>This was an altogether different kind of sporting spectacle and as McClaren turned to head for the tunnel, mercifully close his touchline berth, he was greeted by a sea of angry faces eager to tell him exactly what they thought.<br><br>Thankfully, England started the second period with markedly more energy than they had done the first.<br><br>Within five minutes Hargreaves had fired just wide, Rooney drilled an effort across goal and Koldo needed to scramble to smother Downing's low shot at the second attempt.<br><br>The opening goal was coming and duly arrived when Ashley Cole nodded Lennon's far post cross to Rooney, who flicked it neatly sidewards for Gerrard to launch a 20-yard volley into the bottom corner.<br><br>Having shown the positive side of his game minutes earlier, Rooney then got himself booked for his latest spat with Oscar Sonejee, a yellow card that will rule him out of the June 6 trip to Estonia.<br><br>Rooney was still moaning when Micah Richards was caught accidentally by Marc Pujol. The Manchester City man exited on a stretcher, Rooney left as well, replaced by Jermain Defoe as McClaren made a double change that also involved the arrival of Dyer.<br><br>The Newcastle man's direct running certainly injected some life into what had been a pretty pedestrian midfield, although his woeful attempt to turn home Lennon's cutback hardly helped England's cause.<br><br>Still, for a while the visiting fans enjoyed themselves, ignoring the rain sweeping over a stadium with inadequate cover at one side and none at the other.<br><br>Why, McClaren even managed to get to the touchline to bark a few orders without being abused.<br><br>The atmosphere was just beginning to change again when Gerrard charged through, as he does so often for his club, took Defoe's return pass, then produced a neat finish.<br><br>David Nugent's arrival 12 minutes from time gave Preston their first England international to cheer since Sir Tom Finney almost 50 years ago. He scored too, running in to belt home Defoe's shot which was about to slither over the line.<br><br>It was a notable day for the Championship club. But if the fans get their way, it will be a momentous evening for something else entirely.</div>
