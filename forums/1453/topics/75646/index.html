            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard has given Gerard Houllier a massive show of support by stating that he will review his own future at the club if the manager is axed in the summer.<br>Gerard is the most influential player at the club and he has formed a strong bond with the manager which has included various private conversations about how the team can recover from this season and go forward. The skipper isn't afraid to speak his mind when he thinks people aren't pulling their weight and he is without a doubt, Houllier's strongest ally.<br><br>"If Gerard Houllier left the club I would have to consider my own future," warned the skipper. "I believe he is the man for the job, I like playing for him."<br><br>**************************<br>This must be one of the most dreaded pce of news any anti-GH fans wanna hear.<br><br>Is there something we dun know abt GH tat makes us think so differently fm the players.  But why aren't their support for GH translated into performances on the field?<br><br>This is really puzzling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">It's no coincidence tat most successful teams in the EPL (if other leagues) do have a hardman in the middle - Vierra for Gunners [his record nos. of red cards speak volumn] and Keane for Manures.<br><br>For us, we had Souness, then McMahon (think Poolman can add some more) in the past...and now, it's Gerrard.  I dun think any one fan can fault his full-hearted, if not full-bloodied display in most matches, albeit some are overly-enthusiastic.  There's little doubt in my mind tat he's gonna be one of the best Reds to wear tat armband.<br><br>Hence, his latest quote is rather difficult to digest...there's no way the club will gonna keep GH (when his time is due) for the sake of SG...but losing SG will be a big-big blow to the team n the club.  I really hope the club will not have to face such a dilemma   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></span></span><br></div>
