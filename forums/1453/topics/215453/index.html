            <div class='col-md body'>Bolton would lend Chelsea keeper Bolton boss Sam Allardyce has offered to lend his Chelsea counterpart, Jose Mourinho, one of his goalkeepers.<br><br>Chelsea are without their first-choice stoppers after both Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini suffered head injuries during Saturday's win against Reading.<br><br>A Bolton spokesman said: "Sam suggested that if we can get keepers out on loan, then we will consider it.<br><br>"He said yesterday if Jose or Chelsea come enquiring about them, we will certainly talk to them."<br><br>Under Premier League rules, Chelsea would have to apply to the board if they wanted to draft in a temporary goalkeeper.<br><br>The board have discretion to allow their request if they consider the circumstances to be exceptional.<br><br>Uefa rules, which apply to the Champions League, also allow a club to bring in a temporary stopper if they have two keepers ruled out by long-term injury or illness.<br><br>The club must announce the change to Uefa 24 hours before the goalkeeper will be expected to play.<br><br>With Jussi Jaaskelainen firmly in place as the Bolton number one, Allardyce has former England international Ian Walker, Oman international Ali Al-Habsi and trainee Chris Howarth waiting in the wings.<br><br>Al-Habsi moved to the Reebok Stadium in the January transfer window but has yet to make any appearances for the club while Walker has only played once this season in the Carling Cup.<br><br>Cech faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after undergoing surgery on a depressed fracture of his skull.<br><br>Cudicini was also concussed and carried off during the match but was released from hospital later on Saturday.<br><br>The Italian was well enough to visit the club's training ground on Monday where he gave Chelsea TV an update on his progress.<br><br>"I'm ok. Just a little bit of a headache but apart from that, ok.<br><br>"I've had a lot of messages, from here, from Italy, and I use this occasion to thank everybody for their concern about my situation."<br><br>The Italian, however, is doubtful for Wednesday's Champions League home tie against Barcelona and Chelsea are likely to turn to third choice keeper Hilario.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cech's father predicts one-year absence<br>AFP<br>October 17, 2006<br><br>LONDON (AFP) - Petr Cech's father has estimated his son and Chelsea keeper will be out of action for a year following surgery on a depressed fracture of his skull.<br><br>The Chelsea goalkeeper is recovering from an operation on the serious head injury he suffered in the early stages of Saturday's 1-0 Premiership victory at Reading.<br><br>The 24-year-old was involved in a collision with Royals midfielder Stephen Hunt and both Cech's parents have given their reaction to the incident.<br><br>ADVERTISEMENT<br>His father Vaclav told the Times: "My son will be out of football for a year. At first, I didn't realise how bad it was. When I heard the diagnosis, my knees trembled. I couldn't believe my ears."<br><br>Cech's mother Cechova added: "I thought maybe he was suffering from some kind of concussion, but after speaking to his wife (Martina), we were told that his injuries were getting worse. It was terrible to see."<br><br>Hunt, whose knee connected with Cech's head during the challenge, insists the collision was completely accidental.<br><br>A leading neuro-surgeon on Monday warned that rushing Cech back into action could prove fatal, claiming his injuries would require at least six months out of the game.<br><br>Meanwhile Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann told Tuesday's Daily Mail that greater care needs to be taken regarding keepers before another horrific injury happens.<br><br>German Lehmann told the newspaper: "Yes it's a man's game, but what you have to consider as well is that these men have children and wives and their children don't want to end up seeing their fathers end up with lifelong damage, driven around in a wheelchair or not being able to work anymore."<br><br>Chelsea number two keeper Carlo Cudicini was also knocked out in a clash with Reading's French defender Ibrahima Sonko later in the same game though his head injury was much less serious.<br><br>Lehmann added: "I feel sorry for both keepers, but it made me really angry too. I'm still upset because it happened to (Mark) Schwarzer and (Shay) Given as well. They are very brave and they never went to challenge or harm the striker, but all four got knocked out due to "clumsy" challenges.<br><br>"I have never injured a player in my life and I want to retain that record because I respect my opponents, but if they want to have a go at me I will have to change my game because there is no protection from the referees."<br><br></div>
