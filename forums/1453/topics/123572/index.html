I had a chat with the manager before Christmas and he told me I wasn't in his plans. In that situation you need to think about your future but I never thought about leaving.<br>"Even though I wasn't guaranteed first team chances, I didn't want to go. I wanted to stay until the end of the season to do my best if games did come along for me."<br>German side Hamburg are believed to be monitoring Biscan's situation at Anfield and could make a move for him in the summer</span><br><br>Why ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Igor Biscan, despite his amusing appearance of cluelessness, is a terrific player. Even many loyal Liverpool fans forget that when he was signed in December 2000, he came in as a defensive midfielder and the <strong>Captain</strong> and most popular player of his club Croatia Zagreb. He had, at the age of 22, become a regular in the Croatian team (which at the time was excellent) and had played in both the UEFA cup and the Champion's League. He certainly had what it takes to make it at Anfield.<br><br>He impressed for the rest of 00/01 season (including wins over Arsenal and Man Utd - outclassing Vieira and Keane on both occasions and being hailed in the press) until Houillier moved the towering lad into odd positions, on the flanks, and where he was most criticised, at centreback. Biscan could not cope with his increased defensive responsibilities and his form suffered until he was dropped from the side.<br><br>I hoped that Rafa would see Igor's qualities and retain him as useful backup to Gerrard or Xabi, seeing as how Hamann is on the verge of retirement (or at least, moving on to a sunset club). Igor has been class on the Continent, with superlative displays in the Group Stages and First Knockout Round of the Champion's League. His vision and dribbling are top-notch at times, but he struggles to find consistency without being able to get regular football.<br><br>He's worth keeping, and certainly capable of justifying the 5.5 million pounds the club paid for his services.<br><br>2-0 down<br>3-2 up<br>Who comes on to score the fourth?<br>Igor, Igor, Igor!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Biscan will be a good back-up for Xabi Alonso. Better still, put Biscan and Alonso together when both Hamann and Stevie G are gone. Please, we need more hardmen, not softies like Luis Garcia, never can hold the ball under pressure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">I like him to stay .<br><br>I like his professional attitude .<br><br>Like some of you had said , we need back-ups for Alonso , Gerrard and Hamann , and Biscan can come in handy .<br><br>We need 4 active midfielders for the UCL ( 8 games at least )...EPL ( 36 games ) , FA Cup ( 6 games minimum ) , Worthington Cup (4 games minimum) .<br><br>How can a team have only 3 midfielders covering so many games ? What if Gerrard &amp; Hamann is injured ? That is the time we need Biscan , as a reliable back-up .<br><br>Biscan can go , if Rafa can find us a solid reliable replacement .<br><br>Still i prefer Igor to stay . </span></div>
