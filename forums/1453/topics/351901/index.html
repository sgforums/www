              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">....says Sami Hyypia, 1 of the heroes of the OT nite!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*************************</p>
              <p>Kopites watched their side spank Real Madrid 4-0 on Tuesday before clinching the club's biggest win at Old Trafford since 1936. <br>  <br>"It's been a good week," said the 35-year-old, who was signed by Gerard Houllier in 1999. "I was just asked if I've had a week like this before and I couldn't think of one since in 2001 when we won a few cups in one week." <br>  <br>Liverpool are four points off top spot with nine games remaining following the 4-1 victory over Manchester United. <br>  <br>The leaders also have a game in hand, but Hyypia insists no one in the Anfield dressing room will stop believing in their title dream until it becomes mathematically impossible. <br>  <br>"We needed to win this game and we did. Everyone is happy with the result and I'm sure a few of the other teams will be happy too," he said. <br>  <br>"It's been a fantastic week but United are still four points ahead with a game in hand. It's going to be difficult to think about the title but we'll keep fighting until the end and see what happens. <br>  <br>"We can't control how they do so we just need to concentrate on ourselves and hope they drop some points. <br>  <br>"If we didn't believe then we might as well stop the season now. You have to believe while ever you still have a chance. We have to do our best and win our games, and maybe Man Utd will drop points in some of their games and we can take advantage." <br>  <br>Hyypia started the game as a last-minute replacement for <a class="red" href="http://www.sgforums.com/team/squad/arbeloa/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alvaro Arbeloa</span></span></a>, who hurt his hamstring in the warm up. <br>  <br>The big Finn revealed afterwards that he had just a few minutes to prepare. <br>  <br>"I found out just a few minutes before we came out," he said. <br>  <br>"I was wondering how the first minutes would go but I got into it and had no problems."</p>
