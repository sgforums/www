              seriously, rafa very bad in buying ppl... instances like kromkamp, gonzalez, paletta, pellegrino, nunez, josemi.. some of which we would love to forget or we never known of their existence. and also he love to collect young and unheard-of players and put them in the reserve squad.. then loan them out... and after that sell them. and most of them never get to play for the first team at all until more recently...like plessis(but now disappeared from first team liao) , ngog, insua and el zhar.  -.- the more later signings like itandje, voronin, pennant, dossena and degen.... is a waste of money..
              
              but still he made some good signings.. agger, skrtel, alonso (best signing thus far along with torres), torres, reina.

              <p>limpper i know what u mean la,but u got to know that lfc changed a lot since rafa took over,rafa took over a lousy liverpool team if u remember,and such achievement is actually not bad already. and i got to disagree with u that we got the worst style,past few seasons if u had said that i would have agreed with u,but this season they have been playing more passing football, but we are facing the same problem as arsenal,if opponent play rough,we chui.</p>
              <p>anyway,rafa really got some bad vision in signing players,maybe the scouts are to be blamed too? i dunno. and some players he didnt even give them time before he sell them out,for example,mark gonzalez,hes not that bad u know,speedy and with skill,scored some goals too. another another example is paletta, but i heard that is he wan to go back to argentina.</p>
              <p>he oso sell some of his gd players away,never really appreciate them,most notable is peter crouch,and now pennant. now that rafa sometimes play 4-5-1/4-4-1-1 (cant really figure out is which 1). it puzzles me more as to why he sell crouchy away.</p>

              <p>if a team wants to win the league, nothing should be an excuse. or, you shouldnt even be finding excuses.</p>
              <p>yup, i agree that this season, we play better football, more passing, more pocession.</p>
              <p>but again, so what? at the end of the day, no one talks abt how you play, everyone see what you take, either that 3pts, or 1pt, or 0.<br><br>the first time round we play stoke, they say stoke played as if they parked a huge bus infront of the goal. so much so that we cant score.<br>isnt that an excuse?<br>i don see chelsea, man utd having problems breaking up teams as such. they have players who have the ability to do so, creative, pacy, dangerous kind of cutting ways into defenders.<br>you want to win, you play, not talk.</p>
              <p>of course i wish to see the title coming to anfield, but i don think we can. we lack the pace throughout the season.<br>those signings we make, not all, but most are not needed, 20m for keane? wtf?<br>inter got quaresma for only 15m, i don see liverpool going for him?<br>i was thinking what a good addition it is for quaresma to come, we can play him on the right, pushing kuyt/babel with torres up front. this way, gerrard wont be busy only infront, but also able to help out in the back.<br>look at yest match, i din see gerrard back most of the time.<br></p>

              <p>hey,limpper,for ur info.</p>
              <p>1stly)quaresma is rated as a number 1 flop at inter in a recent poll,which is a poll to decide which is the worst player this season thus far in italian serie A,or something like that,thats why i say hes rated as a flop,he is a good player thou,thats why i say we go for it.</p>
              <p>2ndly)reina is 2ND choice keeper for spain,first choice is casillas,tell me how many goalkeepers in this world are better than casilias? and if reina is really that sucked why would he receive golden gloves for consecutive seasons?</p>
              <p>3rdly)dirk kyut is the 6th best player in the EPL currently with actim index,which is a system to grade a player on every aspects of his game,he was 4th only recently then he dropped to 6th. his crossing has improved considerably.</p>
              <p>4thly)arbeloa is one of the better right back in our club,he may not be fanciful but he do his stuff well,have u ever seen him blunder? dont forget he is the player that defended against barcelona very well when we were playing champions league,and i dont see him deproving either.</p>
              <p>liverpool back in years is good,thats definitely,but the time when houllier was stepping down,they are a declining force.</p>
              <p>and if u compare this liverpool to the liverpool that RB juz started with,its MUCH better,both style and players,you got to agree with that,not to forget that only 3 teams in england have been constantly getting trophies(chelsea,man utd,liverpool).</p>
              <p>i know it may be slow but the signs are there to tell.</p>
              <p>if you are a "fan" that only know how to criticize and fail to see the effort done by ur so called "lousy" players/manager whom u condemned.</p>
              <p>yes i mean,players to players,liverpool may not be better than man utd,but players alone dont make a team,its the chemistry that counts,look at chelsea yesterday,so many good players,but plays like shit?</p>
              <p>so please,if u want to criticise them,do ur homework well ok? no one tells u to continue cheer on them,but wad u are doing is very disrespectful to them,undermining their effort.</p>
              <p>you said "if kuyt was such a good player, it wont end up in rafa's hand alr.<br>" so are you trying to say that rafa cant get good players? then how about torres? alonso? agger? skrtel?luis garcia?and most recently,riera? you are contradicting yourselves.</p>
              <p>as a liverpool fan,u are a total disgrace.seriously,if u only know how to scold them and fail to see their good and u think that players from other clubs are much much much better,then go and support other clubs,liverpool dont need a fan like u.</p>
              <p>you are really a joke,you call yourself a fan? c'mon.</p>

              <p>i fully agree with your comments, Renaldy.</p>
              <p>just look at the ex lfc players rafa had when he just took over (exclulding his flop signings):-</p>
              <p>djimi traore (blunder king)</p>
              <p>igor biscan (mop hair)</p>
              <p>vladimir smicer (i like him but he seems too injury-proned to make an impact)</p>
              <p>harry kewell (similiar to smicer)</p>
              <p>sinama pongolle (very interesting player however i think there were too much pressure on him and le tallec when they first joined liverpool as highly-rated teenagers)</p>
              <p>anthony le tallec (pongolle's cousin?)</p>
              <p>jerzy dudek (talented goalie but just too erronous)</p>
              <p>full respect to rafa for bringing in players whom can replace the above lot and are doing quite a good job at it. for eg:- arbeloa, riera, kuyt, reina etc.</p>
              <p>i'm also very happy that rafa is giving opportunities to local academy players such as jack hobbs, stephen darby, jay spearing and martin kelly. these are the kind of players that has liverpool in their blood and will do their utmost best for the club. do hope to see them featuring more in the 1st team though. i read somewhere that steven gerrard was the last academy player to be brought into the first team and that was in 1998 - more than 10 years ago man!</p>
