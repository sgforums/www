              <h1>King Kenny: Dalglish brought in to lure Roy Hodgson or Martin 
              O'Neill to Liverpool... but don't rule HIM out of a sensational return<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish will spearhead the search for 
              Liverpool’s new manager after Rafa Benitez’s six-year reign finally 
              ended on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Fulham boss Roy Hodgson and Aston Villa’s 
              Martin O’Neill top the list of targets but Dalglish is understood to be 
              interested in taking over himself at the club where he enjoys iconic 
              status.</p>
              <p>Dalglish readily accepted the role of kingmaker, in 
              conjunction with managing director Christian Purslow, after Benitez was 
              sent packing with a pay-off in excess of £4million.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Kingmaker: Kenny Dalglish will have a huge 
              say 
              on the identity of Liverpool's next boss - the Scot himself could could 
              make a sensational return to Anfield</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Last night he was urged to take control of the crisis club by former 
              Liverpool stars and fans. Phil Thompson, who was hired by Dalglish in 
              1986 as Liverpool’s reserve team coach, said. ‘I can see the logic in a 
              Dalglish appointment – until there are new owners.</p>
              <p>‘Of course I
               would support Kenny. He was a good team-mate, a good manager. He won 
              the title with Blackburn Rovers. He’s still very passionate about 
              football. So I can see where that would fit in.’</p>
              <p>After a 
              troubled end to the Benitez era, marked by rows with his Anfield bosses 
              and a worsening relationship with key senior players, Liverpool are 
              eager to restore order and stability behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>They 
              want an established, experienced coach, with an understanding of Europe 
              and ability to cope with pressure, and believe Hodgson fits the bill on 
              all fronts. </p>

              Roy Hodgson - who both masterminded 3-1 victories over Liverpool last 
              season - are on the shortlist to replace Rafa Benitez</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>While an approach has yet to be made, Liverpool have been heartened 
              by an early indication that Hodgson, 62, would welcome a move to Anfield
               and, unlike Benitez, would not need substantial transfer funds to 
              revive their fortunes next season.</p>
              <p>Benitez dismissed as 
              inadequate a summer budget of no more than £15m, but Fulham boss Hodgson
               would back himself to get the best out of players already at his<br>disposal.</p>
              <p>The former Inter Milan coach has transformed Fulham from 
              relegation strugglers to European trailblazers and has a track record 
              for working easily and successfully with foreign players.</p>
              <p>Hodgson
               is on a 12-month rolling contract with the London club, and 
              compensation<br>should be no more than £2m. </p>

              </div>
              <p>O’Neill will also figure prominently on Dalglish’s list and would 
              jump at the chance of restoring Liverpool’s tarnished reputation after 
              becoming increasingly concerned by dwindling transfer funds at Aston 
              Villa.</p>
              <p>The Villa manager has tried to find some common ground
               with American owner Randy Lerner over the level of investment needed 
              but he might be easily prised away<br>from the club.</p>
              <p>Former 
              Manchester City manager Mark Hughes is another who will feature on the 
              shortlist, while Galatasaray’s Frank Rijkaard, Turkey coach Guus Hiddink
               and Bayern Munich’s Louis van Gaal head the likely list of foreign 
              candidates.</p>

              <p>But former Liverpool stars Thompson and Mark Lawrenson believe 
              Dalglish could also fill the role himself.</p>
              <p>Thompson, who was 
              speaking at the Standard Chartered ‘Beat the Goalie’ competition in 
              London, raising money to treat the blind or partially sighted, added<br>that
               the appointment of Dalglish could persuade star players Steven Gerrard,
               Fernando Torres and Javier Mascherano to stay at the club.</p>
              <p>‘I
               want Steven Gerrard and Torres to stay at Liverpool FC. And Mascherano,
               too. Because that is going to make my football team stronger,’ he said</p>
              <p>‘You’re
               looking at Kenny Dalglish, who is steeped in Liverpool tradition. I can
               see where the Kenny thing would fit in with people. It is probably a 
              step in the right direction at this present moment.’</p>
              <p>Football
               pundit Lawrenson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, added: ‘I would have<br>thought
               Kenny would be heavily involved and quite rightly so — maybe not just 
              in choosing the manager but holding the fort in the meantime.’ </p>

              <p>Benitez’s lawyers finally agreed a severance package worth an initial
               £4m after two days of negotiations with their Liverpool counterparts.</p>
              <p>It
               will rise to over £6m should he remain out of work beyond this summer, 
              but that appears unlikely after Inter Milan again went public on their 
              intention to recruit him as Jose Mourinho’s successor at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>Liverpool
               chairman Martin Broughton confirmed that Benitez’s departure was 
              initiated by the Anfield board.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Rafa will forever 
              be part of Liverpool folklore after bringing home the Champions League 
              following the epic final in Istanbul, but after a disappointing season, 
              both parties felt a fresh start would be best for all concerned.’</p>
              <p>Support
               for Benitez, 50, was beginning to waver in the stands, as well as the 
              boardroom, but he sent an emotional farewell message to supporters.</p>
              <p>He
               said: ‘It is very sad for me to announce that I will no longer be 
              manager of Liverpool FC. I would like to thank all of the staff and 
              players for their efforts. </p>
