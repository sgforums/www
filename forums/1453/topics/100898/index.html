Liverpool scores NO goals! its the own goal that gave Liverpool the 3 points.<br><br>Tarore was good... Riise was also good and could have scored yet another goal for the Reds.<br><br>Baros really needs to be sharper when comes to scoring goals.<br><br>Josemi is still chasing shadows ever since he red card.<br><br>Hyypia is the usual rock at the back...<br><br>Kewell really needs to score some goals to get back to the deadly player he used to be when with Leeds.<br><br>Biscan... what can I say... he run created the goal... I think he is finding his touch in the midfield role...<br><br>having praised some much on the players... I still think that its not a good game... reason being... it still shows that Reds lack finishers... Reds failed to put the chances away... it the world of soccer... if u dont make your chances count.... it might just hurt you... the score line could have been... Deportivo 0 Liverpool 0 or worse Deportivo 2 Liverpool 0 but then IF Liverpool make their chances count... it would have been Deportivo 2 Liverpool 5<br><br>anyway, a win is a win... well done Mighty Reds<br></div>

Wonderful defensive capabilities ! </span></div>

No point showing the hunger and ate no food... we still starved... its only lucky that Deportivo is playing a lousy game.<br><br>its impovement.. but still we NEED to score goals.. thats what soccer is all about... scoring goals... no looking hungry and full of bites... yet ZERO goals... If its really our game score line should have been 5-0 to liverpool.<br>Basically that's what I wanna say... thats what I'm upset about.<br><br>Glad to see the once 'useless' Biscan and Tarore playing so well.</div>

With more luck, we cld've won by 3 or 4 clear goals -  Baros, Garcia n Riise cld've been more clinical with their finishing!<br><br>As Poolman pointed out, tis is achieved with the absence of some key players.
