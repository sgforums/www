              <p>Basically,</p>
              <h3>How to eat if you are training in Muay Thai</h3>
              <p>When
                  you first begin training in Muay Thai boxing don’t worry too much about
                  the amount of food you are eating. Give your body a chance to get used
                  to the new training schedule. Your appetite will find its own rhythm.
                  Try not to eat within the few hours before training. Intensive training
                  on a full stomach will make you unwell.<br> <strong>You must drink enough fluids to fulfil your  body’s needs and never allow yourself to become dehydrated.</strong> Sugary soft drinks can be high in calories and offer no nutrition; you
                  are better off drinking plain water. You will sweat a lot during
                  training (especially in Thailand’s humid climate) and this fluid loss
                  needs to be replaced. But drinking excessive amounts of water is also
                  not helpful to your body and will certainly not help with your
                  training. During training sessions try to take only small sips. During
                  the rest of the day listen to your body, it will tell you when it is
                  thirsty. You should drink one or two glasses of water following each
                  meal to aid digestion. Rehydration drinks containing a mix of salts and
                  sugar are a good idea if you are worried about the amount you are
                  sweating or you have just begun training in Thailand’s hot climate.
                  These drinks should be limited to one per training session.<br> <strong>If you are losing weight you must be especially  observant of your own body and look carefully for any signs of stress.</strong> Weight loss should not exceed one pound (0.5 kg) a week. Anything
                  faster (unless you are seriously overweight, in which case consider
                  controlling your weight before embarking on a very intensive training
                  regime) will have a damaging effect on your body, the evidence of which
                  may not present itself until much later in your life. Remember, every
                  person has a natural body weight that is dictated by their individual
                  traits.</p>
              <div class="story">
              <h3><a id="youngsters" name="youngsters"></a>Youngsters should not modify their diet</h3>
              <p>In
                  the case of Muay Thai boxers in their early or middle teens attempts to
                  reduce body weight cannot be recommended (unless you are specifically
                  directed to do so by a qualified physician with special knowledge of
                  children’s weight problems). <strong>Diet modifications in youngsters can  have grave health implications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></strong>Its actually quite standard to know how to control your diet.. But i ripped this off from the internet.<br><br>1) *Follow a basic guideline of 50% carb 30% protein 20% fat<br> 2) *Select correct number of calories per pound of bodyweight (divide by 2.2 = KG)<br> a) 10 for a sedentary (no training)<br> b) 15 for light training (1x per day)<br> c) 20 for hard training (2x per day)<br> (E.G. 160lbs x 15 (training once per day) = 2400 total calories<br> 1200 cal = carb 720 cal = protein 480 cal = fat)<br> *This is just a basic outline to follow to get started, adjustments
              will be made later in program to account for the many different
              Metabolic Types and calorie needs.<br> 3) Keep a nutritional diary<br> 4) Increase H20 consumption (one ounce per pound of bodyweight)<br> 5) Eat 5-6x small meals per day<br> 6) Choose lower Glycemic Index carbohydrates (the Glycemic Index
              indicates how rapidly food is broken down into Glucose, the lower G.I.
              foods are better for blood sugar regulation)<br> 7) Increase intake of Vegetables<br> 8) No Fruit Juice<br> 9) No processed foods<br> 10) NO SOFT DRINKS including diet sodas (Beware of Aspartame)<br> 11) Whenever possible always choose Organic products!!!<br><br><br></p>
              <p>Protein<br> Proteins are the building blocks for our bodies they repair muscle
              tissue after exercise. They also have hundreds of other functions and
              play a vital role in enzyme &amp; hormone production and utilization.
              They are responsible for transportation of hemoglobin in the blood,
              growth of hair and skin etc. Protein can also be used as a source of
              fuel although carbohydrates are naturally the bodies preferred source.
              Protein can be broken into 2 basic types; complete and incomplete.
              Complete protein contains all 10 of the essential amino acids and
              incomplete protein means it lacks some of the essential amino acids.
              For example protein sources that are complete are chicken, fish, red
              meat and diary products. Incomplete protein sources are beans and other
              plant sources. However, you can combine incomplete proteins together to
              form a complete protein (e.g. rice and beans).</p>
              <p>Carbohydrates<br> Carbohydrates fuel the nervous system, the brain and muscles. There are
              2 types of carbohydrates= simple and complex. Simple carbs are broken
              down quickly inside the body (High G.I) complex carbs take longer to
              process. When choosing carbs in your diet, focus on particularly on
              whole natural carbs that haven’t been processed or refined that are Low
              to Moderate G.I</p>
              <p>Fat<br> Dietary fats are just as important as protein and carbohydrates. Fat is
              a major component for health and is often overlooked. It helps
              transport the fat soluble vitamins A E D K all are needed for us to
              remain healthy. A diet exclusively devoid of fats is very much an
              unhealthy one! For instance fat can help you stay fuller longer
              increasing a feeling of satiety, which is useful when dieting hard.<br> Omega 3 is an important Essential fatty acid (EFA). It has an
              anti-inflammatory effect on the body, which is obviously important for
              fighters. Not to be confused with Omega 6, most of us have in abundance
              in our diets.<br> Avoid if possible anything with hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oil or trans fatty acids.</p>
              <p>These are bad synthetic fats the body cannot break down fully. They
              can lead to many health issues such as obesity and increases in Low
              Density Lipoprotein (LDL) bad cholesterol.</p>
              <p>H20<br> The most important substance in your diet and body is water. Your body
              is 70% water and being de-hydrated by as little as 2% can affect your
              performance.</p>
              <p>Cutting Weight<br> In most cases fighters will try to drop weight, as they are getting
              ready for a fight. It is not wise to restrict your calories while you
              begin training heavy for your competition. Top-level athletes should
              take care of themselves all year. By maintaining low body fat levels,
              it will allow you to focus on the fight and not making weight. When you
              are given short notice and you have to cut weight in a hurry, make sure
              you adhere to proven techniques and strategies.<br> If you need to lose weight follow these recommended guidelines;<br> 1) Set correct % of protein carb fat and calories<br> *35% carb 35% protein 30% fat<br> 2) Remove all grains and wheat from diet<br> 3) Remove all dairy from diet<br> 4) No root Vegetables e.g. carrots and potatoes<br> 5) No processed meats<br> 6) Sample menu<br> - 4 organic eggs &amp; 2 pieces of fruit (multi vitamin &amp; omega 3)<br> - 6 oz chicken breast &amp; 2 cups green beans<br> - 5 oz red meat &amp; 2 green beans<br> - 6 oz tuna &amp; 1 apple &amp; 2 cup spinach salad<br> *Before workout BCAA<br> - 30 grams whey protein &amp; apple &amp; pear *after work out<br> - 5 oz red meat &amp; 2 cups broccoli (multi vitamin &amp; omega 3)</p>
              <p>Supplements<br> - Take a high quality multi-vitamin 2x per day<br> *This is nutritional insurance to make sure your body has everything it needs to run at the highest level possible.<br> - Take 6 grams of a high quality omega 3 fatty acid<br> - Before workout BCAA are recommended to maintain a anabolic state (positive balance)<br> - Drink a high quality Whey Protein Shake 20-30 grams after a workout, with fruit (banana or berries)<br> • After a workout you have what is called your “post work out window of
              opportunity” this time period is when you need to replenish your body
              with the nutrients you just lost or utilized. During this “window” your
              body is able to utilize and assimilate more of the nutrients you eat.
              Also, your muscles are ready to absorb more amino acids during this
              time which are needed to repair the tissue that was just damaged due to
              training. If at this time you take in a liquid form of protein and
              carbs it digests faster and will be absorbed more readily into the
              bloodstream.</p>
              - Glutamine 10-15 grams per day<br> * The most abundant amino acid in the body, it has been shown to
              improve immune function (it will keep you from getting sick before the
              big fight). Also Glutamine is anti-catabolic, which means you won’t
              lose that hard earn muscle while dieting.<br> - Wheatgrass - 1 oz per day (my personal secret)<br> * One shot is equal to 5 pounds of vegetables in nutrient quality, 6 grams of fiber and it tastes pretty good.<br> Eat Well and Train Hard
