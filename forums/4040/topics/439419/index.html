              non-USD Market Maker" in China <br><br>GUANGZHOU, CHINA--(Marketwire - October 
              9, 2011) - <br><br>Editors Note: There are two photos associated with this Press 
              Release. <br><br>BMO ChinaCo welcomed Canada''s International Trade minister, 
              the Honourable Ed Fast, to its Guangzhou branch today during the minister''s 
              visit to China. Minister Fast took the opportunity to meet with BMO staff as he 
              touted the benefits of increased trade and investment ties between China and 
              Canada. <br>"Increased trade and investment benefits middle class families in 
              both countries," said Minister Fast. "Canada''s world-class financial 
              institutions, like BMO, are delivering financial security and stability to a 
              growing middle-class in China, and their success abroad, creates prosperity and 
              opportunity for families back in Canada. The success of Canada''s world-class 
              financial services sector and institutions abroad is a key example of Canada''s 
              capabilities, expertise, and what Canada can offer its important trade partners 
              like China." <br><br>"China and Canada are close friends, and we''re very 
              pleased to welcome Minister Fast and support the Government of Canada''s 
              continued efforts to strengthen the ties that bind our two great countries," 
              said Brendan Wong, Managing Director and Head of Guangzhou, BMO ChinaCo. "Canada 
              has many advantages, including prudent fiscal policy, low inflation, interest 
              and unemployment rates, and a corporate tax framework that is among the best in 
              the world. Forbes Magazine just named Canada the best country in the world for 
              business, and Canada''s banking system has been ranked the soundest in the world 
              by the World Economic Forum for the last four years. Canada also has a 
              sophisticated transportation infrastructure and a strategic location at the 
              crossroads between the North American marketplace and Asia. <br><br>"BMO has the 
              expertise and deep local knowledge to support trade and investment between China 
              and North America, and help our customers capitalize on the enormous 
              opportunities in both," said Mr. Wong. "Our commitment to China is unmatched by 
              any other Canadian bank and dates back to 1818 â€“ just a year after our founding. 
              BMO is one of only a handful of North American banks, and the only Canadian 
              bank, to have a wholly-owned subsidiary bank in China." <br><br>BMO is the only 
              Canadian bank with branches in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and 
              was the first Canadian bank permitted to operate in the capital. The Bank also 
              has a representative office in Taipei, Taiwan and an Investment Banking 
              representative office in Beijing. <br><br>In July 2005, BMO''s Guangzhou branch 
              became the first Canadian bank location to be granted a license to provide RMB 
              local currency service such as deposits and loans to both foreign and local 
              companies in China, providing greater access to financial services in the 
              country. <br><br>In 2010, BMO was named one of the "Most Popular Market Makers 
              in China" by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) for the third 
              consecutive year. This award is determined by popular vote among market makers. 
              As in previous years, BMO was the only foreign bank to have won this award. All 
              other recipients were Chinese banks, including Industrial Bank of China, Bank of 
              China and Bank of Communications. In addition, BMO was again awarded "Best 
              non-USD Market Maker" for the third year running. Of the 29 member banks in the 
              Guangzhou jurisdiction, BMO is the only market maker and the only bank to have 
              won this award. <br>About BMO Financial Group <br><br>Established in 1817 as 
              Bank of Montreal, BMO Financial Group is a highly-diversified North American
