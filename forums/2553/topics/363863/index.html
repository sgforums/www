              <p id="paragrah">My father was a typical <em>kaigai chuuzaiin</em> (overseas 
              salaryman), sent overseas by his company to develop business. So when I was 
              growing up, we lived in several places in England, the U.S. and Japan. The 
              family moved back to the U.S. from Japan when I was 17. I later moved to <a class=" lingo_link" style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-WEIGHT: 400; FONT-SIZE: 16px; CURSOR: pointer; COLOR: #0000ff; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" title="Mouse over ^ icon to search." rel="nofollow" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sw20060628a2.html">Switzerland</a><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="BORDER-RIGHT: 0pt; PADDING-RIGHT: 0pt; BORDER-TOP: 0pt; DISPLAY: inline; PADDING-LEFT: 0pt; LEFT: auto; FLOAT: none; VISIBILITY: visible; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0pt; MARGIN: 0pt; VERTICAL-ALIGN: top; BORDER-LEFT: 0pt; WIDTH: 12px; CURSOR: pointer; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; PADDING-TOP: 0pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0pt; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; POSITION: static; TOP: auto; HEIGHT: 12px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; TEXT-DECORATION: none" src="http://img.breitbart.com/images/lingo/spot/spacer.gif" alt=""> as an adult. 
              Presently my home is still in Switzerland, but right now we are considering a 
              move to France!</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>What do you think defines a bento? How would you describe its 
              place in Japanese food culture and the Japanese lifestyle?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">A bento is a neatly packaged meal, essentially. Japanese people 
              generally love tidiness and order (even when they don't achieve it), so I think 
              that bento meals fit the Japanese aesthetic perfectly. Bentos are also 
              associated with fuzzy warm memories of growing up in most Japanese people's 
              minds.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>You comment on different kinds of bento boxes and promote the 
              use of everyday household items. What are your favorite examples of bento boxes? 
              How many do you own?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">Any reasonably leakproof box is perfectly serviceable as a bento 
              box. But I do think that something you use every day like a bento box should be 
              attractive to look at as well as being practical. I don't own a lot of bento 
              boxes — about a dozen, but I mostly use two or three of them.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>Your bento recipes are kept healthy by incorporating caloric 
              values and ratios of carbs, proteins and vegetables. How do bentos you make 
              today differ from ones you grew up with?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">My mother was a very busy woman, with three kids and a full-time 
              job. In middle school I was active in the kendo club and was always hungry, so 
              my bentos were delicious and very hearty, but sometimes a bit odd. I remember 
              bentos that had things like just 12 gyoza dumplings and cabbage (no rice), or 
              two whole uncooked <em>tarako</em> (salted cod roe) lying unadorned on top of the 
              rice. I still loved them though! My current bentos are a bit more balanced, I 
              think.</p>

              you feel Japanese people are as health conscious as many people tend to 
              think?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">Yes and no. Some Japanese people are very health conscious, while 
              others are definitely not, especially teenagers. I think that some people who 
              only know Japan from the outside tend to think that Japanese people are health 
              conscious because traditional Japanese cuisine is quite healthy. But, of course, 
              there are tons of fast-food outlets, pastry shops, convenience stores full of 
              junk food and what have you in Japan.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>You recently organized a blog event called "Get Started Bento 
              Challenge." Can you tell us more about this? What were the difficulties of 
              putting the event together?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">The "Get Started Bento Challenge" was a 5-week sprint of sorts to 
              get people into the bento-making habit. We had a lot of participants from around 
              the world, and also started a discussion forum on Justbento.com. I think the 
              Challenge was very successful, judging from the feedback I've gotten — and the 
              forum is still very active even after the Challenge.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>You occasionally include food stories in the news, like the 
              restaurant that attempted to use breast milk as an ingredient. What other 
              shocking food stories have you encountered in the news?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">The type of food news I find most disturbing these days is 
              becoming so common it's not shocking anymore — the contamination of industrially 
              produced food. It's happening all over the world, and we should be worried about 
              it.</p>

              not?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">I don't really collaborate with other blogs regularly, but I do 
              communicate a lot with other bloggers, especially via Twitter. My favorite food 
              writer in English is M.F.K. Fisher. My favorite food writer in Japanese is 
              Katsuyo Kobayashi.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>Japan, particularly, has a large collection of food-related 
              films. On your blog, you've said that "Tampopo" is one of your favorite food 
              movies. What other food movies would you recommend?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">I also love "Supermarket Woman" ("Suupaa no Onna"), by Juzo 
              Itami, who also directed "Tampopo." "Seagull Diner" ("Kamome Shokudo") is 
              another favorite. Of non-Japanese food related movies: "Babette's Feast," "Eat 
              Drink Man Woman," "Big Night."</p>

              <p id="paragrah">I'm fortunate in that I have the type of job that I can do 
              anywhere with a computer and an Internet connection, which allows me to organize 
              my day to suit my needs. However, there's no denying that the blogging is a very 
              time-intensive hobby, or part-time job, depending on the way you look at it. I'm 
              not sure I'd ever shift to full-time blogging, but for that to happen I'd have 
              to be able to make a full time income from my blogging activities of course. I'm 
              not there yet!</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>Do you have any intention of moving back to Japan? Would it 
              make your blogging easier or do you find that distance helps?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">I don't see myself moving back to Japan full time anytime soon, 
              though I do plan to spend more and longer chunks of time there. If I were living 
              in Japan, or even living in New York (my former stomping grounds), or anywhere 
              with a large Japanese expat community, I'm not sure I would have ever started my 
              food blogs. It was because I was living in a city (Zurich) with a very small 
              Japanese community, and limited sources for Japanese food, and I started making 
              my own tofu and things like that, which lead to a deepening interest in Japanese 
              cooking.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">I do feel that distance gives me a different, perhaps detached, 
              perspective on Japanese culture, as does the necessity of speaking languages 
              other than Japanese most of the time in my everyday life.</p>
              <p id="paragrah"><strong>Health consciousness aside, what are your guilty indulgences 
              when it comes to food? If you could choose your last meal, what would it 
              be?</strong></p>
              <p id="paragrah">Maybe too obvious, but really good, fresh sushi and sashimi — 
              which aren't that easy to get in Europe!</p>
