              There are billions of people that live all across the globe. Different languages are spoken, various cultures practice lifestyles drastically different and ways of life vary greatly. It would seem like the vast differences in cultures and people doesnâ€™t allow for us to have things in common with complete strangers. The facts are however, that we have more in common with different cultures that what we think. Everyone smiles, they laugh, they cry â€“ you canâ€™t hide the fact that everyone has emotions. Some cultures may be trained to not show emotions but that doesnâ€™t mean that they donâ€™t feel them.
              
              Despite the fact that there are billions of people in this world, there are tons of lonely people living all over the planet. People can be in a crowd of people and still be lonely. There are people that you see every single day that consider themselves to be in the category of â€˜lonely peopleâ€™. Forced smiles and fake laughs may cover up the fact that someone may be struggling or hurting. Most people hate to admit that something is wrong. They want to look poised and capable. The harsh facts are that lonely people are everywhere. One of the best places to find lonely people is in a nursing home. Walk into a one sometime and look at the weary and aged faces that might be staring at you. Some of them were put there by families and are ignored. Others have no families at all and spend their time sitting in a chair staring out the window. They arenâ€™t truly alive in their hearts, they simply exist because they are supposed to. It is absolutely heartbreaking knowing how many lonely people you can find in a nursing
              
              home. Despite the games and activities that the homes might encourage or organize, it canâ€™t take away loneliness.
              
              If you ask some of the individuals who would describe themselves as falling into the lonely people category, they give varying reasons. Some of them have no family members and go home to an empty house every night, others are going through a divorce or separation. Other lonely people claim that they have no friends and spend all of their free time completely alone. There isnâ€™t one specific reason for loneliness. It happens to everyone. Even individuals who seem to have lots of friends and relatives and appear incredibly happy may be very lonely.

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
              <p>Haruhi Suzumiya, a first year student in high school, can be
              characterized as being fun, crazy, and somewhat unpredictable. In the
              series, she is introduced declaring her interests in <a title="Extraterrestrial life" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life">aliens</a>, <a title="Esper" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esper">espers</a> and <a title="Time travel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel">time travelers</a> and does not care for 'ordinary' human beings. The last thing on her
              mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such
              phenomenon in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds
              ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many
              classmates chose to avoid her.</p>
              <p><a title="Kyon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyon">Kyon</a> is
              the first character to engage her in serious conversation. From this
              encounter she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to
              open up to the other classmates, later on Haruhi took Kyon against his
              will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has
              taken an interest in Kyon later in the series.</p>
              <p>She is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any
              extracurricular activity. She once joined every activity club in her
              school and quit because she found them to be boring, despite pleas by
              the members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when
              she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with <a title="Yuki Nagato" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Nagato">Yuki</a>, for the band <a title="List of characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya series" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Haruhi_Suzumiya_series#ENOZ">ENOZ</a> during the school festival.</p>
              <p>Her childhood is cited as an originator for her interest in strange phenomena.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhi_Suzumiya#_note-0">[1]</a></sup> While attending a baseball game with her family, she was shocked to see
              the vast number of people who had come to see the game. Before then she
              had often thought of herself and her life as being special and
              interesting, yet then came to realize that they were just ordinary
              normal occurrences and habits and that she is just one of many in all
              of Japan. Consequently, she believed then that there must be at least
              one person in the world who is leading an interesting and truly unique
              life and sought out to effectively be that person thus motivating her
              to seek out the extraordinary.</p>
              <p>After this realization she became notorious in middle school for
              doing odd things which included painting strange hieroglyphs all over
              the school grounds using a field marker and placing all the school
              desks in the halls. Additionally, she accepted and rejected every guy
              who had ever asked her out, the longest lasting a week and the shortest
              being five minutes. She only seeks relationships with aliens, espers,
              and time travelers. This shows the depth of her interest in finding
              non-humans and strange phenomenon.</p>
              <p>In actuality, Haruhi is believed to be either a crack in the <a title="Space-time continuum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time_continuum">space-time continuum</a>, the first <a title="Technological singularity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a> to be spontaneously born in the universe, or God, depending on point of
              view. This belief stems from a massive spontaneous universal event that
              occurred three years prior to Haruhi meeting Kyon, of which Haruhi is
              said to be the cause. The event attracted the attention of three
              prominent groups: the extraterrestrial Integrated Data Entity, time
              travelers from a distant future, and a group of espers.</p>
              <p>Her powers which are capable of altering, creating, or destroying
              reality are triggered by her emotions and inner desires. It's been
              theorized by the espers that the current universe may be just one in a
              string that Haruhi had subconsciously created. In order to relieve
              stress whenever she becomes too emotionally unstable, patches of
              alternate dimension referred to as "closed space" are created and
              within resides gigantic blue entities that begin to destroy the
              surrounding area. Despite having these powers Haruhi is completely
              oblivious to them or the existence of aliens, time travelers, and
              espers.</p>
              <p><a id="Personality" name="Personality"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
              <p>At first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that
              front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her
              determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of
              finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of
              her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way.
              Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain
              ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants,
              an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society
              President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade.
              Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or
              is hurt, such as <a title="Mikuru Asahina" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikuru_Asahina">Mikuru</a> in the aforementioned blackmail. Right and wrong seem immaterial. She
              also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly
              with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and
              recreated when Haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.</p>
              <p>Haruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without
              hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or
              time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her
              rather arrogant. She has very high standards and won't accept anything
              less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of
              trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done
              whatever it may be.</p>
              <p>She is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of
              not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when
              her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to <a title="Mikuru Asahina" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikuru_Asahina">Mikuru</a> she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru's
              attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it
              to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various
              costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up
              doll.</p>
              <p>Haruhi also seems to hate showing signs of vulnerability to others.
              Following her concert performance at the school's culture festival when
              she and Yuki filled in for two members of the band ENOZ, Haruhi showed
              awkwardness towards the band members when they thanked her the
              following day. As Kyon pointed out, Haruhi was not used to receiving
              praise from others because of how mischievous she regularly acts
              towards others.</p>
              <p><a id="SOS_Brigade_role" name="SOS_Brigade_role"></a></p>
              <h2><span class="mw-headline">SOS Brigade role</span></h2>
              <p>Haruhi is the founder and "Brigade Chief" of the SOS, or <em>Spreading Excitement All over the World with the Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade</em> (Sekai o ÅŒini Moriagerutame no Suzumiya Haruhi no Dan). She was unable
              to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the
              group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time
              travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method
              of finding and recruiting members is to "voluntarily arrest" them then
              force them to join.</p>
              <p>The <a title="Haruhi Suzumiya (franchise)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruhi_Suzumiya_%28franchise%29#SOS_Brigade">SOS Brigade</a> is very precious to her and she has since stated to Kyon that she has
              no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will
              go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention
              and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials,
              maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments,
              organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon
              among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade's
              amateur-movie <em>The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina</em> for the school festival.</p>
              <p>However, unbeknownst to her is the true purpose of the SOS Brigade
              which is to prevent Haruhi from becoming bored because doing so would
              bring about the end of the world as the SOS Brigade's members know it.
              Kyon also happens to be a very important person in her life. For
              whatever reason, Haruhi "chose" Kyon. This is first said by Yuki, then
              restated by Mikuru, and Itsuki as well. She often relies on and trusts
              Kyon with anything. Kyon is the only person whom she has been open
              with, and when she briefly created a "new world", he was the only
              person she had brought over from the "old world".</p>
