              <p>Hello there,</p>
              <p>Here's what I am going to say about this topic. Hope you find some insights in this issue.</p>
              <p>What I think is, you can always have a girlfriend who is non-christian, but along the way in the relationship... you can introduce God in to her life thru your life testimonies, and introduce church to her, and bring her to church, but all these only good if your girlfriend who's a non-christian is ready to go that step, and have opened her heart to receive christ. </p>
              <p>Don't misunderstand the bible, when it says it is better to have a christian life partner. </p>
              <p>If you can find a girl who's a christian, then lucky you. But the fact now is that alot of guys and girls can't get someone who is from their own church, and sometimes the person that attracts us isn't a christian at all. Then what are you going to do about it? </p>
              <p>Bible and church did teach us about holy matrimony, being one in the Lord's house. But you don't have to start of with getting one when it is almost impossible. Just take a wider perspective and see it as a result of you and your future wife, at a dating stage, anyone is fine, just bear in mind that Muslims and Christians combination is really a tough cookie, and not advisable.</p>

              <p>Christian and catholic combination? Different points of views from both parties.It will be tough to be able to convert,especially those with strong family traditions of a religion.Nevertheless,it's worth a shot. 1/3 of Sgs are buddhist,18.3% christians,17% non-religion.Assuming all are chinese,18.3/68.6(100%)=27% chance of meeting a christian date unknowingly.Of course,this occurence increases higher if you go to church.</p>
              <p>My tips are:Perhaps if you hold on to your faith strongly,you could switch churches.It may be a calling to find the right one after a spiritual venture through the different churches.If you are out of hopes,move on to another church.</p>

              <p>Based on the Scripture,you can get attached to a non-believer but you must never divorce.That explains the marriage counselling workshops in churches.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband…” (1 Corinthians 7:12-14)<br><br><br><br></div>
