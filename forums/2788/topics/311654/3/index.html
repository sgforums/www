              <p>Ended up in Old Tampines Road while trying to find my way home earlier on, it felt like one of the spookier places I've been to. Later on, some SC members mentioned it's a haunted area. I'n wondering if you guys have any real life experiences to share?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll start. Have been to some rumoured places past midnight but nothing happened. Didn't feel spooked either.</p>
              <p>Old Changi Hospital - Some corners are extremely dark even in broad daylight. Felt nothing and saw nothing while working there at night though some colleagues claim otherwise. No ghostly sightings on my camera.</p>
              <p>The abandoned tv world in Tuas - Same situation as Old Changi Hospital. Walked around the area alone with a torch, no experiences as well. No ghostly sightings on my camera.</p>
              <p>Fort Canning Park - Hiking around at night, nothing seen. Could it be because we were there in a large group?</p>
              <p>So this Old Tampines Road feels a little special. Some kind of strange sense of foreboding in the air. Anybody has actual real life stories to share? What about temples? They are supposed to be sacred places. Are they haunted too even with idols furnished all around?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Came across different people who claim the ability to see spirits have described the same thing lingering next to me on several occasions throughout the years. Wonder why the coincidence sometimes.</p>

              <p>walao u guys, are u guys trying to be paranormal investigators?</p>
              <p>ok,ok... u guys said in a group to so-called haunted places. alrite. How many of u? All move together or seperate own way to explore.</p>
              <p>Normally, these thing wont create trouble when there are ppl in group. ( excuse me, i watched "the Haunting" in Discovery channel)</p>
              <p>Most PI felt or hear something when they are alone, that goes with the camera too which is why most PI even in groups are seperated to do their investigations.</p>
              <p>FOr Natalie, is this your 1st time feeling or u can really felt something is wrong in your entire life?</p>
              <p>AN advice to u all, if you guys wanna go explore its always fine, but dun take it too extreme when anyone of u feels something wrong. Leave immediately if something is just not right. If u heard something falls down at some corner.. dun try to be hero and look for what is it. If u guys really want to go out explore more haunted places, please do more homework of what you're dealing with.</p>
              <p>If you all could come to Malaysia, i want u all to come to my company.. sigh..</p>

              <p>I think you move towards Tuas, and exit left (if I remember correctly, it's exit 14 or 14a) before the checkpoint. After you exit, immediately turn left.</p>
              <p>Not so sure whether you guys can enter from another entrance, there is a huge gate and guards were there 24/7 when I was working there.</p>
              <p>Heh, just note there is no power supply in that area, bring torch.</p>

              <p>This is the classic example of Mr Know-it-all; he has a very high opinion of himself. He is self-deluded and grandiosely annoying; he believes everyone needs his 'enlightenment', advices and opinions and he gives them freely regardless if the other parties are willing.</p>
              <p>His pomposity stemmed from a few thin books, TV programs like Discovery channel and self-delusions - what else? He is probably very self-justifying and takes a lot of pride in treating people like his lesser. He probably had a tough time growing up (could possibly be a victim of school bully or a really unpopular kid) but this is mainly from my speculations.</p>
              <p>Sadly, no one gives a steak knife of what he thinks and says... And he hardly realizes it...</p>
