              <p>Ended up in Old Tampines Road while trying to find my way home earlier on, it felt like one of the spookier places I've been to. Later on, some SC members mentioned it's a haunted area. I'n wondering if you guys have any real life experiences to share?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll start. Have been to some rumoured places past midnight but nothing happened. Didn't feel spooked either.</p>
              <p>Old Changi Hospital - Some corners are extremely dark even in broad daylight. Felt nothing and saw nothing while working there at night though some colleagues claim otherwise. No ghostly sightings on my camera.</p>
              <p>The abandoned tv world in Tuas - Same situation as Old Changi Hospital. Walked around the area alone with a torch, no experiences as well. No ghostly sightings on my camera.</p>
              <p>Fort Canning Park - Hiking around at night, nothing seen. Could it be because we were there in a large group?</p>
              <p>So this Old Tampines Road feels a little special. Some kind of strange sense of foreboding in the air. Anybody has actual real life stories to share? What about temples? They are supposed to be sacred places. Are they haunted too even with idols furnished all around?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Came across different people who claim the ability to see spirits have described the same thing lingering next to me on several occasions throughout the years. Wonder why the coincidence sometimes.</p>

              <p>Shit man.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, halfway through Old Tampines Road after a few old bus stops, I made a U turn and turned back. Maybe because the windows were down and even with music blasting, it felt kindda scary to go further in. Usually a little wary about roads I've never travelled to.</p>
              <p>No cars around either.</p>
              <p>Boy it was spooky. Cos still a little dazed after getting out of the place, then this round turn (can't remember whether it was before or after the TPE), machiam vortex, turn for a long time still haven't finished.</p>

              and the kitchen. i guess that the kitchen entrance to the living
              room could be the 3rd door.</p>

              night also.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>There use to be a a burnt and abandoned hospital behind the girls home in Toa Payoh . About 7-8 years ago , about 13 of us went in to 'explore' . We walked past the toilet and the door was closed . After walking around , we leave the hospital the same direction we used going in . We walked past the same toilet and this time there was no door at all , as opposed to what we saw earlier and there are lots of paper ingots(Kim zhua) on the floor ...</p>
              <p>All 13 of us ran out frantically and also prior to that , some of my friends claimed they saw shadows in the hospital</p>
