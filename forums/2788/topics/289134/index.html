            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Scorpio<br><br>Tis' better to be furious than to be bland and uninvolved.</strong><br><br>It's said that you can recognize a Scorpio by his stare.  That famous stare has become downright notorious in general astrology textbooks and sun-sign columns.  Enigmatic, penetrating, probing while revealing nothing, apparently hostile or ruthless.  The man with the x-ray vision.  This little cameo, along with the infamous passion which is usually attributed to the sign, has gone a long way toward making life pretty difficult for Scorpio people.  After all, when someone asks you at a party what sign you are, and you look at them (penetratingly) and reply, 'Scorpio', and they give a little gasp and back away in fright, or instantly inquire what you're doing later, well, it can get a littleÂ…difficult.<br><br>Scorpio is without a doubt the most perplexing and perhaps the least understood of all the signs of the zodiac.  Scorpios themselves do not help this problem, since they are indeed prone to playing the enigmatic, mysterious type when they are unsure of a situation and are checking out the currents.  Let's abandon preconceptions and start from the beginning.  What is it about the eighth sign that seems to provoke so much confusion, fascination and dread?  Open a medieval astrological text and, if you're strongly Scorpio - sun, moon or ascendant - you may as well take a flying leap off the Golden Gate Bridge, or turn yourself in to the police right away before you perpetrate violence or sexual assault on someone.  The descriptions are that bad.  Power-driven, sex-crazed, violent, warlike, vindictive, cunning:  the image is a pretty horrific one.  The modern equivalent isn't much better.  It's a real nuisance having to live up to Mata Hari (who was a Scorpio) or Don Juan.  Tiring, you might say.  What is Scorpio really like?<br><br>Like Cancer and Pisces, this is a water sign.  Earlier, we talked about water as the element which is most connected with the feeling side of life.  This means that Scorpio, regardless of his habitual smokescreens - and make no mistake about it, Scorpio has the best smokescreens of any of the signs - is a sign of profound feeling and sensitivity, easily affected by the emotional currents inside him and around him, susceptible to the feelings of others, easily hurt, sympathetic, compassionate, often intensely lonely, and driven by an almost voracious need for relationship.  Never mind that 'loner' business that has been tacked onto the sign.  Scorpio is no loner at heart.  Just the opposite.  He longs for really profound, close union.  It's just that he's rather discriminating about whom he allows into his psychic field, being so intensely sensitive.  And also, he's well, you might say a little mistrustful of people.<br><br>Let's talk about the mistrust.  Scorpio might prefer to call it realistic caution.  Like all water signs, Scorpio has no illusions about the goods in the shop window necessarily matching those in the shop.<br><br>Scorpio has an uncanny way of perceiving what other people don't wish to be known.  Often they don't know it themselves, which makes things even more uncomfortable.  It is very unnerving to feel that somebody knows something about you that you don't know yourself.  From early childhood on, Scorpio sees through hypocrisy and sham with his curiously, tuned nose for undercurrents.  Being watery, he will often not be able to formulate these perceptions.  More likely, he'll have strong, immediate gut reactions to people.  And you can be pretty sure that when he smells brimstone, he's liable to be dead right.  The trouble is that he smells brimstone just about everywhere.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scorpio, you see, is privy to one of the most profound and disturbing secrets of human nature:  all individuals carry within them a dark side.  Scorpio cannot afford to be romantic, because he knows perfectly well that alongside mankind's nobility and greatness he is also still an animal, and not a very attractive one at that.  We mentioned that the element of air is idealistic.  In principle, man is fundamentally good.  The element of water is more realistic.  Principles are lovely, but life is different.  No wonder Scorpio sometimes seems deeply cynical.  How could he be otherwise, when he is constantly barraged with the unwelcome and unoffered sight of everyone's dirty linen, including his own?<br><br>One of Scorpio's greatest difficulties in life is to learn tolerance.  Compassion he's got in plenty, although he will be ruthless when necessary and, unlike Piscean and Cancerian fellows, is far less likely to be swayed by a sad story when the teller has made no effort to help himself.  But even with all that compassion, you usually find that Scorpio is intolerant of weakness.  Suffering he responds to; he has the deepest sympathy for pain and loneliness.  A great number of Scorpios may be found in the helping professions, both medicine and psychology, because they are so keyed in to people's pain and the struggle of those trapped in their own darkness.  But laziness and weakness Scorpio will not abide.  His attitude is that no matter what sort of mess you are in, you can do something about it, and make of your life what you will.  By the time he is ready to leave his life, Scorpio will usually have found the secret to performing this little act of self-transformation himself.  Why, then, he reasons can't others?  What he fails to realize is that people are made differently, and not everyone has his capacity for ruthless self-discipline.  Also, it just isn't everyone's path in life.  Scorpio's famous Luciferian pride - the cut-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face variety - keeps him from recognizing that it's sometimes necessary, even courageous, to yield.<br><br>Which brings us to another important facet of Scorpio's nature.  We'll discuss it in more detail further on.  Suffice it to say here that Scorpio has a great problem relinquishing control.  This means control on a lot of levels.  It may be controlling spontaneous expression or emotion outward - we all know the character that, even after a couple bottles of wine and a fifth of whiskey, still maintains his iron grip on himself, and will never, never allow himself to appear foolish or sloppy in front of others.  It may be controlling other people - and this is a real problem in Scorpio's close relationships.  It may be controlling life itself - where you find the arch-manipulators who pull the puppet strings all around themselves to keep the world in its place.  Whatever the nature of it, somewhere in his life every Scorpio has a large key which fits a large iron door behind which liesÂ…..Well, you really wouldn't want to know, would you?  Take all that insight and immense sensitivity, and a liberal dash of the fierce pride and determination to carve his own path through life, throw in a dose of general mistrust of people's motives and you don't exactly come up with what is colloquially known as a 'laid back' person.  Sometimes this produces an attractive and fascinating smouldering quality - hints of fathomless depths.  Lucky you if you can plumb them.  Sometimes it produces a downright paranoiac.<br><br>It has often been said that Scorpio, because of his great will-power, patience, persistence and insight, can succeed at anything he puts his mind to.  This is generally true.  Scorpio is hard to beat once he decides he's going to achieve something.  Because this is a sign of feeling, Scorpio commits himself emotionally to everything he does.  Otherwise he can't be bothered.  Whether it's becoming a nation's leader (like Charles de Gaulle, a famous Scorpio) or changing a lightbulb, if it interests him, then it will never be just a lukewarm job.  It will be done with heart, soul and body thrown in.  When you are really emotionally committed to something, you're going to put all of your talents and resources into it.  Mountains are effortlessly moved in this way.  Insight makes it possible for Scorpio to sidestep, avoid or outsmart - or, if necessary, bludgeon - those who might wish to pull him down, long before anybody else realizes a confrontation is coming.  Martin Luther was a Scorpio.  Who but a Scorpio can defy the whole Catholic Church.  Teddy Roosevelt, another famous Scorpio, had a favorite expression which was his formula for success:<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Walk softly and carry a big stick</strong><br><br>And the steady control of this fixed sign, which allows Scorpio to wait for years if necessary to achieve his goal, misses nothing, forgets nothing.  It's a remarkable formula for success.<br><br>The thing is, success is not usually what motivates Scorpio.  Certainly there are those born under the sign who, frustrated in their emotional lives, make absolute power their ultimate goal.  But that's a pathological expression of the sign, not a genuine one.  Twist anybody painfully enough and you will find they seek power to compensate.  The real key to Scorpio's enormous determination to make something of himself lies deep within his own secret soul.  His heart is always a battleground, for the masculine and feminine elements war within him constantly, forcing him to delve into his own motivations far more deeply than our extroverted society considers healthy.  He has the feminine sensitivity and feeling of the water signs; yet he is ruled by Mars, the god of war, and Pluto, the lord of death.  We are taught very early in western culture that Scorpio's brand of introspection is 'brooding', and that to indulge in it is basically neurotic or egotistical.  But Scorpio sees it differently.  And, after all, he's probably right, at least as far as his own path is concerned.  For him it's not neurotic brooding.  It's a way of trying to find the truth about himself and about life.  To Scorpio, skimming along the surface is offensive.  He loathes superficiality almost as much as he loathes weakness of character.  He must understand why he feels as he does, why he acts as he does, why others act and feel as they do.  He delves and probes into regions which would send the other signs scurrying to the beaches and discotheques.  Scorpio must ultimately understand himself, and come to some kind of truce with the warring forces of his nature which allow him no peace.<br><br>Every Scorpio carries within him a wound of some kind, an emotional or sexual problem or conflict or frustration which - no matter how hard he tries - refuses to be solved.  He usually creates this problem himself.  He has a penchant after all, for creating crisis and then pitting himself against the enemy in good dramatic style.  There is more of the touch of theatre in Scorpio.  This is the secret of Scorpio's self-destructive tendency.  This is really why he injures himself, goads himself with something that he cannot overcome.  It spurs him to achieve something within himself, which is ultimately much more important to him than outer achievements.  He can perhaps recite for himself the lines of William Ernest Henley's poem:<br><br>I am the master of my fate.<br>I am the captain of my soul.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Scorpio Lover</strong><br><br>Enough has been written about Scorpio's famous sensuality and erotic inclinations to make further descriptions redundant.  Not only redundant:  they're not strictly accurate either.  Passion, Scorpio possesses in abundance.  But that passion may not necessarily come out in the obvious way.  Sexuality for Scorpio is more a matter of emotion - a symbol, a way of reaching a different order of experience.  It isn't just a physical release.  Taurus is really the sign of pure earthy sensuality, not Scorpio.  Many Scorpios have a deep mystical feeling about sex, and sex and love are bound up with a longing for some kind of experience which the ordinary relationship can never provide.  Call it what you like - a mystical experience, a taste of the depths, a surrender, or whatever.  It has less to do with the body, and more to do with the soul.<br><br>You might call Scorpio erotic, rather than sensual.  There is a world of difference.  Pick a copy of any Playboy magazine and you will see crude sexuality at its most rampant.  It's the body which is the turn-on.  Eroticism is different; it's the tone, the colour, the atmosphere, the underlying feeling.  Watch a film like the Japanese Empire of the Senses.  Sexual it isn't; erotic it is.  When you understand the difference, you'll understand Scorpio's sexuality.  Sometimes there are darker undercurrents to it - a trace of cruelty, a touch of masochism, some fantasies that involve things our grandmothers pretended didn't exist.  Experimentation is something Scorpio will happily pursue - provided it's erotic, not mechanical.  'How to' journals bore him.  He doesn't need to learn how to.  His curiosity is usually alive from the age of three onwards.  It's something else he's after.<br><br>Because Scorpio is a fixed sign, it possesses a capacity for enduring loyalty and love.  This can sometimes amount to an act of great self-sacrifice.  That same fanaticism that we sometimes see in Scorpio's religious and political views can permeate his relationships as well.  On the negative side, his fixity can amount to absolute possession.  Either way, there isn't anything lukewarm about the Scorpio lover.  That is, if he is in love.  If he isn't, and the magic gateway into the upper (or lower) realms isn't visible, you are liable to be confronted with that chilly quality which all water signs possess when their feelings aren't engaged.  Sorry.  Nobody home.<br><br>Scorpio's biggest problem as a lover - male or female - is, you guessed it, his need to maintain control.  This includes the famous jealousy, as it does the deep and enduring love.  But he must, at all times, be master of the game.  Sometimes this can show in some pretty petty ways.  Like having too much pride to apologize when he has done something really stupid, because it means you've one-upped him.  Or finding little malicious ways to test you, so that you always have the feeling you're the dispensable one.  On the other hand, paradoxically, Scorpio has little respect for someone who won't fight him.  That, after all, is weakness.  So, you're caught in a bind.  He has to win, but he resents it if you don't give him a little flack for it.  Fights are fairly common in Scorpio relationships.  That is, if you haven't got one of the repressed Scorpios where everything seethes inside, like a hot volcano boiling, but all you see is an occasional puff of steam out the top.  If you've got one of those, beware.  Send your Scorpio to an encounter group to release the pressure.  It isn't much fun when it blows at you.<br><br>Crisis and blow-ups are fairly common games within Scorpio relationships.  Implacable resentment, and making you pay for any insult - real or imagined - are other bonuses on the less pleasant side.  What about the advantages?<br><br>What is really rare about Scorpio as a lover is that he has a real capacity for understanding the other person.  Since he misses very little, he will usually know an awful lot about you very quickly.  For those who don't like this kind of honesty, choose some other sign.  But if relationships mean something more than hanging about at discothÃ¨ques together, try a Scorpio.  His way of conducting relationships - if it becomes a relationship, rather than a one-night experiment - always has depth.  He knows how to read another person's needs - and, if not threatened, will do his utmost to meet them.  All water signs thrive on being needed.  Scorpio is no exception.<br><br>Granted, you might not like the amount he or she knows about you.  But probing is Scorpio's business.  You can't expect this sign to play with veneers.  He may keep his secrets, but you won't be allowed to keep yours.  Scorpio is not above scanning the telephone numbers in your little black book while you're in the bath, or checking the receipts in your wallet.  Both Scorpio men and women do this.  Yet this primitive attitude of 'You're mine and that's that' can be immensely flattering.  Scorpio is said - particularly by air signs - to be too 'heavy'.  But that kind of heaviness is a matter of taste.  Whatever else is going, you know the relationship is terribly important to Scorpio.  The job, the in-laws, the boys at the club don't come first.  And there's a great deal to be said for someone who considers a relationship something current and important, rather than something which can be placed on the shelf while he gets on with something else.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>There are a lot of current opinions and definitions of jealousy.  From Cosmopolitan magazine to erudite psychology books, jealousy is one of the most perplexing and ever-present of human emotions.  Some people believe that jealousy is a natural accompaniment to life, the sour with the sweet.  Others think it's pathological, a sign of insecurity.  Others believe it has something to do with older standards of morality.  Still others believe that it's morally wrong, and not part of the idealized state of self-abnegating love which says, 'Whatever makes you happy makes me happy.'<br><br>You won't hear a Scorpio mouthing that sort of drivel.  More likely he'll tell you.  'Whatever makes you happy without me, you'll pay for.'  Jealousy is undoubtedly, in some people, a symptom of deep insecurity and mistrust.  Like the beautiful model who once came to me for a horoscope, who was certain her boyfriend fancied everybody else because she didn't think she was worth anything at all.  Possessiveness, in some degree, on the other hand, is pretty natural.  No one likes to lose what they have become attached to.  To Scorpio, possessiveness is as natural as breathing.  His feelings are intense.  They don't let go easily.  It's simply how he's built.  Unless a Scorpio has deliberately hardened his feelings because of fear of involvement, you won't find many Scorpio swingers.  If you do find one, you can be pretty sure they are running away from their own deep capacity for love, for fear it will hurt.<br><br>Double standards are often part of Scorpio's game - male or female.  What's good for him, he won't tolerate in you.  Many Scorpios believe - with all the emotional fixity of which they are capable - that they have the prerogative to flirt, or have affairs - but not you.  'It's different,' they say blithely.  And it's not male chauvinism either; I've heard this from Scorpio women as well.  If you want equal standards, you have to train your Scorpio.  This means wearing armour, helmet, arquebus, and lance.  It also means being prepared for some god-awful rows, many tears, some rather spicy words, and quite a few hurts - with only the chance of eventually understanding.  Otherwise, accept the status quo.  Is it worth it?  I once knew a woman married to a Scorpio man who had to put up with all of it - the jealousy, the double standards, the little barbs, the moodiness, the works.  I asked her why she stayed with him.  She replied, 'Because he's exceptional.  He's himself.  He's also true to himself.  Of course he's a bastard sometimes.  But he's an individual.  I respect that.'  There you have it.  For many people, complain as you like, Scorpio's fierce individuality can only inspire respect - and often love.<br><br>No one experiences a relationship with a Scorpio without changing.  They come out of it more self-aware, sometimes a little scarred, but looking at life a lot more deeply.  Don't expect fair play and sweetness and light.  Remember Milton's Lucifer - better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.  But it is said, by some very wise people over many ages, that life is made up of light and dark both, and that only the fool believes it to be otherwise.  And Scorpio is no fool.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Scorpio Man</strong><br><br>Let's strip the glamour and see what's underneath.  Remember that this is a water sign.  For all its great strength and courage, the emotional needs of the Scorpio man are much similar to those of the emotional needs of the Piscean and Cancerian.  Affection, acceptance, reassurance, love, companionship, in large quantities.  Undiluted by criticism.  As a water sign, Scorpio cannot bear coldness.  They are terribly sensitive.  That mask of nonchalant nonreaction is a mask.  Remember that.  No Scorpio will advertise the fact that he is hurt or feeling neglected.  You have to train as a telepath.  But remember that this is a watery, feminine, vulnerable sign.  Feminine, you ask?  How could this creature be feminine?  But there is a curious paradox about Scorpio.  The opposite sexual element is very strong in people of both sexes.  The moodiness, emotionalism, eroticism, and subjectivity are typical sides of the female face of Scorpio.  So is the possessiveness.  Many Scorpio men are acutely embarrassed by the presence of so much emotion in themselves.  That's when they become the hard-driving, ruthless, ambitious Scorpios of the textbooks.  But think of what it took to get them that way.  Can you unbend them?  Maybe, maybe not.  Probably in the end, it rests with the Scorpio himself.<br><br>This is not an easy man to live with.  For one thing, you won't get straight answers if you ask pertinent questions like, 'Do you love me?'  On the other hand, you'll get brutal scrapings of the bottom of the barrel when you least want it - like a vicious hour-long analysis of your motives in flirting with Mr AQ at the party, and why it stems from your sexual inadequacies and your rejection by your father.  He can cut deep when he wants, and then honesty precludes compassion.  That's the straight answer you don't want to hear - especially when he's got destructive, and decides he's going to hit back at you for some hurt you've inflicted on him without your even realizing it.  Tell you that you hurt his feelings?  Not likely.  And often he won't apologize either.  To live with this man, you must understand him; and to truly understand him, you must like him.  Yes, I mean like him.  And respect him - what he's made of, what drives him, what his loneliness means, what the depth of feeling does to him in a society which requires men to be detached, what his sensitivity means in a world which does not value it.  If you can't like him, then leave him alone; for you'll never, never change him.  Only a Scorpio can change himself.  And very likely, if you ask, he'll do the opposite.<br><br>If you are the type who minds having to acquiesce - or give the impression of it - then stay away.  This man is not for independent women of the more vociferous kind.  On the other hand he respects strength; and if you make allowance for his pride, which won't permit him to admit a wrong or lose a battle, no lover is more devoted, compassionate, insightful or gentle.  Show your pain to a Scorpio and they will do anything for you.  Show your arrogance, treat them with shallowness, attack them, and you have no chance of receiving anything at all - except their unpleasantness, which can be pretty unpleasant.  And don't trifle.  A Scorpio who thinks he's being mocked can be the most difficult person in the world.  His pride will not allow it.<br><br>What about jealousy?  Well, let's be realistic.  It's not going to go away.  Nor is his feeling that he has the prerogative - for flirtation, for affairs, for whatever he feels he wants - while you don't since you're his.  If you must have other relationships, be extremely clever and extremely discreet.  Otherwise you're in for a hellish time; for it is difficult for this man to forgive a betrayal.  It's the worst thing you can do to him.  The best is to believe in him - and to side with him when he's going through one of his the-world-doesn't-understand-me phases.  Scorpio trusts few people because few people trust him.  This begins in childhood, for he is never truly a child - yet is treated like one, often far beyond a reasonable point.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think no need for Scorpio woman lah since Ispyyy is male.<br><br>Ok next is Sagittarius.<br><br><strong>Sagittarius<br><br>Â….the excitement of the aim and the fascination of the journey.<br>Arrival is not the point.</strong><br><br>The centaur is a mysterious composite figure of Greek mythology - half horse and half human - who's always shooting his arrow at some distant target over the horizon and then galloping off in hot pursuit.  Sometimes he finds the arrow.  Sometimes, however, he gets completely sidetracked by all the interesting scenery on the way, until another target beckons.  It is an apt and descriptive image for Sagittarius, the third and most volatile of the fire signs.  For this equine archer does indeed aim the flashing arrow of his intuitive visions at some distant goal of the future; and most of his life is spent chasing after one arrow or another.  The big question is whether he has aimed true or not.  And, after that, whether he can find his arrow at all.<br><br>The key theme in all this classical imagery is that what really interests Sagittarius is the excitement of the aim and the fascination of the journey.  The goal is really, after all, relatively insignificant.  There is a basic attitude innate in Sagittarius that life is an adventure, a journey, a quest - and the real sport of living is to make that journey as interesting, as varied, as expansive, and as informative as possible.  Arrival is not the point.<br><br>Jupiter, King of the Gods in mythology, is said to be the planetary ruler of Sagittarius.  And we can learn a lot about our centaur friends by having a closer look at Jupiter's imposing figure.  First of all, he is noble, dignified and majestic.  That is, most of the time, when he has his Olympian court around him and plays the hilt of the role rex deibus.  He is a consummate actor, our friend Jupiter.  He is also the great profligate of the Olympian heights, a god who is always chasing something or other - mostly women.  Some Jupiter-ruled folk take this symbol literally, and they are the Don Juans of the zodiac.  It isn't that they are driven by some insatiable sexual passion, though.  It's the ideal that drives them, the possibility of something new and exciting.  The adventure, the unexplored mystery, the unobtainable goal, the one that got away.  Sagittarius, it seems, has this Jupeterian propensity to be afraid he might be missing something - be it a woman, a project, an idea, a book, a creative work, virtually anything new and untried and unexplored.  On a more extroverted level, you'll always find the Sagittarians gathering where a new club has opened up, a hot new restaurant, an artsy film, an exciting workshop or group of some kind.  Some people have used the unkind word 'trendy' to describe this behaviour.  What it's really about is that Sagittarius has a remarkable intuitive nose for what's going to be popular before anybody else knows it.  It is often the Sagittarius who makes fashion, because he gets there first and gives his often vociferous stamp of approval.  And everyone else, knowing that if it weren't good he wouldn't be there, troops after him.<br><br>The more introverted Sagittarian may not be found frequenting a new disco or roller skating rink.  But he'll usually be miles ahead of everyone else with a new novel, a new philosophy, a new film, a new cultural phenomenon.  The same gifted intuition works here, but in a more interior way.   And it works, too, with contacts.  Nobody has the penchant for making valuable contacts than Sagittarius does.  Somehow it's always the centaur who 'bumps into' the director looking for a new lead, the publisher looking for a new work, the record producer looking for a fresh voice.  It can make you tear your hair, the way luck seems to pour from heaven onto Sagittarius' haloed head.  But it isn't really luck.  It's that remarkable eye for the opportunity, that intuitive nose that can spot a potential or a possibility thirty miles away.  And also the impulsiveness, rashness, boldness, call it what you will, that gives Sagittarius the flaming nerves to try his luck, where other signs will cower in the wings waiting for something more concrete.<br><br>Boredom is the great enemy of this rampant and random sign, and believe me, they get very easily bored.  It takes a mere doing something twice in the same way to push the more restless type of centaur out after the next arrow.  After all, he's done that one.  Why do it again?  Never mind telling him about the rewards of applied, disciplined effort.  Pass that advice onto a Virgo or Capricorn.  Sagittarius isn't interested.  For him, it's the exhilaration of the process of getting there, not the kind of reward you can hold in your hand.  Besides, if he ever got to hold it in his hand, he'll no doubt spend it within five minutes anyway.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's take another look at Jupiter, for he is full of information about our unpredictable fire sign.  For another thing, he's got a very jealous wife.  Not that jealousy is the way to keep a Sagittarian in a relationship; fences drive him crazy, and ultimatums are guaranteed to drive him directly into the opposite behaviour.  But think again.  Without that jealous wife trailing him everywhere and doing terrible things to his mortal mistresses, where would Jupiter be?  Where would the spark and excitement of all those peccadilloes go?  Right.  What makes them fun in large part, is that Jupiter gets to fool someone, to play the gambling game.  If it were all socially acceptable and out in the open, why, he probably wouldn't bother.  It would have been too boring.  The elements of danger and a little rebellion against social mores are lifeblood to Sagittarius.  He may look conventional, but he loves to push his luck.<br><br>Another thing about Jupiter.  He's always changing shape.  When courting, he's apt to be a swan, a bull, a shower of gold, virtually anything else his imagination can create.  It's the consummate actor again.  Sagittarius loves to play roles - the more theatrical, the better.  Being caught in the same costume twice is quite horrific for him.  His restless mind is always seeking new ways to approach those goals, new costumes, new poses, new techniques.  Change, travel, constant mental stimulus, exploration of unknown landscapes - tell Sagittarius that there really is a hidden treasure under that mountain and he'll be as happy as any Taurus with his bank account bursting.  Find a Sagittarian who's forced to circle the same ground over and over again, perform the same routine in endless monotony, and you have found the most miserable of creatures.<br><br>Jupiter also has a mighty explosive temper.  Think of all those thunderbolts and flashes of lightning.  He can be pretty terrifying in mid-eruption.  But when it's over, the anger is gone, and he's jovial again.  Not a god to hold a grudge.  And although Sagittarius can sometimes display a fairly flamboyant sort of anger, complete with waving arms and smashed crockery, he really doesn't brood about it afterward.  You won't find Sagittarius plotting away in the corner ten years later like you will Scorpio, or nursing his wounds like Cancer.  Once he's yelled at you, he's finished.  Often he can't understand why the recipient of all his blustering and noise is so hurt by the display.  After all, he didn't really mean it, not really.  All those horribly blunt, hair-raisingly honest remarks he made weren't really true, they were just, well, for effect.  As you pick yourself up off the floor after his barrage of deadly verbal arrows, you may well be astonished at how quickly he's recovered his usual sweet temper.  But Sagittarius isn't renowned for his sensitivity to subtler feelings.  His arrows can be really destructive to the more sensitive signs - like Pisces, Virgo, Cancer - but he doesn't realize it.  Bash him over the head and he won't crumple with horror.  He might bash back, but it's all part of the game.  How can you remain angry at such naÃ¯vetÃ©?<br><br>Sagittarius can also be downright gullible, if you flatter him properly.  Like all the fiery signs, he loves mythology - especially if it means he can mythologize himself.  A lovable quality - unless you happen to be his wife and it's somebody else offering the flattery.  Then what do you do?  Absolutely nothing.  Offer lots of rope.  With luck, he'll hang himself.  The heart of the fiery signs is always true.  But it's true to the ideal, not to the physical reality with all its imperfections.  And it's pretty hard for this fiery spirit to inhabit a world of boundaries and limitations.  Show him that you understand that, and you've earned an undying friendship.<br><br>Friendship, by the way, is a key word for Sagittarius.  He will often refer to a lover as 'my friend', for this ultimately means more to him.  Heavy displays of emotion, particularly the soggy kind that don't have any romantic dash to them, are very disturbing to Sagittarius.  He can take grand drama - after all, he makes enough of it himself - but he can't stand pathos.  Domesticity too can terrify the wits out of him.  And this applies to the female Sagittarian as well.  Offer her the 3.4 children, the piles of unwashed diapers, the dinner to cook, the beds to make, and no prospect of ever escaping on some exciting journey, and you'll never see anyone run so fast.  The world of safe, unchanging domestic security and serenity is not Sagittarius' idea of a happy life.  He needs his pack on his back and a mountain to climb.  Home is pleasant, so long as the back door isn't kept locked.<br><br>What, then, is this quest on which every true Sagittarian spirit must embark?  It varies.  Much has been written about the sporty side of the sign.  But this is more a by-product than the goal of the quest.  Lots of Sagittarians hate sport.  And travel, although often a favorite Sagittarian pursuit, is really a means of enlarging one's horizon.  The Sagittarian traveler isn't the one who books the two-week package holiday in the huge hotel on the Costa del Sol and sits in the sun nursing his tan.  He's the one who needs to be mobile, who needs a city to explore, a ruin, a chateau, a library, a mountain, a place no one else has been.  And the stranger and more alien the culture, the better off he likes it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a sentence, at the heart of Sagittarius there lies a great craving to explore and understand life.  Whether orthodox or not, Sagittarius, like Leo, is a deeply religious sign, and the word religious is here used in its original sense:  to reconnect.  This means reconnection with the source, with the roots of life, with some sense of meaning.  Whether you find him traveling as a salesman or an archaeologist, a poet or a scholar, whatever profession or job he lands himself in.  Sagittarius is trying to broaden his scope, to enlarge his consciousness.  Life is a curious and interesting thing to Sagittarius.  It is something to be played with, explored, enjoyed, peered into.  And ultimately, understood.<br><br>Watch the typical Sagittarian conversation line.  Make an ordinary everyday remark - something like, 'Have you noticed that fashions this summer are getting very ethnic - all that hemp and linen and Indian cotton?'  Any other sign would reply with a personal comment.  Yes, I really like the look.  Or yes, I really hate the look.  Or, it's great because the clothes are so cheap.  Or, my mother doesn't approve because you can see through muslin.  But listen to the Sagittarian.  Everything, to him, is connected with something larger.  Whether in the pool hall or in the university, he is an irrepressible philosopher, with or without the vocabulary.  Expansion is the keyword.  So:  'Yes, I've noticed.  I'm sure it's because in our current society there is a deep need for trying to reestablish a connection with nature.  Technology has forced man toÂ….'    And you're off on a deep, broad, often hilariously funny and frequently inspiring philosophical discussion.  Sagittarius watches other people a lot, and he has both a strong sense of irony and an acute degree of insight.  The leaping intuition of the element of fire is directed toward the world of ideas to Sagittarius - often with great brilliance or, at the very least, with a capacity to grasp broader implications and themes.  No Sagittarian, however poorly read or educated, lacks this capacity to make connections between the ridiculous and the sublime.<br><br>Jupiter is the King of Gods because he's the biggest.  And in an odd sort of way Sagittarius is the biggest sign - in terms of horizons.  Better to shoot an arrow high and lose it than to aim low.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Sagittarian Lover</strong><br><br>It's a traditional tale that Sagittarius exhibits a certain reluctance when it comes to things like marital vows.  This is pretty understandable in light of all the foregoing; since Sagittarius' great love is of open possibilities, he's naturally going to baulk when he's asked to give up all those future possibilities for one reality for the rest of his life.  'Till death do us part' is a phrase which resonates in his consciousness largely because of the word 'death', which is what such a commitment may seem like to our ever-questing archer.  And this is especially true when you find the archer who's already been through a marriage which he made in the days when his idealism was untarnished by the realization that sometimes things don't quite work out that way.  Find a once-divorced Sagittarian and he's likely to be very, very shy of getting bitten again.  And in many ways a state of non-marriage suits Sagittarius, not because he's necessarily always roving and dissatisfied, but because he at least knows he can exist if he wants to with a minimum of fuss.  And just knowing that the back door is open does wonders for his anxieties.<br><br>Sagittarius might not sound like too good a prospect for relationship, from all that we've said.  This isn't really true, of course, it just depends on the quality of the relationship.  His myth is certainly that of the wanderer.  But myths portray symbols and psychological realities, not necessarily literal behaviour.  The endless seeking after future goals and possibilities, the endless quest for meaning, may in fact be a quest lived within his own soul, and not necessarily through a series of partners revolving around the bedroom.  Some Sagittarians, of course, choose the literal enactment.  And there isn't a great deal you can do about it, unless you like this sort of open relationship and are prepared to have your own life too.  It isn't always a pathology; after all, remember Jupiter.  He sets a fine example.<br><br>If you've got yourself into an involvement with a Sagittarian like this, it won't do much good to play Juno and become the nagging, jealous, suspicious wife.  It really doesn't help at all; and it often drives the Sagittarian, like Jupiter, straight into more sympathetic arms.  The same applies to the Sagittarian woman, who may often display the same propensities as her male counterpart.  As soon as you remind Sagittarius that he's responsible to somebody for something, he often gets very, very uncomfortable, and has to do something to convince himself that he can't be tied by responsibilities.  If you want to do anything at all to help the situation with a profligate Sagittarian, try reverse psychology.  But that's for very strong people.  Otherwise, find yourself a more constant and homebound sign.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Sagittarius Man</strong><br><br>This elusive and fascinating creature can often be spotted either by his tendency to gesticulate wildly or by his tendency to tell very funny stories.  Often he'll do both.  But one of the things which virtually exudes all over from Sagittarius is his sense of dramatic irony.<br><br>You'll often find that the Sagittarius man does his traveling and his wandering on a mental level rather than a physical one.  They are often the apparent intellectuals of the zodiac, devouring books, absorbing all forms of knowledge like tasty meals.  But Sagittarius isn't an intellectual in the sense that Gemini is; he's not prone to analyzing with a fine-toothed comb all the bits of information that come into his head.  He's much more intuitive, and more interested in relating fields of knowledge than in dissecting them.  And his mind is speculative - whether it's about philosophy, literature, the arts, or the stock-market.<br><br>For him, this life of the mind is much more important than what he eats for dinner.  In fact, he'll often forget to eat.  The Sagittarius man has a peculiar habit of getting involved, particularly in the earlier part of life, with rather maternal and earthy women who see his absent-minded and endearing quality ('The poor dear, he's so brilliant and he can't even remember to change his shirt.') and immediately feel they need to take care of him.  Now, what he doesn't need, repeat, doesn't need, is to be taken care of.  Yes, of course, he'd live in a pigsty without you, and his clothes would be rumpled, and his hair needing cutting, but if you do all these things for him he'll not only grow to resent it in time, he'll also never get to do it himself. Besides, he might not particularly care.  Sagittarius, like the other fiery signs, is often attracted to the earthy signs - Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn.<br><br>And the Sagittarian man with an earthy partner will, for a time, certainly allow her to become the symbol of steadiness, stability, reliability.  If you're cast in this role, try to stop playing it right at the beginning, not at the end.  It's a tragic mistake that occurs regularly in Sagittarian relationships.  You can't mother him until he grows up.  For one thing, growing up in his terms means something different from growing up in yours.  For earthy people, maturity is synonymous with taking responsibility in the tangible world.  For fiery people, maturity is seeing, knowing, understanding.  By earthy terms, Sagittarius will never wholly grow up; nor should he.  And all that careful mothering and shirt-ironing which is usually aimed (secretly) at binding the dashing, wandering soul to you for all eternity, is likely to backfire in a bad way.  Sagittarius, for all his longing for earth and steadiness, needs ultimately to find it in himself.  And the less responsibility you take for him, the less resentful you'll be, and the more relaxed he'll feel, and the better the future for you both.<br><br>Not that you're to blame.  The archer is a stimulating and exciting and dynamic man, and his fleet-of-foot quality, that tantalizing quality of free self-expression and untamed vision, makes him terribly appealing particularly to women who long for a little excitement and adventure in their lives.  And there's no doubt that Sagittarius' adventurous soul is guaranteed not to bore you.  But try to find adventure and excitement in yourself first, please; then you're likely to enjoy him and his vision much, much more.  One of Sagittarius basic approach to life is to laugh at it; after all, what's so serious when you really think about it?  You have to have a sense of humour yourself; otherwise you won't understand at all what he's laughing at, especially when he laughs at you.  Sagittarius can sometimes be a terrible tease, and he's not averse to taking a sly little poke at anyone who carries too much seriousness or pomposity.  Fortunately this not very endearing quality is balanced by the fact that he can laugh at himself, too.<br><br>The Sagittarian man's biggest problem in relationships is making the dreaded bridge between romantic fantasy and fleshy reality.  For many archers, it's just too big a gap, and they never succeed in bridging it.  Living in the fantasy world, if you've got the money to support it, is the only recourse for this kind of Sagittarian.  Some archers despair, and feel they'll never achieve a successful relationship, so they roam through life leaving a trail of broken affairs behind them, unfinished business, unpaid debts, unlived life.  The fear of failure here is as big as the fear of material failure to the Sagittarian.  After all, what was Jupiter trying to prove?  Behind the often contemptuous and ironic attitude which many Sagittarian men have toward love and commitment, you'll often find a frightened child who's afraid his romantic world will be smashed.  The child can build a pretty big cynical wall around himself.  He can arm himself with a stunning array of quips, jokes, and nasty asides which makes you think he has no heart.  But inside, he's a child.  Don't fall for it.<br><br>Sagittarius has a heart of gold.  It just bruises easily.  Eventually, he learns that the idea is to reach the first goal first.  And trust and friendship are the guideposts that help him on his way.  He can offer these in abundance himself, and he truly deserves them in exchange.<br></div>

Both share all the basic Aquarian qualities of strength, independence, original thought.  One type turns the immense self-discipline and dedication of the sign into a purely personal sphere.  The other goes out into the world, to try her muscle in society.  Either way, this is no helpless, malleable creature.  Her self-sacrifice is wholly self-motivated, and due to her own ideals, not your wishes.<br><br>Many Aquarian women find that the sphere of home and family is insufficient to exercise their intellectual abilities and interest in the larger group.  So you find numerous Aquarian women in the political and helping fields, combining their wide-ranging ideas and spirit for concern for others with their innate femaleness.  The typical profession here is the social worker or psychologist.  Also the teacher and educator.  Remember that it may be Aquarius on the ascendant that we are talking about here.  But wherever you find this woman in professional life, she will be motivated by her ideals.<br><br>As you might expect, Aquarius is not a sign that is exactly conducive to sexual role-playing in relationships.  In fact, many Aquarian women are intensely dedicated to the Women's Movement, for it is a natural to the sign.  The logic and necessity of it is obvious to Aquarius, where it might not be to the more personal-oriented signs like Cancer, Taurus or Virgo.  A great many Aquarian women must, at some point in their lives, become involve with a cause of some kind, even if it concerns only the three families on the street they live in.  And this kind of dedication to a cause brings the best out of the sign.<br><br>It's a little more difficult on an emotional level.  Aquarian women sometimes has as much difficulty as Aquarian men in expressing feeling.  Sometimes it's recognized but held in - and you get a kind of stiffness, a rigidity, a stiff-necked pride.  Sometimes the emotions are completely unconscious, and then you see an appearance of coldness, remoteness, aloofness in personal relationships.  The 'don't tie me down syndrome' is as typical of the Aquarian woman as it is of the Aquarian man.  Because of the resentment toward role-playing, there is also a great liberality in sexual behaviour often in evidence in Aquarian women.  These are the women who are much more likely to recognize frankly their own bisexuality, their need for more than one relationship, their need for purely sexual affairs and escapades outside marriage.<br><br>Aquarius is a masculine sign; it combines with more or less grace with feminine psychology, either in a true marriage which produces the gifted thinker who also has a heart, or in an uneasy conjoining where you have a woman who is basically embarrassed by her own femaleness.  This can often be a problem with the Aquarian woman; 'female' sometimes seem to her to mean weakness, emotionalism, or the victim of masculine domination and suppression.  Not an easy sign for a woman to carry, and get it right.  But with effort, you have the woman who can be both man and woman, true to her own female self yet with a strong masculine quality that allows her to concern herself with issues beyond her own personal satisfaction.<br><br>From all this, it will be obvious that Aquarius is not the woman to choose if you want, (a) the devoted and silent helpmeet who will adore you and listen uncritically to everything you say, or (b) the domestic creature who is only interested in you, your meals, your work, your children, and your cleaning and ironing.  On the other hand, for those who are genuinely able to accept women as people, Aquarius can be an inspiring companion and helpmeet and friend, as well as a person in her own right.  From this angle, the Age of Aquarius has a lot to do with the Women's Movement - and no sign is closer to the vanguard of the movement than Aquarius, in both its more violent and its more reasonable manifestations.<br><br>And whatever you have to complain about in the Aquarian woman - whether it is her rigidity, her dedication to her own principles, her stubbornness, her detachmentÂ¸ or her refusal to regard her loved one as the penultimate hero, you must admit that this woman is interested and interesting.  Men who are afraid of intelligent women should stay away.</div>

The neat, orderly, tidy soul with the perfectly balanced bank account and the immaculate kitchen is a picture which sends most Virgos into fits of cynical laughter.  And even the virtuous, virginal lady with the unbound hair (discreetly clothed) who adorns jewelry and zodiacal knick-knacks doesn't have much to do with our theme either.  For some rather elusive reasons - reasons which just might lie, as so much astrological misunderstanding does, in the attempt during medieval times to Christianize or make 'moral' a symbolic system that is far older and more inclusive than Christianity - Virgo is sadly misinterpreted.  Some signs come out rather badly when you try to moralize symbols into social concepts, and Virgo and Scorpio have been hit the hardest - you're caught between the eternal secretary and the eternal sex maniac.  Well, like many Scorpios, Virgos are getting pretty resentful about all this misrepresentation.  Especially the untidy ones, who are quite shamelessly slovenly and not in the least concerned with whether they arrive at one minute before eight or one minute after.  It has been suggested that Virgos have not yet come into their own because the real ruler of Virgo - Vulcan - has not yet been discovered.  There has been, however, a discovery made of a strange little 'planet' between Saturn and Uranus, which astronomers were quick to call Chiron for reasons best known to themselves but which might just fill the bill.  We don't know yet.  Never mind.  What is Virgo really about, if not the eternal janitor of the zodiac?<br><br>Let's bear in mind first of all that each sign has a deep, fundamental drive in it, a basic motivation which always spurs the individual whether he is aware of it or not.  This basic drive shows in different ways for different people.  We've already touched on these - how, for example, the drive toward understanding that motivates Sagittarius makes some Centaurs travelers and others scholars.  Physical or emotional or mental, the expression still comes from the same source.  And suffice it to say that Virgo's basic drive isn't toward cleanliness.  It has been suggested that perfectionism is a Virgo characteristic.  I haven't found this to be the case.  Discrimination, yes.  Absolutely.  No one is more discriminating than Virgo.  A simple yes or a simple no doesn't work; it's yes to this part and possibly to that part and probably no to the middle one unless A or B can be changed, and certainly no to the last.  Never black and white.  Black and white choices imply a simple universe, and to Virgo the universe is rarely simple.  It's more like a huge, boundless jigsaw puzzle, and it drives Virgo crazy if he hasn't got a picture of he puzzle on the top of the box before he begins to assemble the puzzle.  Discrimination is a finely developed faculty with Virgo.  You can see it in his choice of friends, lovers, food, ideas, lifestyle, clothes, reading, artistic taste, or any other area where choices are to be made.  But to be a perfectionist means you have to be idealistic, since you have to have an ideal of what constitutes the perfect.  And Virgo is no idealist.  It's one of the most realistic, possibly the most realistic sign of the zodiac.  Virgo harbours no possible rosy versions of a perfect utopian world, or even a perfect utopian kitchen.  Virgo uses what comes to hand, what appears on the plate.  The element of earth, remember, is the element that pertains to acceptance of earth plane reality.  And no perfectionist ever accepted reality.<br><br>It has been suggested, too, that there are two types of Virgos, the neat ones and the sloppy ones.  This is probably true as far as it goes.  There are two types of any sign - the introverted and extroverted.  The extroverted version of any zodiacal sign tends to express himself out in the world.  So the extroverted Aries finds challenges in the world, the extroverted Sagittarian explores the world, the extroverted Pisces projects his visions into the world, and so on.  The extroverted Virgo no doubt tries to apply his need to classify and order and synthesize at a worldly level.  The introverted versions of the signs express their natures through an inner reality.  So the introverted Capricorn is spiritually or psychologically ambitious, the introverted Sagittarian travels the boundless leagues of the mind and spirit, the introverted Pisces communes with the depths of his own inner ocean with its mysterious denizens, and the introverted Virgo attempts to synthesize and order himself.  Which means that the sink may well accumulate a truly ripe treasure-trove of week-old dishes, the house may accumulate a formidable array of objects in general disarray, and the world may go well to pieces so far as Virgo is concerned - so long as he's performing that long, alchemical labour within his own depths, on himself.<br><br>Notice that word synthesis.  It offers much more of a key to Virgo's basic motivation than perfectionism.  Synthesis means bringing together different things, like a good cook performing miracles of culinary genius with a random array of leftover bits from yesterday's meals.  Synthesis also means finding compatible things or ideas or aspects of life which most people find mutually exclusive.  Virgo's compulsion and gift both lie in this area of synthesis.  Everything must be fitted together and made to blend.  That means finding out where everything fits by naming it, learning about it, categorizing it, classifying it.  A friend of mine once referred to Virgo as the Great Classifier.  With mercury, god of intelligence and communication, as the present ruler of the sign, you'd expect a love of acquiring knowledge.  The difference between Virgo and Gemini, however, both of which are ruled by Mercury, is that Gemini loves bits and snippets of knowledge for their own sake.  For Virgo, knowledge is relevant only if it's useful.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>So in a way, you can say that this internal voice is always echoing in poor Virgo's mind with every new experience he meets.  'How can I synthesize it?',  he says, and then, 'How can I use it?'  If I can't synthesize it, he'll pretend it doesn't exist, or begin a dogged pursuit of names and definitions which will allow him to pigeonhole that experience to make it manageable.  If it can't be used, he'll discard it with a certain flippant arrogance.  Yes, that's fine for more impractical souls.<br><br>The drive to discriminate sometimes makes Virgo harsh.  He will throw aside people or ideas or careers or things of beauty because they may not be effectual or applicable to what he considers practical reality.  Sometimes he throws romance out as well, which is a tragic thing since you then find that type of Virgo for whom life is work and drudgery.  Often he's a cynic, looking at reality with jaundiced eyes; he knows perfectly well that you have to be clever to survive, and he's prepared to hustle a little and make the effort of polishing the goods because that makes them more saleable.  If he's going to do something, he'll do it well, both from pride in craftsmanship and from a good marketing sense.  Idealistic perfection?  Hardly.<br><br>Sometimes the only tidy thing you see around Virgo is his bookshelf, for many Virgos respect to an inordinate degree the entire field of knowledge.  His books are to him the personifications of his mind, and his mind is often like one of those intricate workings of a delicate Swiss watch, carelessly moving and cataloguing and reflecting and considering and labeling.  He may live with a heap on the living room carpet, but you can bet he's cleaning up his psyche.  A lot of Virgos take to astrology like ducks to water - that is, if they can ever get over the resistance to the aura of vague spiritualism which popular columns have mistakenly cast upon the study - because astrology and other cosmological maps offer them confirmation that the universe is basically orderly, and that God Himself is innately tidy.<br><br>The impulse to be of service also runs strong in Virgo.  Virgos need to be needed, and they need to be useful.  The typical Virgo is not particularly ambitious; he lacks the onesidedness necessary to go after one goal wholeheartedly.  In many ways his tendency to look for wider and wider pieces to complete the great jigsaw puzzle takes away any propensity for him to focus everything on one piece.  It's a rare Virgo who aims for the position of obvious power.  Most of the time you find them as advisors or counselors to someone else who's silly enough to have taken the throne and subjected himself to all that trouble.  Virgo, clever as always, prefers to lurk behind the throne and keep himself out of the line of fire.  Realistic, remember?  Foolhardy Leos and Ariens and Capricorns aim for the top.  Virgo knows that what comes up must come down; he'd rather keep his feet on the ground, thank you very much.  Unless a Virgo has a lot of Leo in his chart, or the sun strongly placed in the horoscope, you'll usually only meet him through his work, rather than through his outgoing personality.  Most characteristic Virgos are quite shy, or if not actually retiring, then subtler and quieter than their friends born under other signs.  Being earthy, Virgo does like his security, and the need for security is often a problem because it keeps Virgo from trying out creative possibilities that require daring and a little bit of gamble.  Ask a typical Virgo to gamble and he'll get a white, shocked look.  Gamble?  How horrible!  You never know when life might deal you a blow; better to plan and prepare for the future.  You often meet Virgos who have been rooted in rather limiting jobs for many years, where their natural intelligence and imagination are stifled, because of the wonderful security of that regular salary cheque.  Besides, Virgo is more curious about what makes the wheels on the car run than he is being the driver and entering the race.  He's a student and observer of life rather than a gambler or an entrepreneur.  It's said that Virgos make better servants than rulers.  This is undoubtedly true.  Remember the historical characters like Cardinal Richelieu.  Being a power behind the throne suits the Virgo very well.  Craftsmanship and craftiness often run together in this subtle sign.  Mercury, in mythology, was also the god of thieves and liars, and presided over the business deal.<br><br>There's another trait, sometimes endearing and sometimes infuriating, that's worth noting here about Virgo.  This is his obsessiveness.  He may be obsessive about order or tidiness in the obvious way, but equally often he's obsessive about emotional orderliness and tidiness.  That is, never show your own emotional weaknesses.  Virgo is a great controller of emotion.  In fact, if you watch a more obsessional Virgo for a while, you begin to get the queer feeling that he's organizing rituals to keep the forces of darkness at bay.  Whether it's the object-obsessive Virgo who puts all the yellow shirts on the left side of the cupboard and falls into a hysterical fit if you introduce a blue one, or the tightlipped emotionally constricted Virgo who analyses everything in a kind of frenzied desire to keep any ripped psychological seam from showing, the root is the same.  You guessed it.  All that chaos and emotional sensitivity and sloppiness, and romanticism and vision lurk secretly in the recesses of Virgo's soul.  He has to fight against his own chaos far too often to be tolerant of vagueness and woolliness in others or in the world around him.  There's too much of it in him.  Virgo's apparent hardness and ruthlessness - no sign is quite so adept at saying 'no' - is often his way of protecting himself against an intolerable insensitivity.  His famous meanness - and no doubt about it, many Virgos are really mean with money - is often a cover-up for a streak of innate extravagance.  And his insistent compulsion to stick to practical realities helps him to escape the mystic in his own soul.<br><br>A queer bird, Virgo.  Not far beneath the cool and analytic veneer you find a sentimental romantic.  Virgo may be brusque in manner, and don't try to borrow money unless you've proven you can repay it.  You'll rarely find Virgo as you find Pisces, who will offer his last pound to the drunk in Piccadilly Circus.  Virgo's more likely to deliver a stern and frequently insufferably irritating lecture about self-help.  But often this is because he's too acutely aware of the drunks, derelicts, rejects and flotsam of life, and has a real horror that he might become one himself.  Planning for and guaranteeing the safety of the future is an obsession with Virgo, because his acute sense of the world as it is often makes it hard for him to have faith or trust in life.  He can't cope with that reality he's so plugged into.  It threatens his sense of stability.  So he shuts it out - discriminating like mad against any elements of it he can't deal with - and looks out for number one.  You'll often find Virgo being generous and apparently altruistic, giving freely of his time and skills, especially when it comes to teaching somebody how to do something.  He loves to show his competence and is genuinely generous in sharing his knowledge.  But you'll rarely find Virgo giving beyond that ring-pass-not.  He usually learns his lesson early.  It's almost as though he has a secret Piscean in him somewhere.  And he's learned Pisces' lesson - with no boundaries comes self-disintegration.  After all, it's only realistic.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Virgo Man</strong><br><br>Some of the best Virgoan qualities make their appearance in the Virgo man in love.  One of this is his desire to be needed, and his generosity and helpfulness.  If you need support, talking, understanding, or material assistance.  Always reasonable, the Virgo man will often draw you out about your problems, and he loves to offer advice.  Give him a problem which is solvable and he'll attack it like a chess game, and often his detached insights are useful and constructive.  There's also a safe feeling about him, and a love of truth and accuracy.  And Virgo rarely pretends to be anything other than himself.  You won't get pushed into the corner to play adoring audience as you might with a Leo or Aries man.<br><br>On the other hand, the Virgo man's self-control and coolness can be infuriating.  He's sometimes the sort of person who insists on hanging his coat up carefully before he kisses you, because first things must come first.  Sometimes he's horribly socially sensitive, and will avoid touch in public because 'somebody' might notice that he's not completely in control, or discover that he has passions.  And taken to extremes, you also might have to cope with the scheduling of everything including courtship - which always comes second to work - and even sex - which also comes second to work.<br><br>Remember that it isn't easy to be a Virgo man.  The sign, like Pisces, is sensitive and vulnerable, and doesn't easily match the cultural male image.  Virgo men often have a chip on their shoulders, because they're trying hard to be cool and in control.  Any emotional need which isn't expressed in neat, structured verbal terms can then seem like an overwhelming demand.  There is a strangely self-contained quality in Virgo, which goes back to our myth about the Goddess.  For a lover or partner to be able to tolerate this shutting-off tendency in Virgo, he or she needs to keep a sense of humour, because otherwise the criticisms can be taken hurtfully and the entire relationship can blow up with resentment.<br><br>The thing that saves this complex and sometimes insufferable temperament from being really intolerable is that Virgo, if you can tell him the truth quietly and clearly, will always listen.  It's one of the most endearing qualities in the Virgo man.  If he's hurt you, or been cold, or been too structured, try articulating it.  Quietly.  He'll usually listen.  If you express it emotionally, he won't.  If you're the combustible type, with a lot of Scorpio or Leo, try a more resilient and less highly-strung temperament.  Virgo simply can't take angry explosions and tempestuous scenes, or long weeping sessions with lots of soggy handkerchiefs.  You'll often see Virgo men fidgeting, smoking heavily, biting fingernails, and doing other little acts which betray the tightly-strung nervous system of the sign.  Given the fact that the Virgo man will usually overwork himself anyway, it doesn't help his naturally fidgety temperament.  He needs lots of play, rest, and nature to heal him.  Usually he can't be bothered to make time, since that list has 'work' at the top of it.  So the onus falls on you to cajole him, reason him, or drag him to some place where after his initial whingeing he might even discover that it's quite pleasant to sit in the sun and do nothing.<br><br>For all these reasons the Virgo man in love is not always every woman's Brides' Magazine dream of the perfect husband.  It's a sensitive, high-strung, and complex temperament, rarely aggressive, more likely to let trifles and difficulties nag and nag inside before direct action is taken.  Virgo isn't Don Juan, although there are some fairly good imitation Don Juans floating about in the form of terribly insecure Virgos trying to pretend to be Sagittarius and Leos.  Trust, quiet, warmth, and safety are necessary for him to show any of that more mystical, sensitive side of himself, the one you ostensibly chose him for.  Hopefully, you didn't choose him to provide you with security, for you're making a sad error if you think he'll be able to play Supportive Father for very long.  He's too fluid and changeable, and too terrified of his own propensity to change, to tolerate being somebody else's rock.  Appreciate his intelligence, his wit, his cynical wisdom, his craftsmanship, his shrewdness, his kindness and his sensitivity, and you'll have a very rare creature as a lover.  For those who appreciate subtlety, and wit, and respect inner solitude, Virgo makes those more flamboyant signs seem pretty boorish in comparison.<br><br></div>
