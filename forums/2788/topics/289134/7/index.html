Not all explorers, mountain-climbers, and world travelers are male Sagittarius.  And the true female archer is as restless, as hungry for experience, as longing to explore the fascinating carnival that she sees in life as her male counterpart.  This woman needs personal freedom to an extraordinary degree, and she's not known for her readiness to marry or her readiness to take up domestic responsibilities.  Frequently she's happier spending a lifetime without both.  And she's likely to have a child out of wedlock and happily raise it as a traveling companion as she is to ensconce herself behind secure walls.  Walls, for any Sagittarian, are like waving a red flag at a bull.<br><br>Any career which allows space, travel, freedom of movement, and opportunity for new contacts pleases the Sagittarian woman.  And the archer who doesn't pursue a career still needs these things.  Failing everything else, she'll become a socialite, because at least she gets to throw parties and meet exciting people.  There are also more introverted, philosophical Sagittarian women - and some, like Jane Fonda, who may be philosophical but also more typical of their sign in that they are vociferous about their philosophies.  You'll also find the Sagittarius woman involved in a cause of one kind or another, because her astute vision and sense of movements within the group give her an interest and a concern for human welfare.<br><br>One thing she isn't, and that is opinionless.  Sagittarius is always thinking about something, chewing it over, learning it, reading about it, discussing it.  Convictions are terribly important to the Sagittarian woman, although her convictions are likely to change regularly.  Sagittarius is a fluid, flexible sign.  You'll also sometimes see the more spiritual or religious side in evidence in the Sagittarian woman - often showing as an interest in religion, myth, psychology, and various assorted esoteric or occult subjects.  There's a love of the unknown and the challenging, the magical and the unexplained.<br><br>There is also a strong sense of fun and humour in the Sagittarian woman.  And the famous blunt Sagittarian tongue is also much in evidence here.  You can't expect an archer to flatter you diplomatically.  More likely she'll deliver a verbal punch between the eyes - not because she's cruel, but because she has a tendency to speak before she thinks, and to not quite realize that you, sensitive soul that you are, have just been irrevocably crushed by the insult.  She's usually right, too; it's pretty difficult to fool Sagittarius' sharp intuition, which has a way of seeing right through postures and hypocrisy.<br><br>You may see a touch of the groupie here.  The Sagittarius woman often needs to be where the action is, where interesting and exciting people are.  Whether it's by her own talents or through somebody else's, she's attracted to anything new and important.  And she needs to be moving all the time, working at things, busy with projects.  What doesn't work is the nine-to-five routine and the office filing cabinet, or the six-to-eight routine of the kids' breakfasts and the shopping and the ironing.  In fact, you might have noticed that many Sagittarian women are terribly inept at dealing with things like tangible organization.  If they do it, they often get good earthy help - those Virgos and Capricorns and Taureans who stand quietly in the background and collect the money and wash up the dishes.  Never mind.  Her gift is at bringing people together, inspiring them, delighting them, teaching them, opening up the world for them.  Not, in fact, cleaning up after them.<br><br>Sagittarius the romantic can have a problematic time in long-term relationships.  Because she loves the new and the exciting, the Sagittarius woman may follow the pattern of her male counterpart, always seeking the knight on the white horse who can take her away from banality and show her a world of fairy-tale romance.  This may be a literal escapade or a fantasy one; but those escapades are common and very likely to occur.  But she does come back again, if let alone.  What you can't do is possess her; she'll fight then, and isn't averse to just walking out.  Sagittarian women are very independent.  You see it even in a Sagittarius child.  You don't tell them to do something.  You ask.  Nicely.<br><br>Sagittarius, like Gemini, needs to be able to communicate.  If you're after the quiet, docile type, forget it.  Sagittarian women are great talkers; and they'll talk about anything they've found exciting and interesting.  They have a knack of making it sound exciting for others, too.  Sometimes they go on too long, and become bores; and there's no bore like your Sagittarian bore once he gets on his favorite passion or enthusiasm of the moment.  But in general, Sagittarius is a conversational animal, and needs a partner who's interested and willing to talk as well.  The silent, taciturn type doesn't do terribly well mated to the archer.<br><br>All the fiery signs need to be in love.  That fine distinction made between loving and the state of in-love-ness is all right for the more rational elements of air and earth.  But without the belief in love, fire wilts.  And the Sagittarius woman is really, in her heart, in love with life itself.  It's to be lived, not caged; and although she'll inevitably take quite a few romantic knocks in the nature of things - not least because her need for personal freedom and independence may drive away a few frightened partners - she never loses her hopes for the future.  This woman is an optimist, a believer in the value and the vitality of life.  Spend any time around her, and you'll begin to believe it too.  Sagittarius faith is infectious.  But unlike most infectious things, it isn't fatal.  Just the opposite. It breeds life.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://&lt;strong&gt;http://songsdomain.tripod.com/zodiac/index.html&lt;/strong&gt;" rel="nofollow"><strong>http://songsdomain.tripod.com/zodiac/index.html</strong></a></div>
