But a few further remarks might be in order. One important thing to mention is that Libra - man or woman - shows his best quality in a relationship which contains plenty of harmony and communication. Because his needs and his gifts all lie in the realm of peace and harmony and interchange, you're barking in the wrong kennel if you're one of those people who like tempestuous, violent scenes with slamming doors and smashed crockery and lots of tears and torn clothes. Although it's certainly possible to drive a Libran to this point, it takes a lot of work, and having accomplished it, you usually find that the Libran, far from enjoying it, loathes every minute of it, loathes himself for reaching that disgracefully bestial level of behavious, and never forgets it. And the next time he's even more diplomatic, and more evasive, and less truthful that before.<br><br>If you want to discuss love problems with Libra, you must discuss them.  You can't emote them.  And make sure you puncture your virulent accusations with a good helping of 'Yes, I know that part is my fault', because otherwise his sense of fairness will insist that he doesn't deserve all the blame.  He'll gladly take fifty per cent, but don't try to heap it all on him, or he'll take the opposite stance and say it's all your fault.  Fair is fair, and Libra believes in equal-sized helpings.<br><br>It can all get too intellectual for some.  Libra is capable of spending hours discussing a relationship - what's wrong with it, what's right with it, how it can be adjusted, how 'we' can make it better.  In the end he shows a surprisingly small capacity to actually act on these realizations:  he may know them and understand them, but it's hard  for him to show them emotionally.  Remember that Libra's feeling nature is quite childlike, often very powerful, and usually repressed.  And when he's being horribly reasonable and discussing it like a political debate with pros and cons and suggestions for bills and amendments, you feel like doing something simple and basic, like clubbing him, or tearing his clothes off.  This sort of behaviour usually has the effect of producing a bland, tolerant look and statement like, 'When you're feeling more reasonable, we'll discuss it, dear.'<br><br>Having a reasonable lover can be a great boon.  It means you can reason with him or her. On the other hand, there are times when reason has no place in love, and this is often Libra's most difficult and painful lesson in the realm of human relationships.  One can sometimes wait a long time for Libra to offer a genuine and spontaneous emotional response which hasn't been reflected over, pro and con, for hours preceding it.  But a little understanding for Libra's need for harmony and peace and a place where things can be happy and romantic and free of rejection and darkness, often makes a lot of difference.  Sometimes Libra can be coaxed gently into trusting his own emotions in an atmosphere of trust.  What he can't do is become somebody else, which means that if you can't accept his innately agreeable and harmony-loving nature, you should try something a little more explosive like an Aries or a Scorpio.<br><br>Libra is capable of putting an enormous amount of time and energy into relationships, which is a rare thing to find; and he or she is usually willing to try adjustment and compromise because it's innate in Libra's nature to see the need for adjustment.  The need for companionship also makes Libra terribly companionable, and if you're the violently independent type who likes to do everything alone, you're liable to have a difficult time with Libra, who likes to do everything together.  Some Librans take this togetherness to such extremes that you begin to wonder if they'll fall apart if expected to eat and sleep alone occasionally.  Some Librans in fact fall apart that way.  But in general, it's a mistake to think this is a weak sign; it's a people-loving sign, and even the quieter, more introverted Libran needs a mate and companion to share his dreams and ideals with.<br><br>Librans know a lot about relationships, and the partner is the beneficiary of all of it.  It's quite a big bonus, especially if you've had experiences of the opposite kind.  But at the beginning and in the end, Libra is an airy sign, not a watery one; and you may have to teach your Libran partner that discussing love is not the same thing as showing it, or feeling it.  Never mind.  For the romantics of the world, that's a pleasure too.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Libra Man </strong><br><br>One of the most noticeable things about the Libran man is that he possesses a good deal of taste and also a good deal of vanity.  He typical Libran isn't one of your rough-and-ready macho types who changes his shirt every three weeks and occasionally checks the mirror to see if he's cut himself shaving.  Libran men are usually concerned about how they look, which can produce either a really well-dressed and attractive man who looks and smells good and likes quality and luxury in everything, or a preening peacock.  Probably you'll see shades of both.  But it's understandable, since beauty is always important to Libra - beauty of ideas if not beauty in form.<br><br>He's also terribly responsive to beauty around him, and as with everything else this carries a plus and a minus.  The place he lives in will generally be tasteful and pleasant and often luxurious; and this isn't the man who lives in a pig's heap and then expects you to clean it when you arrive.  If you live with a Libran, he'll often wish to be involved in decorating a flat or house:  if you don't, he won't usually abide in traditional bachelor digs, but will often have a downright imposing array of comforts around him.  He's also someone who appreciates other people's care over their appearance; and Libran men aren't embarrassed or stiff about offering compliments.  The nicest side of all this is that you can feel really appreciated, and not just in the first two weeks of the relationship.<br><br>The darker side of all this love of beauty is that the Libra man is often incapable of getting past his hangup about physical perfection.  He's often the 'sucker for the pretty face' who can only court beautiful women, and who is frequently fooled and badly hurt because he thought that what looked Good, True and Beautiful actually was.  It takes a long time, sometimes a lifetime, for Libra to recognize that the surface is not necessarily a good index of character.  Also, his ideas of beauty are frequently called from popular collective attitudes, since he pays a good deal of attention to other people's opinions.  If all the guys at the office think she's beautiful, so will he.  He frequently suffers a lot from having to define his own individual taste.<br><br>This problem of loving beauty and being unable to recognize it in other than collective and conventional forms sometimes shows in odd ways.  Like a great difficulty in accepting, or finding attractive, the ordinary manifestations of the human body - lumps and bumps and moles and hair and body smells and period pains and other things that make us human and humanly lovable.  The Libran man's image of women is often something that stepped straight out of the pages of Vogue magazine, polished, plucked, and perfect.  Nobody, of course, looks like that except in photographs.  The most beautiful women in the world still perspire and get dark circles under their eyes.  The Libran man loves women who take pride in their femininity and do everything they can to enhance it.  He doesn't usually appreciate the 'natural' look.  As a cynic once said of nudist camps, 'People actually look better with their clothes on'.  This is often the Libran man's viewpoint.  If you're the kind of woman who enjoys clothes and cosmetics, this man won't laugh at them, or demand that you look like a fresh-scrubbed and wholesome country milkmaid.  He likes style.<br><br>Ah, yes the famous extravagance.  He likes style so much that he's sometimes prepared to bankrupt himself for it.  Libra has a reputation for extravagance, and he earns it.  It's not for the same motives as Leo, the other big spender of the zodiac, or as Sagittarius.  Leo likes to impress; his idea is to have the most different, the most unique, the most impressive thing.  Sagittarius just enjoys spending, because he can't be bothered with ordinary mundane things like budgeting.  Libra spends for beauty.  He'll spend money on beauty faster than he will on necessities; it isn't uncommon to find the Libra man who's blown the entire savings on a beautiful car and can't afford meals for the rest of the week.  On the other hand, he'll spend on his friends too, and on his lovers.  And Libra is usually generous.  A sucker he's not; but if you take advantage of him (remember, fair is fair) he's usually open-handed with money, and never begrudges money spent on pleasure or luxury or beauty or entertainment.<br><br>You might find one of those Libra men where the shadow has taken over.  They're a disaster for anyone, because the constant playing hard to get can corrode even the most confident woman.  This kind of Libran is an incurable Don Juan, so if it's fidelity you're looking for, forget it.  You're more likely to be regaled with stories of how many women pursued him that afternoon, than you are of how desirable you are to him.  But the more balanced Libran is usually quite prepared to have a relationship, as opposed to a fling, because he likes companionship and wants more than a good roll in the hay.  He has a mind, after all, and often a brilliant one, and he needs friendship and intellectual companionship too. Librans are often marriage-minded, and many Libran men marry very young.  They also frequently marry more than once, since the first one isn't perfect.  And if your life path is about learning to relate, then often more than one relationship is needed to learn.  The frequency of broken marriages among Librans shouldn't be looked upon as failure.  If you're seeking the depths of a particular experience in life, you need to try a lot of things to find out about it.<br><br>The Libran man is also a real romantic.  He understands things like flowers, soft music, quieter evenings in intimate restaurants, elegant parties.  He needs them too much himself not to recognize a woman's needs for them as well.  And what he can't bear is an unromantic partner, a partner who has no time for his longings for the fantasy life.  However long you're with a Libran, he still adheres to the tenets of courtly love.  Never take him for granted.  He usually won't take you for granted either, unless you've crushed his love for romance by being too flat-footed and prosaic and trampling on his dreams.  Then he'll seek his romance elsewhere, and show the chillier side of him, the one that keeps the marriage together because it's convenient.<br><br>Definitely not an easy man to get along with if you're very basic by nature.  And he has a tendency, too, to retreat into his head to such a degree that you don't know what he's talking about.  He can get pretty abstract, or just wander off into some inner theoretical landscape that leaves you feeling very cut off and alone.  But all the airy signs do this, and they do it in excess when they've been threatened emotionally.  It's hard for them to remain in the world in the midst of other people's physical and emotional problems and desires for very long.  Libra needs to escape sometimes to his ivory tower, in whatever form it takes.  And anyone involved with a Libra must allow it, because it's part of his nature.  Provided, of course, that it's in balance.  And if it isn't you can't drag him down from it.  You can only coax him, be reasonable, and trust that eventually his need of relationship will always bring him from whatever airy heights he's climbed back into the world of human interchange.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Libra Woman</strong><br><br>With the curious magic of polarities that occurs in this sign, the Libra woman, although she shares in common with the Libran man the love of beauty and style and elegance, often has a mind like a steel trap.   This lady is not the vague, fluffy bundle of fur and giggles that will stare open-mouthed at your mental acrobatics.  She's probably either got a string of academic degrees or might as well have, and has worked through whatever it is you've taken two hours at in about ten minutes.<br><br>Libran women can be quite unnerving.  They often show the enormous paradox of the sign in the contradiction between their appearance and their real nature.  Sometimes you meet a Libra woman who has gone off to the opposite pole, and is the opposite of physically attentive; these are often the women you meet in the masculine (so-called) professions who prefer to find their beauty and elegance in the world of ideas.  But even here you can see the style and the diplomacy at work.  And the Libra woman is usually very aware of her appearance.  But her appearance often belies the capacities and capabilities of her intellect.  She is, however, generally too tactful and diplomatic to allow this to be immediately known.  In fact you may not find it out for years.<br><br>There's often a strong intellectual drive in the Libran woman, whether this shows itself as love of knowledge in a theoretical way or as love of organizing.  Libran women need strong careers to allow them expression of their gifts.  And there is often a real ability to work with groups, to get people together in cooperative action.  Sometimes there is real political ability, and a concern for human welfare.  The masculine pole of life expresses itself through the Libran woman as an ability to work with structures, forms, organizations, concepts.  It can be very disconcerting to many men, since this is usually the woman who will happily spend the day being pampered at the beauty salon, and will very agreeably spend a fortune on clothes.  But no Libran male or female, is simple.<br><br>The tendency to repress emotion exists in the Libran woman as well as in the Libran man.  It's more difficult, in many ways, since society expects women to be emotional.  The detached and often intellectual approach which many Libran women show toward others is acceptable when evidenced by their masculine counterparts, yet often reproached in the Libran woman.  The true Libran is not a creature of feeling; and whatever the biological or sociological differences between the sexes, it's generally easier for the Libran woman to reason things out than to react out of instinct.  This is both a great boon and a great problem.  A boon in the sense of potential for achievement; a problem because the domestic sphere, dealing with children and dealing with relationships, the Libran woman may be uncomfortable and find it difficult either to spontaneously show emotion or to respond to emotional outbursts or demonstrations of need from others.<br><br>The key here, once again, is romance.  Libra's tightly corseted emotions can usually be reached through the ritual courtship of romance; if feeling is passed through this tinted lens which raises it up onto a different level, then Libra feels safe and can allow some feeling to be expressed.  And the Libran woman is definitely a romantic, even if you find her displaying those frighteningly rational tendencies and claiming to be a logical, reasonable person.  One rose goes a long way, one compliment goes an even longer way.<br><br>There seem to be two kinds of Libran women, in fact:  those who are unashamedly the bundle of contradictions that the sign contains, and those who overcompensate for the intense need for relationship by retreating into the intellect.  The latter is usually a frightened Libran who finds too painful to deal with her emotional needs.  Love and acceptance do wonders for Libra, and even the painfully tight Libran with emotions tucked firmly away in a safety-deposit box will eventually display the gentle and affectionate side of the Libran nature.<br><br>The trouble is that a good intellect, which is common with Libran men and women both, can be frightening when it appears in someone who looks as though she should be swathed in furs over scented candlelight; and it seems that if you want to relate to a Libran woman, you've got to accept both the man and woman in her.  For she possesses both, and the Libran woman who's found her own balance is comfortable in both worlds - that of the mind, and that of her own femininity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FBI:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: green;">Where's Gemini!? </span></div></blockquote>Wah you're Gemini... so I see...<br><br><strong>Gemini<br>Â… things shouldn't be brutally honest<br>or stark or without style.</strong><br><br>It's said that Gemini is one of the easiest signs to recognize.  In the first place, Geminis usually talk a lot, so you have a chance to observe quickly that urbane, witty, cosmopolitan charm in any social situation.  (Remember Marilyn Monroe, a famous Gemini.)  Gemini is also recognizable because he's often not where you last left him; and it's common astrological knowledge that you can't tie the Twins down with a heavy cord and expect this sylph of the air to remain with docility and patience until you give the cord a tug.  More likely he'll perform a Houdini-like trick and vanish before your very eyes, leaving you with the cord.<br><br>Unpredictable is another word which generally applies to the typical Geminian; changeable as quicksilver, loving disguise and mimicry, fascinated for a little while with just about everything, quick to become bored and move on.  Interested in many subjects, proficient in few, for the world is too large and there is too much to know and too much to talk about to waste time plunging into depths and missing all those other opportunities.<br><br>To a greater or lesser extent, Gemini is the butterfly of the zodiac (some butterflies are smaller and nimbler than others, but they all fly), gracing your vision for a brief moment while settling on some choice flower, and then moving on.  Of course there are Geminis who have become skilled at some particular study or art or profession - but even these Geminis must somehow find variety and versatility within it.  You'll never find a Geminian actor, for example, always playing the same type of role.<br><br>Gemini has been accused on the negative side, of being superficial and shallow.  But this is neither true nor fair.  The Geminian mind is perfectly capable of depth and concentration, when necessary.  The sphere of ideas is his natural hunting ground.  It's just that Gemini's mind works in a curiously non-linear way.  He knows that if you spend too long with one thing, you're likely to miss all its associations and connections.  And Gemini's aim is not to acquire specialized in-depth knowledge of any one thing.  He's after a broad and comprehensive spectrum of knowledge, which can only be culled by stopping at every port.  He appreciates satire, and the sentence which in shorthand somehow communicates the whole picture without the necessity of delving into great detail.  And he also appreciates what's interesting in the moment.  His concentration isn't foggy, like that of many Pisceans; nor is he absent-minded.  It's just that he's liable to be distracted easily.  Too many things catch his attention.  And why not?  Life, to Gemini, is full of moving things; and where they move, he moves with them.<br><br>Sometimes Gemini's sly mimicry can be cutting and embarrassing, just because which offers the whole situation at a single glance.  He usually doesn't mean to be cruel; but dwelling in the heights as he does, he isn't often aware of the emotional reactions going on around him.  He isn't terribly vulnerable himself, and has the precious gift of self-laughter as well.  You can mimic him if you like.  What he can't understand is the poor soul who bursts into noisy tears because of his little joke.  What did he do?  Never mind, it's obviously time to move on.<br><br>Gemini excels in the media, particularly at journalism, the kind of writing or reporting which communicates the entire picture in a few clever images.  And the urge to communicate is powerful in this sign as is the urge to learn.  There is something eternally childlike about Gemini's mind.  If you take the cycle of the zodiac as a symbol of the different stages of man's development, Gemini, being the third sign, represents the stage where the thinking processes begin.  Watch a child when he's interested in something.  His interest may be short-lived; but as soon as he discovers something, he must tell everybody about it.  It's as natural to him as breathing.  Gemini's often monopolize conversations for hours, not because they want to draw special attention to themselves as many Leos do, but because if they know something interesting then it's the most natural thing in the world to tell it to everyone else too.<br><br>And Gemini is also the great democrat of the zodiac.  You couldn't really expect him to be otherwise, he treasures his own capacity to think and certainly isn't prepared to give over the right of decision-making and concept-forming to anybody else.  Tell him what to think about something and you'll see his back receding in the distance very quickly.  The immense pleasure that Gemini takes in discovering something for himself, finding something out, learning something, is so obvious and so bright that you could scarcely imagine him following someone else's opinions with any docility.  And because he likes to be well-informed, it's hard to fool him or swing him emotionally.  He's interested in people, from a distance, and loves to find out how they tick; and he will talk to just about anybody to find out a little something about something because to him everything is interesting.  You'll rarely find conservatism or prejudice in Gemini's lively, stimulating mind.<br><br>He plays a price for these shining gifts, of course.  No one can be everything, and we're all pretty lopsided to start with.  In order to preserve that smooth, polished world-view that comes from skimming over the surface of an amazing variety of life's experiences, Gemini must often sacrifice his capacity for deeper relating.  The more he spreads himself among the flowers, sampling here and there, the less likely he is to be able to sustain a close relationship.<br><br>Gemini isn't really the person to choose if you like long intense discussions about emotions.  It makes him feel trapped, crushed, and possessed.  He'll usually make a joke or a witty quip about the things he feels most intensely about.  And he'd prefer that you quip too, rather than pour out your deepest soul in grand, theatrical gestures.  It makes him turn pale with embarrassment.  Then he's liable to do this vanishing act, and you're left to clean out the mess.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With all that knowledge clattering about inside his skull, you'd expect Gemini to also have knowledge about himself.  Not so.  He is the least introspective sign of the zodiac, and it takes some pretty critical or difficult experience to get him to actually sit down and sort out his own motives.  It's not his style.  Like a child, he's capable of plunging into some pretty sour emotional states or moods, which don't last very long (no mood does with Gemini) and which he rarely analyses or understands.  His demand for personal freedom is so strong that he'll often recoil with resentment if you try to get him to change or alter his natural changeability.  And he's fully capable of practising big and little deceptions, both on others and on himself, when he feels too pinned down.<br><br>You'll notice that references to childlike qualities have been mentioned several times.  In a nutshell, Gemini is the eternal child of the zodiac.  This doesn't mean he's childish, in the sense that we use the word to describe people whose behaviour has embarrassed us in some way.  It means childlike, which is not the same thing.  His lively interest in learning, his tendency to go off in several directions at once (I know several Geminis who watch television and read books simultaneously, or carry on phone conversations and write letters, or any other sleight of hand you can think of), and his dislike of having to carry responsibilities which he can't understand are all qualities which give him a lot in common with children.  In fact, many Geminis get on brilliantly with children - not from the emotional, motherly point of view like Cancer does, but because they love things that amuse them and are downright brilliant at keeping the wandering interest of a child's mind because their own minds wander in the same way.<br><br>No, Gemini doesn't care for responsibility very much.  He's usually got a strong ethical code - all airy signs do - and he'll deal with people fairly.  In that sense, he's one of the most responsible of the signs, because he's an idealist as far as how he sees people and their interrelationships.  But duty for duty's sake doesn't interest him; he likes to travel light.  He's generally happier with a few back doors open, in case he decides he needs a little journey to refresh him.  Tie him down to one place and one job doing one thing for any length of time and he'll either go to pieces in a mass of nervous fidgeting, smoking, nail-biting and paper-shredding, or he'll leave.  Gemini needs mental and physical mobility.  Put him where he can talk to people, travel a little, and he's fine, and perfectly capable of discharging responsibility.  Put him with a partner who talks a lot about duty, and you're guaranteed a failed relationship.<br><br>Words are fascinating things for Gemini.  Whether he's the more verbal type of Gemini who talks a blue streak or the quieter type (yes, there are some) whose minds may be spinning with all kinds of things but who are too introverted to tell you about them, language is usually a wonderful and eternally stimulating game to him.  I have met many Geminis who are incurable pun-makers - a form of humour which seems to be peculiar to only a couple of signs, Pisces being the other - because they love to play with language.  Self-expression through language is extremely important, and Gemini also often loves to hear himself talk - not because he thinks he's so wonderful, but because he's fascinated with what words can do.<br><br>Often he'll learn other languages quickly, and word-plays amuse him where clumsier forms of humour leave him cold.  And language means a lot to him, too.  Language is the expression of a whole people, and tells you about the psychological traits of the country where it's spoken.  Marlene Dietrich is said to have once made an amusing observation on language.  In French, she said, the male genital organs are feminine gender; and in English, both are neuter.  That's the sort of thing that Geminis notice.  Why?  Well, because it's interesting.  And it makes you think.<br><br>Life isn't a terribly serious business for Gemini.  For this reason many Geminis drift, uncertain as to where their skills or vocations lie, because so much is interesting and they often show little talent at a lot of things.  Even if Gemini has one definite talent, he'll generally be pretty restless and dissatisfied dedicating himself to it, because, well, only one thing to do is pretty boring.  In some ways it's good general advice to Gemini to always have either two jobs, or a job and an important hobby, because that way when one gets boring the other seems fresh and interesting.  We aren't taught to look at careers like this; we're supposed, in this world, to do one thing and do it well.  Often the Gemini is sadly short-changed by this policy, because his real gift isn't at doing one thing well, but at finding the links between two completely disparate things.  He's really a bridge-builder in ideas.  And he's happiest when he can translate one sphere of life into the language of another.<br><br>You can generally spot Gemini by his eyes.  Not that they're peculiar or anything.  It's just that they're generally moving, even when he's talking to you and deeply interested in what you're saying.  But he simply can't help noticing someone new who has walked into the room, or some new object which has appeared on the table or the wall.  This is pretty disconcerting to many people who like to feel that all his attention is focused on them.<br><br>If you're the sort of person who needs this kind of concentrated attention, avoid Gemini.  He's simply not capable of shutting out the stimuli around him.  It doesn't mean he's not interested.  It does mean he's not that involved.  Deep involvement or commitment is difficult for him.  It's not that he needs a lot of rope.  It means he needs no rope at all.  Then, if you're not paying too close attention, you might discover to your surprise and pleasure that he's still there.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Gemini Lover</strong><br><br>In traditional astrology, Gemini is said to get on best with he other two airy signs, Libra and Aquarius.  This sounds great on paper.  But no person is just one sign, and also like doesn't always attract like.  Sometimes they bore each other.  And while Gemini has a lot in common with the other air signs, and many communicate with them in the realm of ideas, he has an irresistible attraction to the water signs - Pisces, Scorpio and Cancer.  This is because Gemini usually has a pretty hard time both knowing what he feels subjectively about things and expressing those feelings to anyone else.  When he gets around those watery types, he loosens up.  He's often fascinated by their disinterest in rational explanations, and charmed (or alternatively, terrified) by their lack of embarrassment about their own emotions.  Now, we've mentioned a little about air-water relationships.  They often produce steam.  Fog, mist, sleet.  And other manifestations of two queerly incompatible yet magnetically attracted elements.<br><br>A Geminian friend of mine once referred to discussions about emotional affairs as 'swamp trips'.  This pinpoints very nicely Gemini's characteristic attitude toward relationships when they try to begin to get a little heavy.  Like a swamp:  damp, suffocating, dangerous, dark, full of things that bite and pull you down into the mire.  The typical Gemini is often positively terrified of emotional demands.  Yet he has a propensity over and over again, of landing himself in relationships with people who are basically feeling-oriented people.  And these watery folks are often full of admiration and fascination for Gemini's versatile mind, yet need a more instinctual kind of rapport for heir own fulfillment.<br><br>It's almost as though Gemini, the eternal butterfly, trying to solve the mystery of the multiple people he feels himself to be, longs for a safe and emotionally secure relationship to help him feel a little less fragmented.  If he can find someone who loves all those different faces in him, then maybe, he hopes, he'll learn to love them himself.  Gemini's relationships, when they're of this kind, can go one of two ways.<br><br>The left-hand fork ends with the partner feeling emotionally frustrated, starved for affection and closeness, rejected and shut out.  Gemini, in his turn, feels oppressed, suffocated, bored, and caged.  It's a sad scenario, this one, and fraught with heavy blame on both sides - although you won't often hear Gemini complaining loudly about his emotional vicissitudes.  He'll more often make a joke of the whole thing, or an ironic and witty remark, and keep the entire thing quietly buried along with other disturbing encounters which he doesn't dare probe to understand.  And he'll probably come away from it with a little less confidence in his own reliability - which is never very great anyway - and will then move on into the next relationship, without quite realizing what went wrong.<br><br>The right-hand fork of this road is a lot happier.  Given time and communication (any relationship for Gemini must have communication) and understanding, Gemini can often ground himself a little better through a relationship, and learn to look inward a little more.  He can begin to discover his own needs and sensitivities, which he often overlooks, and this discovery (that he has feelings too - helps his habitual condemnation of other people's needs as devouring and possessive.  All too often, he attracts highly maternal types who smother him with solicitous care and gently condescending motherly love.  No wonder Gemini all to often remains a little boy - or a little girl - with a dark secret face.<br><br>In common with the other two airy signs, Gemini usually has a high code of ethics in his relationships.  Although he's often evasive, and dislikes being probed for secrets, he'll usually not deliberately lie or lose his integrity in dealing with others.  The element of air has its code of principles, and its principles are high.  Many Geminians try with almost super human effort to live up to their ethical codes, and fail, because the ethical code doesn't allow anybody to react, in an inconsistent way, and then crumple beneath the anger of an emotionally hurt partner.<br><br>Gemini takes the path of deviousness when there isn't any other way to go.  But usually there isn't any other way because he simply can't understand emotional language.  How can you explain yourself in the face of an accusation you simply don't understand?  If you make a demand of Gemini - like, 'You've been ignoring me all evening,' he is likely to offer an evasive answer on principle, because he's aware of so many possible answers and so unaware of his real feelings.  Usually he won't even know what you're talking about.  It seems perfectly all right to him.<br><br>One of the most difficult combinations of signs is Gemini and Scorpio, whether you find this within one person's chart - one of the sun, the other the ascendant - or between two charts.  They personify the opposite poles of air and water beautifully.  Scorpio is a water sign, and therefore highly subjective, with feeling-based responses.  And the typical Scorpios will rarely put up with evasiveness, since his nature compels him to dig to the bottom of any issue to discover its hidden roots and motives.  Gemini can't bear to be psychoanalyzed, largely because he's terrified of what he'll find underneath.  Many Geminians are scornful of the whole realm of psychological exploration, because they have the gift of analyzing things and figure that once you've named a problem it'll go away quietly.  Of course it doesn't since intellectual analysis isn't any help with feelings.  Gemini will often be flippant when accused of some dark and convoluted motive.  Or he'll make something up.  Or he'll go cold, and simply not answer, or walk out.  The truth is that he doesn't know, and what he doesn't know frightens him.  Have compassion.  Gemini often seeks help from intellectual maps and systems and structures in his attempts to find out what he really feels about things.<br><br>There are Geminis, both male and female, who always remain children, in both the best and the worst sense of the word.  They are the eternal butterflies, gilded and charming, delightful and about as substantial as zabaglione.  If you get involve with this more extreme type of Gemini who's never come to terms with the other twin, enjoy yourself, but keep your eyes open.  Gemini needs lots and lots of rope.  He may or may not hang himself with it.  But commitment is terrifying to this type of Gemini, and he's usually not prepared to look beneath the sparkling and effervescent surface of his own mind, full of cross-currents and ripples and mirages, to see what either his needs or yours really are.  It's just too much trouble.  If you're a strongly maternal type, like Taurus or Cancer, or the gentle sensitive type like Pisces, or the intense and jealous type like Scorpio, make very sure that you've got a life of your own, so that you don't expect Gemini to carry all your emotional needs for you.  He simply can't.  And maybe you'll learn something from him or her:  like how to let go and allow Gemini the air he needs so badly.  Geminis become positively psychologically asthmatic when they can't escape.<br><br>And if you're lucky enough to find one of those Geminis who has a little self-understanding, then you're lucky indeed.  For although Gemini will always be elusive and challenging, and will never take kindly to having to explain motives and reason, and will rarely learn to enjoy dramatic emotional scenes, he'll meet you halfway.  Then he's truly the Mercurius of alchemy, the translator and transformer, for he can show with the magic wand of his wit the distant mountain heights where the air is clear.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>The Gemini Man<br></strong><br><br>Several qualities are noticeable about the Gemini man.  For one thing, he's usually in constant motion.  Sometimes physically:  he's liable to fidget, and even if he isn't fidgeting his eyes are generally moving around pretty restlessly, checking out each thing in the room and inspecting each person with immense curiosity.  The hour-long gaze of intense passionate silence that says everything just isn't the Gemini man's style.  Many Geminis simply can't hold their attention for that long, and besides, they don't like to be 'sprung' by somebody staring into their eyes either.<br><br>Another thing that's readily noticeable is Gemini's conversational gift.  It's a rare Gemini who doesn't possess a quick wit and cursory knowledge of just about anything, which enables him to talk to just about anybody for a little while and appear to be interested.  Gemini is also a bit of a gossip - yes, the trait appears in the Gemini man as well as in the Gemini woman - and a less pleasant adjective would be 'nosy' to describe the intense curiosity with which Gemini approaches other people.  He loves to find out interesting things, not because he's looking for power over you like a Scorpio would, but because it just happens to be interesting.  He's gifted at drawing out several pertinent and interesting facts about you very quickly, and then, when you ask a few questions of him, dodging them with skill while he deftly shifts the subject onto the strange mating habits of greenfly.<br><br>Gemini's contact with people is always a light one.  He's neither heavy-handed nor intense.  It's rare to get an outpouring of intense emotion; and if you do, it will most likely come in the form of a letter, and be full of amusing anecdotes and gossip.  Some people find this lightness of touch disturbing:  it seems shallow and superficial.  But it isn't, really.  In fact it's a gift that Gemini offers - the ability to communicate and share feelings while keeping a sense of humour and a perspective.  Gemini might be romantic, but it's not the romance of heavy operatic tragedy.  It's the sort of light, frothy stuff that makes for lovely summer evenings drinking champagne in the rose garden; but it's not Romeo and Juliet.  On the other hand, Romeo and Juliet had tragic ends, which isn't really a vision of romance that appeals to Gemini.<br><br>Absolute devotion of the kind that precludes ever speaking to or looking at another woman also isn't Gemini's style.  He's interested in people and people are interested in him; besides, he can be a charming flirt, which is just one more part of the way in which he approaches life.  The butterfly flirts with life itself; you can't expect him to play Othello to your Desdemona.  He'll rarely show jealousy (that's all in the unconscious, along with all the other terrifying emotions) and doesn't expect you too either.<br><br>And it's impossible to keep him by your side at a party, because the whole point of a party is to talk to people.  People mean others besides yourself.  It's also embarrassing to Gemini to seem to be too attached to one person; it spoils the image of the cloak-and-dagger mysterious secret agent which he sometimes gets a kick out of projecting.  Many Geminis do their best to seem single even when they've come in the door with you, just because it's amusing to try the role on.  It's a rare Gemini who obviously displays himself as half a tight couple.  Once again, it's not his style.<br><br>Words fascinate Gemini.  Emotions don't, unless they can be expressed in words.  The more articulate you are, the better he likes it.  And he does have a thing about writing - love notes, stories, letters, jokes, whatever.  Gemini-type heroes in film and literature (like Errol Flynn) don't get their charm from heavy-handed emotional intensity or physical prowess.  They get it from cosmopolitan panache, a touch of culture, a taste for good wine, a love of ballet or theatre, an eye for a good book, a polished and versatile mind.  If you want to be physically swept off your feet and strong-armed to the altar, avoid Gemini.<br><br>Most of all, the Gemini man is interesting, and likes to be with other people who are interesting.  That means his partner must be interested and interesting:  otherwise he has a very low boredom level, and has been known to seek his interests elsewhere with frequency.  This doesn't mean one must be a brilliant intellectual to make a good match with Gemini.  But it means that the mind has to be alive.  Talk to him all day about what the baby ate and you're asking for trouble.  Obviously no one can become what they aren't.  But if your idea of partnership is to sit silently in front of the fire holding hands and sipping eggnogs, try a Taurus or a Cancer.<br><br>You notice the signs immediately when Gemini's hit his boredom level.  He fidgets.  His eyes wander around a lot.  He looks longingly at the telephone - an instrument of communication which many Geminis love, because it allows them to chatter without the discomfort of emotional confrontation - and waits with positively frightening eagerness for the post to be delivered.  When you see those signs, either sharpen up your own wit, or take him out to the theatre.  The butterfly is preparing to take off.<br><br>The most glorious thing about the Gemini man, the thing which makes his peculiar moods and delicate evasiveness bearable, is the fact that he's really interesting.  Now, to some people that might not sound like much, but to those who have had a fairly satiating dose of boring and dull people living boring and dull lives, where imagination never takes wing and humour never sparkles and everything is horribly serious and responsible and one never, never behaves in a zany or unpredictable or childish fashion, Gemini is like the draught of the elixir.  He reminds you that life is new, and fun, and something fascinating to be explored.  And having spent some time around the butterfly, you might even discover you've got wings.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Gemini Woman</strong><br><br>If you think all women should be sweet, emotional creatures without a great deal of intelligence, whose true role in life is to bear children and devote themselves to their mates, you shouldn't be reading this book in the first place.  And you particularly shouldn't be reading about the airy signs, since women born under this element are even less likely than anybody else to want to fulfill that lovely traditional image.  Air sign women think; and the Gemini woman, in common with her Aquarian and Libran cousins, can generally out-think most anybody you know.  Her thinking might not always be either scientific or consistent, but she's a person of ideas, who needs mental stimulation and interesting people in her life.  It's not that the Gemini woman is incapable of being loving, or maternal, or domestic.  It's just that these things aren't usually at the top of the list of priorities.  Gemini, whether male or female, must have air to breathe and space to explore.<br><br>There's often a quality of sophistication about the Gemini woman.  Whether you see her in a small country village tending her home and children, or at an art gallery opening in New York City, she'll usually be the one who's read everything she can get her hands on about just about every subject you can think of.  She may know something about Iranian politics, and Persian mythology, and knitting patterns, and rare butterflies, and the breeding of horses.  One thing she's not:  provincial.  She needs company and stimulation, and you can't expect her to be happy with a life of strict routine.  And she needs to be appreciated not only as a woman, but also as an interesting person.<br><br>Many Gemini women become neurotic and terribly unhappy because they try to adapt themselves to somebody else's - society, family, husband - image of how they should behave, and underrate their own versatility and restlessness.<br><br>Yes, restlessness.  The Gemini woman, like the Gemini man, often needs two jobs, or a series of hobbies, or a regular class or group discussion, to keep her happy.  Her desire to learn is one of her strongest motivations, and needs to be developed and encouraged - whether this means attending university, or attending evening courses in one or two subjects which interests her, or just going down to the local library a lot.  In career terms, the Gemini woman often makes an excellent solicitor, advertising or marketing executive, translator, teacher, journalist, or photographer - and the whole world of the media, films, radio, television suit her admirably.  She also needs contact with more than one person.  The Gemini woman, limited to just a husband and children to talk to, will often vent her frustrations by becoming an intolerable gossip, because she simply must communicate.<br><br>Problems with emotional expression are characteristic with the Gemini woman as they are with the Gemini man.  The natural Geminian tendency to hold in emotion, to negate it, to analyse it away, often means that the Gemini woman lives a kind of near-hysterical extroverted life running and running away from feelings of loneliness or unhappiness.  A good case in point is Marilyn Monroe, who perhaps might have been spared the tragic conclusion to her life if she had been more emotionally honest with herself.  Her attraction lay as much in her sparkle as it did in her looks, for Gemini radiates a kind of fascination whether he or she is conventionally attractive or not.<br><br>You often see Gemini women who are terribly highly-strung and nervous.  It's a characteristic Geminian response to repressed emotion.  It's got to do with that other twin, the one we talked about earlier.  For the Gemini woman, the polarity in her nature often consists of her feminine self and her intellect, which are frequently at odds with each other.  She'll have in equal proportions the same needs and drives which motivate any woman, and the Geminian intellectual drive as well.  And they don't always get on too well together, these two faces, because if you pursue the mind with all its butterfly weavings and turnings, you can't afford to commit yourself either to love or to maternity.  It's a hard tangle for the Gemini woman to sort out.<br><br>She's often more at home in conversations with men than with her own sex:  and unless her children are interesting themselves, and able to keep her mind fascinated, she often finds the nonverbal side of communication with children difficult.  Many Gemini women have great academic expectations from their children, especially if they have not developed themselves along this line; and it's probably a more sensible exercise for the Geminian woman to satisfy her own love of learning and travel and excitement first before she attempts to raise a family.  Otherwise the low boredom level, and the dislike of routine, can become pretty difficult.<br><br>No astrological sign is deficient in any basic human need or expression.  It's just that each sign suggests a bias, a propensity to learn one way more than another.  With Gemini, ruled by Mercury, the need for knowledge and experience and stimulation is often greater than the need for security.  It's a question of trying to allow room in one's life for all one's needs to be fulfilled.  This is why Gemini, as a sign for a woman, requires plenty of room for personal freedom, development of ideas, and contact socially beyond the family circle.  Air signs, as we've said several times already, need air.<br><br>The quality of delicate romanticism exists in the Gemini woman as well as the Gemini man.  It isn't a heavy or strongly emotional romanticism; it's light, cultured, and airy.  Gemini needs to be frivolous, and love for Gemini must contain some humour and some frivolity as well as more intense emotion.  Also, it needs to be talked about.  The Gemini woman loves words as much as the Gemini man, which means that the tacit assumption that your presence bespeaks your love doesn't accomplish any miracles.  The Gemini woman appreciates a man who can be articulate, especially about his feelings.  And Gemini also likes a few games; things shouldn't be brutally honest or stark or without style.<br><br>Sometimes you see a strong aesthetic sensitivity in the Gemini woman.  Taste is important to her.  She's often fashion-conscious and trend-conscious.  She's rarely the old-fashioned type for whom the sentimental memories of Victoriana suffice.  More often she'll be intensely modern in her tastes, from clothes to cars to the films she enjoys and the books she reads.  Nostalgia is a Cancerian trait, not a Geminian one.<br><br>The Gemini woman can be a fascinating creature.  She can also be an elusive one, and a thoroughly confusing one if you attempt to type her.  She's particularly confusing if you expect her moods to be consistent and her interests focused.  But once again, remember the butterfly.  Butterflies aren't provided by nature for utilitarian reasons such as our food supply or the wood from which we would build houses.<br><br>Whatever nature had in mind, we enjoy butterflies for their beauty, for their grace, for their freedom, for their brightness.  To stretch the analogy to unbearable lengths, we do derive one useful commodity from the efforts of this kingdom of nature:  silk, the most delicate and luxurious and exotic of fabrics.  Gemini is often like silk:  you can't expect to repair your car in silk, or subject it to the brutalities of a washing machine, but treated delicately and appreciated for its beauty, it's the most cherished material in the world.<br></div>

And most of the time they're the only ones bothered enough to speculate, dissect and believe what's written. Same reason pornography has tonnes of images and romance novels describe the same things in lucid details. It's the estrogen.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
