            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Capricorn<br><br>If you're not a socialist by the age of twenty,<br>you have no heart,<br>but if you're not a conservative by the age of forty,<br>you have no brain.</strong><br><br>The Capricorn goat is no ordinary billy-goat munching grass in the pasture.  Look closely at the symbol for this most mysterious of the earthly signs, and you will see that he has a tail, a kind of cross between a fish and a serpent.  The goat who climbs the awesome mountain of worldly success and material achievement also has another entirely different and usually hidden side to his nature.  People who think that Capricorn can be summed up by mundane ambition are sadly mistaken.<br><br>If we look at ancient symbolism, we find that the serpent is one of the oldest representations for instinctual wisdom and the secrets of the earth itself.  And the fish is also a creature that swims in the depths of the unknown waters of the psyche.  Our mountain goat - hard-working, plodding, cautious, materialistic, shrewd, ambitious - is also, in his secret heart, a kind of magician, a seeker after mysteries.  To manipulate and organize the stuff of the world is no mean feat, and takes more than just patience.  Whichever realm Capricorn achieves in - the inner or the outer - he applies the same principles to it, and those principles can be summed up in one word:  mastery.<br><br>It isn't easy to get to know a Capricorn.  For one thing, he's usually learned by the tender age of about three that you let the other guy show his cards first, and that sometimes it's necessary to keep an ace or two up your sleeve.  There is a curious thing about Capricorn children; sometimes you can look into their eyes and be startled by the little old man peeping out from the childish face.  Many Capricorns follow the classical goat's pattern of having to carry responsibility or hardship very early in life.<br><br>The goat doesn't take kindly to having his secrets probed too quickly.  He must first know exactly where he stands, and exactly who you are, and exactly what you want, before he is willing to show his hand.  Suspicious?  Yes, you might say that.  Suspicion is a natural propensity with Capricorn; sometimes it goes the wrong way and becomes profound mistrust of life and people, but the better face of it is caution and realism.  Capricorns learn from childhood on - and childhood for them is often no childhood at all, but a too-early initiation into the hard facts of life - that one should always check one's capital and assess one's possible losses before entering any deal.  And anything to Capricorn is a kind of a deal, even when his motives are the noblest and most altruistic ones.  Remember that the keynote of all the earth signs is realism.<br><br>This is, in a way, the sign of the ulterior motive.  It's also a sign of immense subtlety:  never imagine you've worked out all his motives, because there's always one you haven't thought of.  Nothing is ever done by a Capricorn without a purpose.  All that canny waiting and assessing, hard work and labour, are always directed toward an end.  And you don't always see the goat showing his goal on his sleeve like any Sagittarian, or talking about it like Gemini.  Often he'll play the humble servant, the one who has no ambitions, who only seeks to help, while he waits and assesses and plans.  But there's no time for wasted time with Capricorn, no space for useless leisure and play.  Serious?  Yes, you might say that about Capricorn too.  His wit is often of the ironic kind, full of a sense of life's incongruities, rather than the broad slapstick of some of the other signs.  That ironic wit is part of Capricorn's underplayed charm.  But to most goats, life is a serious business, because it has to be mastered if you want to survive.<br><br>Survival is another key theme for Capricorn.  To the goat, the world isn't always a friendly, bountiful place.  It's as if his antennae are always plugged into what might go wrong, rather than what might go right.  As J.D. Smith says, 'The world is nothing but a vast, concerted attempt to catch you with your pants down.'<br><br>Nothing is ever taken for granted by the goat, least of all luck, which to Capricorn is a highly untrustworthy and often nonexistent commodity.  He'd rather replace luck with good, solid hard work, unlike his fire sign cousins.  And goals, of course, are another keynote to our perplexing goat.  Without goals, Capricorn slides back-end first down that steep mountain path and lands with a rude bump in a big, black depression.  Since the world isn't basically a friendly place for him, his goals give him his sense of meaning, and achievement to him is what romance is to the fiery signs.  Besides, Capricorn will be the first to tell you, romance is all very well, but it isn't very permanent, and it doesn't put a roof over your head.  Achievement can outlast your lifetime, and often comes in the form of good, hard cash.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Let's consider Saturn for a moment, Capricorn's planetary ruler.  He's got a peculiar reputation in astrology, since he's always been considered the symbol of limitation and discipline.  Also of isolation and loneliness.  In mythology Saturn is one of the Titans, the earth gods, children of the great Earth Goddess Gaia.  Earthy indeed:  there isn't any greater pragmatist than Capricorn.  Saturn is also often portrayed as a ruthless figure in mythology, who will stop at nothing - even his own father's destruction - to seize power.<br><br>Ruthlessness may often be seen in the goat, and the field of politics swarms with Capricorns.  But it's always a necessary ruthlessness, and rarely stems from a wanton malice or cruelty.  Power, too, is attractive to many Capricorns, both in the world and in their personal lives.  This in fact is one of the goat's biggest problems in human relationships:  he finds it immensely difficult to relinquish control.  Male or female, Capricorn must always hold the reins.  He's downright terrified of what might happen if he loses control - not only of the situation outside him, but of himself as well.  You might guess from this that Capricorn isn't likely to be the great gambler in the sphere of the passions.  You'd be quite right.  He's more known for having the wit to choose the conductor over the second violin.<br><br>Yet in Roman mythology, Saturn's rulership over the world coincides with the Golden Age of man.  Vines bear abundant fruit, rivers flow sweet, the sky is blue and cloudless, the earth yields its riches, and the children of men no longer have to labour by the sweat of their brows.  In some ways the earth signs have made peace with the world, and the world, pleased to be recognized as something other than a grubby, sleazy and unspiritual cesspit (we're taught, after all, that it's pretty hard for rich men to enter heaven), will often show a kind face in reward for the long labour which the earth signs are willing to expend.  And you often find that Capricorn, once his paid his worldly dues to the ferryman and accomplished something in the way of success or skill, will settle back and begin to develop the deeper, more profound side of his nature.<br><br>Capricorn, far from being a ruthless materialist, is a reflective and often deeply introverted soul who knows that he'll never have the freedom to pursue his love of the mysteries without first learning to live in the world.  Visionary and mystical he isn't; the qualities of faith in the intangible are hard for Capricorn to muster.  But he's often drawn to the occult, which involves learning the laws of the energies that govern life.  That's a very different path.<br><br>Peculiar people, these Capricorns.  With a powerful and faithful ruler like Saturn, it's no wonder they're difficult to know.  There's another strange paradox, too, in Capricorn:  the conflict between society and individual will.  Many Capricorns are unusually sensitive to the opinions and values of the world, and pay a lot of attention to things like good credentials and acceptable training.  The right clothes are important - never too flashy, but always good quality, the sort of thing that's understated and always in impeccable taste.  The right neighbourhood is important, the right schools for the children, the right social image.<br><br>Capricorns often have a remarkable skill at appearing to be the pillars of society, and although in youth they are rebellious and iconoclastic as any young person can be (remember that Capricorn is interested in the world, and often in changing it) they usually become increasingly conservative as they grow older.  It was most probably a Capricorn who said, 'If you're not a socialist by the age of twenty then you have no heart; but if you're not a conservative by the age of forty, then you have no brain.'  You'll also often hear the famous, 'What will people thinkÂ….' Out of Capricornian mouths, for the goat is often unduly concerned with not being noticed within society's protective embrace.  Sometimes Capricorn can be downright crushing with his insistence on obeying the silent dictates of what is right and appropriate.  Yet deep within, he's a fierce individualist, and his game with society is usually yet another of his immensely subtle methods of making sure that the world around him doesn't disturb him while he works out his own particular destiny.  It's based on the principle of rendering unto Caesar what's Caesar's, and rendering unto oneself what's yours.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The pattern of Capricorn's journey usually divides his life into two distinct halves.  Often in the first half - which includes that frequently restrictive or burdensome childhood - the goal is frustrated or thwarted by some responsibility, and is in a sense at the mercy of society or of his tasks and responsibilities.  Hardship - inner or outer - seems to be part of Capricorn's training in the school of life, and if life doesn't offer it to him then he'll take it himself.  You often see Capricorn's entering a kind of voluntary bondage in the early part of life, as though they actually wanted to experience this term of frustration.  It might be taking care of ill or ageing parents, or working at a job they dislike intensely, or embroiling themselves in a restrictive marriage.<br><br>Whatever the nature is of the restriction, there is a curious kind of psychological hair shirt which Capricorn dons for a time.  In medieval mysticism, the hair shirt symbolized the individual's way of purifying himself of his carnal sins in order to prepare him for the experience of God.  Capricorn's symbolic hair shirt is a kind of perpetual self-punishment or self-imposed labour.  Try to get him to enjoy himself and he'll give you a thousand excuses why his responsibilities won't permit it.  And like the British officer of the old school, he's convinced that what tastes bad must be good for you.  No allowances made for luxury or sybaritic indulgence.  He can show an ascetic streak even when there's lots of money around to be enjoyed.  He's more likely to horde it and live as though he didn't have it, then spend freely like the Leo or the Libra on beauty and pleasure.<br><br>But those first thirty years of training serve a purpose.  Even when it's happening at a deep, unconscious level, Capricorn is planning his ultimate destiny.  He may be a nobody, someone who has to take orders from others, or work at things he detests which offer no challenge to his real capabilities.  But watch him when that term has passed and he's released from his self-imposed prison.  All the while a powerful determination and ambition have been breeding in him, and an immense strength of will.  It might be a worldly goal of envisions - to run his own business, to make enough money to buy a piece of land, or whatever.  It might be ambition in a creative sense - to develop a formidable skill as a painter, a writer, a musician.  It might be an inner ambition - self-understanding, or something more occult.  You can see this side of Capricorn in such people as Gurdjieff and Krishnamurti.  But whatever the goal is, those first years of life have developed a steely determination in our goat, and although he may be a little late in getting on the road, once he gets moving nothing is going to get in his way, no matter how many setbacks and obstacles confront him.  Capricorn is very tenacious.  After all that work, he's not going to just dump the project because the road's a little rocky.  If you want to bet money on someone succeeding in life, bet it on a Capricorn.  It's not that there aren't any Capricorns who fail.  Lots do.  But the Capricorn who is really expressing his basic nature is a sure winner.  It may take him seventy years, so don't expect it in a hurry.  But he'll get there.<br><br>Work and success aren't the whole picture to Capricorn.  Because he's very concerned with tradition and structure, his family life is also often highly important.  Structure is yet another keynote for the sign, and marriage and family commitments are often taken with great seriousness and responsibility.  Capricorns don't like to break promises, they like to be thought responsible, and it's important to their self-image to have the world see them that way.  The idea of leaving a marriage, or offending the family, is extremely painful to Capricorn; he'll often endure a marriage that has gone loveless for many years because his sense of commitment to the structure and security is so strong.  This trait is usually more typical of the older Capricorn, since most sun signs don't really show their colours until around thirty and Capricorns even later.  But Capricorn can carry the duty bit so far that he makes his own life a living hell and sometimes the lives of the people around him.  Duty is a two-edged sword.<br><br>And guilt often plagues our goat; vague guilt which he can't always pin down, but which makes him take up responsibilities that others should be handling.  Many Capricorns willingly pick up the threads other signs responsible for keeping the world turning on its axis, and feel horribly guilty if they don't step in.  It might just stop spinning if they do.  It's hard to pry a Capricorn away from his guilt, because it makes him feel he's contributing something.  The trouble is, it often leads other people to lean on him and take advantage of him, which only increases his sense of suspicion and his mistrust of others' motives.  And he rarely realizes that it's his own doing.<br><br>Capricorn's real place is out on the world's stage, moving things in the environment - little or small - so that he leaves the place a little more organized than it was when he found it.  His gifts lie in the realm of organization and control, discipline and initiation of changes within already existing structures.  He's often more of an idealist than you'd expect, in that he may have a vision of how to improve the world, or the small corner of the world he inhabits.  Mystical, he isn't, and his ideals are always attainable ones.  He makes sure of that, and also usually makes sure he has the resources and the skills to achieve them in his lifetime.<br><br>He won't sit idly by and let others bring to birth his vision; he hates to delegate responsibility, and usually believes he must do it himself.  It's usually only in maturity that he discovers it's okay to relax occasionally and enjoy the fruits of his labours.  Sometimes he has to be prodded by an infuriated wife or lover, or a weeping child, to take a little holiday and let himself be sloppy and human.  But in his heart he's a builder, and often a selfless one, building for others with his immense skills and power of will.  It may take you a while to get to know him.  But beneath the often overly conventional garb he's seen a lot of life, and hopefully a lot of the funnier side of it too.  In kabbalistic thought the symbol of Saturn was equated with understanding - profound, rich wisdom based on real experience rather than theories and philosophies.  It's worth a little time and effort to be able to tap that vein of gold.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Capricorn Lover</strong><br><br>Relationships aren't easy for Capricorn.  You might expect this, since control is always important to him, and letting down the solid protection of that suit of armour takes a lot of effort.  He's been wearing the armour for so long that very likely it's rusted at the hinges, and you hear some pretty loud groans and protests as it comes off.  You usually find that no matter how much the goat loves, there's always a last special place inside which he isn't prepared to share, a last area of self-control which he isn't about to relinquish.  Capricorn is often a loner, a self-isolated figure climbing his own private mountain.  And sometimes he won't allow himself to accept either help or sympathy when the going is rough.  Thanks very much, he'll manage himself.  It's difficult to do Capricorn a favour.  He can often be seen doing favours for his friends and loved ones; he knows how to give, especially when it comes to the things of the world.  But sometimes he can't receive very well.  He has a ferocious pride, and a real terror of being dependent and weak.  No goat can bear a situation over which he has no control.<br><br>If you ever have a chance to scratch the surface of a Capricorn, you'll find that he's a secret romantic.  He shares this in common with the earth signs.  But his romanticism is almost never allowed to dictate his decisions.  He'd much rather sacrifice the great romantic love for the safe, suitable partner who is a social asset as well.  When they marry early, many Capricorns run the risk of choosing for security and suitability, and living to bitterly regret the choice.  You'll rarely find Capricorn throwing all away for love.  He might throw all away for the sake of conviction, or for the preservation of his family.  But love?  Well, marriage isn't always motivated by love for Capricorn, and certainly not solely.  Back in the days when marriages were arranged and you learned over many years of sticking together (divorce just wasn't done) to develop a deep fondness and respect for your partner, Capricorn would have found that arrangement just right.  You can imagine what the Pisceans and the Leos and the Sagittarians would have done.  But Capricorn takes his vows seriously, and he wants to be very sure before he makes them that the investment is likely to turn out successfully.  Most Capricorns either marry very early - in which case they're either looking for fathers, or trying to play fathers - or they marry late, having scanned the market carefully.  But on impulse?  Rarely.<br><br>Not that it's a bad way to be.  Capricorn places more value on deep respect, duty, loyalty, and the power of the family bond than he does on a few months of wild passion.  Not that he's not capable of passion.  This is an earthy sign, remember, and the sexual drive is often strong and the physical nature very basic.  But many Capricorns keep this side of themselves out of their serious relationships, because they don't often trust their passions.<br><br>If you are involved with a Capricorn, you must accept the fact that he or she will try to take charge.  Capricorn doesn't take kindly to either positions of submission or humiliation or one-upmanship - unless he's the winner and you the one who submits.  If you hurt his pride, or take away his self-respect, he'll take a long time forgiving, and an even longer time forgetting.<br><br>Because of his earthy, controlled nature, Capricorn sometimes finds it difficult to express his love and affection in a relaxed way.  He may feel it deeply, but you may never know it.  And he's usually attracted to those who can loosen him up a little bit - the extroverted, emotional type, the irresponsible and playful temperament, the child.  The same thing that makes many Capricorns secret religious seekers also makes them seekers after people who are able to open up the romantic side of life for them.  Underneath the realistic and pragmatic surface of Capricorn, you'll find all sorts of fantasies.  But it's not likely he'll tell you about them.  Capricorn is very frightened of chaos.  This is why so many Capricorns shy away from the supernatural or mystical side of life - or, put another way, from the unconscious, the unknown depths in themselves.  An emotional reaction or nonrational experience can leave Capricorn feeling embarrassed and vulnerable.  Yet he longs for these qualities in a partner, someone through whom he can learn to trust all those things he doesn't dare trust in himself or in life.<br><br>So this old-young man or woman will seek someone who can help him free the child in himself.  And this kind of relationship can often heal him and release his real creativity.  The trouble is that, having found someone who personifies the fiery side of life, Capricorn will often take the role of a stern parent with a child, repressing rather than encouraging spontaneity.  If it's you who has been cast in the role of the child, that well-meaning parental tone can get a little suffocating, not to say restrictive.  It's really the child in himself that Capricorn keeps trying to keep in line, the restless, volatile wanderer who might upset all his plans and suddenly call the world's attention to his own difficulty in commitment.<br><br>Capricorn's parent-child marriages (and he'll usually taste both sides of this arrangement, since he'll very likely play the child in youth and the parent later in life) can be either creative or destructive.  Gone sour, they can develop into a never-ending prison for the more spontaneous partner, and a growing sense of suspicion and mistrust for the Capricorn.  Or the stern, stiff streak in Capricorn can let himself be thawed by the gift of love, and learn through it that life can be trusted.  And if the suspicious goat can learn that, well, then, he has the world truly at his feet, since he can begin to enjoy the rewards of all his labour.  It's true for Capricorn than for any other sign that life begins at forty - and often love as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Capricorn Man</strong><br><br>Meet this man while he's still in his twenties and you'll probably not really see the goat.  You'll meet a goat in formation, and often he'll seem like a worldly failure, or wanderer who is unsettled and unsure of his direction.  Or he'll seem to have given up and saddled himself with an unpromising future in some job he dislikes.  But stick with him, or meet him later, and you'll see the goat in true form.  And he'll almost always have a goal he's working his way towards.  And his way of showing his love is generally to share that goal with you, and his expectations in love are that you do everything in your power to help him achieve it.<br><br>Capricorn men tend, on the whole, to belong to a more traditional school.  Once again, this may not be in evidence in the early part of life, since the goat must learn by hard experience and hard experience means he must try a lot of things in youth that he'll moralize fiercely against later.  But because of his emotional complexity and inhibitions, and because security means a lot to him, sooner or later he'll usually look for a stable, solid relationship which can constitute a family for him.  You'll also notice that it's important to many Capricorns to have sons, since the strong patriarchal streak in the sign may love and adore women yet still secretly feels the world should be run by men.<br><br>Capricorn men aren't really very good members of the feminist movement like many Aquarian and Libran and Piscean men are.  They have a strong sense of what masculine pride and dignity and achievement are about.  If you want to get a Capricorn to consider your opinions or wishes, you must learn to be a diplomat.  After all, he respects diplomacy.  What he doesn't like is rebellion.<br><br>Often you'll see a real fatherly quality in the Capricorn man.  He can be wonderfully protective and supportive, and he's usually the kind of man who when he says, 'Don't worry.  I'll take care of it,' really does.  He can be a pillar of strength and a great source of wisdom and help.  The difficulty with this paternal side of his is that you sometimes only get the best face of it when you're prepared to be the helpless one who needs support.  Many Capricorn men dislike capable women; it takes away their need to be the strong figure in the relationship.<br><br>Sometimes you see this reversed.  The Capricorn man who hasn't come to terms with his father relationship may behave like an adolescent still rebelling against the father.  Then, in a queer way, he looks for those paternal qualities in his women.  There is a whole breed of Capricorn male who let their ladies support them and make the financial decisions.  They sit back and play the child to the woman-father-lover.  It's a curious phenomenon, and you find it when Capricorn has been badly scarred or hurt by his childhood.  But more often the Capricorn man is only too happy to play the strong, supportive, capable role.  It's just hard for him sometimes to share it.<br><br>You also have to accept, in relationships with Capricorn, that his career comes first.  That means that if he is moved by his firm from London to Stoke-on-Trent, you learn to like Stoke-on-Trent.  If it's his ambitions that might be fulfilled by a move of house, a pruning of the social circle, a change in any of the things which give comfort and pleasure in personal life, then it's his ambitions which come first.  If you have any of your own, you're expected to adjust.  This means that you have two solutions.  Either you accept with grace and joy the ancient male-female relationship, which has much to commend it, or, if you're the more independent sort, you learn to maintain a relationship with Capricorn that isn't very close.<br><br>That usually means a sexual relationship without any commitment.  He's not going to commit himself to you unless he knows that you're prepared to commit yourself to him and his goals.  And he may simply run a few casual affairs for a time until he finds the woman who can be the kind of emotional support his enclosed nature needs to blossom.<br><br>It's obvious that this kind of man is the perfect mate for some women, and a disaster for others.  It depends on your taste.  But you can't dominate a Capricorn man, except by the most devious methods of emotional blackmail - and he'll usually spot those and learn to despise you in time for it - and you can't make yourself more important in his life than his own inner convictions and commitments.  And what this sums up is a man who is a pretty good embodiment of the masculine principle in one of its most ancient and traditional forms.  Many women prefer more ambivalent men, who are able to lean a little more toward the middle, and have more tolerance for the feminine side of life.  Not Capricorn.  He's not in the least ambivalent.<br><br>He usually knows what he wants - and if it's you he'll generally be fairly tenacious about getting you to surrender - and he rarely deviates once he's decided.  You can either love and respect it, or leave it alone.  It's almost impossible to change both himself and the world.  And nobody can do it for him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Capricorn Woman</strong><br><br>It may be hard to imagine a woman who embodies the principle of the Father.  But in fact it doesn't make Capricorn women masculine.  If anything, they often have a quality of femininity which epitomizes the fantasies of many men.  Take, for example, Marlene Dietrich.  Masculine?  Well, not in any sense we understand the word.  But look again.  The typical Capricorn woman is usually subtle, and sensitive, and perceptive.  She'd rather use diplomacy than argue aggressively; her voice is usually cool and calm and low-pitched.  She's often beautiful and tastefully dressed, never gaudily, and never in clothes that follow a fad, but in classically tailored feminine things.  She's smart enough to know that silk underwear and expensive perfume are far more effective than blue-green dyed hair.<br><br>She's also smart enough to know that you don't confront power directly; therefore, if she wants something from you, you usually end up thinking that you came up with the idea yourself, and she's managed to twist you around with such finesse that you're convinced she's fragile and helpless and you begin to feel such a hero that your biceps begin to visibly swell.  Ah, poor soul.  No Capricorn is fragile or helpless.  All Capricorn women are born with stainless steel spines.<br><br>This doesn't mean that all Capricorn women use people.  Many do; their strong cynical streak makes them choose partners who can provide support and security, or can help with a creative career.  But many are also devoted lovers and wives and mothers, offering their powerful wills and business astuteness and worldly wisdom and shrewd judgment to help you in your own career.  Playing the unseen power behind the throne suits the Capricorn woman very well.  She's realistic enough about herself to know that being the obvious power in the relationship is much more dangerous - you earn enmity of society that way - than appearing to be the follower.  But the love and devotion may be truly selfless, and the manipulation and subtlety offered to help the person she loves achieve something in his own life.<br><br>The thing is, Capricorn needs to manage something, and this is as true of the female Capricorn as the male.  If no career appears in a Capricorn woman's life, her need to fulfill a useful role and organize and direct generally falls on the members of her family.  Then she'll organize your life and direct your energy, often to your gain, sometimes to your detriment because the goals you think you've got are frequently hers.  The Capricorn mother whose managing instinct is thwarted will usually stage-manage the lives of her children.  It's important for the Capricorn woman to have some place in her own life where she can apply her gifts of organization, administration, care of others, outside her personal relationships.<br><br>Whether it's a creative skill or a desire to offer physical service such as nursing or medicine or osteopathy or some other typical Capricornian profession, or a shop or trade which pleases her, the Capricorn woman needs to have a place to unleash her ambition to achieve something either in her own eyes or in the eyes of the world.  Capricorn needs to feel accomplished in something.  Beware of the Capricorn woman who has accomplished nothing, or doesn't recognize that she even has the drive.  Unconsciously, she'll gradually begin to make you her accomplishment.<br><br>We've already mentioned the propensity with many Capricorn women to seek men who can play the role of father during the early part of life.  The Capricorn woman, like the Capricorn man, often has a complex and problematic relationship with the father.  Sometimes you find a type of Capricorn woman who is Daddy's little girl, who needs to be adored and given gifts and taken care of while she expresses her charming, frivolous, irresponsible self.  Then she's trying to live out that strong, earthy Capricorn nature through her man.<br><br>At some point she'll usually go through a crisis; sometimes the marriage breaks down because the man goes off, or her problem with commitment in relationships takes her through so many failed love episodes that she begins to question herself deeply.  You can also find a kind of Capricorn woman who is busy rejecting the father because he's too stern, or possessive, or controlling, and chooses men who can lean on her.  Then she plays father, and often suffers as far as her feelings about her own womanhood are concerned.  Either way, the Capricorn woman seems to mature into the warmest, riches side of the sign later in life.<br><br>The Capricorn woman who has learned to become her own Father and stand on her own feet in life is free to release the gentler, more sensitive and caring side of her nature in relationships.  The feminine side of the earthy signs shows its face here, in the form of real sensitivity and generosity with time and energy:  also in the form of loyalty and dedication.  As we mentioned already, life is serious business for Capricorn.  And the Capricorn woman who has passed the test of her own survival, and learns that she can function in the world through her own efforts, has also learned wisdom and compassion along the way.  In kabalistic teaching Saturn represents the feminine principle of wisdom and understanding, as we have said; and it is also called the Great Mother.<br><br>The profound depths of wisdom and insight which lie in the still pool of Capricorn's heart can flow into relationships once the Capricorn woman has learned that life can be a pleasure as well.  If you're looking for a showgirl, this isn't the sign to choose, even the Marlene Dietrichs of the world, offstage, are wise and self-disciplined women, with a realistic eye and a hard-earned knowledge of human foibles.<br></div>

A Virgo man will be home in time for dinner, help you balance the cheque book, and help raise the children. Whether he's as sexy as Sean Connery, or as silly as Peter Sellers, he will always be by your side. He's conscientious, capable, thrifty, kind, and loyal. Sounds like a real boy scout, doesn't he? Well, he is - the bargain basement version.<br><br>Life with a male Virgoan is like being pushed into traffic when you don't want to cross the street. Born with a superior attitude and an eye for improving everything except his own conduct, he is as relentless with his fault-finding as a pit bull locked onto a mailman's leg, and just as unsympathetic.<br><br>At his worst, he's a classic chauvinist, dismissing what he doesn't believe and believing only what's convenient to his point of view. His one talent for conversation is a non-stop string of criticisms about every facet of your existence, from the way you wear your hair to your coupon-clipping ability. And he won't hesitate to insult your intelligence by demonstrating just how to accomplish either task.<br><br>At his best, he has the kind of predictability that will give you sleeping sickness. He'll expect dinner promptly at six, where you will exchange news of the day's events. Then he'll spend an hour with the children, who will go to bed exactly at eight. Next comes an hour of telling you how to improve your housekeeping abilities. Finally, he'll retire to his home office where he'll spend the rest of the evening mumbling over the bills or developing a plan for your self-improvement.<br><br>His character is purely idiosyncratic. Every Virgo has his own peculiar thought process and just as peculiar a speech pattern. Many self-made Virgo millionaires are unable to utter a sensible statement.<br><br>Throughout his career, legendary Hollywood producer Virgo Samuel Goldwyn adamantly refused to compromise his search for the finest talent, directors, screenwriters, and technical crews. You can't argue with perfection, and The Goldwyn Touch set a standard of excellence that has been seldom, if ever, matched. Sam also had an unmatched Virgo talent for trying to act superior and coming off as a total goofball.<br><br>When his secretary asked for permission to destroy files that were more than 10 years old, Goldwyn said, 'Yes, but keep copies'. He's also credited with such gems as, 'Give me a couple of years, and I'll make that actress an overnight success,' 'If I look confused, it's because I'm thinking,' and 'True. I've been a long time making up my mind, but now I'm giving you a definite answer maybe.'<br><br>Argue with yours, and he'll stare at you as if you've just lost your mind, for he can't believe you dared to disagree. Then he will repeat, word by word, the conversation, question, or disagreement that led you to throw the toaster at his head. Soon, you will feel as if ants were crawling through your brain and will apologise just to shut him up.<br><br>You can take comfort in the knowledge that if you are determined to force his hand, you can send him to bed with a tummy ache. The fact that he's pretending to be ill, and he knows you know it, makes no difference. A male Virgo will feign anything from a headache to a heart attack if he feels cornered. He's as loathe to confront a situation as is his opposite, Pisces, but where Pisces fears confrontation itself, Virgo fears facing any unpleasantries about himself. Of course, he will expect you to rush to his side with chicken soup and spoon-feed him. If he can't control you with his superiority, he'll try to by appearing helpless.<br><br>If you want romance and love songs, choose any other sign (except Capricorn), because you won't find it with this man. Serve him dinner by candlelight and he'll complain he can't see what he's eating. He'll talk a lot about sex and isn't above leering at the nearest pretty face. However, he's really not into promiscuity, even the legal kind, except on Wednesday and Saturday nights, unless it's tax season, then revise that schedule to Saturday from 9 to 9:15. He's so methodical that you can put a cake in the oven and be assured that his buzzer will go off five minutes before the kitchen timer.<br><br>A Virgo man is nervous, nit-picky, and as selfish as a spinster guarding her assets. Emotional scenes baffle and alarm him because he fears losing control. Unless, of course, he plans to lose control, and even then he will try to orchestrate the outcome. Like Mr Spock, too much unbridled passion makes his brain melt.<br></div>

Bobby Riggs (Born February 25) </strong><br><br>He's a dreamboat who lives for romance, and his hypnotic charisma will leave you weak at the knees and breathless. He may be a visionary like Copernicus, or a joker a la Billy Crystal, but a Pisces man is intuitive, caring, and sympathetic. No other male in the universe is as capable of profound love and devotion. Unfortunately, he's so in love with himself that you don't stand a chance.<br><br>The male Fish is the emotional black hole of the universe. Toss your heart, soul, and car keys, and all will disappear forever. This guy learned at an appallingly young age how to weasel his way out of work and charm his way into bed. He's definitely sensual, sexy, and cute, in a debauched sort of way. Don't let the image fool you. At home he may be a quiet little Fish, swimming around and around the beer bottle, but romantically he is the great white shark of the zodiac. A Scorpio man will hurt you because he has a morbid fear of rejection. Your Pisces guy will do it just to keep his teeth sharpened. He's a natural born liar. And he's honed the art until he fools himself. Such as when he's perched on his favorite bar stool, watching the sports channel and ogling hot bodies, but telling himself he's gathering material for the novel he plans to write. The only thing this loser will ever write is a smeared phone number on his cocktail napkin.<br><br>He's self-destructive. He loves sex games. Feel free to wear your nurse's uniform but expect him to play patient, not doctor. Buy a dog collar and he will bark. Introduce him to your best friend if you dare, but don't leave them alone. He will have affairs anywhere, any time, with anyone who will hold still long enough. And with an icy detachment that rivals his Gemini cousin. The Fish can leave you full of his declarations of undying love, drive straight to his favourite watering hole, and pick up the first available body.<br><br>Don't expect your Fish to be the breadwinner. Some Pisces males start on a career path early, but if yours hasn't dropped the remote and picked up a degree by the time he's in his late twenties, forget it. You will end up with a ne'er-do-well who thinks making his fortune means winning the lottery, and that reality TV is culturally educational.<br><br>If you are a Virgo with a job, house, and cheque book, or a Cancer who doesn't mind playing nursemaid for the rest of your life, this guy was meant for you. He's tedious. He has a compulsion to use the same cliches he's used since high school and will invariably run a subject straight into the ground in the shortest possible time. Telling him he's not funny only eggs him on, because he's not after your laughter: he's out to provoke you.<br><br>All bluff and no substance, Mr Fish is a cast of thousands and even he doesn't know what scene he'll play next. But since he does like role-playing, you could pretend you're the Lone Ranger and ride into the sunset.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pisces<br>He'll play pliant on the surface because it's easier;<br>it's not that important to draw blood.</strong><br><br>The range from Einstein to the ranks of junkies queuing at midnight in Piccadilly Circus for their weekly methadone is a pretty broad range.  So is the range from the Fish, that for two thousand years has symbolized the mystery of Christ, to the sad, scruffy, ineffectual figure which Vivian Robson once described in an astrology text as 'the dustbin of the zodiac'.  But this bizarre combination of paradoxical things is typical of Pisces.<br><br>In an attempt to understand the real motivations of the Piscean (a thing which is impossible right from the outset, but which one must, irresistibly, try anyway), I once asked a Pisces friend what he thought about it.<br><br>'Well,' he replied with a perfectly straight face, 'it's a well-known fact that every Pisces secretly longs to be given the fishing rights to all the dustbins in Oxford Street.'<br><br>And there you have it.  Take the dustbin literally or symbolically as you please.  What the rest of humanity discards, ignores or cannot comprehend, Pisces pursues.  In the midst of the waste and wreckage of human dreams and the heights of disappointed fantasies, he will fishÂ….and fishÂ….and fish.<br><br>Pisces is ruled by Neptune, who in ancient mythology is represented as the god of the oceans and the underground waterways of the earth.  Dripping with seaweed, brandishing his trident, he is unpredictable in behaviour:  sometimes friendly to sailors, offering them smooth seas and a calm wind, other times strangely inimical, raising destructive storms and calling monsters out of the depths.  The figure of Neptune tells us something about Pisces right away.  This sign is connected with a realm that has no boundaries, no measurable depths.  'From water all life comes,' the Koran tells us.  And nothing less than the source of life itself is the real secret for which Pisces fishes.  No wonder, if he fails, that he reverts to the disillusioned, deluded escapist.<br><br>It is sometimes said that Pisces, the last sign of the zodiac, contains a little bit of all of the others.  And watching a typical Piscean, this certainly seems to be true.  No one is as much as a chameleon as Pisces, a natural actor.  The theatre and the film industry are full of fishes, playing their parts.  There is a marvelous fluidity and complexity in Pisces people which can be alternatively enchanting and irritating, for they are so many people that you begin to wonder when the real Pisces will stand up.  The secret is that there is no 'real' Piscean.  He actually is everybody.  And if you think it's easy to live with that kind of empathy and identification with the human race, think again.<br><br>It is also said that Pisces incarnates either to serve or to suffer.  This, too, seems to be true in its fashion, although it is a little extreme.  But the tendency Pisceans to become the people with whom they are strongly involved causes many of them to be subsumed.  Sometimes texts refer to Pisces as 'wishy-washy', because there is a passivity, a kind of inertia in these people that shows most clearly when a crisis is upon them.  Watch a Pisces in a dilemma that calls for quick decision and action.  You'll go grey waiting for that positive move.  Decisions, if it is to be quick, means you have to exclude one choice for another.  To Pisces, the problem is that so many choices are available, and if you look at all of them carefully, why, they all contain some truth.  How do you choose when every choice is a right - and a wrong - one?<br><br>This is one of the keys to Pisces' often enigmatic behaviour:  everything is relative.  Like all the other zodiacal traits we have explored, this one is double-edged.  Seeing the relativity of truth is a great gift, because it breeds tolerance.  If men throughout history have possessed a few more truly Piscean traits, there would have been no Spanish Inquisition, no Nazi holocaust, no Salem witchhunts, no bigotry and persecution.  If everything is relative, then you can't condemn others for their viewpoints.  The problem with this attitude is that it can be incredibly lax.  Pisces has sometimes been accused of immorality.  But that isn't strictly true; to be immoral, you have to have morals to break.  And the calm wise indifference with which Pisces greets human transgressions not only applies to his own.<br><br>He will sit quietly while his wife leaves, his children insult him, his employer heaps abuse upon his head, the taxman takes half his income, and his landlord throws him out of his flat.  It can drive you to frenzy - watching the complete blank acceptance - as though they were born to it, expect it, welcome it.  And maybe they know something the other signs don't - that all this suffering, all this misfortune, means little if you're not attached too strongly to life.<br><br>Pisces is the sign of the mystic.  And this mystical streak means several things.  For one thing, many Pisceans are deeply religious - although not necessarily in an orthodox way.  But they have a longing for, and a sense of, some other reality, something transcendant, magical, elusive, that makes ordinary life seem drab and meaningless.  Truly a vale of tears.  For another thing, Pisces has a deep wisdom about the futility of so many human desires.  Intense ambition, powerful passion, covetousness, greed - the ordinary human motives that drive us all - pass through him and pass out again, for none of them have that much power over him.  He is as capable of these emotions as any other sign.  But somehow, somewhere deep down, he doesn't really take them all that seriously.  After all, it's only maya, as they say in the East - only illusion.<br><br>Pisceans seem to have this strange and cynical wisdom, about life and people, even from childhood.  Pisces belongs to the element of water, and, like Cancer and Scorpio, is deeply sensitive to the secret undercurrents that lie behind the mask of ordinary human behaviour.  It's hard to fool a Pisces.  But the difference between the Fish and his two watery fellows is that Cancer and Scorpio, being more strongly attached to their own emotions, will act on their reactions.  Cancer, sensing that someone is a little untrustworthy, will move to protect himself and his loved ones.  Scorpio, sensing the same thing, will usually attack the enemy, to teach him a lesson, or withdraw in strong disgust.  Pisces will look, see, feel saddened, and forgive.  And will generally let himself be taken advantage of or cheated despite his insight.  Why?  Well, I've asked Pisces people that, when they've got into the classic Pisces bind of being the sucker.  'It doesn't really matter that much,' they say.  Or, 'Well, he needed it more than I do.'  Or some other remark which reminds you once again that this world is not the real one for the Fish.  He hears a different drumbeat.<br><br>The Fish is a creature which lives underwater.  And Pisces does too.  He moves in the depths of a world which is difficult to fathom if you are an airy, earthy, rational type.  Everything is seen double, or in quadruplicate, nothing is ever simple or clear.  Every thought and action has thousands of associations which ripple out into infinity.  Pisces does not understand boundaries.  He will frequently eat until he makes himself sick, or drink until he collapses, or get so loud and extroverted that he offends everybody, or go so quiet and withdrawn that he terrifies everyone.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything to excess.  It's because he doesn't really understand how to discriminate, how to limit, how to choose.  If you have ever kept a tank of tropical fish, you will know that you cannot  just leave a week's worth of food and go away on holiday.  A fish will simply eat and eat what's in front of him until he kills himself.  There's no sense of moderation in Pisces.  How could there be?  He's a creature from another world, unsure of and unused to the laws by which the clear, cold world of matter and facts operates.<br><br>What he has to compensate for this rather disturbing failing is a boundless imagination.  For here too, the Pisces has no limits.  He can envision anything.  Einstein was a Pisces, and a good example of where a brilliant intellect can go when it is not hidebound by conventions and dogmas.  Many great musicians and painters have been Pisceans; their imagination know no bounds.  Anything is possible.  Pisces holds the secret to the source of life, the realm of dreams and fantasies.  Psychology calls this the unconscious.  Pisces has a key to this world - one given him at birth, as a gift.  He can come and go as he pleases.  The trouble is, he often finds it difficult to come back.<br><br>Pisces has a real problem coping with reality.  That is, with the one bound by time and space and structure and facts.  Although his intuition may be lightning-quick, and his intellect brilliant, he will often overlook something simple, like the electricity bill.  Pisces has a bad reputation with money.  It's not that he is 'impractical' in the ordinary sense.  He may even display bouts of meanness, and have some pretty shrewd, canny ideas about how money might be made.  It's more that he can't - and won't - bear limitations.  The whole concept of being limited by time, space, and other people is intensely irritating to Pisces.  His mind is on larger things.<br><br>This can be infuriating to more earthy types, or airy types who like everything planned, structured, and explained.  Although Pisces, as a water sign, often finds himself in relationships with the air signs, they see reality in very different ways.  For Pisces, these things are not important.  He would rather decide on the spur of the moment to take a quick plane to Tahiti, or to suddenly buy a Porsche, than he would plan six months in advance a package Thompson holiday and a good, sensible Mini which uses less petrol and a smaller insurance premium.  All this has led to Pisces being called childishly irresponsible.  This is rather unfair.  He's responsible enough with the things he cares about.  It's just that his conception of what's real may differ from that of other people's.  Quite radically.<br><br>Pisces is also an incurable romantic.  He may have many defences to hide this innate tendency, but romantic he was born and romantic he will die.  And romance doesn't just mean about love affairs.  It means about everything.  The house he lives in must be a castle, with moat and drawbridge; the car must be exotic, the bed revolving with platforms and coloured lightsÂ….well, you get the idea.  He lives in his imagination.  In his imagination, everything is not only like a set piece out of Star Wars, but it also changes constantly.  Pisces gets bored more easily than any other sign.  The constantly changing landscape of the depths is not easily replaced by the unchanging banality of life on dry land.  Pisces needs a little theatre in his life.  If you can't provide it, he'll create it.  Often to his own destruction.  But that too has a dramatic ring.<br><br>If you like safe, solid people who always mean what they say and also mean it next week and the week after, stay away from Pisces.  The only thing which is truly consistent about him is his love for, and longing for, change.  That and the closeness he has to the world of dreams, which is far more important to him than the 'realities' of the welfare state where food, shelter and free medical care plus a visit to the local every two nights means happiness.  Not for Pisces.  Give him hyacinths for the soul anytime.  He is remarkably adaptable, and can manage in a garret; but garrets are romantic.  Council estates aren't.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Pisces Lover</strong><br><br>You might expect that all the qualities we have mentioned about Pisces would be in abundant display in his love-life, for Pisces is usually in love.  If not with a human being, then with a cause, or with God, but he is usually in love.  It is in his nature to give, and since this is a water sign, a sign of feeling, it is impossible for Pisces to conceive of a life alone - unless it is a kind of aloneness which the monk or the nun elects in exchange for union of a different kind.<br><br>You may see the sensitivity, the gentleness, the tendency to devotedness in abundance.  You may also see the overcompensation of many Pisceans to their own need for people, exhibited in coolness and a deliberately forced detachment.  You may see the Piscean tendency always to put the other person's wishes first, and to blossom under any show of affection or tenderness.  Or you may see the shadow side take over, where the partner must always be in the position of the servant catering to the lord's whims.<br><br>Either way, the root is the same.  If Pisces can trust, he will give everything.  Not necessarily tomorrow, or next year.  Fidelity and structure are not part of his nature.  But today, now, in this moment.  And if you string together a long string of moments, you may discover that it's been a lifetime.<br><br>One of the more disturbing qualities about Pisces is that he is so ready to enter into a relationship with just about anybody on a certain superficial level that people misunderstand his motives.  He's not really coming on; he's listening with sympathy.  He's also easily seduced, not necessarily only literally.  You can't cage Pisces; his extroverted side flows out easily to other people that you may as well get used to it.  But this is, remember, a wise soul.  He sees through people very quickly.  And although he's led often one way or the next out of sympathy or flattery or a stronger personality, he has the capacity to recognize what's really of value to him.<br><br>This is not likely to be a lover who only notices one man, or one woman.  That's impossible for Pisces; he's not only interested in everybody, he's often attracted to everybody.  His morals are his own; better find out what they are first, so you aren't surprised later.  Don't take him for granted.  But the curious detachment in this sign is in evidence even in this highly fraught situations, when he says it meant nothing, and it would be better if it meant nothing to you too.  If you're the really possessive type, you're in a little trouble.  He may be technically faithful; his imagination certainly isn't, and never will be.  Not likely that he'll be either.  But it depends upon whether you value technical fidelity, or a depth of understanding and tacit communion which no other sign can offer.<br><br>There is also a quality in Pisces, like Virgo - the opposite sign - which is essentially untouched and unpossessable, no matter how formal the contact is, no matter how long you've known him.  Some part of Pisces will always belong to the cosmos, to his own inner self, and not to you.  Unlike the simpler signs such as Aries or Taurus, Pisces is simply not capable of saying, 'Here I am, a simple soul at heart.  I'm yours.'  He may give you forty-five of the sixty-eight selves he's discovered that week.  Don't expect all of them.<br><br>There will be dreams, visions, that he can never communicate.  If you keep asking a Pisces what he's thinking about every time he gets that vague, dreamy look in his eye, you'll drive him and yourself crazy, and never get any satisfactory answers.  The real truth is that he probably doesn't know; he just went off, and if left alone, will undoubtedly come back again.  Many of Pisces' ways of communicating are nonverbal; it's not a sign that excels in debate and defence.  Many Pisceans are completely inept at explaining themselves or their feelings.  They rely on touch, atmosphere, a subtle communion that is almost telepathic.  Try to force them into rigid explanations and definitions and it's like holding a handful of water; it slides through your fingers and it's gone.<br><br>Evasiveness is a word often used to describe Pisces. Deceptiveness is as well.  But it isn't the calculated statesmanship of the Capricorn, or the deliberate secretiveness of the Scorpio, or the mental gymnastics of the Gemini.  When you see thirty different things, how can you explain one?  Especially when the chances are that the other person can't even comprehend what it's like to see thirty?  And ambivalent emotion - well, that's equally difficult.  How to explain when you love and hate someone, when they're ugly and beautiful, when everything shifts and changes, and takes new shape faster than you can say chameleon?  For all these reasons and more, Pisces is an elusive partner.  You take the feelings as they come, and let them go as they go.  Attempting to define and freeze them into structures is a futile exercise.<br><br>Many people are badly hurt by Pisces, not because the sign is cold and unfeeling, but because the other person expects a conventional linear expression of love, like 'I love you, I always will, and that's it', when a phrase like that is downright ridiculous to the Piscean who knows that love is a very varied state, that it has many meanings all of which change all the time, that everything is relative, that you can't plan the future, etc. etc.<br><br>But if you know enough of the world and yourself to allow for motion rather than stasis, basking in the flow of a Pisceans' feelings can be the most healing and regenerative relationship you'll ever have.  The trick, perhaps, is not to ever trample on his dreams, nor ever think you understand him completely.  Just when you do, he'll change on you.  If you dislike change, pick a Taurus or a Leo.  But if you like unexplored regions, and unclimbed mountains, and futures that are shrouded in mist and beckon, and magic castles and unexplored treasures, then don't fear Pisces.  Only don't think you've got only one person.  You've got everybody.  A cast of thousands.  What better way is there to learn about life?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Pisces Man</strong><br><br>You may have observed that Pisces is a strongly feminine sign.  Feminine, that is, in terms of its feeling bias, its imagination, its softness, its compassion.  Many Pisces men are extremely masculine, and perfectly capable of what Jung calls, 'Knowing what you want and doing what you have to do to get it'.  But all in all, the combination of being a man and being a Pisces is a slightly uneasy one.  Largely, once again, because of collective pressures and social expectations.<br><br>There are a great many turntypes among Pisces men.  They compensate in a thousand ways for being Pisceans.  Some of them run in terror from the depths of their underwater visions, into an extreme and brittle kind of rationality which calls for statistics, definitions and proofs.  They are the dogmatic material scientists, attempting to stamp out in others what they fear in themselves.  They have no tolerance for what they call 'emotionality', and cannot abide moodiness in others because their own threatens to overwhelm them.<br><br>But if a Pisces man has the courage to face his own vulnerability, and to see that it can live happily side by side with his manhood, then you have a rare creature.  And he's able to maintain his manhood without disappearing underwater into the realm of escape, that is.  This is the hero of so many books and films, the antihero, the gentle fighter, the sensitive lover.  It's perhaps closer to our modern myth of man than any other, since it's a peculiar marriage of male and female.  The Pisces man who has accomplished this has a rare charisma, a drama about him that makes him endlessly fascinating both to men and women alike.<br><br>Sadly, many more Pisces men hit the extremes.  We've mentioned the rationalist, the Pisces who hates being a Pisces and wants desperately to protect his own sensitivity.  The opposite kind is also common enough.  He's the fellow who loves strong women, especially women who can support him financially; who can take care of him while he's writing the eternal half-finished novel, while he's contemplating the job he'll never take.<br><br>He's the passive victim, abused and betrayed by a cold, brutal wife, looking for pity and sympathy and playing for all its worth to the maternal instinct of some poor foolish woman who thinks all his romanticism is true tenderness and feeling.  These are pathetic Pisceans and their wives and lovers are frustrated women who have to be men most of the time and chafe violently against it.  Many Piscean men of this type gravitate toward the powerful signs in women:  Leo, Aries, Scorpio, Capricorn.  They have no strength of their own, and seek it in a partnership.<br><br>As you might guess, Pisces tends to run to extremes.  It's rare that you get a neutral Pisces.  It's generally one extreme or the other.<br><br>The Pisces man generally needs to feel 'understood' more than anything else.  This isn't so much a sign of physical passion as it is a sensuous sign, a sybaritic sign.  Dragging the woman off by the hair to the cave isn't generally Pisces' style.  Allowing himself to strike up a warm, sympathetic conversation and then allowing himself to be seduced by good wine, soft music, satin sheets and erotic underwear is much more his style.  Pisces is as happy being passive as a lover as he is being, literally or figuratively, the one on top.  It's his particular brand of masculinity.<br><br>Often he will make himself the buffoon, the clown, the victim, for he works a lot from sympathy and empathy.  Women love to protect him.  He can protect himself perfectly well.  But it isn't always in his interests to let you know that.<br><br>Trust him and you'll bring the best out of him.  See only the shadowy side of him and he'll have a devil of a time trusting himself.  He never trusts himself anyway; he's brutally realistic, beneath all those visions.  He needs the trust and loyalty of another person to bring out his own - the realistic trust, that is.  Accuse him of something, and he'll happily go out and do it, just to please.  His way of fighting is not to fight; it's to bend so far backwards that you fall on your face.  Impotence is also his way of fighting.  In this, you'll see the feminine side of the sign in strong colours.  Passive resistance is a technique dear to the Piscean heart.<br><br>You might think he can easily be dominated.  Think again.  In fact his world doesn't include dominant or submissive.  He'll play pliant on the surface because it's easier, because it's not that often important enough to draw blood.  Beneath that pliant surface, it isn't that he needs to control; he just wants to be left alone.  Try to dominate, and you'll discover you're empty-handed.  He's simply drifted away, without a fuss.<br><br>If you are the type who likes to have all your decisions made for you, don't choose a Pisces.  On the other hand, if you want someone to henpeck, pass on this one too.  Now you see him, now you don't.  No promise or marriage contract means anything to him if the fundamental values of the relationship have been abused.  And he'll see through all the games pretty quickly.  He just won't be there the next morning.  No note, no phone call.  Just gone.  Like the fish.<br><br>But if you want a relationship which is more nearly like the ideal vision of what the so-called 'liberated' woman seeks (and these are rare animals as well), you will find that Pisces is not one of your diehard male chauvinists.  Being strongly emotional himself, he usually has immense empathy for women.  He generally gets on with them better than men.  And with his profound understanding of human nature, you're not likely either to be the housekeeper or the sex object.  You get to be a person.  And that's worth quite a lot.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Pisces Woman</strong><br><br>Many paeans have been written to the Pisces woman, for her mystery, her gentleness, her compassion, her elusive charm, her pregnant silences.  And she may be, indeed, the archetypal feminine.  The lovely, gracious princess of the fairy-tale castle, waiting for the suitor to rescue her and cherish and protect her, is modeled on Pisces.  The Pisces woman has a unique ability to make a man feel terribly masculine, because she seems so often to need protecting, cherishing, and tenderness.  Because she has such a changeable range and depth of feeling, she often gives the impression of being slightly unformed.  It brings out the Pygmalion tendencies in any would-be artisans.  Many men think they can shape her into what they choose.  In part, it's true.  The qualities of devotion and gentleness and softness are in abundance in many Piscean women.  But blank slate she's not.<br><br>Like the Pisces man, she's unfathomable, and possesses a soul which no one can ultimately reach.  Although eager to please and rarely argumentative, she also has the gift of defence through submergence.  Now you see her, now you don't.  She may physically disappear, usually with a lover; but more likely she'll be physically present and simply psychologically disappear, gone to the underwater realms or to someone else in fantasy.  It's a very peculiar feeling when she's gone.  No one home.<br><br>Romanticism runs very high in the Pisces woman.  She expects, and needs the poetry and tenderness and style that any fairy-tale princess merits.  Starve her of these and you will drive her either to another lover or into herself, where she may transform into the martyr.  Provide them, and your princess becomes a queen.  Simple.  Yet astonishingly difficult for many men, since Pisces, as a watery sign, seems to attract airy types who believe they can impress her with their sparkling intellects and long for the exhibitions of feeling she herself provides without realizing they must give in exchange.<br><br>And make no mistake, the Pisces woman, if she is disappointed, will not hesitate to deceive.  Remember Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton?  Being good to her isn't enough.  You must enter her dreams with her.  Ignore them, patronize them, and you do so at your own risk.  There is a strong theatrical element in the Pisces woman.  She has a unique gift for getting herself into the most dreadful dilemmas and crisis which no one could possibly sort out, and then going about among her friends asking for advice which is never taken since her need to suffer and sacrifice is fed by the dilemma.  A perplexing creature.<br><br>But meet her in later life, and all the compassion and wisdom which come from having seen the seamy side of just about everything yield a glow and a richness which is far more meaningful than the unshaped marble which Pygmalion sees in her late teens and early twenties.  In this, the last of the signs, the Wise Woman emerges - with all the instinctual wisdom of her sex and all the human insights of her sign.  Often she is almost mediumistic, preferring to shelter herself from life because this gift is so dubious and so difficult to bear.  There is also more than a touch of the witch in Pisces; whether it is white or black depends on whether she has been badly bruised, and how badly.<br><br>A Pisces woman gone wrong is a vampire, playing on the fantasy life of others, and draining their strength.  Never underestimate her, because she may be inarticulate or reluctant to explain herself.  Neptune is an enigmatic god; to love him is to love the ocean, for all its moods and changes, its anger and its peacefulness, its destruction and its beauty.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GenX:</div><div class="quote_body">hi solea<br><br>mind posting something about virgoan gal?</div></blockquote>Gen X bro if she's Virgo what's your sign ar?<br><br><strong>The Virgo Woman</strong><br><br>If you're looking for the perfect housekeeper and have just read somewhere that Virgo women are masters (or mistresses) of the art, you should probably bestow your insult on some other sign.  The main gift of the Virgo woman is her intelligence, not her orderliness; and when you find the compulsive housebound type who dusts three times a day then you're courting trouble because you've got yourself a Virgo who's fallen into the shadow side of the sign.  And all that good housekeeping will pale into insignificance beside the shrewishness which goes with it.  This isn't, we repeat, what Virgo is about.<br><br>As a by-product it can be a nice bonus, and there are plenty of Virgo women who take an interest in their homes and like an orderly environment.  But Virgo as it expresses itself through the feminine psyche seems to be about things like good taste, and subtlety, and understanding, and a keen wit about people and life.<br><br>There are catches, of course.  The self-contained figure of myth is very much in evidence in the Virgo woman, and it's often difficult for Virgo to really be 'married' in any deep sense of the word.  There's a quality about the Virgo woman which is psychologically untouchable, and if you try to invade it you get the same reaction as if you tried physical rape.  Virgo women aren't usually the clinging, helpless type.  More often they're amazons who show a frightening degree of capability and efficiency, either on a physical level or a mental one - or even sometimes both.  Good points for Women's Lib, but bad points if you want to be the sun around which a happily reflecting moon orbits.<br><br>For one thing, Virgo women have opinions.  Mercury's connection with the sign seems to come out in a need to communicate, to talk, sometimes to simply gossip and chat.  Many Virgo women talk endlessly.  Sometimes it can make you cover your ears and begin screaming, just to make the sound stop.  It may not be the traditional Virgo criticism, either.  It may be all about the latest book she read, or the film she saw, or the person she's lately been taking apart and analyzing psychologically.  Virgos love to talk about other people, in great detail.  So if you're after the beautiful, silent type, forget it.<br><br>Virgo women also have a sometimes admirable, sometimes infuriating propensity to question your word and your knowledge, too.  Tell her something and she'll ask the source, complete with footnotes.  Virgo tends to believe not to believe anybody else until the definitive reference work becomes available.  It's hard to be more knowledgeable than a Virgo, because they won't allow it.  It's got a good and bad side.  It does wonders for your intellectual scope, and horrors for your ego.<br><br>Many Virgo women come close to the figure of the Earth Mother, because the peculiar sensitivity of the sign expresses itself through a love of nature and a healing and skillful touch with all crafts.  It seems to be a typical Virgo skill to have a 'knack' with handicrafts of all kinds.  The arts for their own sake rarely attract Virgo, because things must be useful to be relevant.  But the Virgo woman displays immense skill at gardening, and craftsmanship in many areas.  And the quality of needing to be needed which attracts so many Virgos into the helping professions, from nursing to dieticians to psychologists and counselors, is very much an aspect of the Great Mother archetype which is connected with the sign.<br><br>The thing is, you often have to find it behind the high-strung nervous system, the edginess, the need for solitude, the apparent coolness and detachment.  It's hard for a Virgo woman to be spontaneous.  Often she can only show love and affection by doing physical things for you.  The situation applies here as to the Virgo male:  emotion and passion are disturbing and frightening, and can only be expressed in an atmosphere of complete trust.  Break that trust and you'll get the sarcastic, cutting edge of the Virgo tongue, which can be really vicious because she's been observing with minute care all the weaknesses and foibles which you didn't think anybody noticed.  Virgo women have a disconcerting habit of noticing the carefully hidden frayed cuff, the razor nick, the scuffed shoe, the word-slip, the nervous twitch you thought you were controlling.  They observe minute things because for Virgo the vast spectrum of life is best reflected in the small.  For the Virgo woman, the great art is the art of the small.<br><br>It may be appropriate to remind you again of those Virgos who are anything but tight-lipped spinstership shrews:  the Greta Garbos and Sophia Lorens and Jacqueline Bissetts of the world.  But you can see a thread which runs through these women as well as every other Virgo woman, from Lauren Bacall (another Virgo) to Twiggy.  Notice the attention given to skill.  Whatever Virgo does, it does well, and Virgo women are no exception.  These are skilled actresses, with polish and impeccable performance.  Whether cooking or sculpting or teaching or whatever, Virgo women take pride in their skill.  Appreciate it and you'll earn her warmth.  Ignore it or undervalue it, and you've made a ghastly mistake.  And if you're one of those men who doesn't think it's appropriate for a woman to be skilled in anything except pleasing a man, you're courting real trouble with a Virgo woman.<br><br>Curiously, Virgo needs lots of respect - a need which isn't always evident in the other signs, which are less likely to identify with their skills.  Also notice the quality of cool self-containment about these women.  Married or not, they all radiate some mysterious aloofness which is not so much a 'keep out' sign as a 'welcome, but respect my separateness'.  It's evident even in the heat of sexual passion or intense emotion with Virgo.  Self-contained.  If you can learn to deal with the shadowy side, the know-it-all quality, the occasional fits of ordering and tidying either the environment or you, then you can reach the other side of Virgo.  Isn't it nice to be able to appreciate someone who is capable of being her own person?  While all women, and all people, ultimately strive for this, Virgo makes a career and sometimes an art of it.<br><br>Virgo won't adore you blindly.  She'll more likely love you for your flaws and imperfections, because she's a realist and also it makes her feel needed.  And it can either terrify a man into running eighty miles an hour in the opposite direction, or it can be a wonderful cooling bath to actually be able to be yourself.  But then, it depends on the sort of man you are, doesn't it?<br></div>

Too bad most of them don't.<br><br>The majority of them climb grumpily out on the wrong side of the bed and slump into the kitchen, groping for their prune juice (Nature's remedies, you see, are always best for aiding regularity. There's always the danger that laxatives might be habit forming, which could lead to serious dependency.)<br><br>Unfortunately, the negative thoughts and nagging worries two Virgos carefully fold and place at the bottom of their minds with pure intent the night before, have a way of popping right back up to say 'Boo!' to them next morning, getting tangled with their prettier, positive thoughts for each other... perhaps because they weren't folded quite small enough, or perhaps because both Virgos are reluctant to close the drawer on trouble, preferring to leave it open just a crack, so they can peek periodically and count the exact number of their current crop of problems. Virgos treat these problems like they treat their houseplants - with constant, dutiful attention, never forgetting to water them, the latter with distilled H2O, the former with distilled tears. Naturally, given such tender, loving care, both will sprout quickly, grow profusely, and need frequent pruning.<br><br>Now, we'll get right along with the analysis of the VIRRGO-VERGO relationship.  But first let me say to any Virgos reading this chapter - and to any Sun Sign people with the Moon or Ascendant in VIRAGO, that if my prayer is, perchance, not completely answered, one hundred percent, it could be some sort of subtle message from the Universe that God isn't as interested in how we spell His name, as in the love and tolerance and forgiveness we show toward one another's goofs and mistakes.  You know what I mean?<br><br>It's a good and necessary thing for language to be spoken, written, and printed in the most correct form, whenever possible, to avoid misunderstandings in human communication, which is difficult enough at best.  Nevertheless, the kindness to overlook the unintentional mistakes of others is also a good and necessary thing.  It is, in fact, as St. ExupÃ©ry's Little Prince would say, 'a matter of great consequence.'<br><br>Two Virgos who are associated as friends, business associates, relatives, or lovers are often compelled to measure one another's every emotion, action, and response - to spell out every opinion and reaction, using the unabridged dictionary of their own or society's preconceived standards of perfection.  And that's a terrible waste of time, which could be better spent flying kites, making snowmenÂ… installing waterless toilets to save our streams and rivers and oceans from final extinction and pollutionÂ… rescuing kitties and puppies and baby monkeys from Washington's HEW-funded vivisectionists, who torture them so cruellyÂ… running with the wind in your hairÂ… wading in a rippling brookÂ… or weaving dreams, which are the true realities.<br><br>Someone needs to point out gently to Virgos (and a fair scattering of Librans too) that logic isn't the god it appears to be, for logic implies a dangerous fallacy:  the assumption that what never has been can therefore never be - and the converse assumption - that what has always been therefore must always be.<br><br>The word 'therefore' is the tool of logic that can be put even the most alert player behind in a cosmic anagram game of enlightenment.  Not always, but frequently, the word 'therefore' is a warning signal to an open mind that someone is about to snap it shut, lock it, and throw away the key - more in error than such blanket assumptions of half-blind logic, born of the fallacies of preconditioned thinking.  Such unquestioning acceptance makes us all vulnerable to the madmen whose goal it is to control the individual human mind (and eventually the masses) through various forms of drugs and hypnosis - and subliminal messages flashed on television, too swift for the human eye to see, but not too swift to seed into the subconscious.<br></div>
