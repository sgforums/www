He's also the original male chauvinist, because you have to hit him with a veritable brick to remind him that his protection and interference may not be welcome.  And you have to virtually turn him inside out to get him to notice that you can protect yourself.<br><br>Now, many women don't particularly want to protect themselves, or they are smart enough to know that they can do it quietly without bruising that rather fragile Arien ego.  No question about it, Aries has an eggshell ego, to use the phrase coined by Beata Bishop in Below the Belt.  He's as male as male can be:  the original macho man.  He often feels obliged to keep this image up even when he doesn't feel very macho:  knights get tired too, and cranky, and hurt, and vulnerable, but there too, you never hear about it.  Nobody ever describes Sir Lancelot when he has a head cold and needs cosseting.  So the Aries man often pushes himself beyond his own limits trying so hard to be the ideal image of male.  It helps him a lot to relax and recognize that he's human too.  But Aries has a lot of difficulty acknowledging his own humanity, because he's so caught up in the world of myth.<br><br>He's capable of alternating between grand gestures of generosity that are downright poetic and hard to beat, and some pretty crude insensitivity and trampling of others' feelings.  When he's bad-tempered, he doesn't realize how he can injure others who are more sensitive, and when he's on his hobby-horse, he expects everybody around to believe so totally in what he's doing that they should drop their own goals and visions.  But if you do believe in his dreams, he's an unflinching friend and will defend you and protect you literally to the grave.<br><br>What you may have to suffer most with an Aries man is the queer feeling that the goddess he worships, the princess he adores, is some vague glimmering figure just behind your left shoulder.  When you try to tell him you're human, individual, he often can't see.  Aries is prone to idealization of women.  The Eternal Feminine is very much a reality to him, and he perceives and generally loves it as well as desiring it.  But the individual personal qualities of a particular woman are not always so noticeable.  He generally likes what he considers to be feminine women, and he's inclined to stereotype them, just as he's inclined to stereotype himself into the macho-role.  It's hard to bring him down to earth enough to let the outlines of two people emerge from all the mythologizing.  And sometimes - if he's a more extreme fiery type - the outline of the real person is disturbing, and can send him off on the next quest.  It's easier to be in love with an ideal image than a real woman, because the real woman needs to be related to as an individual.  That means slowing down and seeing, considering, feeling, adjusting.  We've already mentioned that Aries is not particularly gifted at the art of adjustment.<br><br>With Aries, there's no lack of passion.  And no lack of romance either.  This isn't generally a once-every-Saturday-at-ten man.  Aries can be a Don Juan or a Casanova, but he certainly isn't a quotidian lover.  You must appreciate his romance and play to it.  Too much realism kills his fire, and too much routine crushes his spirit.<br><br>Aries likes to sweep women off their feet.  This may be basic and physical, or it may be subtle or intellectual.  He also loves to play Pygmalion - change you, create you, fill you with his ideas, stimulate your intellect.  Many Aries men love to believe that they begin with unshaped clay and create a goddess.  Pygmalion was undoubtedly an Aries.  Once again, if you're strongly feminist, this can be annoying.<br><br>If you're comfortable with yourself and don't need to prove the point, it can be amusing, charming, touching, endearing, and still annoying.  The trouble with being the object of Pygmalion's endeavours is that, while you retain the shape he's sculpted, he's fine; but if you develop any ornament or quality which wasn't in his design, he can be hurt and offended and, yes, threatened.<br><br>The truth is that Aries is a very vulnerable sign when it comes to relationships with women.  There is an amusing film which Clint Eastwood starred in and directed called Every Which Way But Loose.  The hero, like all Clint Eastwood heroes, is the original macho man - who is tough but sensitive, strong but poetic, able to beat all the bad guys but still capable of tenderness towards old ladies and pets and able to appreciate the scent of summer flowers.  He's completely duped and mashed about by a hooker disguised as damsel-in-distress.  She looks so frail, so needful, so injured, so abused.  She really wants a little money and then a quick farewell.  His look of baffled injury at the end of the film is a classic Arien look.  Yet it's his own lack of insight, and his blind persistence in taking the feminine at face value as an image rather than seeing and understanding the actual woman, that is responsible for the mess.  Because he's so vulnerable to Woman, he often has to be a little heavy-handed to women.  This is a paradox peculiar to the fiery signs, and in particular to Aries.<br><br>On the other hand, the Aries man has one superb quality which should be emphasized again and again.  He loves change, and that includes changing himself.  Although capable of arrogance, petulance and downright bloody-mindedness, he's never complacent.  This means that, if he can understand that a relationship is a thing which grows and changes and needs insight and attention, he'll happily make that his cause.  And then you get all the benefit of the best side of the Knight in Shining Armour.  And they are, truly, sadly needed these days.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aries<br>If he can't find a crisis, he'll make one.</strong><br><br>Let's begin our description of Aries with a little scenario, which will illustrate some of the qualities of this first of the fiery signs.  The scenario might be entitled the Knight in Shining Armour Syndrome.  It can be found in both male and female Ariens - although in the case of Aries women, it might be subtitled the Joan of Arc syndrome.<br><br>ARIES:  (to friend)  I notice you're smoking.  I suppose you realize that it would kill you?  Give you lung cancer, heart disease, arteriosclerosis, emphysemaÂ…<br>FRIEND:  Thanks, I've read all the literature.  But I still think I prefer to smoke.  Now about those books you were talking aboutÂ….<br>ARIES:  Wait a minute.  Have you really read the literature?  Look, I don't mean to sound pushy, but really, it's for your own good.  I mean, I'm really concerned about this smoking issue.  Every time I take a train or ride in a tube, and I see all these people smokingÂ…I've started a group in my area called Death to Smoking committee.  We're doing a quiet little street demonstration in front of all the local tobacco shops.  I figure if we put enough pressure on maybe they'll get some sense in their heads.<br>FRIEND:  (Lighting up a cigarette in annoyance)  Did it ever occur to you that people may like to choose whether they smoke or not?  We're adults, you know.<br>ARIES:  But I know what's best for everybody.  You say you're adult, you can choose, but have you really read the literature?<br><br>The subject might be smoking, or anything small or great which concerns the public weal.  Give him a mission, a cause, a battle in which he can trounce the enemy, an evil which he can challenge, and out comes that old suit of armour, kept clean and polished in case of emergency.  We don't know whether Joan of Arc was really an Aries or not.  The date of her birth is lost.  But her absolute conviction, her courage, her bravery, her fanaticism, her vision, her devotion to the cause of the French nation, and her defense of the underdog - an important point, that last one - make her pretty Arien.  You may notice the emphasis on championing the underdog.  Aries just doesn't feel really right unless there's an underdog to take care of.  If we ever really enter a truly utopian society, Aries will be in a sorry state, because he lives and breathes for the great battle.  And the great battle must have an ideal.  Remember that Aries is a fire sign, and all fire signs tend to mythologize life.<br><br>The ideal justifies the battle, brings out his courage, draws forth his genius at quick action.  And the ideal, ideally should be the protection or defence of the weak, the downtrodden, the abandoned.  Joan of Arc could hardly have become the mythological figure she did without having a poor neglected wreck of a disinherited king to defend.  That was what gave her cause pathos and meaning.  The restoration of the lost king to his kingdom, the return of justice.  Does it all sound a little fast and furious for ordinary life?  Never mind.  Aries doesn't really believe in ordinary life.  There may not be anymore lost kinds to restore to their kingdoms (although one never knows), but Aries can find a cause in social welfare, in any form of life or human expression which is overlooked, underestimated, or neglected, or hasn't a chance.  Aries is the natural enemy of collectivization, because collectivization destroys myths and takes away the whole drama of the oppressor and the oppressed.<br><br>There is definitely a chivalric quality about Aries.  Not that he's unsophisticated; some of the most polished, brilliant, intellectually aware statesmen and thinkers are Ariens.  But deep in the Aries soul, the age of Courtly Love isn't over.  He's still looking around for the knightly order, the Round Table which can join to declare himself a True and Devoted Knight, and also for the damsel in distress that he can rescue.  You might notice that Aries is very concerned for damsels in distress.  Half the fun of a relationship for Aries is the whole chivalrous display of the rescue.  Then the knight rides away again, of course.  Knights never stay home and fix the fuses in their castles.  They need adventure; otherwise they go pale and lifeless and distressed.  And Aries needs adventure.  It might be making money, or establishing a school, or developing any new idea which is bound to change or alter the world around him.  But adventure he must have.  Contentment and serenity and sameness give him psychic indigestion.<br><br>The ruler of Aries is the planet Mars, the mythological god of war and passion.  All his qualities, when you read about them in such sources as the Iliad, sound like Aries exaggerated.  He's courageous to the point of foolhardiness, and his courage is mixed with the liberal dash of personal glamour.  (Behind-the-scenes courage is more a Scorpio trait, the darker face of Mars).  If you read history, you will come across some interesting descriptions of the age of chivalry, and one of the most interesting is the Hundred Years War.  The flower of French knighthood lost some disastrous battles at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt.  They all behaved like Ariens.  There was no discipline in the French ranks, largely because each knight was so committed to his own honour and prowess that he couldn't receive orders from a superior.  They fought constantly among themselves, because there was no real spirit of cooperation; every knight was a nobleman, and every nobleman an autocrat.  They overweighed themselves with flamboyant armour and banners to the point where if a knight fell off his horse there was no way he could get up again without the help of a couple of squires - or a crane, which hadn't been invented yet.  Notice the Aries trait?  Naturally the English armies, much better disciplined although far less colourful, mowed them down.  Not all Ariens get mowed down, of course.  But often this quality of foolhardiness takes a few years before it's tempered by the realities of life.  Ariens tend to grow up late.  It takes a few hard knocks and a few confrontations with other people's stubborn resistance to teach them that it can't all happen right this minute according to their own unique creative vision.<br><br>Aries will always behave with honour toward both friend and enemy alike; he will be generous and loyal to his friends, and, although scathingly contemptuous, will rarely stoop to revenge or petty behaviour toward his enemies.  He does tend to make a few enemies, though, and not just because he's inclined to be rash and impulsive.  He also inspires a kind of mean jealousy in other people, because in one way or another he's just a little larger than life.  He tends to mythologize himself, and act accordingly.  There is also a strong streak of impatience bordering on arrogance in Aries; he doesn't suffer fools gladly, or insubordination, or slowness, or stupidity, or indirectness.  In fact, he just doesn't suffer gladly at all, unless it's noble suffering.<br><br>Like all the fiery signs, Aries is a child at heart.  This sometimes means he can be childish; at other times it means he's childlike in the most spirited, warm-hearted way.  He can get wildly excited and heated up over things which other, more jaded souls simply miss or overlook; no matter how old he is, from six to eighty, he can still throw himself into his work or his special projects with enthusiasm and energy.  Many Ariens are so infuriatingly energetic that you get tired just watching them.  They rush about with eighteen irons in the fire, all heating, as though they had some kind of invisible pill which made it unnecessary to eat, sleep, rest or contemplate.  This quality of dynamic energy is one of the most noticeable things about Aries.<br><br>That, and the fact that he's usually in a hurry from the living room to the kitchen.  He must have movement and colour and life around him, because he gets bored easily.  Then you get the notorious Aries querulousness, the irritability and edginess and bad temper which often flare up.  Now, the Aries temper can be a little frightening.  Have you ever tried confronting Mars on the battlefield?  But it helps to remember that for Aries, gestures are stylized and often dramatized.  All that fire and smoke and explosion is like a child throwing a tantrum.  If he's really, really angry he won't explode so much; he'll just quietly move to destroy what's in his way.  But the temper is just that - temper.  And once it blows over, Aries hold no grudges.  He's too chivalrous for one thing, and too absent-minded for another.  It just isn't that important.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I had an Aries client who once told me about his behaviour in childhood.  He said that when he wanted his mother to buy him something - a coveted toy, or a sweet - and she had the bad manners to refuse, he had a simple tactic that always worked wonders.  He would throw a tantrum right on the street in front of the shop.  Not a yelling tantrum, either - all kids do that, and Aries isn't all kids.  He would announce in his most heraldic voice, 'I'm going to hold my breath until I turn blue.'  And he would do just that - prone on the sidewalk, where everyone would have to stop and crowd around to see what had happened to the poor child.  His mother, naturally, never waited to see whether he really turned blue.  Also, she obviously didn't know anatomy, or the fact that if he did fall unconscious he would, of course, begin to breathe again.  She simply bought the toy or the sweet.  Cowed by the god of war, every time.<br><br>Naturally one thinks these things end with childhood.  But my Aries client made it painfully obvious that although the nature of the tantrum had changed - after all, who would fall for a forty-five-year-old man saying he was going to hold his breath until he turned blue? - the tactics were the same.  He had everyone in his household benignly terrorized.  But usually Ariens contrive to get everyone else to do what they want.  And their approach isn't subtle.  No emotional blackmail like Cancer, or long strategic planning with deals and financial viable pressures, like Capricorn.  Or gentle, diplomatic statesmanship in the spirit of cooperation, like Libra.  No, Aries has a simple approach.  'Do it.'  If you don't, you get the tantrum, in one form or another - maybe a slammed door and an evening of frosty silence, or a harangue, or a few smashed plates.<br><br>One way to describe Aries is self-willed.  He's unquestionably unaware, a good deal of the time, of the fact that other people might wish to pull in a different direction.  It's hard for Aries to understand compromise and cooperation.  When he's fired up about something, nothing else seems as right, as true, or as relevant.  He's dogmatic.  That means that he simply doesn't notice conflicting opinions, unless you shout them at him.  And then he's often genuinely hurt that you think he's being selfish or egocentric.  In fact he's no more selfish than anybody else, and frequently less so.  Because he tends to be generous to a fault, he's an easy prey for a sad story, and can be easily taken advantage of.  He's also not a particularly astute judge of character, since he's not a suspicious type and will usually believe the best about people until unpleasantly surprised.  Disloyalty, backstabbing, and meanness of any kind can really bewilder and wound him.  It's just that he tends to be a little oblivious to the facts of situations, since he lives in his world of ideals.  What he sees isn't how things are.  It's how they could and should be.  And even if everybody else is too tired or too jaded or too apathetic to do anything about it, Aries will go out there alone if necessary (he prefers support, but can do without it) and fight the dragon.  And doesn't demand repayment for it either.  A little applause, appreciation, perhaps.  But no strings are attached to his gifts.<br><br>Trying to live with an Aries can often be difficult, if you're the type who likes the status quo to remain the same and the partner unchanging.  Aries needs action; he needs something to pour his splendid energies into, something that stimulates him and has open possibilities.  Ariens do not work well as complacent employees for strong bosses.  They need scope and challenge and plenty of personal freedom to follow their visions without interference.<br><br>Now, there is a type of Arien who suppresses all this, just as anyone can suppress the natural qualities of his nature.  You might see a meek, mild, docile Arien led along by a powerful wife or husband, or kept in his place by a powerful employer.  All that fire goes inside, and eats at him from within.  Headaches are a common Arien symptom, when the anger goes inside.  You can't expect the god of war to be happy tending geraniums in the greenhouse.  He'll either tear himself apart, or make life miserable for everybody else instead.<br><br>Not all Ariens display the physical prowess of the mythological Mars, although a lot are fond of sports and physical competition.  The spirit of competition and winning is there, but it may be on an intellectual level instead.  Many Ariens seem to have this quality of dynamic energy in the mental realm, and whether they are scholars, philosophers, prophets, artists, religious leaders or one kind or another, you are immediately impressed by the vivid life of their minds.  They love mental challenge, difficult problems, impenetrable texts which they can battle.  Don't think all Ariens wear armour and ride horses physically.  Some do it very unobtrusively.  But watch out for the glint of the steel cuirass someplace.  You'll always find it.<br><br>Like all the fire signs, Aries has a problem coping with the facts of the situation he finds himself in.  Some Ariens are terribly impractical, about very mundane things - like food, money, taxes.  Some are sufficiently protected by an army of secretaries, agents, cleaning ladies et al. so they appear to be models of efficiency when in fact, if left alone with their own resources, they would make a hopeless muddle of the material world.  Some are a little better with the things of this world, but are oblivious to the limitations of things.  For Aries, anything is possible.  Of course, anything isn't possible.  But you can't tell an Aries that; he'll simply think you're cowardly, unimaginative, frightened or weak, and walk away to prove that it can be done.  And he gets himself into a lot of trouble as often as he wins honours and accomplishes the impossible at the same time.<br><br>One of Aries' most dangerous problems is that he can be easily disillusioned and made bitter.  Because his reality is so often tinted by the values of the chivalric code, he may be injured over and over again by other people who refuse to recognize the code themselves.  Aries doesn't compromise gracefully with either people of life.  And if he's unlucky, or pushes too hard, or has visions which are too wild or impossible, he can wind up in a very bitter state.  He needs more than anything else, to learn to see people as they are and to let them remain as they are without crusading.  Conquering the infidel didn't work in the thirteenth century; it's certainly not going to work in the twentieth.  It's important for Aries to learn balance, a happy medium between his noble visions of how the world might be and the limitations not only of himself but of the times he lives in.  If he can find this balance, he sets his aims low enough to be achievable, without abandoning them to the kind of black despair which overwhelmed the knights when the Holy Land was lost.<br><br>A strange creature, our fiery Aries.  He's capable of profound thought and considerable tenderness; but without warning he'll be leaping on his feet again to stir up another crusade.  Life is certainly not boring with an Aries.  If he can't find a crisis, he'll make one.  There's a certain mischievous streak in him too; he'll poke and goad people and situations which are too staid, too prissy, too stagnant, until the whole thing burst into a conflagration.  He, of course, is out the door first, so that he never gets burned - or almost never.  But Aries can be a tease, a gadfly nibbling away at whatever has grown fat and complacent and too sure of itself.  He likes to play the role of the Devil's advocate, and doesn't mind having everybody else thoroughly annoyed at him for doing it.  At least it generates a little action; and action, for Aries, is synonymous with life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Aries Lover</strong><br><br>Aries in love is what you would, of course, expect.  Love is Courtly Love, and Knights in Shining Armour--don't love either meanly or half-heartedly.  Often, however, they love the shining ideal, rather than the actual princess who may be a little hot and uncomfortable sitting and watching that bloody joust set up in her honour.<br><br>To Aries, half the joy of love is the pursuit.  It might be said that for many Ariens, love is the pursuit, rather than the arrival or the catch.  Have you ever looked at medieval tapestries of the hunt?  It's the hunt in every possible form--the horns, the dogs, the wonderful horses, the ladies in their towering headdressesÂ…but never the catch.  What would be the point of a tapestry showing the catch?  How boring, how banal.  Once caught, it's eaten, or hung on the wall as a trophy.  The hunter is already, from the moment of success, contemplating the next hunt.<br><br>Some Ariens follow this pattern very closely in their relationships.  This is why it's often a good idea to be a little reluctant in the face of the chivalrous Aries pursuit.  You must know how to play the game.  Courtly Love is a remarkable stylized ritual form of human relationship.  The handsome, young knight falls in love, always, with an Unobtainable Lady.  The obtainable ones are in his life, of course - they may be his wife.  But they don't really count.  It's what he can't have that he truly loves and adores.  He writes her poetry, paints her miniatures, sings her troubadour songs, disguises himself as a poor minstrel so that she can throw him a rose from her balcony.  He pines and mourns and watches the moon a lot, and spends lots of time wandering through forests in a kind of sad languorous melancholy.  He wears her colours at the joust, and offers his life to perform deeds of terrible danger on her behalf.  Eventually, it's hoped, the lady is won.  But you never hear about what happens afterward.<br><br>It's not that Aries is incapable of either loyalty or fidelity or a constant relationship.  It's just that he tends to get a little fidgety if the relationship never changes or provides him with any challenge or conflict.  It may seem, knowing the Arien character, that this extremely masculine sign wants a passive, frail, submissive partner - of either sex.  Not true.  Those happen often enough, but they're practice runs.  Aries will stick when he's found a relationship he can't completely dominate.  So, submissive souls, take warning.<br><br>Aries, like the other two fiery signs, Leo and Sagittarius, is a born romantic.  The more prosaic aspects of love don't really interest him, like grilling fish together over the fireplace.  Unless the fireplace happens to be a snowbound cottage in the Alps and the rescue team won't arrive for three days, or the fish has just been caught at enormous risk from a capsized yacht where you both had to swim like mad holding the fish between you to reach the shore.  As soon as things lapse into routine, Aries - male or female - starts to yawn.  Now it may seem an impossible task to always provide excitement and stimulus to an Aries mate.  It doesn't actually mean you have to provide the stimulus.  It does mean that you have to be careful not to try to tame the urge for excitement and change and challenge, physical or mental.  And it means having your own life and your own interests, so that he - or she - never feels you're totally and utterly a possession.  At that moment, the rot sets in.<br><br>One way or another, you won't be bored.  Unless you have one of those completely repressed Ariens who have turned all their energy and dynamism inside against themselves.  Aries is never boring.  And even the injured, introverted Arien isn't; even his neurosis is interesting, if taxing.  If you want a stolid, placid, contented mate, stay away from Aries.  His business is not contentment.  It's challenge.  Try a Taurus or a Cancer.  Otherwise you might get burned.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Aries Woman</strong><br><br>It isn't the easiest thing in the world to be an Aries woman- in a world which burns Joan of Arc.  The attitude which prevailed in Joan's time is not over yet.  When you read the judgments and pronouncements of her contemporaries on her, you find an astonishing thing:  what really upset everybody about Joan wasn't her visions, her charisma, her wild myth, her drama, her strange capacity to predict victories.  It was her insistence on dressing in masculine garb.  Virtually every pronouncement against her mentions this, as the worst, the most unforgivable of her sins.<br><br>The Aries woman, however feminine she is, however devoted a wife and mother, also needs a crusade.  She needs challenge too, and projects which stimulate and inspire her, and a cause to follow, and a goal to reach.  She also needs to feel she is doing something to promote change and progress, on however small a level.  Aries women are naturals for executive positions and positions of leadership, because their strength, courage, directness, and conviction give them both personal charisma and authority.  They are action people.  You can't expect them to sit quietly behind the typewriter, or in the kitchen baking bread twenty-four hours a day.  In a way, the world is only just becoming able to accommodate the clear fire of the Aries woman.  Traditional astrological interpretations in the past have emphasized her masculine qualities as though these took away from the essential femaleness.<br><br>Aries is not, of course, the type of woman who fulfills the fantasies of the lovers of geisha girls in paradise.  She is not likely to be pliable, submissive, and an empty vessel into which a man can project all his fantasies.  She is not likely to hero-worship or smile sweetly when her mate is behaving insufferably.  She's more likely to argue, shout, show a temper tantrum, storm out of the house, or place her own career first.  And quite rightly for her, for this is a spirited sign which has suffered from the weight of social conditioning placed upon it.<br>Aries may not be also particularly maternal.  Mars-ruled, her energy may need direction through other kinds of creativity.  Often Aries women, if they are mothers, are dedicated and devoted, but essentially impatient and much better as companions and friends when the children are older.  They lack the quietness and capacity to put up with noise and confusion which needs to be present along with the love in the early years of a child's life.  They are also apt to push the child, if it is moving in the direction contrary to the parent's wishes.  But Aries women, as mothers, have the unique virtue of not being likely to live their own lives through their children.  This is an inestimable gift.  It spares the psyche of the child, so that it can develop as itself.<br><br>You might say, and of course there are exceptions among individual Ariens, that the Aries woman is a much better mistress than she is a wife.  This is because she must have romance and a certain amount of challenge in her relationships.  And she is also sometimes ferociously independent, and all too likely to attract an easily dominated mate looking for a Joan of Arc.<br><br>The chief difficulty with the Aries woman in relationships is her competitiveness.  She is apt to see a man as not only a challenge, but a fellow contestant.  One-upmanship can be a real problem for the Aries woman, and her natural egocentricity can also be a terrific bruise.  It isn't any worse in the Aries woman than it is in the Aries man.  But it seems that the male ego, at this stage of our development, is less equipped to cope with an Aries assault than the female, which has a few thousand years of practice.<br><br>The Aries woman is also apt to try to take over and change her loved ones.  This kind of interference - known popularly as bossiness - is amusing to some people and infuriating to others.  It depends on your taste, and on whether or not you can deal with it productively.  Better to fight it, because Aries understands a good fight where she doesn't understand sly inferences and undercurrents and subtle emotional pressures.  Often the Aries woman is defenceless against the veiled barb, the indirect hostility; this is why she is often a much better friend of men than of women.  It is typical of Aries women to prefer the company of men.  In part, it's because she's peculiarly inept at the little undercurrents, subtle jealousies, and inferences which are so much a part of the shadow sides of women's friendships.  In part, it's because there's always the sparkle of the challenge and the flirtation of her.<br><br>This woman is noble, and has a noble spirit.  She can be extremely difficult to live with and relate to, for all the reasons we've discussed.  Unlike the Leo woman, who prefers the role of the queen, or the Sagittarian woman, who prefers the role of the hetaera, Aries is capable of tremendous loyal commitment.  She will fight for those she loves, devote herself to them, work for them, believe in them, inspire them.  She's capable of being side by side on the battlefield while preserving her innate femaleness.  Men with fragile egos which need cosseting, stay away.  I have a good friend married to an Aries woman who once, after discussing some trivial complaint about her bossiness, said, 'There isn't anybody like her in the world.  I would never want to leave her.  It's because she's herself, her own person.  She's doing something with her life.  She's interesting and exciting.  I admire and respect her.'  If you are the sort of man who is reluctant to offer admiration and respect to a strong woman, try another sign.  But you'd be missing an awful lot.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Scorpio Men (Why they are weird)</strong><br><br><strong>'If only I had a little humility, I would be perfect.' Ted Turner (Born November 19)</strong><br><br>Whether he is tall, dark, and handsome or short, blond, and chubby, a Scorpio man is idealistic, passionate, and loyal. He will mesmerise you with his candid, purposeful stare and capture your heart with his magnetic charm. He may be as cuddly as Sinbad, or as sexy as Leonardo DiCaprio; wear a white collar, a blue collar, or no collar at all; but here is the man who is impossible to resist. Think you've hit the jackpot? Think again, sweetheart.<br><br>Loving a male Scorpion is like falling for King Kong. Oh, he's sexy and, underneath that aloof exterior, surprisingly sensitive. Of course, that titbit of knowledge may not help when you are handed divorce papers because you said his best friend was a low-life slob. Other guys might sit down to discuss their feelings. Mr Intense will sit down and rip yours to shreds.<br><br>He is selfish. Never mind that you are married to him or in a serious relationship. The Scorpion's idea of commitment is showing up for dinner most of the time. His emotion switch is set at sub-zero, and he won't hesitate to be unfaithful until he's dead. However, contrary to popular belief, he is not sex-crazed. That trait belongs to cousin Aries. Scorpio is terrified of deep emotional dependence on just one person, so, in his usual ass-backward way, he screws around precisely to avoid intimacy.<br><br>A male Scorpion has two reasons for living. The first is power. The second is control. He would control fate if he could - and some try. He will usually be a good provider because his desire for power and control drives him to become successful in his chosen profession. But money is rarely his primary motivation. Financial gain is only a by-product of becoming Mr Big. His moods change faster than a Pisces flipping the remote, and he will test your love by demanding the devotion of a religious fanatic at a revival meeting. He's so jealous, possessive, and sarcastic that you will be tempted to poison his oatmeal. There's no handling a Scorpion. You either put up with him or run like hell.<br><br>Deliberately awaken this man's green-eyed monster, and you better have a shovel handy. You are going to need it to either defend yourself or dig your own grave. Remember this before you are foolish enough to plunge into an affair, or worse, a legally-binding relationship.<br><br>The worst thing you can do to a Scorpio man is to not react to his emotional intimidation tactics. If he demands to be alone, applaud. Curb his sarcasm with a yawn. If he says he wants an open marriage, tell him you thought you already had one. When he announces he's going out without you, tell him to have a good time, then smile as if you know something he doesn't. He'll pretend to leave, park around the block, and sneak back to lurk in the bushes, convinced that you are cheating on him. He's as obtuse as Taurus when he thinks he's right and will stand in a rainstorm all night, muttering to himself, while you are cosy by the fireplace.<br><br>He communicates by threat. The foremost one is that he's leaving you. He also lies. The only thing harder to rid yourself of than a Scorpio man is a Cancer woman. A male Scorpion frequently looks like he just ate a cactus. That's because he spends half his life getting even for some real, or imagined, slight and the other half causing all his own troubles.<br><br>Yours will be so secretive that he would rather have his fingernails pulled out than tell you what he had for lunch. He's morbidly afraid that if he dares to share any serious facts, or fears, you may get the upper hand. That's why he's so good at small talk. He can blather for hours about every piece of minutiae in the world, but ask him a direct question, and he will clam up and rush outside to mow the lawn.<br><br>Your home will be either near water or hidden in a cul-de-sac behind a tall fence. He would live in a place that's accessible only by helicopter, except that it would screw up his Thursday-night dates with the cocktail waitress at the local bar. If you do catch him between the wrong pair of sheets, he will put on such a display of grovelling, whining, and begging, that you might think he has suffered a breakdown. Don't be fooled. He thrives on intensity and is as much masochist as manipulator. He will do anything it takes at that moment to gain your forgiveness, except change. Scorpio is fixed water. He exists in a bottomless well of churning emotional excess and is so embroiled in trying to figure out his own emotions that he will never understand yours. Being sucked into the vortex of his charm is akin to getting lost in the Bermuda Triangle. You may or may not survive the trip.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Taurus<br>You just can't remove the sheen of the good earth on him.  </strong><br><br>Ferdinand the Bull, in the famous children's story, is a lovable creature.  He amuses himself by smelling the flowers, listening to the birdsong, enjoying the summer breezes.  He doesn't do very much, our Ferdinand; but he's easily contented, and at home in his pasture.  Then one day he sits on a flower, and on the flower is a beeÂ…  Well, you can work out the rest.  Ferdinand the Bull is a perfect Taurean.  And the story of many Taureans' lives run along those lines - the contentment of the field and the flowers; but there is always that damned bee.<br><br>Taurus, the Bull, is ruled by the planet Venus.  In mythology, Venus is the goddess of love and beauty.  She's also the most indolent of all the Olympian deities, preferring her considerable pleasures to the nuisance of hard work.  All this describes very nicely one side of the Taurean nature.  A few words encapsulate it.  Peace, serenity, pleasure, calm, stability, placidity.  The famous patience of the Bull isn't so much patience built upon discipline and cynicism, as is Capricorn's.  It's the patience of nature, of the earth itself, serene and living each day for the pleasures it holds, while tomorrow - so long as it can be guaranteed that tomorrow will be the same as today - is forgotten.<br><br>There are other sides to Taurus, of course.  In a sense, you can place Taureans at one of two phases in their lives:  before and after that most dreaded aspect of life to Taurus, the thing that goes innately against the grain - change.<br><br>Among the traditional associations to Taurus is the realm of material stability and security.  And there's no doubt about it, Taurus likes his security in tangible, unchangeable forms - like gold bullion, or valuable antique furniture, or a really superb Ferrari.  Abstract wealth, tied up in investments, or wealth of a non-corporal kind (like knowledge, self-understanding, friends, and other less graspable commodities) is not really wealth to a Taurus.  Security is what you can trust.  What you can trust is what doesn't change, corrode, leave you, disappear, or depend upon others for its value.  Once he has it, he can relax.  Often he relaxes so much that he barely moves again.<br><br>There's another aspect to this security-building impulse in Taurus.  This has to do with Taurus' way of looking at life.  When we discuss the element of earth in general, we mentioned that it had to do with dealing with reality - concrete, tangible reality.  Taurus, the first of the earthy signs, excels at this 'realistic' viewpoint.  Taurus is never foolishly idealistic.  Never naÃ¯ve about the requirements and demands of ordinary life.  A true Taurus always has one eye cocked toward how he can sustain and preserve himself in life.  He's always realistic in his goals, always setting them where he can fulfill them.  Taken by itself, Taurus isn't an ambitious sign.  He can quite happily remain the unseen power behind the scenes:  the investor, the accountant, the one who keeps the business running without getting the public laurels.  Taurus is realistic enough to know that you can't eat laurels, and they won't fix a leaky roof.<br><br>The other side of the coin with this great realism is that Taurus often misses what's not visible to his earthy eye.  He values simplicity and basic facts; but many aspects of life are neither simple nor reducible to formulae.  We might call this the Boring Pragmatist syndrome.  He's boring largely because, if he can't hold it in the palm of his hand, he has nothing to say about the matter, let alone any appreciation for its nuances.  Never mind all those hyacinths for the soul.  A scenario might run like this:<br><br>FRIEND TO TAURUS:  I have the most wonderful idea.  You know that novel I was working on?  Well, I thought it might go really well as a film script.  All the battle scenes staged at night, with torchlight and bonfires and stuffÂ…really dramatic!  And the fifteenth-century costumesÂ…<br>TAURUS:  I can't understand why you're bothering with that stuff.  It isn't making you any money.<br>FRIEND:  Well, not yet.  But if I' lucky, I can get some help from this friend whoÂ…<br>TAURUS:  You'll never get into the film business.  It's too competitive.  It's dead.  I don't see why you're wasting so much energy on it.<br>FRIEND:  It's not dead.  It has all kinds of symbolic significance todayÂ….<br>TAURUS:  Symbolic?  What are you talking about?  Something's dead or it's not.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  Why don't you train at something that can make you a little money?<br><br>This scenario has several different versions.  It can apply, as here, to the complete lack of understanding of the symbolic, the romantic, the dramatic.  Taurus likes his meat and potatoes plain, without sauce.  They must, of course, be of the absolutely best quality; but he doesn't appreciate frills.  He also doesn't appreciate possibilities.  For something to be real to Taurus, it must be more than possible.  It must be definite.<br><br>Other versions to this scenario occur in all areas where the physical reality of something isn't immediately apparent.  Many Taureans are notorious skeptics of anything they consider 'mystical' - like astrology, for example.  I've noticed over a decade of teaching that fewer Taureans enroll in my courses than any other sign.  There are also very few Leos.  For the latter, of course, it's probably that they would rather be teaching themselves; and also, Leo doesn't like to learn from anybody else.  But Taurus will be terribly cautious about something like astrology unless he can be shown, definitively and scientifically that it works.  And not once but several times, in case the first time was a fluke.  I once had a Taurus client who, although he was quite ruffled and impressed by his horoscope reading, doubted that I could repeat such a performance.  He wasn't prepared to accept that the chart worked; he thought (which seemed an even wilder interpretation) that I had somehow acquired my information psychically or telepathically.  He asked if he might sit in on several other chart readings for some of his friends.  Because he was a Taurus, and I knew there was no other way, I conceded.  After about fifteen such sessions he begrudgingly admitted that there must be something to it.  And like a good Taurus, once a change of attitude has taken hold of him, he swung into action.  Not content with merely accepting it, he decided to learn it.  He learned in the way Taureans do when they have finally got moving:  obsessively.  Now he's a practicing astrologer.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This pragmatism about things which might be foggy, woolly, charlatan, or false, works to Taurus' advantage as well.  It keeps him out of mischief, and helps him to establish the absolute reliability of anything he allows into his life.  This applies to relationships as well.  Taurus is the kind of person who prefers to know a lot about you, to 'check your references' in a bizarre sort of way, before he makes any commitment.  After all, that's the sensible, realistic thing to do.  Although he has a sentimental, gentle, romantic streak, it's backed up by healthy cynicism.  In the midst of the bouquets of roses, he might quietly have a peek at your bank balance and inquire about your family.  It's not that he expects you to provide the riches for him.  He just likes to know that everything is stable, secure and reliable.  Including you.<br><br>Let's consider the famous sensuality of Taurus.  The true Taurean is an undeniably sensuous creature.  This means not only in the sexual realm, but in anything that pleases the senses.  Colour:  Taurus often has a real flair for design, for colour, perhaps for painting or photography.  Sound:  Taurus is well-known for its love of music, and many Taureans have become famous singers (like Barbara Streisand) or composers (like Tchaikovsky).  Touch:  this means not only responsiveness to physical touch, but a love of texture.  Silk, velvet, satin, fur.  Yes, of course, it costs money, but Taurus isn't interested in anything cheap.  Taste:  well, that can be a problem.  Love of good food leads many a Taurean into weight problems.  Lots of Taureans have a sleek well-fed look - not floppy fat, but solid flesh, the sign of the person who eats not only what tastes good but is also good quality.  Perhaps a little too much good quality.  Your Taurus friend is bound to know all the best restaurants - not the fashionable ones, necessarily (that's where the Geminis and Sagittarians go) but the really reliable ones with excellent food.  Smell:  Taureans are terribly sensitive to smell, and usually have a great affinity for luxurious scents to various kinds.  From flowers to priceless perfume, Taurus likes to surround himself with good smells.  Often the senses of the Taurus are so acute and intense that he finds it unbearable to be around anything that looks, smells, or feels sordid or cheap or ugly.  Taurus has a strong instinct for harmony.<br><br>Taste is another quality often to be found in Taurus.  Taurus' tastes tend toward the conventional, rather than the startling; if you want shocking taste, try the fire signs, or perhaps the air signs.  Earth, being more realistic and conscious of the demands of society, tends toward things of good quality which are not likely to suddenly go out of style in six months.  Taurus is not a 'fad' person.  But within the confines of his more solid, almost bourgeois palate, his taste is usually impeccable.  Never obtrusive.  Maybe a really good car, like a Bentley or a Rolls Royce (never something as flashy and unreliable as a Lamborghini, which always has to be in the shop to be tuned).  Something reliable that speaks not fashion, but solid wealth.  Taurus has strong roots in tradition.  And often there's a love of the old and the antique - antique furniture, antique lace, antique shawls and jewelry, old masters' paintings.  Solid, ageless, valuable.<br><br>With Taurus' love of beauty, he's bound to create an environment that has as much beauty and pleasing atmosphere as possible.  On the other hand, he's often so occupied with physical beauty that he may miss what lies underneath.  Taurus is the original sucker for a pretty face; he can value beauty so much, in objects and people, that he overlooks and underestimates qualities such as perceptiveness, wit, intelligence, and character.  It isn't that difficult to fool a Taurean if you are beautiful.  Sad to say, many Taureans are hopelessly ensnared by appearances.  It's one of their great failings.<br><br>Taurus is also a collector.  Of objects, money, and people.  What he collects must have value to him.  He will treasure it, take care of it, shower attention on it, and hang on with both tough fists tightly encircling it.  This is why Taurus is often the partner people seek when they seek the real security of a stable, unchanging relationship.  No matter what happens or what you do, Taurus will stand by you.  He may not always understand your motives, but he'll remain loyal regardless.<br><br>The collecting instinct of Taurus can get out of hand.  He may collect for the sake of collecting, which is fine for objects - they don't seem to mind - but very disturbing if you are a person.  Sometimes it takes some rude shocks and a few quarrels to convince a Taurus that you have your own individuality and your own private inner life.  You have to tell him.  He can't telepath, and often miss subtle signs.  And he has a hell of a time trying to disentangle motives.<br><br>Because the gods seem to resent complacency, there is usually a bee in the flowers.  It seems to be a necessary part of the life pattern.  Often the Taurus himself courts this bee without realizing it, unconsciously setting up a situation where he is shocked while thinking it happened by chance or was someone else's fault.  But without the sting, he remains charming and childlike.  Many adult Taureans are so childlike that it's astonishing.  Life is terribly simple to them, black and white, with no shades of grey in between.  They have it all worked out, logically, systematically, and simply.  Good people are good and go to heaven; bad people are bad and go to hell.  Childlike and trusting.  What the bee offers is a capacity to take this precious childlike simplicity and combine it with a little earthly realism.  It's a lovely combination, once achieved.  For you have a person who not only knows the realities of life and can deal with them, but who can also live happily and contentedly in the moment, capable of abandoning himself to his pleasures in the wholehearted way that children have before it's pounded out of them.  Remember the goddess Venus.  She is, in many ways, the eternal child.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Taurus Lover</strong><br><br>Let's deal first with the obvious.  Taurus is a very physical sign.  It's a rare Taurean that doesn't possess a strong, intense desiring nature.  Taurus is sensual, loves beauty, and can be entirely sybaritic.  This is not the sign for the ascetic, unless you want one hell of a religious fanatic instead.<br><br>For many Taureans, the sexual side of a relationship is the thing which takes top priority.  Where there's good sex, there the Taurus remains.  It would be a mistake to assign any particular morality to Taurus; it depends on his personal viewpoint, his generation, and his private values.  If he chooses to be faithful, he's very faithful.  If he doesn't, he'll happily pursue his sensual pleasures on the side, getting enormous satisfaction from them, yet never allowing them to interfere with the stability of a marriage.  Remember that stability is really important to Taurus.  So, of course, is satisfaction.  The way to keep a Taurus in a relationship is not to play sexual games of now-you-can-have-me, now-you-can't.  He'll just find something more available.<br><br>Taurus, being Venus-ruled, has a sense of the romantic.  It isn't stylishly romantic like Libra, or slightly dissipated like Pisces, or intense and shady like Scorpio.  It's good old storybook romanticism, because Taurus has a conventional streak.  The old-time honoured rituals and way work best.  A true Taurean keeps promises, doesn't promise unless he's sure, and isn't sure until he's checked all the facts on the situation.  No, that isn't very romantic.  But his romanticism, heavy-handed though it sometimes is, is genuine.  He really believes in engagement rings and white wedding dresses.  They're concrete representations of his feelings.  Taurus is apt to give gifts, to demonstrate emotion.  This can be both flattering and difficult, because often emotion doesn't come easily to his fixed, cautious nature.<br><br>Because he's very conscious of stability, it's a rare Taurean that flies in and out of relationships.  He may fly in and out of sexual encounters, but 'relationship' to him has a heavy sound.  Often his sense of responsibility, coupled with his need for security, will keep him in a relationship which has long since lost its charm.  In this case he'll very likely find the charm elsewhere, so long as it doesn't rock the foundation of the secure home.  And Taurus can be maddening in his simplicity.  Relationship means you're physically present.  It's difficult to talk about deeper nuances with a Taurus.  You must be literal, because Taurus often has trouble with inferences.  He's likely to believe what you say, and be equally blunt himself.  When you talk about things like unconscious hostility and emotional blackmail and other undercurrent stuff that a Scorpio would take like a duck to water, Taurus will often turn his head away in disgust.  What are you talking about?  Show him.  Put it in the palm of his hand.  Often he won't look at the forces building up underneath that so often wreck the best relationships, simply because his vision is tied to what is in the shop window.<br><br>Taurus can be poignantly gentle, tender and affectionate.  Because it's a very physical sign, most Taureans need tactile expression of love.  Once again, this can either be flattering and nourishing, or it can be suffocating.  You may have heard about the famous possessiveness.  Taurus is indeed a possessive sign, though for different reasons from Scorpio, also notorious for his jealousy.  Taurus possesses, which means that like treasured paintings, the valuable antiques, the rare old books, you're his (or hers) and that's that.  Taurus will often demonstrate this in public by physical gestures of the property-ownership variety.  It depends upon your taste.  Taurus is not the sign to get involved with if you like detachment and open relationships, not if he's in love.<br><br>It takes a lot to goad the Taurus in anger.  The endless patience and easygoing calm in this sign are a blessing and a relief to anybody who seeks tranquility and peace in a relationship.  On the other hand, push him too far, and you have the proverbial angry bull.  And once he's angry, Taurus can be physically violent.  He's rarely subtle enough to deliver verbal bites like Virgo and Gemini, or manipulate poisonous atmosphere like Scorpio.  His language is simple:  smash the china, or punch you in the face.<br><br>One way to observe the violence is to flaunt your freedom from him.  Once an agreement has been made, it's a sure way to anger Taurus.  Another is to threaten his material security.  Taurus women, in divorce or separation, are apt to hang on to the house, the car, the furniture and the bank account with teeth bared and fingernails poised for the attack.  Take away his possessions, his stability, and you have a very angry - and a very insecure - bull.<br><br>For loyalty and steadfastness, no one beats a Taurus.  For calmness verging on complacency, too, no one beats a Taurus.  Like all sign combinations, matches for Taurus depend upon your personal taste.  Taurus is often attracted to fiery temperaments, who possess the daring, childlike abandon, gambling instincts, love of danger, imagination and rashness that he himself doesn't dare express.  Taurus needs fire to warm him, loosen him, show him that other dimensions of reality exist.  He needs fire for faith in life, since his own faith is largely built on what's in the bank.  He also needs fire for creative inspiration, as a muse.  And the more volatile temperaments, the gypsies and the wanderers, the visionaries and the prophets, need Taurus, because like the earth he supports and sustains, protects and cherishes, and because his strength in coping with the ordinary problems of life is endless.  And because, unlike more complicated signs, he simply wants to be happy; and happiness for him is not so difficult to find.  And his simplicity and love of the natural make it a little easier for others to find too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Taurus Man</strong><br><br>The bull is an extremely masculine animal.  Although Taurus is considered to be a feminine sign, the male version doesn't much display femininity - unless you consider as feminine the qualities of gentleness, sensuousness, and love of beauty.  But Taurus tends to run a little macho in many men - largely because it's so physical, and also because Taurus is a sign that's very sensitive to the collective roles which society offers.  So the Taurus man is apt to collect the accoutrements of what society considers masculine, from clothes to stance to his possessiveness of his woman.<br><br>Many of the characters in romantic historical fiction appear to be Taureans.  The strong, silent hero - a sort of cross between Clint Eastwood and Hercules - is a Taurean figure.  He's usually terribly handsome (and Taurus usually is - if not in the conventional, regular-featured way, then in a pleasing, earthy, sensual quality) and also beautifully dressed.  That last is one of Taurus men's frequent traits:  sometimes known as vanity, other times known as good taste.  Taurus likes elegance, and many Taurus men - although not necessarily 'foppish' - spend an awfully long time with hair, shoes, fingernails, aftershave.  These are all physical pleasures, signs of physical beauty and physical style.  It's a rare Taurus man who hasn't got that streak of vanity tucked away somewhere.  After all, Venus rules them - and Venus was perpetually before her mirror.<br><br>The powerful passions are another fictional hero's trait apparent in many Taurean men.  If you like strong sensuality, Taurus possesses it in abundance.  Many Taurus men also pride themselves on their sexual prowess; physical love, like physical beauty, is important to them, and not something to be either hurried or done badly.<br><br>On the other hand, you may not like strong, silent heroes.  You may like a lot of chatter now and again, or a little ambiguity.  In that case stay away from Taurus.  He's not good at games.  And even when you find him in the worst possible situation, somehow he seems wholesome.  You just can't remove that sheen of the good earth itself from him.  D.H. Lawrence 'natural man' (you can find him in Lady Chatterley's Lover and other novels), must have been a Taurus.  The explicit sexuality, the complete absence of embarrassment over any aspect of the human body, are typically Taurus.<br><br>You may, however, like a little more flair, or something a little shadier.  Try a Libran, a Scorpio or a Pisces.  Taurus men can be infuriatingly simple.  When they don't wish to understand something, they block it out.  They tell you you're being unreasonable, irrational or silly.  And they patronize.  This is one of the more irritating qualities about the Taurean man:  he can be smug.  Because he's not easily ruffled himself, he often has contempt or a blank response to someone else's anxiety, fear or nervousness.  Then you get the pat on the head and the suggestion to take an aspirin and get a good night's sleep.  Or a good night in alternative ways, a great cure-all in Taurus' health handbook.<br><br>When you're a mess, he can be a rock of strength and calmness.  On the other hand, he probably won't understand your mess, so don't bother attempting to explain it unless you can explain it simply.  He has no patience for 'female hysterics'.  Everything should have a simple solution.  Some things unfortunately have no solution.  In these cases Taurus refuses to see the dilemma.<br><br>And be careful not to betray him.  Expecting understanding for convoluted games gets you nowhere.  Taurus is terribly vulnerable where his more romantic feelings are concerned; if he's invested in you with his romantic ideal, he will simply be wounded and bewildered if you give double messages.  It's possible to string a Taurus along for a long time, because he tends to love with fixity; but once you've pushed too far, he's equally capable of throwing you and all your belongings out of the house and never speaking to you again.  Fixed is fixed, in love or hate.  And Taurus isn't terribly good at forgiving.  Forgetting, perhaps, or simply not discussing.  But forgiving, no.  He'll remember, for a long, long time.<br><br>You also may have heard of the famous laziness of the Taurus male.  Yes, it's true.  Taurus can be incredibly, overwhelmingly indolent.  His idea of relaxation may be a can of beer in front of the TV watching Match of the Day, while you have more glamorous things in mind.  He also has a tendency to sit with feet up on the table waiting for dinner to be served:  not an attitude calculated to win the  heart of the feminist.  He loves being spoiled, and often takes it as his due.  It depends once again, on your taste.  Remember that, no matter how lurid his past or iconoclastic his views, deep down he's conventional, and probably will always have a touch of the male chauvinist about him.  But that isn't really so bad, if you remember that it's nice to have an identifiably male male around.  Taurus men have a way of making women feel very female.  Who can complain?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tare:</div><div class="quote_body">libra? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div></blockquote>I have unwittingly been slacking for more than 3 hours.<br><br><strong>Libra<br><br>Mirror, mirror on the wall,<br>Who's the fairest of them all?</strong><br><br>One of the most notorious Librans of recent fame is Brigitte Bardot.  She serves as a reminder that the ruling planet of Libra is Venus, goddess of love and beauty in ancient mythology.  You'd think Libra would be the most obvious, easiest sign to understand.  All they need is love, right?  Wrong.<br><br>Remember that Libra is an airy sign.  And air is concerned with ideas and principles above all else.  Love, yes, of course.  Every Libra thinks a lot about love, just as he thinks a lot about anything that pertains to relationship.  But the operative word here is think.  Libra's idea of love isn't necessarily your idea of a warm, cozy, delightful tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte.  More likely, it'll be one of his many theories on the nature of love and marriage, his ideals of the perfect relationship, his concepts about how people ought to behave toward each other, his urgent vision of a world where everything is absolutely balanced, polished, perfect, symmetrical, harmonious.  It can drive you mad.  This sign, whose symbol is the scales of balance, has less to do with ordinary sweaty human coupling than any other.  What?  Libra soil his hands?  Never.  Love, for Libra, must always be in the appropriate style:  a ritual of courtly love, complete with the right gestures, the right words, the right perfume, the right satin sheets, the right scented candles, the right flowers.  Be careful.  Libra is the great perfectionist of the zodiac.  Not Virgo, as you may have heard.  Love, ah yes.  Love, for Libra, makes the world go round.  But his love is a theoretical one.  He knows less about love than any other sign, although he thinks about it more.  That's why he's always searching for it in the most idealized possible forms.  Like Aquarius and Gemini, Libra's emotional nature is often childlike and naÃ¯ve.<br><br>The planet Venus symbolizes, in astrology, the urge for relationship.  Let's look closely at that word.  Relating one thing to another doesn't necessarily involve emotion.  It's the art of comparison, differentiation, of making balanced and symmetrical patterns.  Relationship is an integral part of dance, of geometry, of mathematics, or warfare.  Relationship can mean a delicate and masterly sense of which colour blends with which.  Or whether the lines of a Porsche 928 are superior in style to those of a Ferrari.  This is really what Libra is concerned with.  Marriage, yes.  Most Librans think a lot about marriage, too.  It's rare to find a Libra who remains unmarried for long.  There's something about the ritual, the ceremony, the sense of togetherness, the rings, that appeal to the delicate quality of stylization in Libra's nature.  It's the marriage of opposites, the balancing of things which are incompatible and mutually exclusive, the cleaning up of rough edges, the ordering of the pattern.<br><br>Marriage to Libra is like a sixteenth-century dance.  Every step, every gesture, has a ritualized meaning.  Libra is the great sign of ritual.  And remember that Libra's symbol, the balance, is an inanimate object.  Libra tries to lift ordinary human living onto the level of Platonic ideals.  Not that he's incapable of being erotic or deeply sensual.  But often sex itself must be ritualized, otherwise it turns him off.<br><br>You'll hear the words 'fair' and 'equal' mentioned a lot in conversations with Libra.  The Libran's sense of what is fair is so acute that he can spot an imbalance miles away.  He believes passionately in fairness, and this often causes him a great deal of unhappiness, because life and people aren't always fair.  Again and again his idealism collides with an imbalanced world full of imperfections and rough edges.  Libra believes passionately in equality, too, particularly in relationships.  If you do him a favour, he does you a favour.  If you pay for dinner, he'll pay for the theatre tickets.  In many ways he's truly an enlightened soul when it comes to male-female relationships, for he understands in a very real way what equality and fair play mean, and he won't use sex to tip the balance.<br><br>Here, too, he often meets with sad disillusionment, because finding a relationship where each partner gives exactly the same amount and takes exactly the same amount, where there isn't one slightly stronger or one who loves slightly more, is like finding a unicorn.  But Libra believes in unicorns too, and may often be seen moving from one relationship to another, one job to another, one country to another, believing and believing and believing that one day, some day, he'll find that perfect companion, that perfect career, that perfect environment where no ugliness or coarseness or human tragedy intrudes.<br><br>Like Socrates, Libra seeks the Good, the True and the Beautiful.  Even the Libra who's learned to use his notorious charm to manipulate people and situations still seeks these things.  He seeks them in whatever field of life you find him, in whatever relationship he enters.  He usually knows by the time he reaches his mid-thirties that the Good, the True and the Beautiful are concepts and symbols rather than facts which he's likely to meet on the street.  But he'll go on trying.  And one of the nicest qualities about this curious sign is that in his eternal efforts to change the world and make it a place where the Good, the True and the Beautiful can make their abode, he often succeeds in making life just a little better, a little more beautiful, a little more harmonious than it might otherwise have been.<br><br>Like his planetary ruler Venus, he has the gift of creating style and grace and harmony wherever he goes.  More earthy souls often don't appreciate Libra's special gift.  But those who know that hyacinths for the soul are as necessary as that extra five pounds a week on the salary cheque appreciate Libra.<br><br>Libra has a quality of initiation, a need to have goals, which the sign shares in common with Aries, Cancer and Capricorn.  All these signs have as a basic characteristic the need to be working toward something.  Libra is usually looking for order, for perfection, for an ideal of relationship.  Because he's always aware of other people's viewpoints, he won't often show aggressiveness or pushiness in his encounters with others.  But don't forget that he possesses just as much initiative as his more overt cousins born under Aries and Capricorn.  He's always after something.  The difference is that, in order to really feel confident about achieving it, Libra needs a partner.  If you spend some time with a Libran, you'll learn to recognize the royal Libran 'we'.  Aries simply says, 'I want that.  Do it.'  Libra is far more diplomatic, far cagier.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He's born with a downright frightening awareness that the world is full of people who have opinions which differ from his.  He'll always listen to other opinions, frequently agreeing with them in order to encourage his partner or opponent to talk more.  In the end, he does exactly as he pleases.  But somehow he always succeeds in giving the impression that he's done it because of your cooperation.  In fact, you might even walk away thinking it was really your idea, and that you pushed him.  Instead of 'Do it.'  Libra would much rather approach gently, with the famous charming smile, and say, 'You know, I was thinking that it would be really nice for everyone here if weÂ….' And you're hooked.  How thoughtful he is.  How genuinely concerned with others' needs and ideas.<br><br>How unassertive.  How diffident.  Why, you'd be glad to do it.  In fact, you'd even thought of it yourself.  You're so glad to have his supportÂ…<br><br>It's no wonder Libra has a reputation for being a skilled diplomat and a masterful statesman.  He has a rare gift of being able to achieve what he wants with the minimum offence.  How can you be offended by somebody who's always consulting you about your opinions?  Here's the art of Venusian relationships at its most fluent.<br><br>The problem with this, of course, is that more direct souls don't believe a word of it.  They see Libra as a chronic hypocrite and flatterer.  From one point of view, it's sometimes true; Librans have been known to smile sweetly and pay you an endearing compliment when they actually hate the ground you walk on.  They're also prone to agreeing with your side of the argument when they take their place as mediators - 'Yes, I agree with you completely, he's perfectly dreadful' - and then turning around and doing the same thing to your opponent - 'Yes, I agree with you, she's behaving horridly.'  It's hard if you're the sort of person who likes friends who'll bleed and die for you rather than show the faintest sign of disloyalty, to learn to trust Libra, who'd rather be friends with everybody than bleed and die for anything.  And more suspicious types like Scorpio and Capricorn don't appreciate Libra's gift for flattery either.  They don't trust compliments in general, these signs, and they certainly don't trust somebody who always approaches with a 'You're looking marvelous today' when you know you look terrible.  Viewed from the other side of the fence, Libra doesn't come across as particularly trustworthy.  Diplomats never do.<br><br>But on the other hand (an expression you'll hear frequently on the lips of Librans) this isn't hypocrisy, nor is it dishonesty.  From Libra's point of view it's all true.  He'd much rather compliment you than insult you, not just because he likes to be liked, but because he tends to look for the beautiful and the positive in people and in life.  Yes, the diplomat is at work.  But sometimes it's nicer to be courted by a diplomat than bludgeoned by one of those types whose excessive love of 'truth' causes him to destroy brutally your most delicate dreams and needs.  The Libran photographer, for example, will usually use a soft-focus lens and flattering lighting to enhance a woman's appearance, because he knows that most women like to appear beautiful; you'll rarely find him in the harsh realist school which insists on portraying every last spot, wrinkle, and superfluous hair because it's true to life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True life to Libra is tinted with his visions of the beauty it might contain.  Even if he lives in a dark, dreary one-room basement flat, he'll do his best to disguise its limitations with a few flowers, some bright colours, some clever use of design.  And when you're there, you have the illusion that it's bigger, brighter, more luxurious than the physically big, bright, luxurious homes of less tasteful people.  Which is the reality?<br><br>Libra's royal 'we' isn't sheer hypocrisy either.  Of course the diplomat is at work here too, because Libra is smart enough to know that you can get a lot more done when people are on your side than when they're fighting you.  And he also has a positive hatred of quarrels and emotional storms, and a real terror of being disliked.  It shatters him to know someone despises him.  He'll often do everything in his power - which is considerable - to win the opponent over.  But apart from the diplomat, Libra also has a genuine interest in other people's ideas and feelings.  He really does care, although the degree of it varies with the individual Libran.  The interested listener isn't just listening because he knows it makes you like him better.  He's also truly interested.  And if he doesn't show his disagreement, well, that's not wholly hypocrisy either; he's also smart enough to know that even if he disagreed, it wouldn't change your mind anyway, so why bother?  Much more pleasant to have pleasantness.<br><br>An interesting case in point is Alexander the Great, one of the more influential Librans in history.  He's generally known for conquering most of the known world.  But Alexander wasn't your usual run-of-the-mill dictator carving territory out for himself for love of power.  He was a Libran, after all.  He was an intense idealist, and held a belief for the whole of his life that the disparate peoples of the ancient world - Greek, Persian, Indian - could mix and intermarry and create a united world under one king, with different customs and religions co-existing happily side by side.  He himself married the defeated King of Persia's daughter to set an example, and arranged marriages between his Macedonian troops and Persian women.  A true Libran dream, this one.  Alexander's tragedy, like that of any other idealist, was that after all his painstaking work Greeks still hated Persians and Persians still hated Indians and fire-worshippers hated earth-worshippers and people still wanted to rape, loot and pillage.<br><br>Alexander's military tactics are also pure Libra.  He never just blundered into battle, attempting to win by brute force.  His genius was his strategy.  Time after time he worked out what his enemy was going to do by psychologizing him, and then playing with his knowledge.  He also led his men with true Libran finesse; he ate with them, drank with them, starved with them, knew all their names, never set himself above them.  No ordinary conqueror, this one, but a wonderful example of many Libran qualities at work.<br><br>Frequently, with all these gifts, the one to suffer is the Libran himself.  This is because, if you're going to spend your life with the kind of acute awareness of everybody else that Libra's got, you don't have a chance very often to express your own emotions honestly.  And this is Libra's biggest problem.  He often finds his own emotions very painful to deal with, because they so frequently contradict the ideal of the Good, the True and the Beautiful.  Libra likes to think that emotion should always be pleasant, agreeable, loving, harmonious.  When he feels things like anger, hatred, jealousy, intense desire, it frightens him.  One shouldn't feel such things.  He often carries a pretty sizeable guilt complex around him, over all those nasty things that churn around in the secret soul.  Like the fact that he doesn't really like everybody after all.<br><br>In a nutshell, Libra often represses his own emotions mercilessly, both because they conflict with his image of how people should be, and because they get him into trouble (meaning that sometimes other people get angry at him) when he shows his real feelings.  His unreal world of perfect harmony and companionship often becomes so unreal that it's impossible for him to deal with ordinary human conflict.  And repressed emotion like that, sooner or later, surfaces in a variety of unpleasant and indirect ways - like depression and physical illness.  Or like secret and unintentional snipes at the people he's trying hardest to be pleasant to.  Then he says the worst possible thing at the worst possible moment, and doesn't even realize what he's done.  His pent-up anger and hostility have come out in an indirect way, and he's usually the last one to know he's doing it, until he's lost all his friends in the process.<br><br>Libra, the great lover of Truth, is often emotionally dishonest, both with himself and with others.  It isn't intentional.  It's just that this sensitive idealist, with the perfect image of the world rattling around his very capable brain, takes a long time adjusting to the rougher currents in the sea of life.  And all too often he'll just avoid the challenge of adjusting his idealistic nature with a bumpier world by trying to hide behind a relationship which can protect him and offer a warm, secure cocoon so that he doesn't have to deal with such difficult issues.  Put briefly, Libra is often terribly dependent on his friends and loved ones, because he wants protection from life.  The thing is, he has so much charm that you can't resist protecting him, and perpetuating the vicious cycle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Cancer Woman</strong><br><br>There are two types of Cancer women.  Those who are Mothers.  And those who are Eternal Children.  Often they cross, and you find both in one.  Cancer is often the epitome of the feminine - moody, non-rational, alternately loving and cruel, unpredictable, gentle, soft, capable of surprising ruthlessness, and ultimately enigmatic and full of mystery.<br><br>Don't think because she can cook, that she's domesticated.  Or that, because she likes children, she's docile and has no ambitions of her own.  Cancer women can be intensely possessive, driving, ambitious people.  It's just that they tend to live it through someone else:  the husband, the lover, or the child.<br><br>Many Cancer women choose deliberately to play the role of Mother.  They have a wonderful gift for making a home, for creating a warm, loving atmosphere, for dealing with gentleness with all the bruises - physical or emotional - which their loved ones incur.  But don't forget that the Mother Goddess, in the myth, has more than one face.  Her domestic face heals, nurtures, supports.  Her dark face is wild like the maenads who dance the sacred dance of Dionysus on the mountaintop and dismember the faun they catch.  There are secret depths of emotional storms and a strange, matriarchal consciousness in the Cancer woman.  Some Cancer women show this archaic attitude by seeing men essentially as sources to beget children.  They hark back to the old days when the Mother ruled and the king was sacrificed every five years.  For this kind of Cancer, all men are essentially children, to be cosseted, loved, and made pregnant by.<br><br>A relationship with this kind of Cancer is both frightening and a great challenge.  Frightening because it can castrate a man.  If you are always treated like a boy, you remain one; and if you weren't before, you become one.  On the other hand, meeting it with the challenge of masculinity can lead to a wonderfully dynamic, passionately, constantly stimulating love.  In the ancient myths, it is the hero who challenges the power of the Mother - not by demeaning or subjugation or denial of her rights, but simply by affirmation of his manhood and his own destiny - who is truly the hero.  There is a fascinating quality about many Cancer women because of this dark aspect to the sign, which is much in evidence in Cancer women.  It beckons, it fascinates, it attracts, it repels.  But safe and domesticated, it isn't.  Think again.  The cooking may be great.  But you need to understand the woman.<br><br>The Cancer woman, too, must create.  Usually her creativity is expressed through the bearing of children.  But at mid-life, when the children have begun to grow away and need a friend more than a Mother, many Cancerian women suffer a deep crisis of identity.  Who am I?  What is my own life about?  This is the greatest challenge that can befall a Cancer woman.  In a sense, Cancer women's real life doesn't begin until this stage of the journey.  The first part of life is often bound up with the home and family, the natural and right and instinctual expression of all the femininity and creativity of the sign.  But later on the world must become larger, and the family bigger - the reason, perhaps, why many Cancer women make such excellent teachers, counselors and therapists.  The creativity must be shifted on to levels other than the biological - perhaps why so many Cancer women make such excellent painters, novelists, actresses with depth and subtlety in mid-life.  The depth and richness of the Cancer woman shows itself most truly after thirty-five.  It is a slow-maturing sign.  Crabs don't race like greyhounds.  But the Cancer woman, often more oyster-like than crab-like, may take half a lifetime to grow her pearl - her wisdom about human nature, and the depth of her love for people and life.  Perhaps this is the most mysterious of all the faces of the Mother:  Sophia, which means, in Greek wisdom.  And wisdom comes from the heart, not the intellect.<br><br></div>
