For a while everyone was talking about the Age of Aquarius as a kind of New Dispensation, a time when wars would cease and everybody would love everybody else and the New Utopia would arrive, seen through a haze of marijuana smoke and acid rainbows.<br><br>Now, a decade later, people are still talking about the Age of Aquarius, but with a certain unease.  It appears to consist now of things like terrorism, revolution of Iran, Arab-Israeli conflict, a diminishing supply of fuel for the world, and general malaise.  Did the Age of Aquarius fall flat on its face?  Did it ever arrive?  And is Aquarius really about love, brotherhood and Flower Power?<br><br>Well, yes, in part Aquarius is about love and brotherhood.  Or perhaps, we should say, with more accuracy, that it is about ideals - and the ideals of love and brotherhood are among many which are formulated in the forward-looking Aquarian mind.  Particularly ideals about the group, the welfare of humanity, the future of society.<br><br>Aquarius is also, broadly, about science, and knowledge, and invention, and discoveries which will improve the lot of men in the generations to come.  FraternitÃ©, egalitÃ©, libertÃ© - the cry of the French Revolution - is in many ways an Aquarian cri de couer.  The noblest of human visions are spun from this last of the airy signs, which in its most profound meaning symbolizes the genius of human invention extended to its fullest limits, applied to the control of nature by the will of man and the structuring of humanity into a civilized society.<br><br>So what happened to the age of love and brotherhood?  The same thing that happens to many Aquarians.  The ideal was ahead of its time, as the ideals of many Aquarians all too frequently are.  The ideal hit a head-on collision with the reality of human nature, which can't really be explained and governed by ideals alone.  Without the ideal, no progress of any kind could take place.  Yet the anchoring of an ideal takes time, and flexibility, and a sensitivity to the limitations of human nature.  Aquarius is not overly gifted in any of these three things.  He is usually impatient, and wants to see the ideal made flesh right this minute.  He is not very flexible, although a great lover of truth.  And he has very little understanding of, or patience with, the seamier side of human nature.<br><br>You can see here the dilemma, the gift and the curse of the Aquarian.  His symbol is the Waterbearer.  Notice carefully that the Waterbearer carries his jug to offer the water of life to humanity - but doesn't get his own hands wet.  As an air sign, Aquarius finds his reality in his ideals.  Because he is concerned with issues that pertain to the group rather than the individual, you can see the traditional Aquarian link with welfare and human rights.  Fields like social work and education and politics are natural for the forward-looking Aquarian who wants to set the world to rights.  It's truly the sign of liberty, democracy, and human equality.  And Aquarius, as far as his ideals are concerned, is usually truly democratic.  One of his nicest qualities is his sense of fairness and integrity.  He has a pretty finely honed conscience, which is often so sensitive that it makes his life unbearable.  He often has a horror of being what he calls 'selfish', which is very noble but not very psychologically healthy.  Regardless of his personal likes and dislikes, his dedication to his beliefs is unshakeable.  And this dedication is often to the objective perspective, the broad canvas, a code of ethics or principles by which he believes he should live.  And, of course, he is often dedicated to Truth.  Yes, it's capitalized, that word Truth.  For Aquarius, there is generally only one Truth.<br><br>Never mind whether he hates you bitterly.  Fair is fair.  Aquarius will still deal with you with integrity, because, vile that you are, you're still a human being, and all human beings have certain innate basic rights.  Sometimes you'd wish he'd show a little honest unfairness.  But no.  Fair is fair.<br><br>Look at some of the famous Aquarian figures of the past.  Abraham Lincoln is one of the best known.  Of course it would be an Aquarian who declared equality between black and white in an age of slavery, and abolished slavery with the result of the American Civil War.  He was shot for his pains.  Many Aquarians suffer the retaliation of the more conservative elements of society for their contributions, which are frequently suspected.  You will also see among the distinguished Aquarian names figures like Thomas Edison - great thinkers and inventors whose discoveries are not intended for personal satisfaction or gain, but for the benefit of the human race.  Their dedication is absolute; try to find out anything about their personal lives and you're astonished to discover that they seem to have no personal lives.  All their energy and ability is taken up with the dedication to the goal, the ideal.<br><br>The list of noble, courageous, dedicated idealists is a very long when it comes to Aquarius.  So is the list of scientists and philosophers.  Can we say anything at all bad about this sign?<br><br>Of course we can.  For as we near the end of the zodiac, the signs become increasingly complex.  Their extremes become more and more extreme.  But the time we get to Aquarius and Pisces, you are dealing with an enormous spectrum of human abilities and foibles.  There is an element to Aquarius which can only be described as intellectual bigotry.  That courageous fixity of ideals can become stubborn fanaticism - the rigidly rational scientist with no heart, who is a caricature in this modern age.  This is a fellow who invents a new weapon because it's scientifically interesting and immensely effective, without the wit to realize that people don't possess the psychological maturity to handle such a thing with any responsibility.  A little closer to home, this is the fellow who doesn't worry about the few people who might be harmed by a faulty nuclear reactor - or who disguises the actual percentage of radioactivity in the atmosphere - because, well, those are only a few little people, and they don't really have anything to do with grand things like Our Country's Defence and Power.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Also in the shadier reaches of Aquarius are to be found the rampant communist who believes in a utopian state where all wealth is leveled and all people equal - without regard to the fact that people are fundamentally different and are emotionally incapable of coping with this.  George Orwell's 1984 is a horror story of an Aquarian Age run rampant.  Lest we think that the ideals of love and brotherhood as expounded by the more fanatical adherents of the sign are the answer, enforced by a totalitarian state, read and re-read this little book which was once considered science fiction and now looks horribly like prophecy.<br><br>And what about the individual Aquarian?  Well, typically, he encompasses these two extremes - genuine love and concern for the welfare of the group, and personal intellectual bigotry.  His ideals and his true sense of democracy are immediately noticeable.  Even the non-political Aquarian who lives an ordinary life and doesn't concern himself with movements, will often be found defending the underdog in his business.  His ideals often make Aquarius stand out by a head above the crowd.  He thinks about other people, about their needs and potential.  Or maybe we should say he truly thinks - a rare commodity in an age of slogans and opinions.<br><br>On the other hand, he doesn't much like individuals.  Aquarius is the fellow who loves humanity and doesn't like people.  He can be brusque, cool, unfeeling, insensitive, rigid, dogmatic, and downright stupid when it comes to the subtleties of human relationships.  He can stand by principles when principles are the least relevant thing in the situation.  His fairness can be blindly infuriating when what is most needed is a little bias.  In those typical situations where you're hurt by someone else's offhand remark, and turn to your Aquarian for sympathy, and get a pronouncement fit for a trial where point by point the reasonableness of the remark is discussed, it's a wonder there aren't more Aquarians murdered every day.<br><br>Aquarius is often embarrassed by emotion, and finds it distasteful both in himself and in others.  I've known quite a few Aquarian women who consider it shameful to cry; this sign is proud and self-controlled, and displays of emotion are seen as a weakness.  Those tears that according to romantic novels melt the hearts of the hardest men don't work terribly well on Aquarians.  After you've sniffed delicately into your lace handkerchief and looked up at him with moist dewy eyes, you may find either that he's quietly left the room during your fit, or that he's got his newspaper out and is reading about the political situation in Uganda.  Or he may sit quietly and watch you, and then, when you're certain he's about to tell you he really loves you after all, or that he understands, or that he's sorry he hurt you, he opens his mouth and says, 'Good!  Now that you've finished, we can discuss this reasonably.  I do so hate it when you get irrational like that.'  And when you're about to throw the teapot at him in a screaming rage because he hasn't understood at all, he'll look at you coolly and say, 'Now, don't throw another scene, it's really selfish, you know.  Can't we talk about something else?  People are suffering and dying all over the world.  Did you know that the Tanzanian troops waited three days outside Kampala so that the inhabitants could escape?  I think that's really a humanitarian thing to do.'  Having made you feel utterly and abjectly guilty for having been so emotional in the first place, he can indulge in a little smug self-satisfaction, because he succeeded in keeping his mind on the Really Important Things.<br><br>Obviously, not all Aquarians are this unfeeling.  Aquarian women in particular have an immense capacity for devotion and loyalty.  But here too it's so bound up with their ideas and their ethics that they often don't adjust very well to the changes and nuances of relationships.  And most important, with all this obsession about the rights of others and what they ought to do and be, they forget about themselves - to such an extent that they mince their own emotions to pieces through simple lack of expression.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a little scenario to illustrate the point.  We might call this the Noble Soul syndrome.<br><br>AQUARIAN TO FRIEND:  I'm fine, thanks.  A little tired, that's all.  It was an awful lot of work moving into the new house, and getting the kids ready for their new school.<br>FRIEND:  But last time I saw you, I thought you said you didn't like that house.  You weren't going to take it.<br>AQUARIAN:  Well, it's much more convenient for John's work.  It only takes him twenty-minutes.  With the other place, it would have been an hour and a half commuting.<br>FRIEND:  But what about you?  You said you hated the neighbourhood, and the shops aren't very nice, andÂ….<br>AQUARIAN:  Oh, I was just being silly.  Selfish, you know.  I'm terribly selfish like that.  I should never have gone on like that.  John always Comes First.  After all, where would I be if I always thought of myself?  My mother always told me never to be Selfish, it's the worst thing you can do.  A Good Mother always thinks of her husband and children first.  No, the house is just right for John.<br><br>This is very noble.  Truly good.  But our Aquarian, if you see her a few years later, is liable to be a little messed up.  She might be on Librium, to keep her nerves from acting up.  She might have high blood pressure, or have developed a few nervous habits like a tic, or compulsive cleaning.  All that natural aggression has been submerged.  And when you track her into old age, she's had to become incredibly rigid to keep all that stuff repressed for so many years.  She's gone cold by then.  That's when Aquarian goes fanatic.  When years and years of being Unselfish and adhering to Right Behaviour have made a dog's breakfast of heir spontaneity and love of life.<br><br>Aquarians often has a wonderful gift for logic.  He can discuss things reasonably, rationally, and often brilliantly.  So when you challenge him - or present an emotional grievance - he has it all sorted out to begin with.  He can work it out rationally, analytically.  He's got all the answers.  He has a gift for analysis of human temperament - many Aquarians reach prominence in the psychological field - so he can tell you exactly what your motives are, why you said this, why you said that, and what the solution is to the problem.  It's so neat and pat it makes you swoon with admiration.  The trouble is, there's no room for any emotion in it.  I've had discussions with psychologically 'aware' Aquarians who have taken an interest in the whole realm of the human psyche.  They can list their complexes, use all the latest jargon, draw the latest psychological maps.  The human being like an airplane or an automobile or a well-constructed society, operates on certain basic principles.  There isn't any room for chance, or fuzzy edges.  Emotion has fuzzy edges.  People to Aquarians are mechanisms - wonderful, divine mechanisms, but nonetheless mechanisms.  And that well-read Aquarian who knows all the latest about the psyche, while he can discuss it with brilliance, often doesn't know anything about himself at all.  It's because he doesn't know what he feels, what he thinks he ought to feel, what he thinks he should and shouldn't feel, and he thinks you can think about what he thinks he feels.  Confused?  You should see the Aquarian in the midst of all that.  Simple phrases, like 'I love you' or 'I hate you' or 'I'm bloody angry with you' are very difficult for him.<br><br>The fact is, Aquarians have very deep and complex emotional natures.  It isn't that they have no feelings.  It's that they are often frightened of their feelings.  Aquarius is a true air sign.  What can be understood by the mind is safe, because you can reason it out.  What can't be understood is often relegated to the realm of the 'imaginary' or the 'emotional', dreaded or simply reasoned out of existence.  Is there room for any romance in this formidable temperament?  Yes, but it's usually unconscious.  Aquarius is often very embarrassed and awkward - you might even see him blush - when the subject turns to romantic matters.  This is the fellow who, out of sheer embarrassment, will neglect to give his woman flowers during twenty years of marriage.  He often can't understand the need for flattery, compliments, sentimental displays of affection.  Everything has to have a reason.  He may love deeply - but he won't show it very often, and especially not in the ordinary little ways that make a love relationship so enjoyable.  He is capable of sacrificing his life for a loved one.  But sometimes the loved one feels like saying, 'That's very nice, but flowers would have said it better.'<br><br>I once knew an Aquarian man whose wife left him after six years of marriage.  They had two children, a large house, an opulent lifestyle, and he was extremely successful in his profession.  His profession involved quite a lot of travel, which meant long periods when his wife was left alone.  It never occurred to him that she would mind this, because it never occurred to him to ask.  He could handle it; he simply clicked off on those trips, something Aquarians seem to be able to do with ease.  They simply shut down shop and shift to another department.  He also found it extremely difficult to show his wife any affection in ordinary situations.  To him, this was superfluous.  He had proved his love because he had married her, fathered two children on her, took care of her, and was reasonably faithful to her.  During one of his trips, she ran off with a friend, who had won her starving heart by writing her love poetry.  My Aquarian client was beside himself with shock, grief and bewilderment.  'She kept telling me it was the love poems,' he said, baffled.  'Why?  What difference does it make if somebody writes her love poems?'<br><br>His wife never came back.  To this day he still finds it impossible to comprehend that the poems were to her a symbol for something - a recognition that she had feelings, that she was romantic, that she had a heart.  To him, it was terribly unreasonable.<br><br>I have seen a number of Aquarian marriages go this way.  When it's the reverse way around, with the woman an Aquarian, there's a different base.  There the complaint of the man is often, 'She's so good, so fair, so self-disciplined.  She makes me feel irresponsible and selfish.'  And sadly, the unspoken part of this is that she can be pretty boring.  Anybody who's unselfish and highly principled all the time will drive a lesser mortal into some fairly nasty actions, just to get an ordinary human reaction.<br><br>What, then, can Aquarius do?  Perhaps realize that his abstract love of humanity should extend to include himself and his loved ones.  Often this simple point eludes him.  Generosity of feeling toward oneself and those close is part of the ideal of love; often, Aquarians miss it.  Some of the zodiacal signs have a knack with personal relating; others don't.  Aquarians has perhaps more difficulty than any other sign, because he often has so little sense of the 'personal' - including his own 'person'.  Aquarius' ideals often mean too much to him because he hasn't got a sense of himself.  We can, historically, make excuses for the Lincolns and Edisons of the world.  In retrospect, we're glad they were such personal failures, because their humanitarian achievements were proportionally great.  Perhaps that's Aquarius' role in the human family.  But with a little balance, if you're not a Lincoln or an Edison, you can be a human too.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Aquarius Lover</strong><br><br>We've already said quite a bit about the emotional propensities of Aquarius.  Perhaps a little recapping is in order.  Remember what we said about the air signs in general:  they live in the world of ideas, and tend to be frightened by emotion.  This is truer of Aquarius than the other two airy signs because Aquarius is what its called a 'fixed' sign.  This means exactly as it sounds.  Fixity can also be translated as strength, stubbornness, or rigidity, depending on how extreme it is and whether or not that fixity is in agreement with you or not.<br><br>So Aquarius tends to repress his emotions.  He often sees his emotions as a weakness, something embarrassing.  You might deduce from that that he's not the world's most romantic or effusive lover.  He's often charmingly naÃ¯ve in matters of the heart, and displays a winsome clumsiness which falls in weird counterpoint to his usually sophisticated ideas.  In some ways, it's delightful, because he's usually incapable of playing the Don Juan unless he really means it.  And then he's likely to make a somewhat less than suave one.  Aquarius' gifts are not known to lie in the realms of courtship and romance.<br><br>So we can count sincerity of feeling and loyalty among his virtues.  Because he's generally clumsy with emotion, he usually means what he says if he ever does tell you he loves you.  Also, Aquarius is a truth-addict.  This means, on the other hand, that he doesn't like lying, so you can believe him most of the time.  On the other hand, it means you should be careful not to ask for those little declarations of emotional reassurance that lovers need.  Instead of the compliment or reassurance, you might get a pronouncement like,  'Well, to be strictly truthful, I don't actually love you at this moment.'  I once knew an Aquarian man who felt obliged to announce, at various times of the day, whether he did or didn't love me - not for any particular reason except that he felt I ought to always know the truth at all times.  It can be pretty wearing on the ego, to say the least.<br><br>Aquarius' loyalty springs from double-edged sources as well.  On the one hand, he's probably more capable than any other sign of adhering to a promise kept.  So if he promises fidelity, and means it, he very likely will be - because he's loyal to the ideal.  And he does have a lot of self-discipline.  On the other hand, his loyalty also springs from the fact that the realm of romantic escapades isn't really his style.  He's awkward and unsure of himself in it, and often finds it more relaxing and less troublesome to remain loyal because he can get on with what he enjoys the most - things of the mind.  It's not that Aquarius lacks passion.  Not at all.  But he's not particularly sensuous, and often doesn't spend long hours with his erotic fantasies in the way that you would expect of Taurus and Scorpio and even Pisces.  He's busy thinking about the World and what can be done with it.<br><br>To balance the scales more in his favour, Aquarius is a truly interesting companion, and he also knows, more than other signs, how to be a friend.  This should not be underrated.  Friendship often means more to Aquarius than love, partially because he doesn't understand love - it's too complicated and problematic, and he has trouble defining it - and partially because friendship's ideals are easier to uphold.  So Aquarius, man or woman, can be a wonderful friend in all the senses of the word.  He is loyal and honourable, and is capable of much self-sacrifice; he cares about other people, and so long as you don't expect him to participate in your emotional scenes, he's a wonderful listener and a careful, objective advisor.  No friend could be more friendly or tolerant, or understanding.  In marriage or a love relationship, this quality of detached and undemanding friendship is often a true blessing.  It means you can have your own ideas, think your own thoughts, discuss things, have companionship and camaraderie without the clutter of an expectation of roles, or a lot of emotional possessiveness.  Aquarius, although he has as much jealousy in him as anybody else, will very rarely show it.  He will rarely even admit it.  He appears to be the least possessive of lovers.  Don't let it fool you.  But on the other hand, it doesn't intrude.  If he believes in letting his partner have freedom, then by God he'll make sure he grants it, even if it minces his gut to pieces unconsciously.<br><br>If you're looking for a great deal of sentiment and romance, stay away from Aquarius.  You're more likely to have lengthy political and ideological discussions, and very few whispered and sweet nothings.  On the other hand, if you seek a friend as a lover, Aquarius puts the other signs to shame.  He's genuinely interested in people, and genuinely interested in you.  Just don't try the heavily emotional approach.  And buy yourself flowers.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Aquarius Man</strong><br><br>It seems that the psychology of the masculine combines very well with Aquarius to bring out the intellectual bias of the sign.  So the epitome of the Aquarian male is the thinker, the dreamer, the philosopher, the scientist.  Also, the problem men in our society have confronting emotional situations generally is aggravated in Aquarius.  Aquarian women, while they don't handle their own emotions very well, are usually at least aware of them.  But no one is more out of touch with his own feeling nature than the typical Aquarian male.<br><br>So the Aquarian male is often one of the most infuriating people you will ever meet when it comes to relationships.  First of all, the coolness has a lot of pride.  Control of emotion is a big thing for Aquarius.  No matter how much he's hurting, unless he's about to have a breakdown, he will often not grant you the satisfaction of knowing about it.<br><br>Another problem he's got is that he often sees emotion as a demand.  Remember the Aquarian is very big on the idea of freedom.  This is often carried to outlandish extremes in personal relationships.  Typical of it is the Aquarian man who refuses to tell you what day and time you'll see him again - because he doesn't 'believe' in time.  Or the Aquarian man who 'believes' in open relationships, and tells you truthfully (because he believes in truth, and feels everything should be open between you) about the three other lovers you have to compete with.  Not that you asked.  It's just that he believes in truth, and doesn't understand why you should be hurt and make a scene.  It's unreasonable and possessive, and you shouldn't be so self-centred.  Everybody, he will tell you, benefits from it.  Shouldn't we all love each other?  If you love him, you should love his other girlfriends, because they love him too, and heÂ…Well, you know the story.  It can make even the most tolerant lover develop homicidal instincts.<br><br>You may have the sort of Aquarian who simply refuses to discuss personal feelings.  Or he may tell you you're being very 'heavy' and too emotional.  The problem is, he's often grossly hypocritical about all this.  When the tables are turned on him, he's capable of behaving as much like Othello as any Scorpio is.  But he won't be as honest about it, because he'll drag in things like honesty and loyalty and other concepts which damn your behaviour without conceding that the real root of his upset is his feelings, not his principles.<br><br>The only way to deal with this kind of Aquarian is to out-Aquarian him.  That means challenging his beliefs, so that he can find out whether he really believes in them or not.  If it means being a little unpredictable yourself, or requesting your own freedom of behaviour.  Remember that this is a fixed sign.  Fixed signs aren't adaptable; they don't adjust easily to other people.  They have their own world, their own values.  They don't like being pushed.  That reforming instinct in Aquarius simply doesn't apply when you try to reform him.  You've got to have a good deal of your own detachment, and some source of creative life of your own, if you want to make a relationship work with an Aquarian.  He's not prepared to put that much into relationships on an emotional level.  You simply have to get used to it, and learn to read his signals, not his words.  A good deal of the time, what Aquarian says about his feelings should not be taken literally.  You can take his word for it on his ideological views, or his special subject of study.  He's pretty reliable there, and usually knows what he's doing.  About his own emotions he usually knows very little.  Learn to use your instincts, and learn a little telepathy.  But don't expect an honest expression; you'll get what he calls honesty, which usually has nothing to do with it, because in this realm he isn't very honest with himself.<br><br>On the other hand, expect a good deal of unconscious emotional dependency.  That independent spirit, with his mental mind in the clouds and his eyes on the future, is more sensitive than he can ever know.  He's terribly vulnerable emotionally, rather childlike, which is why he takes such great pains to mask his emotions from everybody including himself.  He would consider it weakness.  If you need overt displays of it, avoid Aquarius.  If you're confident enough in yourself to know you're worth loving, and can appreciate the friendship this man offers, you're fine.  And who knows?  You may even reform him, within reason.<br></div>

Both are reliable and trustworthy.<br><br><strong>The Taurus Woman</strong><br><br>As the bull is a supremely masculine creature, the cow is supremely female.  Sometimes, in modern usage, cowlike is considered to mean dull, slow, boring.  But the Greeks saw the cow differently; they named the goddess of love and desire, Venus, the Cow-Eyed.  And the Egyptians also had a cow-goddess, Hathor, a symbol of the fertility of the earth and of woman.  The female Taurus is often the epitome of the instinctual feminine - the dream-image of many men, and with all the softness, strength, wisdom, patience and passion of her goddess antecedents.<br><br>There seem to be two distinct types of Taurus woman.  The first is the real Venusian Taurus.  These are the lovely ones, with perfect complexions, surrounded by beautiful scent, dressed in sensuous, expensive clothes.  Janet Reger probably does a thriving business in glamorous pure silk, underclothes for the Taurus women of this world.  Pampered, indolent, sensuous, and very concerned both with their own attractiveness and their capacity to please a man, they owe a lot to the old temple priestesses in the days when the power of the earth goddess represented the power of life itself.  This kind of Taurus woman is the ideal feminine for men.  Her problem is that she often doesn't do much, or think much, of anything else.<br><br>The Venus Taurean woman is devoted, and usually loyal - provided you give her security, and take care of her, and pamper her.  She will offer everything of herself, and her tenacity and faithfulness is admirable.  Sometimes it's too admirable; try to release yourself from a relationship with a Taurean woman like this, and you have to be either very callous or give up, since she'll hang on with that incredible Taurean tenacity until you give up and come back out of sheer exhaustion.  Taurus women can wait; and they often do wait, and wait, and wait, for the commitment or the promise.  As we mentioned earlier, Taurus is attracted to fire.  Many Taurus women are fascinated by the fiery types - unfortunately, the least reliable of all the men of the zodiac.  They love glamour and success and a little dash, a little fleet-of-foot unpredictability.  They themselves are willing and ready to play earth mother.  Be sure you want an earth mother.  Flirtatious at the beginning, Taurus settles into stability very easily and quickly.  The benefits of the care and love of a Taurus woman are inestimable.  If you prize your freedom, however, try another sign, like Gemini or Aquarius.<br><br>The other type of Taurus woman is the 'natural' type.  She is still an earth-mother and her qualities of devotion, gentleness, steadfastness and strength are as much present here, perhaps more so.  But these are the women who eschew make-up, eat healthily, live in the country, despise cigarette smoke, and want to go back to the old ways of life.  If you have that secret fantasy of the cottage in the country covered with climbing roses with your own horse stabled in the field behind, and the lovely smell of fresh-baked bread wafting out from the kitchen, this kind of Taurus woman is for you.  Be careful, though, if you get fidgety easily.   If you like to travel, give her at least three months' notice.  And don't, for God's sake, change plans at the last minute.<br><br>Taurus women are often very literal.  That is, they believe what you say, and hold you to it the next day.  If you're one of those people who change their mind a lot, be careful.  Taurus is capable at hurling at you, 'But you said you loved me.'  'But that was a year ago,' you reply.  So what?' retorts Taurus.  'You promised.'  And so it goes.  If you promise, mean it.  She simply doesn't understand, otherwise.  And you get cast in the role of the bastard.<br><br>No matter what the Taurus woman goes through - from expensive call-girl to business manager - there is an innate naÃ¯vetÃ© and wholesomeness, a naturalness, that experience doesn't seem to be able to quench.  Even the Taurus woman, whose practical abilities and business acumen and persistence have led her to build a career for herself in the world, possesses this naÃ¯vetÃ©.  Simplicity is perhaps a kinder word.  It can be both - charming ingenuousness or infuriating literalness.  But the great gift of the Taurus woman is her ability to keep things within the realm of common sense, whether it's in a domestic environment or at a job.  Her eye for the realistic, the stable, the reliable, is inerringly accurate.  She's a poor judge of people, because people are more complex and have layers.  Her eye for facts of a tangible kind is fantastically accurate.  And her common sense is a wonderful elixir for the jaded visionary who has seen so many possibilities, and dissipated so many talents, that he can't see the point any longer.  Taurus brings things down to earth.  And because it's a gentle sign, it's likely to be a soft landing.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Leo<br><br>He's not just anybody, after all.<br>He's himself, at whatever cost.  </strong><br><br>Leo's public relations staff have been very busy in sun-sign columns, portraying the king of Beasts as the top of the heap.  After all, his ruler is the sun, the Great Light as it is called in medieval astrology.  So we have the traditional portrait of Leo:  mane flying, radiating confidence and sunshine, ready to outshare and outshine any foe, loving himself, life, and the applause of the crowd.  Most Leos do their best to help cultivate this image.  They will be the last to tell you it isn't what the sign is really about.  But it isn't.<br><br>A reminder might be useful here how to read sun-signs in the horoscope.  Being born under a particular sign, or having a lot of planets or the ascendant placed there, doesn't automatically show that you are those things, that you have those qualities full-blown and ready to display in the shop window.  It means that there is a reservoir of potential innate in you, something to strive toward.  You grow into your chart, just as a seed grows into full plant.  The stars correspond to us, reflect us, have a connection with us, but they don't fate us.<br><br>If you see someone with lots of Leo in his chart, don't make the mistake of thinking that he's confident, radiant, egocentric, creative, self-assured.  It means he is trying to develop confidence in himself, trying to radiate himself outward into his environment, trying to find out who he is, trying to express his creativity.  And because these goals are likely to be terribly, intensely important to him, he will spend a lot of time and energy developing them.  But Leo, confident?  Hardly.  His problem is usually just the opposite, which is why he spends so much time thinking about himself.  After all, if you look in the mirror and there's nobody home, what meaning can you find in life?<br><br>Leo is a fiery sign.  The element of fire is concerned about all else with the discovery and fulfillment of future possibilities.  In Aries, these possibilities have to do with action, with leadership, with challenge.  In Leo, these possibilities have to do with his fulfilling his own peculiar myth.  And you don't have to go far to discover Leo's myth.  There is a wonderful book on the meaning of mythology by Joseph Campbell, called the Hero With a Thousand Faces.  There's Leo:  the hero or heroine, in a thousand different guises, playing a thousand different roles, disguised as somebody you know, or maybe even yourself.  Beneath the apparent worldliness and bombast of the fire signs there always lies a secret child, who mythologizes life.  And Leo, more than the other two fire signs, loves to make a myth out of himself.  He is so idealistic it can make you cry.  Even the Leo who cloaks himself in the cynicism of the world is really a romantic to the core.  And Leo's idealism frequently makes him cry as well, since he's inclined - being rather fixed in temperament - to become fairly solid (put euphemistically) in his attitudes and ways of thinking.  In other words, Leo tends to envision life in a certain way - and that way is usually coloured by all the charm and romanticism of King Arthur's court - and once his got his vision, he really doesn't appreciate having to change it.  It takes a lot to convince him that life is not the fairy tale he thought, where villains are always recognizably and utterly good, where the hero always wins and the villain loses, where the beautiful rescued princess is suitably grateful and adoring.<br><br>Sometimes villains and heroes, much to Leo's chagrin, have subtle shadings of grey, and are not easily definable.  Leo has a kind of black-and-white perception which doesn't readily accommodate the complexities and subtleties of human nature.  And those beautiful princesses have a nasty habit, particularly lately, of not wanting to be rescued at all, since they're learning how to do it themselves.  What can a poor lion do?  Leo courts shock after shock on the plane of real life.  Like the other two fire signs, his intuition works overtime and tells him about he creative possibilities whereby he can live out his myth as hero, creator, sustainer, protector of the weak.  It's a tough role to play these days, since people can be so damned unappreciative.  Even in King Arthur's time they aren't always willing to play the game.  So Leo usually collides mane first with some aspects of life he doesn't like very much.  But if he sticks to his inner vision of himself, and relinquish his demands that the rest of the world conform to his ideals, it may one day dawn on him that he is indeed the hero, on a quest for his own Self, and that the rich love of life which blooms in him is not wasted because he has to make a few adjustments to reality.<br><br>The tendency to cling to the ideal and become bewildered when it doesn't match reality is most visible in Leo's relationships.  Both in business and in love, in the family and with friends, he is perpetually baffled by the pettiness, ambiguity, jealousy, and general nastiness that abound in the human psyche.  Not that he doesn't possess these attributes himself.  But Leo will usually make an enormous effort to be honourable in his dealings with others, because that's the knightly code.  Quite right, he's a living anachronism.  There are Leos walking around where you can virtually hear the clank of armour and see the heraldic banners waving in the breeze.  Loyalty is terribly important to Leo, and honour - a word whose meaning has become rather tarnished in the marketplace these days.  It's perfectly understandable why the lion may so often be found with the hurt, disillusioned look on his noble face.<br><br>In the big, bold, colourful world in which Leo lives, the intrusion of the small and the banal are not welcome.  Leo needs to paint his canvas with large, unrestricted strokes.  Whenever some new, original idea is needed, wherever an impact must be made, wherever some new creative possibility can be envisioned, there'll you'll find Leo.  Freddie Laker is a characteristic Leo.  Who would have thought that one man, without the enormous funds and hierarchy of the large airlines behind him, could have succeeded in setting up his Skytrain service with such flair?  Notice the ads for his flights.  Often you get to see the picture of Sir Freddie himself, smiling and promising his customers the best possible service available.  There's the Leo touch:  the personal stamp.  No cold, impersonal photo of a big, powerful plane as you find with commercial airlines.  No, you get to see the man himself.  A little exhibitionist?  Of course.  But that's part of Leo's charm, too - the more distinctive and individual he can be, the happier he is.  Some Leos carry this to the most outlandish extremes.  Napoleon, for example, wanted to conquer the world.  But you'll notice that wherever it's said that something can't be done, there you'll find a Leo determined to do it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The trouble with all these big, bold, colourful strokes on the canvas of life is that somebody has to clean the paintbrushes and wash up the paint tins afterward.  And also during.  And you can be pretty sure it won't be a Leo, who feels trapped and miserable when he has to deal with the details of everyday life.  When you read mythology, you don't often find the hero considering what chemist he should visit for his mouthwash so that he's acceptable to the princess.  No, details like that aren't part of the mythological world.  Who ever heard of King Arthur shopping at Marks and Spencer to save a quid or two on chain mail?  You may have heard that Leo is extravagant.  Yes, that's perfectly true.  His extravagance stems from two sources:  firstly, he loves things to be quality, beautiful and luxurious, as well as distinctive and stylish.  Secondly, he can't be bothered to see whether there's enough in the account to cover it.  Leo resents having to adjust, and hates limitations.  If he wants something, he believes he ought to have it.  Save?  Budget?  Don't be silly.  Somehow it'll get covered.<br><br>Leo's intuition also gives him an unquenchable optimism.  Find him on the dole and he'll have his mind focused years ahead when he'll be on top again.  The trouble with all this is that in the meantime it's always somebody else who has to do his worrying for him.  It might be reasonable to say that Leo behaves as though he needs a twenty-four-hour secretarial and accounting service at his disposal.  Now your more successful Leo might have this very thing, and life is truly a myth for him, since he can indulge his fancies as he pleases.  For the more limited Leo, life can be hell.  Or he'll make it hell for his partner, who's the one stuck for reminding him he's got a doctor's appointment, reminding him he owes an electricity bill, reminding him to take his clothes to the cleaners, reminding himÂ….You probably have the picture.  Leos can give the impression, quite unconsciously, that they expect to be taken care of and cleaned up after, because they're concerned with much more important things.<br><br>This can naturally become a classic scenario, and often does.  Leo, being a fiery sign, is often attracted into relationships with earthy partners, who seem to offer the stability and realism he needs to complement his big dreams.  But you should listen to those earthy partners complain:  Why do you always assume you have more important things to do and leave me to clean up the mess afterward?  It really isn't deliberate autocracy.  Remind a Leo that he is behaving badly and he'll usually be both astonished and hurt.  He doesn't mean to treat people like a crowd of courtiers.  But his mind is so often in the future, or in his imaginary world of creative vision, or on the big picture, that he fails to notice the difficulties he makes for others.  Yet his gifts are often so outstanding that others make allowances for him.  For a while.<br><br>This connects with another curious facet of Leo's psychology.  Because of the slightly dramatized world he lives in, he often can't conceive of the fact that the world outside doesn't orbit around him like his inner one does.  So it's often difficult for him to realize that life goes on without him.  He needs to feel important to himself, and often tries to find his sense of self-esteem by being important to others.  When they don't notice him, he's hurt.  Objectivity is not one of Leo's strong points.  I once had a friend - a double Leo, both sun and moon being placed there - who, one day finding his tennis shoes too tight, cut off the toes.  A couple of days later, a new fashion appeared in the shoe shops (it was Hollywood, the natural habitat of many Leos) - open-toed boots.  My Leo friend observed this phenomenon with a certain charming mixture of amazement and complacency, and then said in utter seriousness, 'I wish people aren't always copying me like that.'<br><br>There you have it.  The thing is, people do frequently copy Leos, because they often have style and charisma; and it's easy to see how a little personality inflation goes a long way.  Nothing in the world is quite so important to Leo as his own world.  It is genuinely painful and difficult for him to see beyond the lens of his own consciousness, and comprehend that other people are truly different, think and feel differently, and most importantly, that they have a right to be different.  At heart Leo is the Divine Child of the zodiac.  And to a child, the world is a mysterious and exciting extension of himself.  The sun shines for him, the clouds rain on him, and good and bad luck are personally related to the heavens favouring or disliking him rather than being either products of his own efforts or the tracks of random chance.<br><br>Leo men and women often find it very difficult to share the stage.<br><br>Sharing it with somebody else means taking away the possibilities for their own creative expression.  It also means being limited, because they must adjust to somebody else's needs and feelings.  So Leo will always find ways, overt or subtle - and there are many subtle Leos about who don't really look like Leos, but actually just as true to their sign as the more charismatic ones - to claim back the space which has been usurped.  If you are the timid and secretly resentful type, stay away from Leo.  Fire signs are not known for their sensitivity to the feeling currents around them, and they don't make good telepaths of other people's needs if those needs aren't voiced.  Leo may inadvertently trample over others' feelings without ever meaning to, or ever realizing it, simply because he's so caught up in his own vision.  Therefore, you have to make a noise, if you want a piece of the stage.  If you have set a precedent of ten years of meek subservience and then discover you've got a stomach ulcer or migraine headaches because you're seething with anger over Leo's clumsy insensitivity, blame yourself.  Remember the child.  Although he loves to preen and appear to others in the height of style, Leo is terrified of being unloved, mediocre, unappreciated, unnoticed.  And his pride will often not permit him to admit it.<br><br>It's something difficult to understand that these flamboyant, always individualistic people are not always the extroverts they seem.  Leo is often shy and deeply introverted, but depends so ferociously upon the love and acceptance of others that he will do virtually anything to earn their approval.  It is a problem of identity.  The first task that challenges Leo in life is the issue of who he is, why he is here, why he is uniquely himself.  It's a lifelong challenge.  If he can't muster the self-esteem he needs from his inner resources, he'll crave it like a drug from the audience.  But his real journey is within, into the source of his own being.  Leo at heart is a religious sign, using the word here as its originally meant:  to reconnect.  It is the secret of his intense need to create something which mirrors his own essential substance - be it a company, a book, a painting, a political movement, an airline, a scientific achievement, an empire, a photograph.  It is in this process of creating that he finds his real sense of self-value.  Leo is a disaster when he tries to follow the advice and instruction of others.  A lifetime of following will often kill him with heart disease and frustration.  He needs, in some way, to create something, however small, that is wholly and completely his own.<br><br>From others, Leo requires the same nobility that he strives for himself.  He can be an intolerable perfectionist both with others and with his own behaviour.  Nothing less will do.  Shatter his dream and you cause him pain; but pain is the only thing that shakes him out of his pride and complacency.  His heart is that of a noble knight.  But he needs realism and earthy wisdom, and above all a sense of humour about himself and his own foibles.  Heroes, in myths and fairy tales, are not the funny characters.  That role is left to the court jester.  It seems that when Leo learns how to be the jester himself, and can laugh at himself a little, his true nobility emerges.  Flexibility is important, too, for him to learn, for he often lacks this as well.  Most of all, he needs faith in himself, in what he stands for, in what he is trying to become.  Leo is the most human, the noblest, the most tragic - in the ancient Greek sense - of the signs.  This is because the sign is the epitome of Man, that bewildered creature who is half-animal and half-god, and who has not yet understood either his own origins or the fact that the world is populated with other human beings different from himself.  The Leo who learns this is indeed the hero.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Leo Lover</strong><br><br>Love makes the world go round for Leo.  And love, like every other experience in life, is something mythical to him, something which must be dramatized to the utmost.  Love too must be big, bold, spectacular and dramatic.  He's a romantic and a generous one; and one of his ways of showing love is to lavish gifts on the loved one.<br><br>And those gifts aren't just ordinary run-of-the-mill boxes of chocolates.  They're more likely to be expensive, exotic, and difficult to obtain; and usually they're things which are meant to be worn so that someone else can admire them.  For the love of God, show your appreciation.  A Leo who's gone through a great deal of trouble to present his loved one with a gift can be totally crushed and humiliated if the gift isn't acknowledged with suitable enthusiasm.  Leo is a better giver than he is a receiver.  He genuinely loves to give.  But he never does favours offhandedly; there's a self-consciousness about them, and he needs to be thanked.<br><br>Leo's ideals in love are different, however, from Libra, the other sign which is concerned about all else with love and relationship.  For Libra, love is an exchange, a partnership, a meeting of two different individuals.  For Leo, it's a creative act, and he's the sun at the centre. Sometimes you can get the distinct feeling, in the midst of Leo's romance, that he's so in love with being in love, and so in love with the lovely image of his love, that somehow he's missed noticing you.  It's a common Leonine problem in love affairs.  The partner feels sort of left out of the whole thing, unless he or she is one of those people who also has the knack of stepping in and out of the fairytale landscape.<br><br>But apart from this problem - and it may be little or big, depending upon the Leo - the lion is really the ideal lover.  Male or female, the gift of making a love affair magical, something special, is one of Leo's special qualities.  He can always make you feel as if it's the first time anyone in the world has ever been in love.  He loves with style, and without inhibition.  And it's in his nature to be loyal, too; for although the lion can be vain, and loves to be admired by the opposite sex, he is basically a constant partner, and has an idealistic vision of love as something which endures.  If he loves he will move the earth.  (If he doesn't love, he will often use).<br><br>Of course, he needs something in exchange for all that loyalty.  For one thing, he needs loyalty in return.  Leo, male or female, is a jealous cat, and won't tolerate smaller fry pursuing his chosen mate.  He can be very obvious and not a little rude about insulting or removing challengers.  In a way he enjoys the contest, provided he's on safe ground, since this kind of knightly combat suits his image.  What he can't endure is betrayal, which is deeply wounding and rarely forgiven.  Leo has a naÃ¯ve heart, and a wonderfully soaring idealism.  Betrayal of trust is a horrific thing to him.  Where Capricorn expects it and Scorpio suspects it constantly, Leo simply can't believe it.  He'll rarely look below the surface at why.  To him it's a cardinal sin, the worst sin you can commit.  And you'll not be given a second chance very often to do it again.<br><br>If you want to understand just how deep this sense of honour and loyalty goes in Leo, consider the attitudes in love and war during the Age of Chivalry.  France has always epitomized the chivalric code; and a French knight, when taken once in battle during the Hundred Years War, discovered that his captor was a mere peasant, of lower rank than himself.  The French knight proceeded to knight his captor, so that they could be of equal rank, so that his own knightly rank wouldn't be insulted.  Now, that's Leo.  It's said that France is ruled by this sign, and one can well believe it if one reads a little French history.  And the French attitude toward love is typically Leonine:  it's an art.<br><br>Leo not only expects loyalty and fidelity.  He or she also expects to be treated like a king or queen.  Now, this is a sword which cuts two ways.  On the one hand, Leo can be so lovable that you want to treat him like royalty anyway.  On the other hand, that I, the King routine can sometimes be a little annoying, because it goes with a double standard.  Now, it may be a little unfair to say so, but in spite of this Leo seems to operate on a double standard basis much of the time.  (How else could he be, when his primary motivation is his own self-realization?)  But it's sometimes difficult to remind Leo gently that what's good for him is also good for you.  He's apt to forget it.<br><br>Leo also offers, in exchange for the loyalty and love he seeks so intensely, a wonderfully protective quality.  Male or female, Leo will fight for the person he loves, and defend them loyally.  He can be protective and supportive and terribly caring, and is not averse to making some pretty big sacrifices on behalf of his love.  (The little sacrifices are sometimes harder for him).  But when it comes to big gestures, Leo won't baulk.  He can be completely self-sacrificing, and give up everything, and never begrudge it.<br><br>All in all, Leo's love affairs and marriages are interesting but rarely smooth.  He's too temperamental a creature, and his visions and ideas are too big to be able to avoid inevitable conflicts in the smaller realms of living.  Leo doesn't get along with the mundane reality of relationships and the inconsistency and limitations of human nature.  What Leo wants is the total love, the mythological love, the love that was sang in the troubadours' songs six centuries ago.  In one sense, that kind of love doesn't exist; and Leo usually suffers disappointment in love somewhere along the line because of it.  On the other hand, this symbol of the power of the heart is also a reality on another level, and no sign is as capable as Leo is of bringing the world of myth into the ordinary one, to gently remind other mortals that they're also heroes and princesses.  If you're around someone who tries to be a walking myth all the time, you begin to realize that myths are all around you; and a relationship with Leo can convince you that fairytales aren't so silly after all.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Leo Man</strong><br><br>You might expect the Leo man to be slightly larger than life.  He usually is.  Sometimes it's in the obvious way - his creative talent, or his success, or his flamboyant personality.  Leo often radiates charisma - and whether you like him or not, you're likely to notice him.  Sometimes the quieter, more introverted type of Leo appears on the scene, and doesn't make a great roar about his own uniqueness.  But if you get to know him, you'll find that inwardly he's just the same, and the same need for mythologizing his own life exists deep within him.  Don't be fooled by quiet, shy Leos.  They may have more restrained ascending signs, like Cancer or Capricorn or Virgo.  But they're lions nonetheless.  And that quality of intense self-consciousness, of always feeling as though the stage is under their feet and the audience watching, permeates even the most introverted Leo.<br><br>Because he lives so much in his visions, the Leo man is often attracted to an earthier partner.  This can be a wonderfully creative combination, and it can also be a disaster.  Where it works, the Leo man looks for his stabilizing influence in his partner, and maybe achieves a measure of realism and contact with reality through her - by approaching her own more earthy outlook.  Where it's a disaster, it usually springs from Leo's tendency to undervalue detail and the things of ordinary life.  When he takes this stance, he's liable to treat his women as though they were in his life to clean up after him and remind him of his eleven o'clock appointment.  You usually wind up with a very angry and resentful partner.<br><br>Leo the romantic can sweep you off your feet.  His attitude toward love is neither timorous nor restrained, and those grand gestures - whether they're gifts or magical journeys to magical holiday places or dramatic declarations of emotion - are irresistible.  A Leo man can make a woman feel completely feminine and desirable.  And it's fairly typical for the Leo man to have a fairly long and insistent crowd of admirers and pursuers.  Even if he's not a conventionally handsome or successful man, there's something about him that women find fascinating.  Leo is a very male creature.  There's nothing ambiguous about him.  He can often be the archetypal male, and women's liberation notwithstanding, it's pretty difficult to resist that kind of magnetism.<br><br>Where the difficulties arise is later.  Once upon a time, in an age when roles were fairly rigid and women had little opportunity and perhaps little desire to live beyond those roles, the Leo male would have, from any point of view, been anybody's ideal image of manhood.  For that matter, he still is.  The problem is that society has changed and people have changed:  and it has become increasingly apparent that men have a feminine component to their psyches and women a masculine component.  The need to express this opposite within oneself is increasingly a demand of our culture.  And this is where Leo finds his difficulties, because he doesn't warm much to the idea of having a woman with a life that ranges beyond him at the centre.  Many Leo men become intensely resentful when a woman shows too much interest or too much commitment to a career, a creative pursuit, or simply an independent array of interests, hobbies or ideas.  Leo needs to feel that he's the sun around which your moon orbits; if you suddenly take off and start shining with a light of your own, he's liable to get a little sullen at best, and at worst to stifle your individuality because his own is threatened.  It's a rare Leo - though it's both possible and happens regularly - who cannot only acknowledge the need for independent creative expression in his mate, but also his own need for an individual partner.  He can only do this if he's standing firm on a ground of self-confidence and self-esteem.  Otherwise, he can be pretty difficult to be around, since anything you do that doesn't place him at the centre is looked upon as a betrayal.<br><br>The Leo man has probably more harmonious relationships with the more fluid signs - Gemini, Pisces, Virgo, Sagittarius, perhaps Libra.  This is because he's basically a fixed creature; he doesn't change his habits or his viewpoints easily, and certainly not because someone else has told him to.  If you try to change or push a Leo man, you're wasting your time.  He can be stubborn to a maddening degree, and his pride will rarely allow him to acknowledge the wisdom of your advice.  His business is to give advice, not receive it.  On the other hand, faith in him, belief in his dreams, confidence in his hopes, and acceptance of his sometimes childlike need for constant reassurance and attention, can work wonders.  A Leo who knows he's believed in can achieve miracles, outside in the world and inside within himself.<br><br>If you're the more independent or self-contained type, Leo can be a big problem for you.  He requires lots of time, love, attention, and devotion.  He wouldn't be half so interesting and charismatic if he were the self-effacing type, anyway.  Besides, who ever heard of a hero who hid in the background while his lady fought the battles?  Extreme women's libbers should stay away from this animal, for although Leo usually loves women and loves loving women, he expects his woman to be a woman first of all.  If your need is to be recognized as an individual first and a woman second - which is fair enough for many women - you're going to see a little fur fly if you try to make a home with the king of the beasts.  On the other hand, if you're the self-effacing martyr-like type, Leo isn't for you either, because he likes you to be as royal as he is.  It reflects back on himself, and he needs to take pride in his partner.  A difficult but lively relationship is likely to be yours if you're involved with Leo.  It's never an easy sign - far too temperamental.  But nothing can match Leo when it comes to sheer life and vitality and colour.  And if you want to have a partner you respect and take pride in, then Leo's probably a good choice for you.  He's just not anybody, after all.  He's himself, at whatever cost.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Leo Woman</strong><br><br>Meek, mild, colourless and self-effacing this lady is not.  She's a queen, and expects to be treated like one.  Even the more repressed Leo woman will show this side of her nature, although it may be heavily disguised under socially acceptable manifestations of good behaviour.  The truth is that the Leo woman is intensely individual and not very good at being everybody's favorite model of conventionality.  More often than not she'll be a troublemaker, or a woman who causes people to gossip about her.  She has an intense need to live her own life in her own way, and that life has got to have a little colour and a little dynamism to it.  Have you ever watched caged lionesses in a zoo, pacing back and forth and back and forth, their eyes furious and glaring, because they haven't got room to stretch out and run?  That's what happens to the Leo woman when she's caged either by social expectations or a limiting relationship.<br><br>The Leo woman needs some place to express her creative impulses.  Whether these are in the form of artistic talent, organizational ability, public relations ability, or whatever, she needs to be somebody special, and to do something extremely well that will earn her some sort of recognition.  Recognition is as necessary to the Leo woman as the Leo man.  If the Leo woman doesn't find an outlet, she's liable to try to get recognition either by getting every available male to fall in love with her, or by trying to play Pygmalion and shaping the lives of her husband and children.  And exacting due recognition from them later for all she's done.  This dynamic, energetic woman must have a stage on which to perform.  Otherwise, she's liable to throw you off yours.<br><br>Leo women are often highly competitive.  This may be in their field of work, where they need to shine.  The Leo woman shouldn't have to be in a position of answering to somebody else all the time; she needs room to work with her own ideas, and come up with her own designs.  Often Leo women are also highly competitive with their own sex, and it isn't really a sign that makes for good sisterhood unless the other sisters are willing to play Greek chorus to the main role.  The Leo woman must have the role of leading lady.  It's very typical to find her with a bevy of friends who all lean on her and need her advice and help.  In part, it's because she's strong and also generous, and needs to be needed.  In part, it's because she doesn't like competition.<br><br>Often Leo women extend this tendency to be the support to a weaker role into their relationships.  You often see Leo women with some gentle and pleasant and basically indecisive men, who worships at their feet and gives them the devotion they need so badly, and who is also willing to be moulded.  Many Leo women are afraid of stronger men, because they need to dominate; and this can be a great problem, because while it satisfies the Leonine needs it denies the feminine ones.  And all too often the pattern in relationship is for the Leo woman to take charge, to make the decisions, to be the strong partner, and then to bitterly blame the man for being weak when she in fact has never given him a chance to be otherwise.<br><br>This is why it's so essential for the Leo woman to have some area of life where she can shine independent of her family.  If this need is satisfied elsewhere, then she can relate to the people close to her in a less compulsive way.<br><br>The Leo woman is also very concerned with the image she gives in society.  You won't often find her mousey and self-effacing; she's more likely to dress dramatically, act dramatically, and attract attention because of her sheer style and charisma.  Take a Leo like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.  Self-effacing she's not.  She has a Scorpio ascendant, so is perhaps more underplayed than many Leo actresses and performers; but style is terribly important to her, and so is her dignity.  Leo women don't like to play the fool or the victim.  Their pride is ferocious.<br><br>Their gifts lie both in their capacity to be so intensely individual and so intensely alive, and in their loyalty and generosity to those they care about.  Even more than the Leo man, the Leo woman is likely to offer devotion and steadfast love in relationships - provided she's treated well.  But that's not fair enough, because she's somebody special and she knows it.  Never, never, never take Leo for granted.  The lioness has claws, and isn't averse to making a scene that would make more socially inhibited signs turn white and cold with shock.  If you're looking for a woman who is also an individual, an individual to the hilt, then you'll like Leo.  In fact, you'll even love Leo, for it's a sign that inspires intense responses.  One thing that won't happen:  you're not likely to overlook her.<br></div>
