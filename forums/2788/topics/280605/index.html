Drink, smoke and sleep alone.<br><br>The only good thing to come out of all these is you have no one to nag at you. At the same time, the only reason your phone rings at all is work related.

Nobody is going to spend it with you anyway. So you pre empt the misery and start 'booking' friends.<br><br>On lucky weeks, between Friday and Sunday at least one friend will be free from their partners to spare you one coffee session.<br><br>That is when you actually get to communicate and talk to somebody. Imagine a bad day at work and you need to whine to somebody when you come home. Or you make exciting progress and need to share it with somebody. When you're single, you have nobody except friends.

Maybe you should dress up a bit so you don't look shi*ty in town. But you wonder what's the point in dressing up if nobody is going out with you? You end up feeling bitter so you rent DVDs from the neighbourhood, drink, eat chips, surf the net. This is what they call, a RUT.<br><br>Sunday arrives and no sex still. But at least you feel purposeful and celibate. You sleep in all day. Read magazines. Run your errands and run back home because you're still single and it's still the weekend.<br><br>At night listen to Class 95 and wonder why you're single. Congratulate yourself for having survived yet another single weekend. Yet you feel bitter because after a hard week at work, you don't even have the balls to reward yourself with a movie night out. So you drink a little and smoke a bit go to bed.<br><br>Dog week repeats until you're out of work again which makes it all even worse.

Drag yourself to work. Come home at night, all meals are take outs, after a few years they all taste the same. All wanton mee, chicken rice, mixed vegetable rice, duck rice, prata, they all taste the same. The crux is, you queue up for food alone. Go home and eat alone. Watch TV alone. Shower. Surf the net. Drink, smoke and sleep alone.<br><br>The only good thing to come out of all these is you have no one to nag at you. At the same time, the only reason your phone rings at all is work related. Nobody else calls to ask you about your day. Nobody wonders where you. Nobody misses you.<br><br>***<br><br>By Wednesday you start panicking and dreading Friday (because Friday is the day everybody screams TGIF whereas you don't know what there is to be thankful for). Nobody is going to spend it with you anyway. So you pre empt the misery and start 'booking' friends.<br><br>On lucky weeks, between Friday and Sunday at least one friend will be free from their partners to spare you one coffee session.<br><br>That is when you actually get to communicate and talk to somebody. Imagine a bad day at work and you need to whine to somebody when you come home. Or you make exciting progress and need to share it with somebody. When you're single, you have nobody except friends. If your friends are all attached, then better luck next weekend.<br><br>***<br><br>Friday - Sunday:<br><br>Friday comes, you go home and contemplate the weekend. You want to go and catch a movie. But all your friends are attached and busy. You contemplate watching it alone. But you refuse to parade solo on a weekend in town, couples all over gnashing at your single hood. Maybe you should dress up a bit so you don't look shi*ty in town. But you wonder what's the point in dressing up if nobody is going out with you? You end up feeling bitter so you rent DVDs from the neighbourhood, drink, eat chips, surf the net. This is what they call, a RUT.<br><br>Sunday arrives and no sex still. But at least you feel purposeful and celibate. You sleep in all day. Read magazines. Run your errands and run back home because you're still single and it's still the weekend.<br><br>At night listen to Class 95 and wonder why you're single.
