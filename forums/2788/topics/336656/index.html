              <p class="subheading">The Hidden Qualities Women Love in Men</p>
              <p>A man women love is comfortable no matter what. When a situation is
              against him, he is able to come out stronger. He does not require
              women’s or other guy’s approval. He has integrity and never diverts
              from it. He does not do everything a women wants thus leading her to
              have all the power. He challenges her thoughts and behaviors as not
              being good enough for him. He balances cockiness with humor. He is able
              to tease, be funny about it, and build attraction.</p>
              <p>Balancing the cockiness with humor is something called “cocky and
              funny”. This shows your confidence and high value using humor, two
              extremely attractive qualities to a lady.</p>
              <p>An example of cocky and funny can be picking something up unusual
              about her and busting her for it. Say she is going out to a party, you
              haven’t been invited, and she has a somewhat large bag (it doesn’t have
              to be really large). You can bust on her by saying “That bag is huge.
              Do you have a bomb in there and am going to blow up the party or
              something? I’m glad I’m not going.”</p>
              <p>This example is funny, gives you the power, and you show her you do
              not need her approval. It won’t make her come chasing after you but
              it’s what you need to constantly keep doing to build attraction.</p>
              <p>The other day a lady complimented me on how good I looked (I’m not
              actually that good looking. It’s just that I was teasing her and the
              only response she would have known to feeling attraction is to be
              nice). What a wuss would have done is reciprocated the compliment by
              telling her something good about herself or he would have just said
              “thankyou” and let the situation fizzle down. I knew this was an
              opportunity to keep building her tension. I looked at her in a calm
              manner, said “Thank you. I always do.” and made my eyes trace down her
              body. I saw her shoes which were these strappy things with small heels.
              What I did was than told her she could at least wear better shoes to
              keep up with my standards, “Did you make those shoes this morning with
              strings and some bamboo?” She laughed, loved it, and I loved it. It was
              confident, appropriate, cocky, and funny.</p>
              <p>Another confusing area on what women want in men is chivalry which
              refers to courteous behaviors towards women. Chivalry has never been
              and never will be dead. It is the context of which chivalry is used
              that determines its effectiveness. A powerful magnetic attraction is
              only made when strong behaviors that have been discussed in this
              article are used in combination with chivalrous behavior like:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Opening doors for women.</li>
              <li>Walking on the footpath closest to the road.</li>
              <li>Pulling out a chair for your lady to sit on.</li>
              <li>Buying her a meal not to impress her or to take her out, but
              because you are eating there in the first place regardless of her
              accepting your invitation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Chivalry behavior is not as effective and may even be negative when
              the man who is chivalrous is also a girly-man who sucks up to women.
              Having chivalrous behavior in addition to the other characteristics of
              a manly-man discussed in this article are hidden magnetic qualities
              women love in men.</p>
              <p>Back to other nice-guy qualities that women hate. A nice-guy runs
              after women. He seeks approval begging like a little puppy for
              attention. As a strong word of advice, if you are chasing a woman you
              are not being chased by her. You demonstrate neediness and approval by
              chasing. When you realize this and take control of the overall
              meta-frame (the meaning of the interaction) she then actually begins to
              chase you. Controlling the meta-frame demonstrates your power, internal
              comfort, confidence, and no need for approval, all characteristics
              women are begging for in a man.</p>
              <p>Do not be a traditional nice guy. Keep your power in your
              relationship. Lose the need to control her. Become cocky and funny.
              This will most likely make her attached, needy, and wanting your
              approval. Who would have thought?</p>
              <p>Women desperately want guys with these characteristics and
              especially the more popular and hot women who are flooded with
              nice-guys. These ladies always get nice-guys coming up and
              complimenting them on how beautiful they are. If you talk to a lady who
              has guys coming up to her a few times each week, I can guarantee you
              she is sick of it, hates guys who are intimidated of her, and guys who
              are a “walk-over”.</p>
