              <p>Hope everyone contribute abit to the my question ok? Or whatever you can think of, please write as many as possible. Really appreciate on that.</p>
              <p>Well, if let say you are in a service line? Like working in a restaurant as a waiter/waitress. Or if you are consumer yourself.</p>
              <p>Other than the good service you look forward to, what small little things that you u can do for this restaurant as a waiter/waitress? Or as a consumer what you look forward to this restaurant? </p>
              <p>Example: As a consumer when you walk into the restaurant, you hope that you will have some snacks(eg peanut) on your dining table for free consuming while waiting for your food.  Or you look forward to receive small little free gift? If it is a free gift, what will you like to have?</p>
              <p>So please brainstorm abit for me ok, no right or wrong answer just give me what you really hope for? Be it a waiter/waitress or even if you are a consumer yourself what you really want or what can be done?</p>
              <p>Yup, that's about it. So i be counting on you guys. :D</p>

              <p>service stall must be professional... They will achieve this when they take pride in their work... Unhappy and unmotivated staff usually cant achieve this becoz they couldn't be bothered... only wanna go work, off work then take pay... -________-</p>
              <p>1) When asked abt soup of the day, daily special, card discount all tat, they shld know on the spot...</p>
              <p>2) When ask for recommendation, they are able to describe and recommend accordingly...</p>
              <p>3) Always keep a smile.</p>
              <p>4) Do not walk and talk at the same time, IE: "I'm sorry, your order is being process" - while walking away... Instead, stop at your track, attend to the customer, assuring them their order is being processed and make them feel like that they are your valued customer...</p>

              <p>a. Always offer a smile. It puts people at ease. Even if your customers give you a dour face like pangsai, smile at them and be extra nice to them. People with shit face usually are having problems in their lives, so the small, tiny act of smiling can help to make them feel better. Trust me, it works. I had a horrible morning before cause I fought with someone and had the foulest mood and face on, and when I went in to Starbucks at Simei, the staff there greeted me with a friendly 'good morning, welcome to starbucks!' and gave the biggest grins ever. That helped to make me forget about my sourness for a moment because I was taken aback at the change of atmosphere and smiled back politely, which did help ameliorate my mood a little. Therefore, smile. (:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b. Know your items well. Recommend things that the customer would like based on their preferences.</p>
              <p>c. If it's a restaurant and the customer has to wait, offer free complimentary tea, coffee, water or soft drinks while waiting, as well as some mini munchies like, peanuts, crackers, bread, etc.</p>
              <p>d. Make sure our service tax is worth it. Many a times I've been to restaurants that charge us service tax and can't fucking be bothered to provide said 'service'. What the fuck am I paying the bloody service tax for if you cannot bloody come to my table to take my bill? One outlet I remember is this japanese restaurant. Can't remember the name, could be sushi tei or something. I know they had pink or red walls and white chairs. The interior was very nice, and they sell those mochi thingies with green tea ice cream and all. Their service was HORRIBLE, they didn't have any more green tea mochi left and on top of that, to pay, we had to leave our chairs and QUEUE UP to pay. Ridiculous.</p>
