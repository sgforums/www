              MISS Dong Thi Hue is hearing-impaired.
              But that has not stopped the 19-year-old Vietnamese from looking for her dream guy.
              
              Her only criterion: He must also be hearing-impaired.
              
              This way, both can communicate well through the universal sign language, which people with hearing defects usually have to learn.
              
              Miss Dong is unlike her Singaporean peers, who prefer men who are not hearing-impaired, said Mr Martin Wong, managing director of Mr Cupid International Matchmakers.
              
              Singapore women - whether hearing-impaired or not - tend to be choosy, said the matchmaker.
              
              This is why he came up with the idea of helping both hearing-impaired Singapore men and Vietnamese women hook up, following requests from some local men.
              
              Currently, he has 10 hearing-impaired Vietnamese women waiting in the wings for Singapore spouses with similar disability.
              
              By looking for foreign spouses, these women hope to break out of the clutch of poverty and have better lives.
              
              They are aged between 18 and 25, educated in special schools and are able to communicate in universal sign language.
              
              They are also able to cook, do household chores and are willing to start families with their foreign husbands.
              
              Said Mr Wong: 'Despite being born with hearing defects, these women learn to stay positive and independent from young.'
              
              Mr Cupid started this service following requests from Singaporean walk-in clients with such a disability.
              
              Mr Wong said the men said their disability hindered them from finding local wives.
              
              TRICKY BUSINESS
              
              Even hearing-impaired women here generally prefer men without such disabilities, he added.
              
              So far, they have not matched any couple yet as the service started a few months ago.
              
              According to Mr Wong, some visually-impaired men have also asked if the agency can recommend them women with similar disability. But, currently, it does not.
              
              Other matchmaking agencies told The New Paper on Sunday that matchmaking disabled people is a tricky business and should be handled with caution - if tackled at all.
              
              Mr Francis Toh, who runs First Overseas International Matchmaker, said he has turned down such requests.
              
              He said this is because he cannot 'speak' their language.
              
              Mr Toh explained in Mandarin: 'We're already taking a chance when matchmaking able-bodied people because both have to adapt to each other's habit, culture and personality.
              
              'When it comes to hearing-impaired people, the situation is more touchy.
              
              'It is dangerous. I don't want to burden either party with each other's disability.'
              
              Mr Mark Lin of Vietnam Brides International Matchmaker said he also received such requests.
              
              Recently, three hearing-impaired Singaporean men asked for help to find wives, he said. He rejected them after they made known their intentions by writing on paper.
              
              Mr Lin said: 'They wanted wives who are pretty, young and able-bodied - when they cannot offer the same to the women. So it is very difficult to find a perfect match for them.'
              
              He has matched four disabled Singaporean men with able-bodied foreign women.
              
              'People who are disabled need not necessarily look for similarly disabled partners to have a happy marriage.
              
              'Just like people who are born poor need not necessarily marry another poor person. As long as they do not set their sights too high, they can find someone who will meet their expectations and vice versa,' said Mr Lin.

              Living in a world measured by worldly success, SG women have no choice but to buck the trend meaning shopping for the prince charming..that's life
              Of course SG men have a choice and look overseas for a women not raised in a materialistic culture and be happier for it..there's no easy solutions...
