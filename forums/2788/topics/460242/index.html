              This is Tiffany, a second-year university student from Hong Kong. I attended boarding school in the UK before returning to HK. Right now I am in Montreal, Canada, as an exchange student for the autumn semester.
              
              I'm curious about life in Singapore and what it feels like to be Singaporean, as Hong Kong and Singapore have so much in common and yet also different in so many aspects. 
              
              Pleae PM me if you care for a chat.

              Thanks for your suggestion, but I really doubt if reading forums is the best way to get to know Singaporeans. I would certainly miss the give and take in interaction. 
              
              If you just read the posts at HK forums, I'm afraid you will get a negative picture of Hong Kong people.

              Hello, All,
              
              Actually I am not totally ignorant about Singapore. My mother was born in Singapore but emigrated to Canada when she was 9. I've been to Singapore before, the last time being January this year. I went on an exchange visit with an environmental group from my university. Iam eager to learn more about Singapore, for intellectual as well as for sentimental reasons. 
              
              I am a Psychology Major, but am also interested in Geography, Sociology and Anthropology. I find Singapore a very interesting city. I think if you want to know a city well, you must stay there for a longer period of time and 'go native', - live as the locals do. Travel books are helpful, but only to a certain extent, unless the author is very observant or has lived in the city for a prolonged period of time.
              
              I wonder if I've put my post in the wrong section. Maybe I should have put it at "Chit Chat'.

              Unfortunately, psychologists do not have this super-human ability to read people's mind. But thanks to Magnetic Resonance Imaging, now we certainly learn a lot about brain activities. That's why psychology has made great strides in recent years.

              I've been to Singapore 3 times. The last time was in January this year - 5-day university exchange visit. When you stay for a few days, you tend to see a place through tourist's eyes.

              Good suggestion. Taking a job (or studying) there will certainly help you get to know a city. But I'm not sure if my professional qualifications will be recognized there, as I'm not interested in a business career.
              
              From my experience, even a 2-month stay will give you a pretty good idea of what life in a particular city is like, if you do your homework  and go out to meet the locals.

              <p><br>Good suggestion. Taking a job (or studying) there will certainly help you get to know a city. But I'm not sure if my professional qualifications will be recognized there, as I'm not interested in a business career. From my experience, even a 2-month stay will give you a pretty good idea of what life in a particular city is like, if you do your homework and go out to meet the locals.</p>

              A first degree in psychology is hardly a professional qualification. I hope to be trained as clinical psychologist. To register as a clinical psychologist, a 2-year full-time master's degree is a basic requirement. To practise in Singapore as a clinical psychologist, I'd probably need accreditation from a local professional group and may encounter difficulties. Sorry for not making it clear in my previous post.
              
              I'm not sure if clinical psychologists here need fluency in Hokkien. My Putonghua is OK but my knowledge of Hokkien is minimal.

              <p><br>oh well, basically the hospitals will try to arrange patients suited to your preferred language. So if you are not good with dialect, it should still be alright. Yea to practice clinical psychology you will need a masters in the degree. But you can still try if you want to and see what kind of accreditation they need.</p>

              Thanks for your information. For clinical psychologists, practicum is very important. At HKU, clinical psychology students have to spend 220 days interning not only in hospitals, but also the Health Department, the Education Bureau, the Social Welfare Department and social service agencies. 
              
              Even if I get accrediation, I won't be confident enough to work in an unfamiliar environment in Singapore. It'd be difficult to give therapy and counselling unless I know something about the environment my clients grow up in and the community resources available.
