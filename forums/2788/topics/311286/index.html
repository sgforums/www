              <p>An american cited:</p>
              <p> </p>Vietnamese women make much better wives than American women.
              
              An American woman has several fundamental problems that will never go away and that will get much worse a few years after she is married:
              
                 1. Her inherent anti-male bias and pre-occupation with fairness that was drilled into her at high school, college, and through the media. Her constant confrontations and trying to prove herself and to make a point.
                 2. Her self-centeredness, her ridiculously high expectations, her sense of entitlement, her high-maintenance, superficial, and stuck up attitude, her snootiness and her sense of superiority. This "princess" syndrome means that she will always think that she is better than you, and that she deserves and she is entitled to whatever she wants from you.
                 3. Her general mental instability and psychological disorders.
                 4. Her using sex as a weapon and reward to get things. 
              
              Vietnamese women generally don't have any of these problems. Marrying an American woman simply does not make sense. The ONLY reason men stay with American women is because they did not have enough exposure to Vietnamese women. Any man who spent a few months in Asia will not even look at American women again.

              <p><br>A lot of ang mo men who marry women from 3rd world countries want a 'free' maid and not a wife.</p>
              <p>Maybe you prefer a wife that only says 'Yes sir yes sir' to you. Or maybe you just can't handle them.</p>
              <p>And seriously, don't you get tired of posting the same topic under different guises already?</p>
              <p>So like in your church girls thread, I'll advise you to buy yourself a Vietnamese wife and get on with life instead of bitching non-stop here.</p>

              <p>A vietnam wife beats hand down on any Sg women…there are good SG women too but mostly they are taken and fewer in numbers as the march towards female liberation in Asia goes on….<br>Viet women are devoted and loyal to their men and don’t expect more than what their men can provide for them</p>

              <p>What's stopping you from buying a wife then?</p>
              <p>Go buy one and stop bitching and whining la. </p>
              <p>Better act now before Viet start to progress and become like SG ok, then you start bitching about the women there too and maybe by that time you have to look at microasia or something for a wife.</p>

              <p>Like in SG, there are the men who can handle it and then men who bitch and whine.</p>
              <p>And not all men like their women to bow down to their every whim and fancy too.</p>

              <p>myself, I'd rather have my testicles treated with steak tenderizer and stapled to a maple chopping block than to get a wife through such means. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
