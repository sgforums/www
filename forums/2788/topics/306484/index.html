              <p>I dont think is really wrong la, but its really hard to forsake your another half even how bad it is. The feelings there, and most probably got children liao.... Its a tough decision leh....</p>
              <p>Diff ppl of cuz diff, and also diff situation.... Gonna make your own choice and set your mind straight before marriage. Therefore many pre-marriage courses going on right now to educate couples before marriage. Educate how to continue r/s and if fight occurs what to do..etc etc.. those courses are not cheap btw..</p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Actually it depends on that guy, himself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>There are guys who tend to be overly jealous. </strong><br>Like my ex, he tends to get jealous when I spend time with my guy friends. <br>He thought I was flirting away with them despite that he trusts me and I had introduced these guy friends of mine to him.<br>Apparently, he didn't realised that he was the guy I loved.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>There are guys who give freedom and totally understand you.</strong><br>Like my friend's relationship, they are free to go everywhere they go as long as they informed each other. <br>Their minimum requirement, 2 sms per day (1 in the morning and 1 at night) and meet once a week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>There are guys who can't be bothered.</strong><br>Like my gf's ex, despite that they are attached for 1 year, they can't be bothered to about each other's whereabout.<br>The bottom line, they know that they are still young, trust and love each other. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">There are more.. but I can't tink of them now.. hehe..</span></p>

              <p>I've seen people (girls mainly) who are almost controlled by their bf. Means like, either they can't do this thing because Mr Bf doesn't like, or go somewhere die die bf must come along or they don't show up, or worse still bf curfew, checking their computers, etc...</p>

              <p><br>To have a clear and great personal value/principles. If u have a set of good values and principle cultivated during young age! U will know what is enough and worth doing rather than to sunk low for love.</p>
              <p>If u see yr bf kick a harmless kitten hard for blocking yr way, will u still love this kind of person and sacrifiace for love??? Do u think u can have a lasting r/s?</p>
              <p>Be firm with yr principle and value, set a decent minimal character requirement of yr opposite partner, control yr feeling and true love will florish.</p>
