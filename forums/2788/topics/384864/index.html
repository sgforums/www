              <p>Recently got a few disagreement with my boyfriend. Now we're on seperate hiatus meaning that we wont see each other for quite some time as a little break between us. But we're still together, that what i was hope for. It was last friday that it happen, it was a simple dinner here and there, share stories and stuff. Then it hit him. I was talking to my boyfriend and wanted to go for zoukout the following day with my friends since they asked me out for that special event. My boyfriend told me to reject their offer and spent time with him instead. I was stunned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is stupid. This is like a one of the year event and he wont let me go. Not like im going to bend over some rules or something but i must go to this event. Its a must for me or else i'll feel left out of what my friends been talking all day long. I was so mad at him but i dont want to spent my day at home during saturday. So i have no choice but to go out with him or to my friends. Its my one chance of getting this fun life so i go for it. I went to my friends and on to zoukout. I pay it back to my friends $60 for her thanks for treating me the tickets. Lots of fun there. Assholes spray foam over us. Random guys asking for our number. My friend is the most prettiest within our group and of course, she gets more strangers number than us. But with all this dancing, i got a minor guilt in me that my boyfriend is mad at me. Oh well, dont want to spoil my fantastic day over some pathetic boy. We ton there till the party was way over. It was 3pm and my shirt was really smelly. Kinda embarrassed about the smell because it affects my body too. My friends think that my armpit smell. My god, my face was blushing pink. "No it doesnt ok!" I said with a mean voice. I cover up my armpit and dont dare to raise my arm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank god there's a spare recycle clothes at the event. I picked up the white tank top and the shorts. It was a girl clothing anyway so yup, i just picked them. A few hours later, my boyfriend sms me. He said he needed  break between us. I was too drunk to care about that and besides, i dont quite like him anyway. I didnt reply back. And another thing, i got a few of guys number here too. Who cares about him. hell yeah now is my hell of a time to enjoy. Next year is my final year of living in a teen world. I better make myself useful and enjoy this life with all i have. Not gonna let some douche bag ruining my life. My friend fetch me home with his car. As soon i stepped inside my house, i dashed to the bed and make my parents think as if nothing happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ahhhh wonderful i guess but i got a feeling that there's a challenging road up ahead. All this is just to test me or something. And yup im ready for whatever road that takes me. So many stuff i wanna try. I haven't break my V, i dream of becoming in a media. but best of all, i just want to have fun with all my friends till the next commitment</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks for letting me out ~~ &lt;3</p>

              <p>After reading your story, confirm you are not the chip i know lol...</p>
              <p>Anyway, the way you think is wrong to a certain extent...</p>
              <p>"My boyfriend told me to reject their offer and spent
                                      time with him instead. I was stunned."<br>Do you know why your boyfriend wants you to reject the offer? From my point of view, it is not stupid at all that he says such a thing.</p>
              <p>Well, you may agree with me or don't agree with me, certain guys think like this and it's normal.</p>
              <p>First of all, drinking and alcohol.<br>Touching these, you will never know what can happen to you next. You might not hear much stories of what happen, but there are a lot of cases which actually happen. <br>You might be thinking that nothing will happen. But there still, your boyfriend is worried. Only because he cares and he fear that something might happen, he asked you to reject. You might think this is a stupid reason to reject, but you never know how much it actually haunts him just thinking that you are going to zoukout. It's not that he don't trust you or what, but just that he can't help it but to worry.</p>
              <p>And, the reason why he doesn't wants to say his real reason to you. Do you think if he say that because he fear something might happen, it's a good reason? It might seems just a simple reason, but it's actually something that he really take it seriously and he really fear that something might happen. I personally have this feeling before which is why I know how he felt. And you already might be thinking that "It's stupid", so he of course won't say the truth of how he felt. Cus he know that you will think it's stupid.<br>He ask you so spend time with him is just an excuse though.</p>
              <p>But one thing you need to understand is that, you might see it as just a small problem, but you never know how big that problem is to him. It hurts him deep inside and it really haunts him.</p>
              <p>"Random guys asking for our number. My friend is
                                      the most prettiest within our group and of course, she gets more
                                      strangers number than us."<br>"And another thing, i got a few of guys number here too."Well, if you think this guy could be better then you current guys, I have nothing to say.Strangers asking a girl for number, only for one reason.</p>
              <p>"Not gonna let
                                      some douche bag ruining my life."<br>You will never know are those new guys you met gonna ruin your life or your current boyfriend who cares and worried even at the slightest fact gonna ruin. And the answer who will ruin it is pretty obvious.</p>
              <p>Lastly one last advice to you, heed this advice.<br>Do not lose your v... People might be saying it's ok to lose, or what so ever, or it's common now, it's the trend now... Just don't get those stupid influence... Those are for losers. To tell you the truth, yup in fact it's very common for people to lose their v, and you can hardly find anyone who still is one... But still, don't fall into temptation and influences. Know how to say no not only to drugs, but to guys who ask it from you.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>I agree that your boyfriend should not restrict your movements. If you really want to go to zoukout, by all means he should let you have fun. But bear in mind that he had good intentions in his heart for not letting you go. He might want to spend some time specially with you on that day or he is afraid of other guys trying to pick you up over there. Which bf wouldn't be afraid of that?</p>
              <p>That aside, after the starting part, what you said just turned me off. You are really acting like a kid; wanting to have fun all the time and ignoring all the concern from your bf &amp; parents. I don't want to go on as what I want to say may seem to others like I'm flaming you. But in conclusion, you are immature, reckless and you do not deserve your boyfriend, judging from all the words you said.

              <p>chill yo. I agree on the bf MIGHT have a good intention part. Either that, or he's just freaking jealous that she's gonna spend awesome time partying.<br><br><br>Lets put it this way. TS is being very selfish in doing wadever she did, especially when she pointed out that there are many other guys out there, blah blah blah and so on. Immature? Yeah probably, but one have to understand that TS is in her teens. Relationship in teen years will almost never lead to marriage i pressume., unless shotgun =/<br><br>Everyone knows the politically right answers to alot of question. But to say and do is just too different entity alltogether.</p>

              <p>dear simple gal, problems occur when 2 people have different views about what constitutes a relationship. to u, it's zoukout before boyfriend. to him, it's boyfriend before ur friends.  </p>
              <p>a break up in inevitable de lah.</p>
              <p>since he wanted a break and u're more than happy to oblige, then there's no problem... whatever works!</p>

              <p>inspite of ur
              protests, ur next boyfriend chooses to attend a bikini party at st james
              with his stud friends over spending time with u. would u think of
              urself as a douchebag for being unhappy? or would u think of him as a
              douchebag for being insensitive to ur feelings?</p>
              <p>take time to mull over the meaning of commitment and what makes a relationship, share ur ideas with the next lucky guy before taking the plunge again ya. have fun!</p>

              <p>Its like reading someone's bloggy. well at least i know ur now 18 yrs old...... if u wan to enjoy, then go... no one stopping u. only yrself. but just take it easy la...dont go to such extend like break yr V &lt;---which is totally awesome btw.</p>
              <p>and dont leave yr drinks unattended. dont put a 100% trust of those ard u, they will put smth in yr drinks if u go for toilet or tackle hugs and kiss other girls (another awesome thing) or wat. Try drink finish first then leave it as it is. If those long time friendship and u alrdy know that they are yr true friend and trustworthy then i think its ok la. But those unknown ppls wanna hang out with u or those "just" become friends then dont put all yr hope into them yet.</p>
              <p>n try to jio yr bf along la if got any party or wat n see how it goes. I think... i think he's feeling left out thats why he wans u to spent time with him instead. Share the sian feeling</p>
