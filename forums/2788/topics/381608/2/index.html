              <p>Hi Ahbel Emo,</p>
              <p>Please do pardon me for saying so, the biggest obstacle in the relationship between the two of you is his mother. </p>
              <p>You can accept him carrying a potentially life-crippling disease; accept him despite the fact that he is a divorcee with a child who is not even his; accept him despite he is earning a much lower pay than yours - Thus, that speaks a lot of your loving and gracious character, and your true and honest feelings towards him.</p>
              <p>For the sake of your relationship, you have been putting up with his mother, but it is unlikely that things can last like this forever. What I will suggest is for the two of you to rent a cheap room for the two of you to live together in for the time being.</p>
              <p>As for the future, you need not worry too much about it, and do let time take its flow. Housing is definitely an issue, not only for the two of you, but also for most newly-wed couples as well. I have to sincerely apologise here though, for I am unable to give you a really good solution or suggestion when it comes to such housing issues.</p>
              <p>As for your wedding night, you can actually try out alternatives to the traditional banquets or restaurant dinners.</p>
              <p>I know of an individual who was once in jail, and thus he was unable to get a high paying job after he was released, even though he has turned over a new leaf. When he got married, his friends seek the aid of some fellow Buddhists and even nuns, and everyone did everything they could to help him out. The Bungalow which is used as a Buddhist Lodge by the nuns was used a wedding night dinner celebration area, and all of us did whatever we could to help him out. One of his friend become his chauffeur and used his lorry as a wedding car, some of us bring our own bottles of soft drinks and food ingredients and cooked for his wedding dinner meals, a beautician help out his wife, some of the odd-jobs workers help to bring tables and chairs...etc. Knowing of his finance situation, we refuse red packets with money, and accepted those with chocolate coins instead.</p>
              <p>For your honeymoon, the two of you can leave the child in your mother's care for a few days, and have a simple trip to Malaysia or Indonesia. </p>
              <p>As for your boyfriend himself, he is worried of making you worry, that is why he is trying to "act like a man". It is the same for my boyfriend as well, and I hope I will not offend any of the male forummers - it is sort of an egoistic thing for guys. You must let him understand, for a relationship to work out, the two of you must be open towards each other and share all your problems instead of keeping it to one self, or trying to "be a man".</p>
              <p>I wish from the bottom of my heart all the best to you for your relationship.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              <p> </p>
