              <p>1. you have changed so now you are interested in studying and that is very normal. try to look for a "useful" diploma that is acredited by MOE.</p>
              <p>2. you salary of 1k is really too low. you should look for a better job. Pls.. my gangster friend working at drink stall already can get $1.8K at 16 years old.</p>
              <p>3. you dont intend to become a driver driving a van for delivery than dont bother to take the driving license because it will cost you in total at least 1K plus and it will drag at least half a year</p>
              <p>4. work 1 K give 500 how can that be enough to survive? stop give household money save it for dipolma</p>
              <p>5. you can become a nurse, there is a scholarship for it. go to WDA and see if there is any sponsored course.</p>
              <p>6. you are stressed because of $$$ (so is I ) so find a better job, do something that can earn. Or you can try CDC.</p>

              <p>Hi xIcEx,</p>
              <p>Please do not call yourself pathetic, it is a good thing that you are aiming high. Have you considered getting a Higher Nitec, and enter a local polytechnic? It will be a longer route, but your diploma will be more recognised in this case.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, in your current situation, you will have to choose to either forgo your driving license, your dream of getting a diploma, or your job. It is not impossible, but it will be very difficult to juggle all three of them simultaneously.</p>
              <p>I have absolutely no right to ask you to stop giving your family a household allowance, but you may wish to consider lowering the amount which you are giving right now.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>since your family dun believe you, rely on your efforts instead. go take up a part time job on weekends where you can earn a little. as for studying, better study at SIM than MDIS or other private schools. if you dun believe me, wait till you are a student there, then you know what I am talking about. how about wait till you have saved a few thousand dollars then go study part time at SIM? as for a gf, you do not need one now. you should concentrate on establishing your career first before thinking of having a gf.</p>
              <p>cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi, your life's probably at its most 'down' period.  I understand how you feel. Just stress everyday, maybe even thoughts of suicide (I hope not so jia lat). </p>
              <p>Firstly on $$$ problems, go read up books. I recommend 'Rich dad, Poor dad' by Robert Kiyosaki(I HIGHLY DEEPLY RECOMMEND THIS). Its an old book but it will definitely help you in getting rich, as well as giving you the motivation to not give up on life just because your academic studies suck. I suggest getting a government-paid, no need qualifications job. e.g SAF signed-on officer, policeman. Though not well paid, these jobs give you stable income of around 2k per month, <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/po_salary.htm">http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/po_salary.htm</a>. What's more, it doesn't require much brain power when you're merely holding a low rank, so its easy in a way. Entry requirements for SPF : <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/po_entry.htm">http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/po_entry.htm</a>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, no matter what happens, don't blame anything or anybody else. Whatever happens in your life is you fault and responsibility. Our minds will constantly and <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; white-space: pre;  ">unconsciously</span> create excuses for yourself. I know its hard and you have no choice but to listen to your dad, but yeah. Find motivation in your life, perhaps a get a gf, but dont be despo, it will f*** you up even more. </p>
              <p>Good luck in your life and career dude. :D</p>

              <p>Since things have a taken a positive turn for you, you will have to work harder from now on for your studies and driving lessons. </p>
              <p>As for your birthday, I will advise you to keep it simple. Your father may not be happy if you are to have an expensive celebration, given that your grandmother and aunt are paying your fees for you.</p>
              <p>All the best to you in your studies and driving course.</p>

              <p>To TS:</p>
              <p>I believe that if you work hard, you will not starve. At the same time, your father is probably masking his true feelings from you - maybe he feels that if he was nicer to you like he was in your secondary school days, you would become complacent.</p>
