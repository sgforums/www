              <p>My friend, some of the guys and I over here had really lost intested in Singapore girls. Maybe in my younger days, i had interest. But when we are exposed to other countres's ladies. We felt that their expectation and standard for guy is much more lower. I am planning to marry a Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, China lady if they are nice.</p>
              <p>SIngapore gals. I am sorry to comment on this. Those just look ok had the mindset that they are very pretty and their expectation is very high. Maybe influence by other gals. May God forgive me for making this statement, Dun get angry. What I and my friend survery. Singapore gals are not very pretty, no figure, arrogant, demanding ladies in the world. Maybe a small portion is not like that but are already being booked and marry. Leftover rice who wants.</p>
              <p>No Joking. Look around you. A lot of my friend and relative either they dun get marry or Marry China woman, Vietnam chinese girls, Thai Chinese or indonesia Chinese</p>

              <p>why not you think it this manner, it's not the ladies demand high. it's all about/in your mindset. like typical singaporean guy looking for wife, must be chio bu, low expense, dont shop. good wife. obedient stay at home be housewife kind. therefore of cos you think they are getting more materialistic as they don't fit your category. perhaps i over state some factors above.</p>
              <p>it is like you living in singapore of cos you follow singapore "standards". perhaps those ladies you met are more materialistic ladies. social around more, i believe you can find a local acceptable one.</p>
              <p>lol. and no joke. foreign wives are sometimes good at the beginning. when she is familiar with singapore already. that's when you have problem. like cheating of your $ and become more demanding. it's happening to those after 5 - 10 years marriage. ;)</p>
              <p>just my thoughts. no hard feeling. ;D</p>

              <p>I only hear many terrible things about SG Men misbehaving themselves while overseas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I pitied these SG Men but I can understand their needs to deceive themselves in order to retain their mental balance because it is a well-known fact that these SG Men have been cornered for a long time in SG. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>My friend, some of the guys and I over here had really lost intested in Singapore girls. Maybe in my younger days, i had interest. But when we are exposed to other countres's ladies. We felt that their expectation and standard for guy is much more lower. I am planning to marry a Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, China lady if they are nice.</p>
              <p>SIngapore gals. I am sorry to comment on this. Those just look ok had the mindset that they are very pretty and their expectation is very high. Maybe influence by other gals. May God forgive me for making this statement, Dun get angry. What I and my friend survery. Singapore gals are not very pretty, no figure, arrogant, demanding ladies in the world. Maybe a small portion is not like that but are already being booked and marry. Leftover rice who wants.</p>
              <p>No Joking. Look around you. A lot of my friend and relative either they dun get marry or Marry China woman, Vietnam chinese girls, Thai Chinese or indonesia Chinese</p>

              <p>It's only right for girls to want the best for themselves. So we can't really blame them setting the bar too high. Well, it may be a bar too high at times though <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif">.</p>
              <p>But it's only natural for wanting the best for ourselves.</p>
              <p>It's a society where men and women are equals, or at least supposedly so. </p>
              <p>The social stereotypes of men and women are still out there. And there is still that glass ceiling above every girl that has yet to shatter. Cracks has been appearing on it after concerted efforts by women movements but it is still there.</p>
              <p>This is especially apparent in asian countries which are more conservative in comparison to western countries.</p>
              <p>Instead of asking ourselves as guys whether the girls are setting sky high standards, we should perhaps think about whether we are setting our standards too low.</p>
              <p>Girls are more educated now, more knowledgeable and may even earn more money than us. But are we giving them the respect they deserve at times?</p>
              <p>No longer are they willing to remain at home being a housewife. They have their own ambitions, goals that they want to achieve. There is a career out there where they may want to carve out for themselves.</p>
              <p>Understanding and respecting that are the first steps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>And Singapore girs arent that bad looking too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> </p>
