              <p>Welcome, and as you see in the topic, I am looking for a female friend / possible companion.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Here's my intro for convenience:</strong></span><br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: blue;">About me</span></span></strong><br> I have been browsing these forums for a while now, and i finally muster this intro.<br> <br> First off, about myself.<br> I am single, just agree with my ex to part our 2 years relationship 
                  recently (June 12), so she could focus on her studies, and also because she ask me
                   not to wait for her. It was sad but a most pleasantly possible 
                  departure, as we continue to remain as good frds.<br> <br> I am in my early 30s, chinese male, looking very much in my mid 20s. I 
                  am abt 164 and 61kg (just weighed not long). I do enjoy surfing the web,
                   but i guess i like nite cycling, watching meteor showers, anime shows, 
                  nice nice shows like 10 promises to my dog and the such, more. I do read
                   a variety of topics ranging from first aid, IT, inspirationals, 
                  astronomy, funny stuff, meaningful stuff.... <br> <br> I always loved to eat and enjoy good movies (though i do not watch every
                   single movies available), usually with just 1 or 2 other persons at a 
                  time. I value quality time together, and can be quite a touch person - 
                  enjoys close company, hugs and holding hands.<br> <br> I do like walks along beaches, or just sitting around listening to waves
                   and the winds. I can be wild a bit too, but i dun party sorta. (U will 
                  have to pm me to know wat i do on my wild side).<br> <br> And yes, I dun smoke at all and dun drink too. I am allergic to liquor 
                  (to why i dun drink), not some weirdo or wat haha. Liquor nearly kill me
                   2 cny ago when i accidentally took &lt;20ml of choya (16% alchohol). <br> <br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">About You (the Companion I seek):</span></span></strong><br> <br> I hope you enjoy hanging out together (can be in-house zai nan zai nu 
                  style), enjoys chatting (though simply being together is cool too), and 
                  enjoys some of the activites I enjoy doing. It does not matter if you do
                   not know any of them at all, but is willing to learn to enjoy.<br> <br> I hope you will enjoy sharing with me your hobbies, your likes and dislikes too. <br> I do hope you do not smoke or drink, though this is the least important.<br> <br> I prefer someone below 30, preferably petite in size (note its 
                  'preferred' not absolutely). Its ok watever race so long as u r asian 
                  chinese (no prc though). So long as you are pleasing to my eyes, it wil 
                  be great!<br> <br> I am not must-have-large-boobs lover (so even A cup is ok) if you are 
                  worried abt physique.If things go well, I hope you will be a 
                  long term companion, not excluding the possibility of lifelong. <br> <br>If you are keen to know and befriend me, just pte msg me k?<br> We can meet up and see how things go. And PS: sorry if u r fl looking 
                  for business, nope i am not looking for paid ons sex. Even if its fb, I 
                  feel we must be able to connect first. Think Companionship as the word. 
                  ^^<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: lime;">About Definition of Companionship:</span></span></strong><br> <br> For those who are unsure of "companion" : (Bracketed words mine)<br> One who accompanies or is in company with another for a longer or 
                  shorter period (hopefully as long as it can go), either from choice or 
                  casually (I hope from well think through choice); one who is much in the
                   company of, or is associated with, another or others; an associate; a 
                  comrade; a consort; a partner (In this case, with me alone.).<br> <br> To me, a companion is one who is a listener, physically there for u when
                   needed, a shoulder to cry on, a crazy one to be lafing out with.... and
                   yes, when u r a companion to me, u can expect the same from this other 
                  half (me).</p>

                                      muster this intro.<br> <br> First off, about myself.<br> I am single, just agree with my ex to part our 2 years relationship
                                      recently (June 12), so she could focus on her studies, and also
                                      because she ask me not to wait for her. It was sad but a most
                                      pleasantly possible departure, as we continue to remain as good
                                      frds.<br> <br> I am in my early 30s, chinese male, looking very much in my mid
                                      20s. I am abt 164 and 61kg (just weighed not long). I do enjoy
                                      surfing the web, but i guess i like nite cycling, watching meteor
                                      showers, anime shows, nice nice shows like 10 promises to my dog
                                      and the such, more. I do read a variety of topics ranging from
                                      first aid, IT, inspirationals, astronomy, funny stuff, meaningful
                                      stuff....<br> <br> I always loved to eat and enjoy good movies (though i do not watch
                                      every single movies available), usually with just 1 or 2 other
                                      persons at a time. I value quality time together, and can be quite
                                      a touch person - enjoys close company, hugs and holding
                                      hands.<br> <br> I do like walks along beaches, or just sitting around listening to
                                      waves and the winds. I can be wild a bit too, but i dun party
                                      sorta. (U will have to pm me to know wat i do on my wild

                                          20s. I am abt 164 and 61kg (just weighed not long). I do enjoy
                                          surfing the web, but i guess i like nite cycling, watching meteor
                                          showers, anime shows, nice nice shows like 10 promises to my dog
                                          and the such, more. I do read a variety of topics ranging from
                                          first aid, IT, inspirationals, astronomy, funny stuff, meaningful
                                          stuff....<br> <br> I always loved to eat and enjoy good movies (though i do not watch
                                          every single movies available), usually with just 1 or 2 other
                                          persons at a time. I value quality time together, and can be quite
                                          a touch person - enjoys close company, hugs and holding
                                          hands.<br> <br> I do like walks along beaches, or just sitting around listening to
                                          waves and the winds. I can be wild a bit too, but i dun party
                                          sorta. (U will have to pm me to know wat i do on my wild
                                          side).<br> <br> And yes, I dun smoke at all and dun drink too. I am allergic to
                                          liquor (to why i dun drink), not some weirdo or wat haha. Liquor

                                          (16% alchohol).<br> <br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">About You (the Companion I

                                          nu style), enjoys chatting (though simply being together is cool
                                          too), and enjoys some of the activites I enjoy doing. It does not
                                          matter if you do not know any of them at all, but is willing to
                                          learn to enjoy.<br> <br> I hope you will enjoy sharing with me your hobbies, your likes and
                                          dislikes too.<br> I do hope you do not smoke or drink, though this is the least
                                          important.<br> <br> I prefer someone below 30, preferably petite in size (note its
                                          'preferred' not absolutely). Its ok watever race so long as u r
