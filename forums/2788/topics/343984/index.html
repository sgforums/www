              <p>But since the broke up, my memorises of our relationship starts to fade away. Within this 1 and a half month, i start to forget those little surprise we once came up for each other, not all but most. I'll not think about her if i'm doing somehting else.</p>
              <p>But she was the one i loved the most in my life.</p>
              <p>Why? Am i just another jackass or is it good for me?</p>
              <p>But she was attached few weeks back, i was seriously pissed &gt; jelaous. She made me felt that I can be replaced easily. But again, the 2years, we believed that it is the best part of our life.</p>

              <p>When my ex gf of a year and 8 months broke up with me in august 2007. That week when we broke up, i found out she went to meet up with some guy to have ex with. So I was pissed from what I remember and went out with my friends to go clubbing the following night. Hooked up with a chick that night, the next day I felt much better. But still the memories didn't fade until 4 months later.</p>

              <p>This is call a healing process, different people have different ways to heal. But by healing and slowly forgeting it does not mean that we are a jerk. It just means that we are slowly on our way to make ourselves ready to go into another relationship.</p>
              <p>Everyone is different, she heals faster than you did, but that does not mean that she loved you lesser than you did her. I know some people who can take 5 years to forget a 1 month relationship, and I know some who can move on from a 6 years relationship in a few days. It's a matter of perspective.</p>
              <p>Keep the good memories, and learn why it did not work out, this is a new era and there are many opportunities out there. One fine day, when you suddenly remember the good memories of the 2 of you together but you do not feel sad but appreciate the fact that you once were together, is when you have healed completely.</p>

              <p>yr situation is almost the same as mine, my clique is now closer to my ex den me, as previously they was in the same class . so now they often go out together. in the past it was me going out with her. sigh. but that was 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>but now im starting to let go already, starting not to think about it, just let it be a part of yr memory. although i take quite long, 2 years. but well.. it's never too late .</p>

              <p>Hmmm..this just goes to prove that the love between the two of you weren't that wrong enough and it is most likely to be puppy love which does not really last long. 2 or 3 years is really a maximum.</p>

              <p>i also went through the same thing as u..but much worse..</p>
              <p>my ex initiated the breakup..telling me hurtful stuff like how he finds that i am too childish (&amp; that he only found out after we've been together for around 3yrs)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i was silly at that point of time..even told him stuff that i can try to be more mature..dress more mature in front of him..but he still insisted on breaking up</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, the breakup was very sudden..just pop out of nowhere..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it was only a few mths later that i realised he met another girl behind my back..&amp; the reason he broke off with me was to be with that girl =.='''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can only say that..i was extremly hurt at that point of time..kept having negative thoughts that "am i really that bad?" "how can he forget about me so fast?" "how can he get attached so fast w/o sparing a thought for my feelings?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but..it is really true that time can heal everything...</p>
