              <p>If you're a graduate and draws about 55k per annum including bonuses, will you consider a guy who has only O' levels but draws an annual salary of up to 160k including bonus and director fees. He's a salaried employee holding directorship in a and has a good portfolio.</p>

              <p>I think our educational or certificate levels are totally being overated</p>
              <p>just becoz a person's education is "high" it doesn't really mean they are.....</p>
              <p>i find it stupid especially for those people who deem themselves as being highclass or the top of society juz becoz they've got a degree or masters etc...</p>
              <p>its as if they think they've seen the world when in fact, they really haven't....becoz a person's educational level can never ever ever guarantee that the person will have a positive, open and non-boasting mindset.....having a proper minset and having a wide base of knowledge is two different things....</p>
              <p>imagine if you got a bf who has an O level cert and your mom wants to introduce you to a guy who is doing his pre-u and stuff.....would that not be insulting? society needs a tight slap sometimes.....</p>
              <p>i dun think communication should ever be classified as a problem....coz humans are supposed to be adaptive and therefore, if you cannot adapt or learn to communicate well, then it would care to show that the person is just plain lazy and is just chasing the girl for sex.......</p>

              <p>I know suntec city bonds require 250k for a unit now, and if keep for 5 years, total payout at maturity is guaranteed at a minimum of 5.28% per annum, possibly more... That one should be lower risk ba...</p>
              <p>But even if I'm a miser, my current gf (likely to be future wife) is not. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Actually I beg to differ that for investments, the higher the risk, the better the returns... If you know what you are doing, the risk would definitely be much lower than someone who is investing purely because of hearsay or by gut feeling... I'm still sponging up more research and info on this area though...</p>
              <p>But talk so much... Ultimately still need the first pot of gold to do all these stuff... :(</p>
