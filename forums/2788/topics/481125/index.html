              <p><br><br>Hi All<br><br>Currently I am serving NS. There's this girl whom was my previous poly classmate. We are together for 3 Years 2 months whom just called it quits with me over Family Related Issues and Time Commitment as I am currently in NS. And as I do shift work my weekends are not guranteed.<br><br>She broke the news first to me via text as first saying she is considering our relationship as she was very stress with her studies, personal commitments, Family Issues as well as Extra Curricular Activities in school. We thrashed matters over massage as she was busy mugging for her Quizzes up in a few days time. I even dropped by her school to look for her unannounced to tell her how much I miss her and love her and we talked for a bit before she told me she needed a cooling period to cool off. <br><br>Honestly I was devastated and smothered her with messages of how much I love and miss her daily and even called her but to no avail during the cooling off period. I know I should not have done this after consulting some of my friends.<br><br>After 1 week she texted me saying she thought enough and that she came to a decision. That she don't think that we can ever resolve the issues that she thinks are problems in our relationship. I replied citing to meet up for her to break the news to me as a courtesy of our 3 years relationship and she agreed to the meet up after her upcoming exams.<br><br>I asked her to allow me to buy her a meal when she came over for the agreed agenda. As I really love her and want to chase her back to be part of my life.<br><br>Any Recommendations or advice you could give me to make this turnaround a success?<br><br>Regards<br>Nicholas<br><br> <br></p>

              called it quits with me over Family Related Issues and Time
              Commitment as I am currently in NS. And as I do shift work my
              weekends are not guranteed.<br> <br> She broke the news first to me via text as first saying she is
              considering our relationship as she was very stress with her
              studies, personal commitments, Family Issues as well as Extra
              Curricular Activities in school. We thrashed matters over massage
              as she was busy mugging for her Quizzes up in a few days time. I
              even dropped by her school to look for her unannounced to tell her
              how much I miss her and love her and we talked for a bit before she
              told me she needed a cooling period to cool off.<br> <br> Honestly I was devastated and smothered her with messages of how
              much I love and miss her daily and even called her but to no avail
              during the cooling off period. I know I should not have done this
              after consulting some of my friends.<br> <br> After 1 week she texted me saying she thought enough and that she
              came to a decision. That she don't think that we can ever resolve
              the issues that she thinks are problems in our relationship. I
              replied citing to meet up for her to break the news to me as a
              courtesy of our 3 years relationship and she agreed to the meet up
              after her upcoming exams.<br> <br> I asked her to allow me to buy her a meal when she came over for
              the agreed agenda. As I really love her and want to chase her back
              to be part of my life.<br> <br> Any Recommendations or advice you could give me to make this
              turnaround a success?<br> <br> Regards<br> Nicholas<br> <br></p>

              <p>Hey,<br>Hope you're doing ok. Sometimes, you doing you best wont be enough to fix something that is broken. What she said may be an excuse to soften the blow to you.<br>I hope im wrong though, and wish that you can salvage it. NS shouldnt be a reason why u two have to break up. Not much of a real advise here, but give her the space she need. U cant force love. <br><br>Cheers<br></p>
