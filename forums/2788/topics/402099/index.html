              <p><em>"The great question that has never been answered, and which I have   
              not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into   
              the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?'"</em><br> -From (the  founder of psycho-analysis)<em> Sigmund Freud: Life and Work</em> by  Ernest Jones, 1953<br> <br> Think about this for a second. If  men knew what women really want, why 
              wouldn't they just give it to them.<br> <br> In  today's world, men can mainly be classified into two main 
              categories.  The majority of men in modern society fall into the 
              category of Mr Teddy  Bear. The other category is Mr MCP 
              (male-chauvinistic pig)<br> <br> Mr  Teddy Bear's love motto:"Your wish is my command." He is too  
              considerate and overly sensitive towards her. He only thinks for others 
               but never for himself. She classifies him as "too nice"<br> <br> Mr  MCP's love motto:"My way or the highway." The only person he cares 
              for  is himself. 'Give' is not a word that exists in his dictionary and 
              his  favorite words are 'Me' and 'Take'<br> <br> And then of course,  there is the third category which by now you might 
              have already figured  out. REAL MEN, are a rare breed. What makes a REAL
               MAN, you must be  thinking to yourself now. In a sense, he is a perfect
               blend of the good  qualities of Mr Teddy Bear and Mr MCP.<br> <br> He is a  confident, decisive take-charge guy. He always conducts himself
               with  class and manners. He is the leader in the relationship. He knows
               to  compromise and give in when appropriate. He is not needy/clingy and
               his  life does not revolve around hers. He brings her happiness through
                humour, respect, romance and affection. When she is down, he shows his
                support. When she talks, he listens with empathy. He apologizes when 
              he  is at fault but he never begs for her forgiveness/approval. She 
              respects  and looks up to him. In her mind, he is the knight on the 
              stallion. <br> <br> These  are some of the many traits that a REAL MAN possess. If you are 
              just  like him, i congratulate you for you are on the right path, at 
              least  when it comes to romantic relationships. But if you are more of 
              Mr Teddy  Bear or Mr MCP, its high time you think about how your actions
               and  behaviour have impacted your current or past relationships in a 
              negative  way.<br> <br> When you have successfully developed yourself to  display those 
              qualities of a REAL MAN. Your partner will never entertain  the thought 
              of leaving you. In fact, she will treasure you because you  have become 
              her 'prince charming'. Women you interact with will  naturally be 
              attracted to you.<br> <br> Why are REAL MEN such a  rare breed these days? This is due to the 
              brainwashing prevalent in  mainstream media and the lack of good role 
              models to learn from today.  Majority of women have no problems 
              understanding men. In fact,  relationships is their forte and majority 
              of men are totally clueless  when it comes to understanding women. There
               is a lot of garbage out  there in mainstream media which only serves to
               confuse men further. One  of the major culprits is advice for men 
              provided by women which are  politically correct and half truths. Such 
              advice has only brainwashed us  men into becoming her Teddy Bear which 
              she will ultimately dump when  her respect for us diminishes by the day 
              and finally gets into the  sewers.</p>

              <p>Arapahoe,</p>
              <p>Its not about male or female perspective. It works and therefore it is the truth. Doesn't matter if a cat is black, white or brown. If that cat is able to catch mice, it is a good cat. Take a closer look at those men who are successful with women over the long term, you will realise they have all of those qualities and much more.</p>

              <p><em>"The great question that has never been answered, and which
              I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of
              research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman
              want?'"</em><br> -From (the founder of psycho-analysis) <em>Sigmund Freud: Life and
              Work</em> by Ernest Jones, 1953<br> <br> Think about this for a second. If men knew what women really want,
              why wouldn't they just give it to them.<br> <br> In today's world, men can mainly be classified into two main
              categories. The majority of men in modern society fall into the
              category of Mr Teddy Bear. The other category is Mr MCP
              (male-chauvinistic pig)<br> <br> Mr Teddy Bear's love motto:"Your wish is my command." He is too
              considerate and overly sensitive towards her. He only thinks for
              others but never for himself. She classifies him as "too
              nice"<br> <br> Mr MCP's love motto:"My way or the highway." The only person he
              cares for is himself. 'Give' is not a word that exists in his
              dictionary and his favorite words are 'Me' and 'Take'<br> <br> And then of course, there is the third category which by now you
              might have already figured out. REAL MEN, are a rare breed. What
              makes a REAL MAN, you must be thinking to yourself now. In a sense,
              he is a perfect blend of the good qualities of Mr Teddy Bear and Mr
              MCP.<br> <br> He is a confident, decisive take-charge guy. He always conducts
              himself with class and manners. He is the leader in the
              relationship. He knows to compromise and give in when appropriate.
              He is not needy/clingy and his life does not revolve around hers.
              He brings her happiness through humour, respect, romance and
              affection. When she is down, he shows his support. When she talks,
              he listens with empathy. He apologizes when he is at fault but he
              never begs for her forgiveness/approval. She respects and looks up
              to him. In her mind, he is the knight on the stallion.<br> <br> These are some of the many traits that a REAL MAN possess. If you
              are just like him, i congratulate you for you are on the right
              path, at least when it comes to romantic relationships. But if you
              are more of Mr Teddy Bear or Mr MCP, its high time you think about
              how your actions and behaviour have impacted your current or past
              relationships in a negative way.<br> <br> When you have successfully developed yourself to display those
              qualities of a REAL MAN. Your partner will never entertain the
              thought of leaving you. In fact, she will treasure you because you
              have become her 'prince charming'. Women you interact with will
              naturally be attracted to you.<br> <br> Why are REAL MEN such a rare breed these days? This is due to the
              brainwashing prevalent in mainstream media and the lack of good
              role models to learn from today. Majority of women have no problems
              understanding men. In fact, relationships is their forte and
              majority of men are totally clueless when it comes to understanding
              women. There is a lot of garbage out there in mainstream media
              which only serves to confuse men further. One of the major culprits
              is advice for men provided by women which are politically correct
              and half truths. Such advice has only brainwashed us men into
              becoming her Teddy Bear which she will ultimately dump when her
              respect for us diminishes by the day and finally gets into the
              sewers.</p>
