              <p>A <strong>lie</strong> (also called <strong>prevarication</strong>), is a type of <a title="Deception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception">deception</a> in the form of an untruthful statement, especially with the intention
              to deceive others, often with the further intention to maintain a
              secret or reputation, protect someone's feelings or to avoid a <a title="Punishment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment">punishment</a>. <em>To lie</em> is to state something that one knows to be <a title="False" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False">false</a> or that one has not reasonably ascertained to be true with the intention that it be taken for the <a title="Truth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth">truth</a> by oneself or someone else. A <a title="Liar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar">liar</a> is a person who is lying, who has previously lied, or who tends by nature to lie repeatedly.</p>
              <p>Lying is typically used to refer to deceptions in oral or written communication.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sourcesÂ since July 2008">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></em>]</span></sup> Other forms of <a title="Deception" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception">deception</a>, such as <a class="mw-redirect" title="Disguise" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disguise">disguises</a> or <a title="Forgery" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery">forgeries</a>,
              are generally not considered lies, though the underlying intent may be
              the same. However, even a true statement can be considered a lie if the
              person making that statement is doing so to deceive. In this situation,
              it is the intent of being untruthful rather than the truthfulness of
              the statement itself that is considered.</p>
              <h3><span class="mw-headline">Types of lies</span></h3>
              <p>The various types of lies include the following:</p>
              <dl><dt>Fabrication</dt><dd>A fabrication is a lie told when someone submits a statement as truth, without knowing for certain whether or not it actually <em>is</em> true. Although the statement may be possible or plausible, it is not
              based on fact. Rather, it is something made up, or it is a
              misrepresentation of the truth.<br> Note: it is entirely possible (and common) for one to fabricate a lie and believe it.<br> Examples of fabrication: "The dog ate my homework", or "I did unplug the iron".</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Bold-faced lie</dt><dd>A bold-faced (or barefaced, or boldfaced, or bald-faced) lie is one
              which is told when it is obvious to all concerned that it is a lie. For
              example, a child who has chocolate all around his mouth and denies that
              he has eaten any chocolate is a bold-faced liar.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Lying by omission</dt><dd>One lies by omission by omitting an important fact, deliberately
              leaving another person with a misconception. Lying by omission includes
              failures to correct pre-existing misconceptions. A husband may tell his
              wife he was out at a store, which is true, but lie by omitting the fact
              that he also visited his mistress, although it is disputable whether or
              not this is actually a lie. In most cases, the person has not directly
              denied a truth, but merely omitted some part of what transpired.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Lie-to-children</dt><dd>A <a title="Lie-to-children" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children">lie-to-children</a> is a lie, often a <a title="Platitude" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude">platitude</a> which may use <a title="Euphemism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemism(s)</a>, which is told to make an adult subject acceptable to children. A common example is "The <a title="Stork" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork">stork</a> brought you" (in reference to childbirth).</dd></dl> <dl><dt>White lie</dt><dd>A white lie would cause no discord if it were uncovered, and offers
              some benefit to the liar, the hearer, or both. White lies are often
              used to avoid offense, such as telling someone that you think that
              their new outfit looks good, when you actually think that it is a
              horrible excuse for an outfit. In this case, the lie is told to avoid
              the harmful realistic implications of the truth. As a concept, it is
              largely defined by local custom and cannot be clearly separated from
              other lies with any authority. As such, the term may have differing
              meanings in different cultures. Lies which are harmless (but told for
              no reason) are generally called white lies.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Noble lie</dt><dd>A <a title="Noble lie" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_lie">noble lie</a> is one which would normally cause discord if it were uncovered, but
              which offers some benefit to the liar and assists in an orderly
              society, therefore potentially beneficial to others. It is often told
              to maintain law, order and safety. A noble lie usually has the effect
              of helping an <a title="Elite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite">elite</a> maintain power.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Emergency lie</dt><dd>An emergency lie is a strategic lie told when the truth may not be
              told because, for example, harm to a third party would result. For
              example, a neighbour might lie to an enraged husband about the
              whereabouts of his unfaithful wife, because said husband might
              reasonably be expected to inflict physical injury should he encounter
              his wife in person. Alternatively, an emergency lie could denote a
              (temporary) lie told to a second person because of the presence of a
              third.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Perjury</dt><dd><a title="Perjury" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury">Perjury</a> is the act of lying or making verifiably false statements on a material matter under oath or affirmation in a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Court of law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_law">court of law</a>, or in any of various sworn statements in writing. Perjury is a <a title="Crime" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime">crime</a>,
              because the witness has sworn to tell the truth and, for the
              credibility of the court to remain intact, witness testimony must be
              relied on as truthful.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Bluffing</dt><dd>Pretending to have a capability or intention which one does not actually possess. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bluffing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluffing">Bluffing</a> is an act of deception which is rarely seen as immoral, because it
              takes place in the context of a game where this kind of deception is
              consented to in advance by the players. For instance, a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Gambler" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler">gambler</a> who deceives other players into thinking he has different cards to
              those which he really holds, or an athlete who indicates he will move
              left and then actually dodges right, is not considered to be lying. In
              these situations, deception is accepted and indeed expected as a tactic.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Misleading</dt><dd>A <a class="mw-redirect" title="Misleading" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading">misleading</a> statement is one where there is no outright lie, but there still remains the purpose of making someone believe in an untruth.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Dissembling</dt><dd>"Dissembling" is a polite term for lying, though some might consider it a reference to merely <em>misleading</em>. It is usually considered to be a <a title="Euphemism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemism</a> for lying.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Exaggeration</dt><dd>An <a class="mw-redirect" title="Exaggeration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaggeration">exaggeration</a> occurs when the most fundamental aspect(s) of a statement is true, but
              only to a certain degree. An example of this sort of lie is when
              someone says they are so hungry they could eat a horse.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Jocose lies</dt><dd>Jocose lies are those which are meant in jest, and are usually understood as such by all present parties. Teasing and <a title="Sarcasm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm">sarcasm</a> are examples. A more elaborate instance is seen in <a title="Storytelling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling">storytelling</a> traditions which are present in some places, where the humour comes
              from the storyteller's insistence that he or she is telling the
              absolute truth, despite all evidence being to the contrary (i.e. <a title="Tall tale" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_tale">tall tale</a>). There is debate about whether these are "real" lies, and different philosophers hold different views (see below).</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Contextual lies</dt><dd>One can state part of the truth out of context, knowing that
              without complete information, it gives a false impression. Likewise,
              one can actually state accurate facts, yet deceive with them. To say
              "yeah, that's right, I slept with your <em>best friend</em>" utilizing a
              sarcastic, offended tone, may cause the listener to assume the speaker
              did not mean what he said, when in fact he did.</dd></dl> <dl><dt>Promotion lies</dt><dd>Advertisements often contain statements which are incredible, such
              as "We are always happy to give a refund", or exaggerated predictions
              such as "You will love our new product".</dd></dl> <dl><dt><a class="mw-redirect" title="Belief systems" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_systems">Belief systems</a></dt><dd>It is alleged<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> that some belief systems may find lying to be justified. <a title="Leo Tolstoy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> is cited<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> as describing religious institutions as "the product of deception [and] lies for a good purpose"</dd><dd><br><br></dd><dd><br></dd></dl>
