              <p>Have you heard of the term "Love at first sight" uttered from the mouth 
                  of a female? How can a woman fall in love with a man she has only set 
                  her eyes on for thirty seconds for the first time? If women claim that 
                  they are not shallow and do not go for looks, why is it they can fall in
                   love with a good-looking stranger they barely know. Where do you think 
                  the term "Love at first sight" came from? It sure doesn't sound like 
                  words a man would utter.<br> <br> Try this experiment if you are still not convinced. Get a dating website
                   account and use a photo of an average looking guy for your profile 
                  photo. Wink at as many girls as you want and count the number of 
                  positive responses you get. Now change your profile photo to that of a 
                  very good looking guy. Wink at the same number of girls and now count 
                  the number of positive responses you get. Well, i'm sure we are all 
                  smart enough to know instinctively the difference in the number of 
                  positive responses received without going through the hassle of the 
                  experiment.<br> <br> However, women are also right when they claim they are not shallow. 
                  Because although they might be initially attracted by a man's good 
                  looks, they also quickly look to verify that a man also has the manly 
                  qualities which she subconsciously desire. Without those manly 
                  qualities, a guy can only go as far as attracting a female who is 
                  interested in his looks but he would not be able to hold on to the lady 
                  for the long term. The more time she spends with him, the better she 
                  will get to know him in terms of his true character and personality 
                  which might not match up to his looks. That time it takes for her to 
                  discover a man's character traits invariably depends on how much 
                  interaction has taken place between her and the man.<br> <br> If her initial interest in the guy is very high, she might take a longer
                   time to finally decide to leave him because of his undesirable 
                  character traits. There's a reason why people say love is blind. On the 
                  other hand, if her initial interest in the guy is just moderate, she 
                  will be able to make up her mind about leaving him much sooner. This can
                   be as quick as only after one date. If a guy can manage to 
                  maintain/increase the lady's interest through his manly actions and 
                  behavior for more than three dates, there is a very high chance that the
                   lady has already decided to keep him. From time to time, the lady will 
                  look to test the man just to be assured that he still has those manly 
                  qualities which she desires from him over the long run. Once the man 
                  starts getting complacent or starts to take her for granted, her 
                  interest in him will start to dip and eventually she decides to leave.</p>
