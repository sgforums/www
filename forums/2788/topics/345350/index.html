              is the first sign of the Zodiac.This sign, more than any other, needs
              to lead. A natural-born warrior, fearless and courageous when positive,
              but foolhardy and reckless when negative, an Aries person is difficult
              to ignore, highly competitive, hard to beat, in sufferably annoying,
              but strangely likeable.Aries people are strong-willed, adventurous,
              naturally extrovert, and impulsive.Loaded with energy and vitality,
              they charge at full power into their endeavors and expect people to
              keep up with them. Most Arian people are direct, outspoken and
              uncomplicated. Arians can strike out and hurt, both mentally and
              physically, but they are just as quick to forgive and forget.<br>Zodiac compatibility: Libra, leo, sagittarius, gemini<br>Best Engagement Stone: diamond, bloodstone<br>Love color: red, black<br>Love flower: daisy<br><br><br><a title="Taurus compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/taurus-compatibility.html"><strong>Taurus compatibility</strong></a> <br>Taurus
              is the second sign of the zodiac.They are content to take second place
              in the ventures they undertake.Taureans are quiet, gentle people, but
              they know their own mind.The thought of too much action can sometimes
              make a Taurean feel physically sick.<br>Taurus people love money,
              wealth, and status more than anything else, and it is rare to find a
              truly poor Taurean.They know how to handle their finances, despite
              being spendthrifts, and like to be seen as the people who have
              everything. Taureans feel trapped or imprisoned if denied physical
              access to the land.They are always greenfingered in some way.<br>Zodiac compatibility: virgo, capricorn<br>Best Engagement Stone: sapphire<br>Love color: green<br>Love flower: carnation, roses, violets<br><br><br><a title="Gemini compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/gemini-compatibility.html"><strong>Gemini compatibility</strong></a> <br>Gemini
              signs are built with restlessness, versatility, and a constant desire
              for mental activity. Sometimes Gemini people cannot stop talking but
              it's mainly gossip for their own personal experiences. Geminis are
              clever. Their talent with words also makes them good writers and
              orators.<br>Geminis can bluff their way through any situation.
              Relatives, friends, and companions are very important to Gemini
              people.Their restless nature leads them to travel by road, rail, and
              air. The Geminians life may appear to be chaotic, but this is how they
              like it.<br>Zodiac compatibility: aquarius, aries, libra<br>Best Engagement Stone: agate, amber<br>Love color: yellow<br>Love flower: rose<br><br><br><a title="Cancer compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/cancer-compatibility.html"><strong>Cancer compatibility</strong></a> <br>Cancer
              signs have deep emotions and fathomless longings. Rather than take a
              risk and put all their energy into something that might fail, they
              prefer to wait and watch. When the time is ripe they dive in with great
              speed and efficiency. They are serious, caring, sensitive people with
              complex psyches.This is a sign that dislikes taking unneccessary risks.
              When the going gets tough, they are perfectly content to dig in and
              surround themselves with domestic comfort and security. A wounded
              Cancerian is not an easy person to deal with. Given the opportunity at
              the right time, people of this sign cope remarkably well with fame,
              fortune, and responsibility. Money and a sense of security play an
              important part in the Cancerian scheme of life.Though careful with
              money they are kind, generous and thoughtful.<br>Zodiac compatibility: scorpio, pisces<br>Best Engagement Stone: emerald, pearl<br>Love color: pearl white<br>Love flower: lily of the valley<br><br><br><a title="Leo compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/leo-compatibility.html"><strong>Leo compatibility</strong></a> <br>Proud
              and regal, fiery and determined, the subjects of the leo sign are
              always a bit larger than life. Leos love to be noticed, admired, and
              adored. Innately lazy and good-natured, it is often quite difficult for
              Leo subjects to make an effort to assert themselves. Leos are renowned
              for being eternal children. Leos are loyal, likable, and often quite
              lovely people, but they can also be self-indulgent, stubborn, and prone
              to sulking if they don't get their own way.They are warm,
              demonstrative, and theatrical and love pageantry, blitz and glamour.
              They love adornment of their physical self. When Leos commit themselves
              to something they go with it for life. Leos are honest in love life.
              Leos when loved and respected have hearts of gold. But when not loved
              or when they are not reciprocated they become depressed, self-pitying
              and self-destructive.<br>Zodiac compatibility: libra, leo, sagittarius, capricorn<br>Best Engagement Stone: onyx, diamond, amber, garnet<br>Love color: yellow, red, orange<br>Love flower: gladiolus<br><br><br><a title="Virgo compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/virgo-compatibility.html"><strong>Virgo compatibility</strong></a> <br>Virgos
              seem to sit on the fence looking backward with confidence and at the
              same time displaying a certain timidity in moving forward.Virgoan
              subjects are happy to remain in the background, employing their
              organizational skills to help those with extrovert talents.Virgos are
              practical, sensible, logical, and clever.They can make mountains out of
              molehills in both a positive and negative context .Virgos are renowned
              for their fussy, worrying, critical natures-traits which can be very
              irritating to other signs.They are perfectionists who need to have
              everything just right. No sign is more critical or more demanding of
              itself than Virgo. Fussiness, which borders on obsession at times, is
              apparent with most Virgoans.<br>Zodiac compatibility: taurus, capricorn, cancer, scorpio<br>Best Engagement Stone: cornelian<br>Love color: grey, yellow<br>Love flower: azalea<br><br><strong><br><a title="Libra compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/libra-compatibility.html">Libra compatibility</a> </strong><br>Libran
              subjects tend to center their lives around love and relationships.
              People born under Libra zodiac sign need a partner in order to be at
              their best and feel fulfilled. Librans are reluctant to select a
              direction until they are absolutely certain it is the right one. For
              this reason they tend to be thought indecisive.<br>Librans love to
              impose a sense of order in their lives-everything must look
              perfect-appearance, clothing, possessions, home and environment must be
              scrupulously clean and tidy. Most librans posses a hard, cold, steely
              core. When they are confronted and forced to show their true colors,
              subjects of this sign can turn out to be remarkably hard, aggressive,
              and verbally self protective. Outwardly likable, gracious, and caring,
              it comes as a surprise when, at the slightest hint of trouble, Librans
              quickly vanish.To achieve balance in all aspects of their lives is the
              ultimate aim of most Librans, but sometimes the means does not justify
              the end.<br>Zodiac compatibility: aquarius, gemini, aries, scorpio, leo<br>Best Engagement Stone: ruby, pearl, peridot<br>Love color: blue<br>Love flower: orchid<br><br><br><a title="Scorpio compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/scorpio-compatibility.html"><strong>Scorpio compatibility</strong></a> <br>Scorpio
              is probably the most feared and yet the most revered sign of the
              zodiac. Most Scorpios would not hurt a fly for they are as gentle,
              caring, and generous as they can be hard, cruel, and mean. It really
              depends how they are treated.This is a sign which demands respect and
              usually gets it. Scorpions are highly sensitive, emotional creators who
              are so easily hurt that they cannot bear to show their feelings for
              fear of being ridiculed.Scorpios develop from an early age the ability
              to control such outer expressions of emotion, and remain dry-eyed.
              Scorpios do not forgive easily, if even at all, and are capable of
              holding a grudge for the rest of their lives. Scorpio subjects are
              hardworking, generous, and very determined. Once they begin a task,
              they will be dedicated to finishing it. Scorpios can become obsessively
              devoted to a person, a cause, or a project.<br>Zodiac compatibility: libra, taurus, cancer, pisces<br>Best Engagement Stone: aquamarine, jasper, malachite<br>Love color: golden, black, red<br>Love flower: chrysanthemum<br><br><br><a title="Sagittarius compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/sagittarius-compatibility.html"><strong>Sagittarius compatibility</strong></a> <br>Given
              freedom, they are warm, affectionate, funny,and interesting companions
              .The adaptability of Sagittarius gives ambidexterity to its subject and
              enables them to tackle more than one thing at a time. Concentration is
              not their strong point, however, and they often become unstuck when
              talking on too much.Their love of change and variety makes them
              fascinating but unreliable .Projects are started but not finished,
              appointments and promises are made but not kept, and words are spoken
              which mean nothing a few days later.Sagittarians listen earnestly to
              advice but rarely follow it.They are easily able to forgive and forget.
              Regarded as the luckiest sign of the zodiac, Sagittarius always appear
              to land on their feet. They can be reckless and foolhardy, and children
              of this sign are often prone to accidents. Sagittarius are known for
              their bluntness and what they perceive is plain honesty. Diplomacy is
              an alien word to them. They are great storytellers.<br>Zodiac compatibility: sagittarius, gemini, libra, aries, leo<br>Best Engagement Stone: cornelian, topaz, opal<br>Love color: black, light blue<br>Love flower: jasmine<br><br><br><a title="Capricorn compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/capricorn-compatibility.html"><strong>Capricorn compatibility</strong></a> <br>Capricorn
              subjects have a sense of duty and responsibility toward themselves and
              others. Capricorns solider on down the road of success. Because they
              work hard at everything they do, they expect everyone else to be the
              same. Laziness, apathy, and lack of ambition are alien words to
              Capricorns.<br>From a very early age Capricorns seem to have old heads
              on their young shoulders. Baby capricorns have fewer tantrums than the
              other children of the zodiac cycle. Capricorns need masses of respect,
              recognition, and security in their lives. Capricorns of all types are
              intrinsically loyal, reliable, honest, hardworking, and astute.<br>Zodiac compatibility: virgo, taurus, scorpio<br>Best Engagement Stone: ruby, diamond, crystal<br>Love color: green, yellow, black<br>Love flower: tulip<br><br><br><a title="Aquarius compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/aquarius-compatibility.html"><strong>Aquarius compatibility</strong></a> <br>Aquarius
              is one of the hardest signs of the zodiac to understand. Aquarius are
              often felt to be unfathomable when in reality they live almost entirely
              on the surface.Aquarians will not reveal their innermost feelings no
              matter how hard others may try to persuade them, simply because they
              are unable to do so.People of this sign have a reputation for being
              enigmatic, difficult to understand, and different from everyone else,
              and cleverly play on this to gain power and attention.They are
              extremely friendly yet detached at a personal level, sociable in large
              gatherings, but unsociable at smaller meetings and parties which
              require greater intimacy. They are helpful and compassionate when
              involved with charities or group activities.<br>Zodiac compatibility: aries, leo, libra, gemini<br>Best Engagement Stone: garnet, turquoise, agate<br>Love color: blue<br>Love flower: violet<br><br><br><a title="Pisces compatibility" href="http://lovestoryblog.com/pisces-compatibility.html"><strong>Pisces compatibility</strong></a> <br>This
              is the sign which contains a little of every other sign and is often
              the hardest of all to understand. Pisces are rarely content. Typical
              Pisces subjects are quiet and introspective, preferring to watch and
              wait rather than dive straight in. They are generally kind,
              sympathetic, and supportive, and readily offer a listening ear for
              people with problems and a shoulder for friends to cry on.<br>But when
              the time comes that they need to be comforted themselves, they find it
              hard to express their feelings to others and often turn away and
              console themselves in private. The Pisces capacity to reach great
              heights and sink to the lowest depths leaves them vulnerable to
              addictions. Pisces are gullible and easily tempted, especially when
              young.<br>Zodiac compatibility: cancer, scorpio<br>Best Engagement Stone: amethyst, fluor spar<br>Love color: white, light blue, ocean green<br>Love flower: bluebell</p>

              <p>blame it on his sign: why men do the things they do</p>
              <p><strong>Aries</strong></p>
              <p><em>'Arrogant. Pompous. Vain. Cruel. Verbose. Show-off. I've been called all of these. Of course, I am.' </em><em>Howard Cosell (Born March 25)</em></p>
              <p>Passionate,
              idealistic, and sentimental, the Aries man is part hero, part child, no
              matter what his age. He's as friendly as a puppy, downright fearless,
              and rather like one of those weighted clowns that children punch. You
              can knock him down, but he will always bounce back. And, for as long as
              he loves you, he will be faithful, sexy, and attentive. If you feel
              weak in the knees, make sure there's a sofa handy to fall on, because
              by the time you've swooned, this Romeo will have moved on to his next
              conquest! Aries men are in love with love. The appeal is in the art of
              romance and the thrill of the chase, not your charming smile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some
              astrologers compare an Aries man to a knight in shining armour.
              However, you are just as likely to get run down by his charging steed
              as scooped up in a pair of loving arms. Sir Lancelot may have been bold
              and honest, but he was also a royal pain in the butt - a bit like your
              Aries man. His ego ruined a kingdom when, in his eagerness to run his
              hand up Guinevere's dress, he conveniently forgot his vow to King
              Arthur. In Lance's point of view, he was a hero, and to an Aries man,
              his point of view is the only one that counts. The Ram fears mediocrity
              more than death. He would rather be the biggest jerk in town than just
              another anonymous working slob. He is subjective, bossy, and has a
              caustic wit he inflicts with careless abandon. He takes pride in being
              more self-centered than Scorpio and more obtuse than Taurus. He's sure
              he's right, especially when he is wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Male Rams come in two
              types. Bold, brash, and ready for action or shy, quiet, and ready for
              action. Don't be fooled by the shy type. He may come over all 'Aw
              shucks' and toe shuffles, like Aries Dennis Quaid, but under that poker
              face, or enigmatic smile, his brain synapses are firing at 1,000 per
              minute, concentrating on the best way to get you into his bed in the
              shortest possible time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the door of the original Playboy
              Mansion in Chicago hung a brass plate with the inscription 'Si Non
              Oscillas, Noli Tintinnare' - the Latin for 'If you don't swing, don't
              ring'. Aries Hugh Hefner, the flip, hip, big daddy of hedonism, is
              still alive and well, and still the quintessential bad boy at 77.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember
              all of this before you buy your wedding dress. After the ceremony, he
              will expect you to worship the ground he makes you crawl on, while he
              declares his need for freedom. He will require you to have the house
              sparkling, the grass mowed, and the cars washed, all before he gets
              home from his latest adventure. He'll leave a trail of dirty clothes
              from the front door to the shower, while shouting his dinner order over
              his shoulder. When he appears at the table, he'll expect you to have a
              gourmet's delight in one hand and his favourite cold drink in the
              other. And, you'd better look like you just stepped out of the pages of
              Vogue. This man chases the ideal. He doesn't want a real woman, with
              real needs. He wants the adoration of a mother and the ethereal
              qualities of a fairy princess, all wrapped up in the figure of a
              Playboy centrefold. He thinks he is indestructible, but he's extremely
              accident-prone and seldom gets through life without a few broken bones,
              several concussions, and a couple of totalled cars. He is restless,
              fidgety, and has frequent headaches.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as he is either brash
              or shy, he'll either be a spendthrift or paranoid about starving to
              death. You'll have to cut out coupons and buy pork and beans in bulk,
              while he plays Mr Fix-It with the plumbing. You'll learn to sew and to
              raise your own veggies, while he attacks his latest money-making scheme
              with the same fierce energy that makes him shout at the TV and practise
              road rage in the church parking lot. If he's loose with cash, you'll
              have to work two jobs to keep the debt-collectors off your back and a
              roof over your heads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Ram communicates by temper tantrum. He
              will smash the glasses and put his fist through the wall one minute,
              then get jiggy with it the next. And he will be genuinely surprised
              when you resist his ardour as you're bent over the dustpan, sweeping up
              shards of crystal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your favourite martian will start a little
              war to have an excuse to slam out of the house and stay out until all
              hours. A Leo would announce that he's going out with the boys, and a
              Capricorn would tell you he's working late at the office, but Aries
              needs to rationalise his bad behaviour. If you're the bitch, then he is
              still the hero. The Greeks christened him the Ram. You can call him
              Butthead.</p>

              <p><strong>Virgo</strong></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><em>'I'm not afraid to let people know that I'm kind of an idiot.'</em><em>Terry Bradshaw (Born September 2)</em> <br><br>He's
              faithful, thoughtful, and cool-headed during a crisis. A Virgo man will
              be home in time for dinner, help you balance the cheque book, and help
              raise the children. Whether he's as sexy as Sean Connery, or as silly
              as Peter Sellers, he will always be by your side. He's conscientious,
              capable, thrifty, kind, and loyal. Sounds like a real boy scout,
              doesn't he? Well, he is - the bargain basement version. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>Life
              with a male Virgoan is like being pushed into traffic when you don't
              want to cross the street. Born with a superior attitude and an eye for
              improving everything except his own conduct, he is as relentless with
              his fault-finding as a pit bull locked onto a mailman's leg, and just
              as unsympathetic. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>At his worst, he's a classic chauvinist,
              dismissing what he doesn't believe and believing only what's convenient
              to his point of view. His one talent for conversation is a non-stop
              string of criticisms about every facet of your existence, from the way
              you wear your hair to your coupon-clipping ability. And he won't
              hesitate to insult your intelligence by demonstrating just how to
              accomplish either task. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>At his best, he has the kind of
              predictability that will give you sleeping sickness. He'll expect
              dinner promptly at six, where you will exchange news of the day's
              events. Then he'll spend an hour with the children, who will go to bed
              exactly at eight. Next comes an hour of telling you how to improve your
              housekeeping abilities. Finally, he'll retire to his home office where
              he'll spend the rest of the evening mumbling over the bills or
              developing a plan for your self-improvement. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>His character is
              purely idiosyncratic. Every Virgo has his own peculiar thought process
              and just as peculiar a speech pattern. Many self-made Virgo
              millionaires are unable to utter a sensible statement. <br><br>Throughout
              his career, legendary Hollywood producer Virgo Samuel Goldwyn adamantly
              refused to compromise his search for the finest talent, directors,
              screenwriters, and technical crews. You can't argue with perfection,
              and The Goldwyn Touch set a standard of excellence that has been
              seldom, if ever, matched. Sam also had an unmatched Virgo talent for
              trying to act superior and coming off as a total goofball. <br><br>When
              his secretary asked for permission to destroy files that were more than
              10 years old, Goldwyn said, 'Yes, but keep copies'. He's also credited
              with such gems as, 'Give me a couple of years, and I'll make that
              actress an overnight success,' 'If I look confused, it's because I'm
              thinking,' and 'True. I've been a long time making up my mind, but now
              I'm giving you a definite answer maybe.' </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>Argue with yours, and
              he'll stare at you as if you've just lost your mind, for he can't
              believe you dared to disagree. Then he will repeat, word by word, the
              conversation, question, or disagreement that led you to throw the
              toaster at his head. Soon, you will feel as if ants were crawling
              through your brain and will apologise just to shut him up. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>You
              can take comfort in the knowledge that if you are determined to force
              his hand, you can send him to bed with a tummy ache. The fact that he's
              pretending to be ill, and he knows you know it, makes no difference. A
              male Virgo will feign anything from a headache to a heart attack if he
              feels cornered. He's as loathe to confront a situation as is his
              opposite, Pisces, but where Pisces fears confrontation itself, Virgo
              fears facing any unpleasantries about himself. Of course, he will
              expect you to rush to his side with chicken soup and spoon-feed him. If
              he can't control you with his superiority, he'll try to by appearing
              helpless. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>If you want romance and love songs, choose any other
              sign (except Capricorn), because you won't find it with this man. Serve
              him dinner by candlelight and he'll complain he can't see what he's
              eating. He'll talk a lot about sex and isn't above leering at the
              nearest pretty face. However, he's really not into promiscuity, even
              the legal kind, except on Wednesday and Saturday nights, unless it's
              tax season, then revise that schedule to Saturday from 9 to 9:15. He's
              so methodical that you can put a cake in the oven and be assured that
              his buzzer will go off five minutes before the kitchen timer. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>A
              Virgo man is nervous, nit-picky, and as selfish as a spinster guarding
              her assets. Emotional scenes baffle and alarm him because he fears
              losing control. Unless, of course, he plans to lose control, and even
              then he will try to orchestrate the outcome. Like Mr Spock, too much
              unbridled passion makes his brain melt. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><em>'I wouldn't be caught dead marrying a woman old enough to be my wife.' </em><em>Tony Curtis (Born June 3)</em> <br><br>He
              is simply irresistible. The Gemini man is a fun-loving, independent,
              roguish romantic who has a doctorate in flirting. He can cook an exotic
              dinner. Then dance with you in the starlight, point out the
              constellations, and capture your heart with his beautiful version of
              their myths. But don't invite the wedding guests yet. While you are
              mentally compiling the guest list, he will excuse himself to get you a
              fresh glass of chilled wine, and while in the kitchen, manage to phone
              three other girls for dates next weekend. The only thing this
              schmoozing, womanising, party animal is interested in is adding your
              phone number and bra size to his ever-increasing list of victims. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>Gemini
              movie star Errol Flynn was long regarded as the black sheep of
              Hollywood. The phrase 'in like Flynn' was coined as tribute to his
              ability to score. His real-life adventures, rebellions, and general
              unruliness rivalled those of the swashbuckling heroes he portrayed.
              Flynn was married three times and cheated on all of his wives. His
              first wife, French actress Lily Damita, said, 'You never know when he's
              telling the truth. He lies for the fun of it.' His life was one of
              cheerful excess. But, by his late forties, his hurricane-force
              existence had taken its toll, and he was a burned-out shell of his
              former, lively self. Flynn died of a heart attack at 50. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>Your
              Twin will probably not be quite as bad, but all Gemini men have a gypsy
              moth's fatal attraction to a pretty face. Totally faithful Gems do
              exist, but are rarer than a shy Sagittarius. In fact, the word
              'faithful' has a different meaning to a Gemini man. Think of Gemini
              Brigham Young, the Mormon founder of Salt Lake, who had 27 wives. I'm
              sure that, in his mind, Brother Brigham considered himself a devoted
              and faithful husband. In my mind, he was in Gemini paradise. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>Yours
              will have five hobbies, four careers, and an assortment of friends that
              resemble a mini-United Nations. But, his intellectual prowess is
              limited to his ability to memorise the various versions of Trivial
              Pursuit and entertaining his friends by tearing you to pieces with his
              merciless, acerbic tongue. He lives to put down people, and will call
              you fat ass in public, or snap his fingers at you when his glass is
              empty. Cold-hearted and calculating, he is a blatant social climber and
              will propose on the first date if he smells money. As a husband, he is
              ambivalent. The only thing this guy's passionate about is being
              entertained. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt"><br><br>If you think love means being together at least
              some of the time, sharing dinner, and watching TV, you had better find
              yourself a homey Cancer, or a quiet Virgo, and send this horny hound
              dog packing. Or you could look on the bright side. You may be
              hysterical and freaked out half the time, but you'll never be bored. </span></p>

              first thing you'll notice is his genuine, and adorable, smile. The
              Cancer man is sweet, chivalrous, and has a wonderfully off-beat sense
              of humour that can be downright loony. He is sentimental, sensual, and
              truly affectionate. He is a traditionalist who respects the proprieties
              of courtship, believes in family and forever, and he's absolutely the
              best snuggle-bunny in the universe. <br><br>You may see an ideal mate,
              but what you get is an ideal stalker. A male Crab's idea of devotion is
              bonding at the hip, so unless you are prepared to become his Siamese
              twin, run in the opposite direction as fast as possible. In bed he is
              tender, but so passive that you'll soon tire of always being on top. <br><br>His
              devotion is legendary. However, don't say 'I do' until you understand
              that this extends to every friend and relative he's ever had,
              especially mother. It's not above him to wait until the honeymoon to
              tell you she's coming to live with you as soon as you return. <br><br>He's
              subjective. His favourite game is 'Guess How I'm Feeling'. You will be
              expected to read his mind, sense his moods, and mend his fragile ego,
              all without benefit of knowing what has upset him. Don't worry.
              Everything upsets him. Forget to buy toothpaste, and he'll decide you
              don't love him anymore. Say you want a night out with the girls, and
              he'll expect divorce papers in the morning. </span></p>

              lean. You'll fall for his shy charm and those big, sad eyes. He may
              remind you of a slow-talkin', slow-walkin' hero like Gary Cooper or
              Henry Fonda. His needs are simple: home and hearth, a good woman, and a

              may offer old-shoe comfort, but what you're likely to get is an
              army-boot mentality. Hook up with the Bull and either do things his
              way, or do your thing alone. He won't mind your independence, if it
              benefits him in some way, and as long as dinner is ready when he
              appears. Don't expect to be showered with praise and lavish attention.
              But do expect to be cast in the role of the little woman. Of all the
              men in the universe, this one expects the 1950s textbook version. He
              will buy your clothes, pick your friends, and criticise your beliefs.
              He is judgmental and fixed in his ideas, attitudes, and prejudices.
              Nothing you can say or do will change him. You'll have the distinct
              feeling of being boiled alive slowly, just as the proverbial frog, and
              you will be right. Mr T invented the smothering relationship. <br><br>He
              is jealous, possessive, and obsessive. Piss him off and he'll hold a
              grudge. Unfortunately, it's not a silent one. He will snipe and pick
              and make nasty remarks until you want to bash in his head with the

              <p><span class="promotxt"><strong>'If only I had a little humility, I would be perfect.' <em>Ted Turner (Born November 19)</em> </strong><br><br>Whether
              he is tall, dark, and handsome or short, blond, and chubby, a Scorpio
              man is idealistic, passionate, and loyal. He will mesmerise you with
              his candid, purposeful stare and capture your heart with his magnetic
              charm. He may be as cuddly as Sinbad, or as sexy as Leonardo DiCaprio;
              wear a white collar, a blue collar, or no collar at all; but here is
              the man who is impossible to resist. Think you've hit the jackpot?
              Think again, sweetheart. <br><br>Loving a male Scorpion is like
              falling for King Kong. Oh, he's sexy and, underneath that aloof
              exterior, surprisingly sensitive. Of course, that titbit of knowledge
              may not help when you are handed divorce papers because you said his
              best friend was a low-life slob. Other guys might sit down to discuss
              their feelings. Mr Intense will sit down and rip yours to shreds. <br><br>He
              is selfish. Never mind that you are married to him or in a serious
              relationship. The Scorpion's idea of commitment is showing up for
              dinner most of the time. His emotion switch is set at sub-zero, and he
              won't hesitate to be unfaithful until he's dead. However, contrary to
              popular belief, he is not sex-crazed. That trait belongs to cousin
              Aries. Scorpio is terrified of deep emotional dependence on just one
              person, so, in his usual ass-backward way, he screws around precisely
              to avoid intimacy. <br><br>A male Scorpion has two reasons for living.
              The first is power. The second is control. He would control fate if he
              could - and some try. He will usually be a good provider because his
              desire for power and control drives him to become successful in his
              chosen profession. But money is rarely his primary motivation.
              Financial gain is only a by-product of becoming Mr Big. His moods
              change faster than a Pisces flipping the remote, and he will test your
              love by demanding the devotion of a religious fanatic at a revival
              meeting. He's so jealous, possessive, and sarcastic that you will be
              tempted to poison his oatmeal. There's no handling a Scorpion. You
              either put up with him or run like hell.</span></p>

              <p><span class="promotxt"><strong>'I make it up all different every time I'm asked.'<br> <em>Andy Warhol (Born August 6)</em> </strong><br><br>A
              Leo male is warm-hearted, generous, and dignified. He's a genuine
              romantic you won't have to tempt twice to go for a moonlit stroll or to
              your favourite hideaway for the weekend. The Lion seeks a mate who is
              stable, family-oriented, and intelligent. His family adores him, he
              keeps his friends laughing, and he's always the centre of attention. In
              the office. In jail. At the beach. He's the centre of attention.
              Always. <br><br>His favourite game is Commander-in-Chief. A Leo will
              snap off orders with the crispness of a general ordering his troops and
              expect you to move at double time to wait on him hand and foot. He
              demands to be rewarded for coming home in the evening, and he demands
              your respect, whether he deserves it or not. Should he remember your
              birthday, nothing but a blatant display of fawning will satisfy his
              ego. <br><br>He rarely loses his temper as long as you call him
              'master' while bowing in respect. Challenge his authority, and he will
              roar, kick the sofa, and issue a couple of ultimatums designed to
              strike fear in your heart. As soon as the scene is over, everything is
              forgotten. Be stupid enough to deliberately wound a Lion's pride or,
              worse, attack his dignity, and you'll soon feel like helpless prey
              being sized up for dinner. <br><br>If he's a quiet Lion, he'll be a
              benevolent dictator who wants you to hover over him constantly. He'll
              want you to rub his aching shoulders and tell him how fit, strong, and
              wonderful he is, no matter what his age or physical condition. He, on
              the other hand, will not hesitate to tell you that your hair is a mess,
              your ass is too big, and that you have the intelligence of a gnat. When
              you burst into tears, he will be genuinely shocked because, in his
              mind, he was only trying to give you the benefit of his wise counsel. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong><em>'The great question - which I have not been able to answer - is 'What does a woman want?'<br></em><em>Sigmund Freud (Born May 6)</em></strong><br><br>He's patient, prudent, and persevering, a tower of strength on whom you can lean. You'll fall for his shy charm and those big, sad eyes. He may remind you of a slow-talkin', slow-walkin' hero like Gary Cooper or Henry Fonda. His needs are simple: home and hearth, a good woman, and a nest egg for that rainy day. But before you start drooling, read on!<br><br>Taurus may offer old-shoe comfort, but what you're likely to get is an army-boot mentality. Hook up with the Bull and either do things his way, or do your thing alone. He won't mind your independence, if it benefits him in some way, and as long as dinner is ready when he appears. Don't expect to be showered with praise and lavish attention. But do expect to be cast in the role of the little woman. Of all the men in the universe, this one expects the 1950s textbook version. He will buy your clothes, pick your friends, and criticise your beliefs. He is judgmental and fixed in his ideas, attitudes, and prejudices. Nothing you can say or do will change him. You'll have the distinct feeling of being boiled alive slowly, just as the proverbial frog, and you will be right. Mr T invented the smothering relationship.<br><br>He is jealous, possessive, and obsessive. Piss him off and he'll hold a grudge. Unfortunately, it's not a silent one. He will snipe and pick and make nasty remarks until you want to bash in his head with the nearest blunt object.</span></p>
