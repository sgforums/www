              <p><span class="promotxt"><strong>'My divorce came as a complete surprise to me. That will happen when you haven't been home in 18 years.' - <em>Lee Trevino (December 1)</em></strong> <br><br>He's
              honest, trusting, and eternally optimistic. He won't restrict your
              freedom, or expect you to drop your nights out with friends in favour
              of staying home with him. He may have a wry perspective on life similar
              to Mark Twain's or the diplomacy of Winston Churchill. An Archer wants
              a companion to accompany him on frequent, spontaneous outings to
              wonderfully diverse places, because to him, life is to be explored and
              enjoyed. <br><br>Before you decide he's your soul mate, understand
              that a male Sagittarius has the same attitude toward commitment as does
              his mythological symbol, the Centaur. He spends all of his youth and
              most of his adulthood in continual heat. He is an accomplished lover,
              but it's the deed he desires, not you. <br><br>You no doubt fell for
              his smile and talent for quoting Shakespeare while simultaneously
              unfastening your bra. But, as a partner, he makes a great friend, one
              you won't see very often because his idea of home is a place to drop in
              when he needs a change of clothes or a shower. Since an Archer could
              happily live in a cave for months, eating crickets and contemplating
              his navel, even if you marry him, you'll feel like you're still single.
              Don't expect to lean on his shoulder or cling to his arm. Do expect to
              be his pal (or groupie) and to spend many nights alone. He's neither
              jealous nor possessive. </span></p>
              <p><span class="promotxt">In fact, he wants you to have a life
              independent of his because that allows him more time for drinking beer
              with his mate and following the football. He is the one guy in the
              universe who was born to be a bachelor. He won't care how you dress,
              who your friends are, or where you spend your time, as long as you
              don't bother him with the details. He's too busy elucidating his latest
              theory for solving all the problems of the world. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Gemini</strong></p>
              <p><span><em>'I wouldn't be caught dead marrying a woman
              old enough to be my wife.'</em> <em>Tony Curtis (Born June
              3)</em><br> <br> He is simply irresistible. The Gemini man is a fun-loving,
              independent, roguish romantic who has a doctorate in flirting. He
              can cook an exotic dinner. Then dance with you in the starlight,
              point out the constellations, and capture your heart with his
              beautiful version of their myths. But don't invite the wedding
              guests yet. While you are mentally compiling the guest list, he
              will excuse himself to get you a fresh glass of chilled wine, and
              while in the kitchen, manage to phone three other girls for dates
              next weekend. The only thing this schmoozing, womanising, party
              animal is interested in is adding your phone number and bra size to
              his ever-increasing list of victims.</span></p>
              <p><span><br> <br> Gemini movie star Errol Flynn was long regarded as the black sheep
              of Hollywood. The phrase 'in like Flynn' was coined as tribute to
              his ability to score. His real-life adventures, rebellions, and
              general unruliness rivalled those of the swashbuckling heroes he
              portrayed. Flynn was married three times and cheated on all of his
              wives. His first wife, French actress Lily Damita, said, 'You never
              know when he's telling the truth. He lies for the fun of it.' His
              life was one of cheerful excess. But, by his late forties, his
              hurricane-force existence had taken its toll, and he was a
              burned-out shell of his former, lively self. Flynn died of a heart
              attack at 50.</span></p>
              <p><span><br> <br> Your Twin will probably not be quite as bad, but all Gemini men
              have a gypsy moth's fatal attraction to a pretty face. Totally
              faithful Gems do exist, but are rarer than a shy Sagittarius. In
              fact, the word 'faithful' has a different meaning to a Gemini man.
              Think of Gemini Brigham Young, the Mormon founder of Salt Lake, who
              had 27 wives. I'm sure that, in his mind, Brother Brigham
              considered himself a devoted and faithful husband. In my mind, he
              was in Gemini paradise.</span></p>
              <p><span><br> <br> Yours will have five hobbies, four careers, and an assortment of
              friends that resemble a mini-United Nations. But, his intellectual
              prowess is limited to his ability to memorise the various versions
              of Trivial Pursuit and entertaining his friends by tearing you to
              pieces with his merciless, acerbic tongue. He lives to put down
              people, and will call you fat ass in public, or snap his fingers at
              you when his glass is empty. Cold-hearted and calculating, he is a
              blatant social climber and will propose on the first date if he
              smells money. As a husband, he is ambivalent. The only thing this
              guy's passionate about is being entertained.</span></p>
              <p><span><br> <br> If you think love means being together at least some of the time,
              sharing dinner, and watching TV, you had better find yourself a
              homey Cancer, or a quiet Virgo, and send this horny hound dog
              packing. Or you could look on the bright side. You may be
              hysterical and freaked out half the time, but you'll never be
              bored.</span></p>

              stop talking but it's mainly gossip for their own personal
              experiences. Geminis are clever. Their talent with words also makes
              them good writers and orators.<br> Geminis can bluff their way through any situation. Relatives,
              friends, and companions are very important to Gemini people.Their
              restless nature leads them to travel by road, rail, and air. The

                                          slob. Other guys might sit down to discuss their feelings. Mr

                                          up for dinner most of the time. His emotion switch is set at

                                          profession. But money is rarely his primary motivation. Financial
                                          gain is only a by-product of becoming Mr Big. His <span style="color: #0000ff;">moods change
                                          faster</span> than a Pisces flipping the remote, and he will test your
                                          love by demanding the devotion of a religious fanatic at a revival
                                          meeting. He's so <span style="color: #0000ff;">jealous</span>, possessive, and sarcastic that you will
                                          be tempted to poison his oatmeal. There's no handling a Scorpion.
                                          You either put up with him or run like hell.</span></p>

              <p>if you believe in western astrology, rising signs play a part in character mold too. It's supposed to signify the mask you don in front of others. You should be cancer rising, like myself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> These people
                            come across as gentle creatures. There's something familiar about
                            them -- they're the guy or gal next door. When they enter a room,
                            they don't walk in with a splash. Instead, they move to the sides
                            and weave their way inwards. These people have a familiar feel to them.
                            Because they are rather sensitive to their environment, they can
               get flustered easily, especially in public.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Their first instinct, when
                            threatened or on unfamiliar ground, is to protect themselves. When
                            new situations present themselves, they can immediately withdraw
                            or act shy. Generally, these people come across as caring people.
                            They seem quite sweet -- even innocent. Usually, these people
                            appear unassuming enough to be quite approachable. Some Cancer
                            Ascendants, however, have retreated into themselves so much as to
                            be quite the opposite.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Since Capricorn is on the
                            Descendant, Cancer Ascendant people are looking for structure and
                            security in their partner and their relationship. These people
                            function best when their partner displays strength, financial and
                            emotional stability, and know-how. In fact, many Cancer Ascendants
                            prefer it when their relationship has well-defined rules. Security
                            is the basic need, and they are generally more than willing to
                            give up some personal freedom in order to get it. In some cases,
                            Cancer Ascendant people can surprise their partners. Why? Because
                            they come across as rather unassuming, family-oriented people.
                            When it comes to marriage, they have a rather matter-of-fact,
                            practical approach. </span></p>
