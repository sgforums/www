There is no need to get attached for lust and besides, to do so would be morally wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>Patrik, you're single because you don't want to compromise You live alone and like it, thanksverymuch. Well, at least some of the time. You prefer coming and going as you please, and you don't like to be controlled or held responsible for someone else's schedule or needs. After all, you probably have plenty of friends, a satisfying career (or other projects to occupy your time), and you may simply not have room for another person right now Â— unless of course they can bend to meet your routine exactly. Does this sound familiar?<br><br>While we admire your go-it-alone attitude Â— and your carefree, open-minded spirit Â— you may be shutting out others from your life without realizing it. You never know, maybe if you met the right person you could learn to grow together Â— while holding onto your hard-earned independence.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tinuviel, you're single because you don't want to get hurt<br><br>Ever heard the expression, "Once bitten, twice shy?" You can probably relate to this, can't you? Your last relationship may have left you a little raw in emotions, and the memories are likely still fresh in your mind. Fresher than you can sometimes believe. With a hurt like that, you're probably not so eager to enter the drama again Â— and we can't say that we blame you. You may be so afraid of getting hurt that you take things to heart big-time when you're involved with someone Â— after all, you've been hurt before, why can't it happen again? You also may be guilty of comparing potential mates to your ex who may still constantly loom large in your mind.<br><br>But maybe, just maybe, it's time to check your baggage at the door and let a new person into your life with a clean slate. You have a lot to offer someone, but you can't do it when you have one foot firmly planted in the past.</div>

Ever since you were a kid, you've probably dreamed of the perfect wedding, coming home to a white picket fence, dog, and 2.2 kids (how does that work, anyway?). When someone asks what you're looking for, you don't skip a beat: You're likely to have a handy checklist that details your perfect partner. Hair and eye color, height, religion, education, career, interests, the list goes on.<br><br>While it's great to have standards Â— Hey, you shouldn't have to settle, after all Â— there's one slight glitch in your master plan: No one has made the grade in real life Â— at least not yet. Next time you're out with someone, keep yourself from mentally checking that list, and give love Â— and others Â— a chance. That special someone who you've written off may be perfect for you after all...<br><br></div>
