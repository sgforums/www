              <p>by <span class="author vcard fn">Love Coach Rinatta</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his research he discovered that a man will most likely cheat if
              he feels unappreciated and unloved by his wife. This is absolutely true
              and I have been telling clients that for years. The reason anyone has
              an affair is because their needs are not getting met in their primary
              relationship and most often, these needs are emotional rather than
              physical.</p>
              <p>At the same time, why are women not appreciating the men that then
              end up cheating? In most cases it’s not because the wife is simply a
              b-itch, but it’s because the man is behaving badly, is not stepping up
              to the plate in the marriage, or is not being loving and appreciative
              of her.</p>
              <p>So it’s a vicious cycle. The man stops being as a good a partner he
              once used to be, or the marriage becomes a family and the man does not
              step up to his share of the responsibilities and being there. The wife
              feels less appreciative and loving because she feels less supported,
              cared for and loved. The man feels less appreciated and eventually may
              go out and find a girlfriend to make him feel better about himself.</p>
              <p>This also applies to long term relationships that are not marriages and also applies to women who end up cheating.</p>
              <p>So how are you supposed to negotiate the murky waters of
              relationships so as to avoid the devastation of cheating in your
              relationship? I don’t yet know if The Truth About Cheating goes into
              this, but here is my 4 step plan.</p>
              <p>1. Appreciate what you husband/partner is doing for you, your
              family, around you, regardless of what else he may not be doing. This
              may be hard, but you would want it done for you, and it will preserve
              the love in your marriage/relationship.</p>
              <p>2. If there are things that bother you about what your partner is
              doing or not doing, how he/she is treating you or not treating you, ask
              for change in a loving, respectful way. Ask for change repeatedly if it
              is important to you.</p>
              <p>3. If you need to, get professional help as an individual or a
              couple to try to help your partner make the changes necessary to help
              you both be happier with each other. You may also need to make changes
              to function better in your relationship.</p>
              <p>4. If there are problems in your marriage or relationship, things
              you have repeatedly asked him (or her) to change and the change is not
              forthcoming, make a choice. Choose between:</p>
              <p>(a) Make peace with your partner as he/she is because obviously
              there is not going to be the change you want. That means you let go of
              what you want completely and make peace with what is.</p>
              <p>(b) Leave because you can not live with the marriage/relationship
              and your partner the way things are and obviously there is not going to
              be the change you want</p>
              <p>Affairs happen when both partners can not make peace with how things
              are, but can not leave. The non-cheating partner can not make peace
              with how she is being treated and retaliates by trying to make her
              husband feel bad about his unwillingness to change his behavior.</p>
              <p>And he does feel bad and can’t live with feeling bad. Instead of
              encouraging change in him, feeling bad drives him into the arms of
              another woman.</p>
              <p>You may think it should not be this way, but it is.</p>
              <p>That is why it is so important to pick a partner who can most
              naturally give you what you want in a relationship, so that you do not
              have to pull teeth to get your needs met. If you happen to be single
              and you want to make sure that your next partner is highly compatible
              with you, get my <a href="http://www.whatittakes.com/classes/whodoyouneed.html">Who Do You Need eCourse</a>, which will help you figure out just whom you need to be in a relationship with.</p>
              <p>And secondarily, that is why it is so important to deal with
              relationship problems and issues as soon as they occur, rather than
              letting them fester and grow worst. I don’t yet know what tips this
              affair book has for improving marriage, but I am sure they are great.
              And if you want more good ideas that will work to improve your
              marriage, take a look at <a href="http://www.whatittakes.com/classes/relationshiphelp.html">three ebooks I have crated for marriage improvement.</a></p>

              <p>it's not wrong to want to meet your other half's needs. it's just that there are many factors to consider. maybe the person you met are not meant for you. humans are complex in their thinking as their age matures. it's a blessing to be simple.</p>
