              First Cardinal Rule of Dating
                  
              1.Study and do your homework. How? Take the time to find out your date's personality, her likes and dislikes, food preferences, leisure time activities! By doing your homework, you ensure that your first encounter and/or first date will not be a disaster. However, if you are pressed for time and unable to do your homework then you just have to wing everything very carefully, attentively and pay close attention to the woman's nuances of speech, body language and behavior.

              2. Relax and hang loose. Never ever be uptight because when you are tense and anxious, the more likely you will make costly mistakes. Hey, it's not just you, the other person you are with, in all probability is also nervous, so the best thing for you to do is to relax, be at ease and make small talk. Make sure to get her attention and make doubly sure that you keep it! Be easygoing. Women find men who are easygoing more interesting and fun to be with. Be confident. If you want, you can make safe jokes to break the ice but avoid flirting at all costs! Ninety-nine percent of women find it easier to be at ease and comfortable when the men they are with are funny or hilarious - laughter takes the stress off the situation of being with a total stranger on a one-on-one situation and believe it or not, it makes them feel safe (which is to your advantage).

              Science..and Seduction.. Oddfellows or Bedfellows? 
              A More Scientific Approach to Flirting!
              If flirting is instinctive, why do we need this Guide?
              
              Like every other human activity, flirting is governed by a complex set of unwritten laws of etiquette. These rules dictate where, when, with whom and in what manner we flirt. We generally obey these unofficial laws instinctively, without being conscious of doing so.
              
              Where to flirt?
              
              Parties
              
              Flirting is most socially acceptable at parties, celebrations and social occasions/functions. At some such events (e.g. Christmas/New Year parties) a degree of flirtatious behaviour is not only socially sanctioned, but almost expected.
              
              This is because most parties, celebrations, carnivals and festivals are governed by a special code of behaviour which anthropologists call 'cultural remission' - a temporary, structured relaxation of normal social controls and restrictions.
              
              This might just sound like a fancy way of saying 'letting your hair down', but it isn't. 'Cultural remission' does not mean abandoning all your inhibitions, letting rip and behaving exactly as you please. There are rules of behaviour at even the wildest carnival - although they may involve a complete reversal of normal, everyday social etiquette. Flirtatious behaviour which is normally frowned upon may be actively required, and prissy refusal to participate may incur disapproval.
              
              Drinking Places
              
              Flirting is also socially acceptable in some public settings, usually where alcohol is served - such as bars, pubs, night-clubs, discos, wine bars, restaurants, etc. One survey showed that 27% of British couples first met their current partner in a pub, and alcohol was voted the most effective aid to flirting by respondents in the Martini Flirting Survey.
              
              Flirting in drinking-places is, however, subject to more conditions and restrictions than at parties. In pubs, for example, the area around the bar counter is universally understood to be the 'public zone', where initiating conversation with a stranger is acceptable, whereas sitting at a table usually indicates a greater desire for privacy. Tables furthest from the bar counter are the most 'private' zones.
              
              Learning-places
              
              Schools, colleges, universities and other educational establishments are hot-beds of flirting. This is largely because they are full of young single people making their first attempts at mate selection.
              
              Learning-places are also particularly conducive to flirting because the shared lifestyle and concerns of students, and the informal atmosphere, make it easy for them to initiate conversation with each other. Simply by being students, flirting partners automatically have a great deal in common, and do not need to struggle to find topics of mutual interest.
              
              Flirting is officially somewhat more restricted in learning-places than in drinking-places, as education is supposed to take priority over purely social concerns, but in many cases the difference is not very noticeable. Taking a course or evening class may in fact provide more opportunities for relaxed, enjoyable flirting than frequenting bars and night-clubs.
              
              Workplace
              
              At work, flirting is usually acceptable only in certain areas, with certain people and at specific times or occasions. There are no universal laws: each workplace or working environment has its own unwritten etiquette governing flirtatious behaviour.
              
              In some companies, the coffee machine or cafeteria may be the unofficial 'designated flirting zones', other companies may frown on any flirting during office hours, or between managers and staff, while some may have a long-standing tradition of jokingly flirtatious morning greetings.
              
              Careful observation of colleagues is the best way to discover the unspoken flirting etiquette of your own workplace - but make sure that you are guided by the behaviour of the most highly regarded individuals in the company, not the office 'clown', 'groper' or 'bimbo'.
              
              Participant sports/hobbies
              
              Almost any participant sport or hobby can involve flirting. The level of flirtatious behaviour, however, often tends to be inversely related to the standards achieved by participants and their enthusiasm for the activity.
              
              You will generally find a lot of flirting among incompetent tennis players, unfit swimmers, cack-handed potters, etc., but somewhat less among more proficient, serious, competitive participants in the same activities. There are of course exceptions to this rule, but before joining a team or club, it is worth trying to find out if the members have burning ambitions to play in the national championships or win prestigious awards for their handiwork. If you are mainly looking for flirting opportunities, avoid these high-flying groups, and seek out clubs full of happy, sociable under-achievers.
