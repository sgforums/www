              <p>heres mine..</p>
              <p><strong>Your view on yourself:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label1">Other people find you very interesting, but you are
              really hiding your true self. Your friends love you because you are a
              good listener. They'll probably still love you if you learn to be
              yourself with them.</span></p>
              <p><strong>The type of girlfriend/boyfriend you are looking for:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label2">You are not looking merely for a girl/boyfriend - you
              are looking for your life partner. Perhaps you should be more
              open-minded about who you spend time with. The person you are looking
              for might hide their charm under their exterior.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Your readiness to commit to a relationship:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label3">You prefer to get to know a person very well before deciding whether you will commit to the relationship.</span></p>
              <p><strong>The seriousness of your love:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label4">You are very serious about relationships and aren't
              interested in wasting time with people you don't really like. If you
              meet the right person, you will fall deeply and beautifully in love.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Your views on education</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label5">Education is very important in life. You want to study hard and learn as much as you can.</span></p>
              <p><strong>The right job for you:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label6">You have many goals and want to achieve as much as
              you can. The jobs you enjoy are those that let you burn off your
              considerable excess energy.</span></p>
              <p><strong>How do you view success:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label7">You are afraid of failure and scared to have a go at
              the career you would like to have in case you don't succeed. Don't give
              up when you haven't yet even started! Be courageous.</span></p>
              <p><strong>What are you most afraid of:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label8">You are concerned about your image and the way others
              see you. This means that you try very hard to be accepted by other
              people. It's time for you to believe in who you are, not what you wear.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Who is your true self:</strong></p>
              <p><span id="Label9">You are mature, reasonable, honest and give good
              advice. People ask for your comments on all sorts of different issues.
              Sometimes you might find yourself in a dilemma when trapped with a
              problem, which your heart rather than your head needs to solve.</span></p>

              Your view on yourself:
              Other people find you very interesting, but you are really hiding your true self. Your friends love you because you are a good listener. They'll probably still love you if you learn to be yourself with them.
              
              The type of girlfriend/boyfriend you are looking for:
              You like serious, smart and determined people. You don't judge a book by its cover, so good-looking people aren't necessarily your style. This makes you an attractive person in many people's eyes.

              The seriousness of your love:
              You are very serious about relationships and aren't interested in wasting time with people you don't really like. If you meet the right person, you will fall deeply and beautifully in love.

              The right job for you:
              You're a practical person and will choose a secure job with a steady income. Knowing what you like to do is important. Find a regular job doing just that and you'll be set for life.

              What are you most afraid of:
