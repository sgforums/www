              Your view on yourself:
              
              You are intelligent, honest and sweet. You are friendly to everybody and don't like conflict. Because you're so cheerful and fun people are naturally attracted to you and like to talk to you. 
              The type of girlfriend/boyfriend you are looking for:
              
              You like serious, smart and determined people. You don't judge a book by its cover, so good-looking people aren't necessarily your style. This makes you an attractive person in many people's eyes. 
              Your readiness to commit to a relationship:
              
              You prefer to get to know a person very well before deciding whether you will commit to the relationship. 
              The seriousness of your love:
              
              You are very serious about relationships and aren't interested in wasting time with people you don't really like. If you meet the right person, you will fall deeply and beautifully in love. 
              Your views on education
              
              Education is very important in life. You want to study hard and learn as much as you can. 
              The right job for you:
              
              You're a practical person and will choose a secure job with a steady income. Knowing what you like to do is important. Find a regular job doing just that and you'll be set for life. 
              How do you view success:
              
              You are confident that you will be successful in your chosen career and nothing will stop you from trying. 
              What are you most afraid of:
              
              You are afraid of having no one to rely on in times of trouble. You don't ever want to be unable to take care of yourself. Independence is important to you. 
              Who is your true self:
              
              You are full of energy and confidence. You are unpredictable, with moods changing as quickly as an ocean. You might occasionally be calm and still, but never for long.
