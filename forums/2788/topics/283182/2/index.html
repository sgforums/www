If the ger no longer find the guy attractive or found out that the guy isnt what she wanted, what is so wrong about dumping or breaking up? At least, in this case, the ger clearly know what she want and it isnt TS mate. There is no real fix rule or time line as to when to get serious or not in r/s. It is more of understanding each other with each passing days together. If one found out any time in the r/s that he/she wasn't the one u looking for, breaking up is the only right and responsible thing to do. Nothing to do with whether if the other party is a nice guy/gal or not. Love isnt charity and being together isn't about empathy either. Player dun usually commit themselves into r/s.</div>
