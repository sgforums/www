So let start with the country north of us. I am hopping 4 to a car, 2gers and 2 guys, easier to share the accommodation. If not it will be 2 cars.<br><br>As for where, i dun mind further south or even as far as ipoh. I still got a few m8 there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, the only Asian country I will visit again as a short 'getaway' by flight will be Laos, Luang Pabrang area or Vientienne.<br><br>Tropical beaches and resorts are only worthwhile when it's couple hood activity with the promise of spas, suntan and getting laid. So we'll nix that for this forum.<br><br>Apart from that, places such as Malaysia would be nice, but only if it involves sleeper train rides. Not willing to spend so much on it because I've been to Malacca, Penang, KL, JB etc etc when I was a kid. It's rather boring going back to places I've been to before. Ispyyy is going to remind me that it is always the company that matters and everyone can have fun, just depends on whether or not they want to. Yep that's right, but if you're asking me to drive up to Malaysia just to have seafood and drink beer, I'd rather do it at Changi Village. Friend of mine was in Borneo last year and stayed in a jungle, mingle with the tribes. Now that is another story altogether if we get to see some tigers or do some hunting for a change.<br><br>What I was thinking of initially was a longer trip. Between 10 to 15 days. It will be something to look forward to, an adventure. Some where far off from big cities etc. Mt Kilimanjaro is good. But air tickets cost 2K over. So some planning has to be done beforehand. Which is why I am suggesting to do it at year end. But then again for most people, they wouldn't know whether they'll be free at year end. So I guess we'll just leave that idea hanging for now.</div>

So we'll nix that for this forum.<br><br>Apart from that, places such as Malaysia would be nice, but only if it involves sleeper train rides. Not willing to spend so much on it because I've been to Malacca, Penang, KL, JB etc etc when I was a kid. It's rather boring going back to places I've been to before.<br><br>What I was thinking of initially was a longer trip. Between 10 to 15 days. It will be something to look forward to, an adventure. Some where far off from big cities etc. Mt Kilimanjaro is good. But air tickets cost 2K over. So some planning has to be done beforehand. Which is why I am suggesting to do it at year end. But then again for most people, they wouldn't know whether they'll be free at year end. So I guess we'll just leave that idea hanging for now. </div></blockquote>Tropical beach and resort are indeed fun only when there is something worth doing. Or a couple trip.<br><br>I thought when u mention short weekend road trips, it will be to the nearby country, m'si. Anything above that will most likely last more then 4 days. The only thing good abt driving is that u get to visit the more inaccessible places instead of the usual tourist trap. If we are driving, it shouldnt cost much.<br><br>If it is a sleeper train trip u wish, i would suggest waiting till they joinup all the rail line all the way to china. That should b done by year 2010 or 2012. Think i read that in the last asean meeting. Then u would truly have sleeper train trip worth taking.<br><br>As for the out of city trip u hopping for, well that will require some planning and saving up. But dun go dismissing it yet. I bet there is lot of ppl interested in doing thing slightly out of the norm and more adventurous. Yeah year end seem a better timing as most 9-5 job holder would be able to clear their leave to do a long break. Some fresh air in the jungle might be welcome for change.<br><br>Let just do something near 1st and get ourself a gang gear toward travelling. Unless u wish to signup with some group tour.</div>

Trust me... the rest u gotten out is worth the money. Try thinking in the line of hot water in a freezing weather, and bug free bed. Dun forget, if u are tired out from a restless sleep, u dun really enjoy the trip. Plus, the long hrs driving leh!</div>

But in reality, nope!!! Brisbane is just another important node where it links u to many places of interest (Like gold coast, great barrier reef n blah blah)<br><br>For example :<br><br>Singapore travel to Gold coast (air only) - $1300 (including air tax)<br>Singapore travel to Gold coast (thru Brisbane + train) - $700 (including air tax + 1hr plus of train journey)<br>It is just about budget and planning. Not necessary u stay in back packer's inn or rent a car is going to being cheap ... Sometimes, the land packages offered in Australia itself is the cheapest and the most reliable... I can stay in a 4 star hotel but still pay backpacker inn's stay... I can fly from Melbourne to Sydney and still be cheaper than driving...<br><br>Of coz, end of the day, it is up to one's interest. Australia is just too big... There is too much for one to do there...<br><br></div>
