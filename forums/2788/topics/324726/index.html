              <p>Dunno how to add images to this post, else i'd post the photos of this chap Keavepoh77 (mobile number 97505*25, msn keavepoh@*****.com.sg)... got to know him from one of those online networking thingies.</p>
              <p>When Keavepoh77 tried to contact me, i checked out his profile and told him i'm not his type. He tried to be 'friends' for the initial period, and despite i being abit hostile to him, he seemed patient and sincere to be 'just friends'. We finally met once with his another friend for ktv, and that session made me even more disturbed about him and decided to stop contacting him altogether. This is what happened... :</p>
              <p>KP77 was supposedly nearby but i suspected for his own convenience and cost savings, he chose to meet me at a specific location instead of picking me up (its on the way!). We finally met and he claimed he wanna buy some stuffs but walked ard buying nothing. Next is dinner, and i suspect he was trying to hit on a cheap meal. Well, not that i am hungry for an expensive meal, but i do have certain expectations of 'first dates'. We went to a jap restaurant in bugis (please, its not even one of those authentic jap restaurants that will burn a hole in anyone's wallet), and eventually i even offered to pay him my share. To which he happily accepted and didn't give me back my change. Minus points. During this dinner, he seemed to be busy on the sms, turned out he was trying to make sure that friend who's supposed to join us really do join us for ktv. He was not even sure we're going to ktv until he is sure his friend can join us. When the bill of the ktv came, his friend took the bill matter-of-factly. As if he always settle the bills. And KP77 happily said 'thank you' without his friend offering to pick up the tab and suggested that i allow his friend to treat me too. I felt disgusted so i insisted on paying my share. Adding 'i wouldn't wanna take advantage of such a nice chap as you', insinuating that KP77 should pay for his share too. He did, reluctantly. Final blow : Turned out this friend drives, so the friend ends up chauffeuring us
              home eventually (note: he made his friend send him home first coz he
              claimed he's tired).</p>
              <p>After that terrible 'first date' which made me even more sure of what my overseas galpals said of singaporean guys as 'cheapskates' and 'no sense of humility and gentility', KP77 persisted to message me on msn. Or he'd give me missed calls (my phone's by my side 24/7 so i'm pretty sure my phone only rang twice and he'd hang up. Then he'll call again to ring twice and hang up. So that i will call back. Phone bill control? Free incoming call?). Or sms to me, telling me there are more friends he'd like me to know. I finally told him off over msn that i do not think much of guys who sponge off their friends. And that he is using this 'gender equality' thing to take advantage in the dating scene. And he gave all of us 'self-employed' ppl a bad name. As if we're ppl who can't stick to a day job so we glamorise ourselves to be 'self-employed', ending up as scrooges who can't make ends meet but still wanna enjoy the dating scene.</p>
              <p>Despite my obvious hostility, he persisted sending me messages via msn and sms.</p>
              <p>I resort to ignoring his messagings. Last night he gave me missed calls again. I finally snapped and call him back to tell him i'm sick of his games. He promptly sent me an sms 'f*ck u' (spelt out in full) after that. I replied that i will go to the police if he persists. He replie 'sounds gd :&gt;' (of all nerves, with a smiley face!!!). So i replied 'stop harassing me!' to which he replied the same thing too, abou 10mins later. I think he is getting worried now so naively thought that by sending that sms, he could turn the tables around.</p>
              <p>Now if i could figure out how to post his photos online i would. In the meantime the single ladies here should take note of this 'self-employed, well-toned' chap of approx 29 or 30 yrs old. He is in fact one of those 'self-employed' who rented a shophouse unit, sub-divided it into i think 10 other smaller units (big enough for only a bunk bed and sitting space, no windows) to rent it out to others (those with windows will be more expensive). My occupation tells me what he is doing is morally not quite right, although legally he claimed he did it the legal way. He doesn't take rejection nicely. And he is a sponger.</p>
