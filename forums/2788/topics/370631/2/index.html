              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I read your life story... Sounds like mine....its so hard to explain anything here in words..</p>
              <p>I can see that you love her, and its a good thing...</p>
              <p>She will come back to you evenif its only YOU who wants it..</p>
              <p>but before that you need to shape up your life.. and ask yourself few things..</p>
              <p>I wil not say "Let go", and "move ON".. because its just not possible and I know it does not happen.. when we love someone, cant just move on...</p>
              <p>Your love is worth mentioning and being proud of what you did.. but you have to get out of past, and live in present and make a future so that you can get your love back and she can come to you.. remember the past becaue it was the best time of all..</p>
              <p>I know one thing, saying "i love you" and "i have changed" will not do any good to your relationship with your girlfriend....</p>
              <p>Now, what you can do.. is to look at your life from your girlfriend's point of view.. I downloaded few good books from internet on couple relationships which I read last few weeks...... Give me your email and I will forward them to you.. It helps..</p>

              Sorry for not replying, was drowning myself with lots of work and sports. It's a great way to relieve myself from unnecessary thoughts. 
              
               I want to thank everyone who even bother to reply. BeYourSelf, Thanks, you're right in the sense you can't just ask me to let go or move on. Not easy :). I guess you've been thru what I'm currently going thru. When you love someone, you just can't move on without him or her. No matter how bad she is (I'm not saying she is bad honestly), no matter how you force yourself, how your friend brain washes you, you end up still thinking about her and stuff. It's really hard. She just appears in my thoughts in everything i do. so.. thank you :)
              
               and moderator maskedangel! I'm not dead yet. It hurting but I'll survive somehow. I still have lots of thing in life. No doubt i still love her very very much. I guess I'll just leave everything to fate. What's meant to be yours will be. 
              
              :)))))) THANK YOU EVERYONE :'( TOUCHEDDDDDD

This world contain countless people(human) and u just walk pass a tiny place in ur country or city, u still got alot place that u dint been through... Loving someone tht din't appreciate u or dint love u much cant be help like tht... Bare in ur mind that (love cant b change bad to good or good to bad)~ Sometime u should relax yourself n hanging out with ur best buddy together~Dont let a RS break or weaken ur heart!! Always think that (love is just a game that can b end it soon or can b endless)... So next time,dont put 100% in ur coming RS... Always put parents 1st then best buddy then only to ur RS... Without RS,there r alot of things that u wan to do,u can spend,u can do even u can share wif ur buddies.. Be single doesn't mean u r lonely... For me,be single also is a freedom to me~~<br>SO Cheer up man!! god knows wat we r doing~~ Wuahaha!! so appreciate the time in your life... Time walk by dam fast until now i also got alot of white hair since im so young~~ XD</p></div>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, welcome to sgf, singlesclub.<br> <br> I'm sorry to read about your agony, and yeah basically, all i can
              tell u is to move on. Based on what i've read, I'd say that you're
              kinda clingy. In all rs, you have to give your S/O some space to
              roam. You cant keep her in a cage all the time. It makes her
              curious about the outside world, making her wanna "explore" more of
              it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think u have been a great bf, but sometimes, great just isnt
              enough. As u've mentioned, its your 1st rs. Take it as a giant
              stepping stone and learn from it. I cant judge if she deserve you
              or not. But i'd you all should have ended in a better note. u do
              not deserve to be embarrassed/toyed like that.<br> <br> In any case, move on.<br> <br> <br> And welcome to single's club</p>

              <p>I know, there are many people on this site who will disagree with me, but the topic is banal and lame in it's nature.</p>
              <p>The best person to consult about the question is psychotherapist. I hope, the topic starter didn't make anything fool yet.</p>
              <p>I'll make a couple of statements that are 100% true about the story, but they may seem outrageous to other people:</p>
              <p>1) IronicLove, you NEVER loved that girl, believe me. That was not love.</p>
              <p>2) What is injured in you is not your heart, but your vanity (I can explain if it's not obvious).</p>
              <p>3) The only way out for you is to grow personally and emoionally, develop your personality. You'll realize what happened to you and MAYBE if you will not push it, your gf will try to get back to you. But you'll see, if you understand the nature of what's happened, you most likely will not accept her back.</p>
              <p>IronicLove, pretty much everybody was in the same situation. I know how hard it is and I see you really have courage to endure it.</p>
              <p>The invaluable advantage from this story is that it gives you a great lesson and brings you one step ahead to successful life with your true life partner (I suppose, you are not quite ready to meet this person yet)</p>

              <p>awww we have a love guru ^^^^^  hhaha. dude no one has the rights to define love be it u or anyoneelse in the forum. this might be one load of bullshit for u. but it might mean a gr8 deal for ironic. from wat i see ur post is jus plain biase point of view. but one thing for sure. yeap jus learn from it man.</p>
              <p>a man grows stronger after each rejection. just have to keep thinking positive. but pls arh dun becos like tht thn despo go find another gf horh. thn wat sergei said would be correct. it wun be love it would be wat i call ' replacement '. been thru rs probs myself. cant help much but erm. jus relax rs means a gr8 deal in one's life but it does not mean everything man.</p>
