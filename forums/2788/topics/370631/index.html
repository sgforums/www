            <div class='col-md body'><p>I've been in love with this girl since i was 14, we got together when we were 15. We've been through a lot. 5 years later, we broke up. 4 days ago, we broke up. I'm really upset and hurt that i dont know what i should do or what i can do. I really hope a more experienced person out here can help by giving me advise on what i should do.<br><br>We started like any rs, as a friend who chatted on the phone. Soon, we were talking about how we like each other. Initially, she would go on and off, contact me for a month, ignore me for a month and it continued for around 8 months. Sure, i was hurt during that time, she just disappear and appear again in my life. Still, i never did stop loving her. 8 months later, she told me it was due to her being afraid that she would fall too much for me. That was how, we finnally got official.<br><br>We dated, went out. I was happy, we were happy. It was my first and her first relationship. I loved her. It was long before soon, i was bombarded with lies. Lots and lots of lies. Still, i never gave up. I held on to her simply because i love her. Irregardless of how much lies she gave, how much time she promise not to lie to me anymore, it continues, still, i continue to have faith it her. It was until 6 months later, we had a very heaty quarrel. She told me, shes starting to fall for another guy. I was hurt. For the first time in my life, i cried for a girl. I cried in front of my mum like a baby because i was so hurt. I told her, that i would respect her choice if that was what she really wanted. 2 days later, she came back into my life, saying that she has chosen me instead of her. I accepted her back into my life, simply because i love her too much. Too much for my own good i guess. Lies didn't stop. She continue lying and meeting the guy in secret. It was until 1 year later i finally decided. It's the end. We broke up.<br><br>It wasn't the end of our relationship. 2 years later, we patched back. During this 2 years, I've never stopped loving her nor hav i ever stop missing and thinking about her. This time, my love for her was even more intense. I thought, we were really fated and meant to be, thats why we got back together after 2 years of breaking up. I gave in 100% to this relationship, to try and make it last. to make our childhood lovestory last.<br><br>After the pached up, i did everything i could to make her feel loved and care.<br>I find her every single day, not just during the "honeymoon period" just because i dont want to make her feel lonely.<br>No matter how tired i am, even when i work til 3 ~ 4am, i would still go over her place, wake up at 6am the next morning just to on heater and cook breakfast for her.<br>I would bring her out often, pay for everything simply because i wanted her to have more money to spend on herself.<br>I stopped clubbing even when im entitled to free entry and drinks because she dont like me hanging out at such places.<br>I drove all the way from 1 end of singapore to another just to fetch her home becuase she says she's tired and dont wish to take the MRT for a hour.<br>i waited for her all night til 4am just because i dont want her to go back home alone after chilling at her friend places, even when i need to wake up early the next morning.<br>I would do everything to make her parents like me, from helping out at a party, to driving her parents around when they needed to buy stuff, to doing every single thing and paying to every single detail.<br>i would buy anything she wanted and liked. Not that its anything extremely expensive. but i still saved really long for those.<br>I bought her oversea, around to play, to have fun, to make her feel loved.<br>All these are just some of it. Ive done so much for her. Ive done everything i could because there was only a focus. She was my focus. i did everything to make us last, til marriage, til we have our kids, til we both grow old, til we both die.<br><br>After we patched back, it wasn't the end to her lies. Yap she was good. a really good girlfriend. I'm not saying she's not and im not pushing all the blame to her. I enjoyed how she would offer to massage me. how she would let me sleep on her lap and pat me to sleep when im not feeling well. buy food for me when im hungry. <br>but there was stuff that i didnt like about her.<br>I dont like the fact that no matter what i did for what, all that she ever blogged about me was when i blamed her for lying to me, when i lost my cool because i was so angry that she lied to me. It was because of this, none of her friends liked me, but i didnt mind. I continued to do what i can for her, simply because i love her. I dont like the fact that whenever we quarreled, she would find guys to talk to and so on, so much so that whenever after a quarrel, i would see messages of her with other guy flirting and saying stuff like "when u giving me the hug u own me?" <br><br>It was until 4 days ago, our relationship came to the very end. It was so painful. I was so hurtful. I dont know what i should do now because i feel so hurt and lost nothing seems to be able to cheer me up. I still love her. I still miss her. I still needed her love but it was something that i can never get it anymore. She fell for another guy once again. This time, she chose to left with that guy. She chose to end our love that has been going on for 6 years, with a guy she barely knew. When i went to beg her to come back to me. All i got from her was this cruel sentence " i go and discuss with my bf if i should return to you". I had became nothing but a joke between her and her new bf. <br><br>Im hurt. Terribly hurt. I need help and im serious about it. I just hope someone might have some answer for me. <br><br>P.S. sorry if i posted this on the wrong section. i dont know what else i could do beside asking for help everywhere. Thanks.</p></div>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, welcome to sgf, singlesclub.<br><br>I'm sorry to read about your agony, and yeah basically, all i can tell u is to move on. Based on what i've read, I'd say that you're kinda clingy. In all rs, you have to give your S/O some space to roam. You cant keep her in a cage all the time. It makes her curious about the outside world, making her wanna "explore" more of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think u have been a great bf, but sometimes, great just isnt enough. As u've mentioned, its your 1st rs. Take it as a giant stepping stone and learn from it. I cant judge if she deserve you or not. But i'd you all should have ended in a better note. u do not deserve to be embarrassed/toyed like that. <br><br>In any case, move on.<br><br><br>And welcome to single's club</p>

              <p>The problem is right there in your long post. Its all the things you did.</p>
              <p>You over did it. Too much over did it. Exceedingly over did it.</p>
              <p>She goes to the other guy because he leaves her hungry, for love, for attention. She yearns for more from him. He don't give her enough, so she wants more.</p>
              <p>She is looking for someone, and that someone she do not see in you, because you are too busy pandering to her that you neglected yourself. </p>
              <p>There is some truth in that girls fall for <em>pai kias.</em> Thats because they make the girls hope.</p>
              <p>I learn something from my pet cats. If I want to pat and hold them, they will run away. If I ignore them, they come to me. Sometimes girls are like that.</p>
              <p>Thats what relationships is all about, you must balance giving and taking.</p>

              <p>You have come so far and i am sure you really loved her very much or i say too very much.  She keep telling lies but is it all about she meeting someone else?  If it so then forget it.  She may not be ONE for you.  Of cause love is not about getting back how much you had given, and with your age you understands.  For me i also understands that's why i refrain from giving out in case i get hurt.  Yet i still get hurt.  Move on, there are someone right there waiting for you.  You are blessed!  Pain will ease with time.  See you have so many replys from the angels, you are not alone.  Led out your hands, there are angels to guide you along, when the day your girl comes, you give her your heart  : )</p>
