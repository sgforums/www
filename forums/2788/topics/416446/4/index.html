              <div id="articlePage0" class="bodyText" style="width: 100%; display: inline; visibility: visible; font-size: 0.75em;">SINGAPORE - One-third of those married for 20 years or more said that if they could marry someone else, they would, according to a survey.<br><br>But the institution of marriage in Singapore is still standing strong, the survey of 1,100 soon-to-wed and married couples discovered.<br><br>Conducted by national marriage resource centre Marriage Central, the survey showed that 98 per cent of married respondents were satisfied with their marriage.<br><br>Ms Anita Fam, Marriage Central's chairman, was very encouraged by the statistics, especially the ones which indicated that 95 per cent of married couples were looking at marriage as a lifelong commitment.<br><br>She believes that the numbers bode very well for the attitudes towards marriage in Singapore.<br><br>But the survey also found that one in three couples married for 20 years and more said they would have married someone else, if given a second chance.<br><br>The centre said this was not necessarily bad news.<br><br>Said Ms Fam: "I think the significant thing is that those people who were surveyed are still married to those spouses. And that to me underscores what marriage is all about, that you keep working at it.<br><br>"You might find someone who's physically more attractive along the way but it doesn't mean that you dump your spouse for that person. That's marriage."<br><br>The statistics showed that couples were indeed prepared to work hard at strengthening their marriages, with 82 per cent of the respondents saying they would try to resolve a conflict within the same day when an argument with the spouse arose.<br><br>Figures provided by the Department of Statistics support Marriage Central's findings. <br><br>Divorce rates in Singapore have been stabilising over the past five years, averaging 7.5 divorces per 1,000 married Singaporeans.<br><br>The centre also announced a change to its advisory board to include counsellors, lawyers and researchers.<br><br>Said Ms Fam: "The practitioners we have involved are really hands-on in the areas. So that's why we have counsellors, we have lawyers who are in the area of family practice, we have academics because we need them as well. So, we have a full spread."<br><br>Plans to further promote stable marriages will be formalised later this year.<br><br></div>

              <p>Married couple sure got quarrel along the way.</p>
              <p>Whether both can meets the eye is another thing.</p>
              <p>Whether both can sit and talk and solve the problem is another thing too.</p>
              <p>Whether both can open up and talk freely is another thing too.</p>
              <p>If hubby or wife bring up one matter, and out of sudden, hubby or wife get agigated without even discussion,then can kiss goodbye to the married.</p>
              <p>If both started to quarrel the moment one sensitive topic like $$$$$, the married is unstable.</p>

              If u look like rooney, twice the age of rooney, and have no money, den forget about getting married at all.
              
              Jokes aside, finding a 'right' partner isn't that hard. Whether u're satisfied with it or not is another thing. 
              
              from my exp, I had an awesome future wife, bright future, no bad habits n stuff, only that she's quiet most of the time. 
              
              Then I meet this fucking slut, boobs so big its doesn't fit her top, wild personality, eyes set to kill. I jump ship stupidly, n regretted that decision ever since.
              
              she expect me to be there for her 24/7, no clubbing / drinking, fake sickness so I would leave my friends and keep her company. So much more than that. 
              
              See, the problem lies with me. I could have a awesome shit coming to me in the future, all secured, but I dumped it all away. 
              
              So the prob could lie in u as well. Maybe u ask too much in a rs, u can't have best of both world. 
              
              And I dumped that bitch, though it left me being single, and I do feel so ever fuking lonely, it was a tough lesson learnt.
