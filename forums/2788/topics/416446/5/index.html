              <p>I'm saving too little for my retirement, so don't think I want to spend more money. My CPF was robbed suddenly by PAPist so ...... Think Sunkapore will  be very unstable in the long run, especially if the PAPist win majority, there will be different kind of MPs and ministers soon, some from Phillipines, some from China and stuff like that, with different views on things, hardly will there be any more ministers will help anyone except themselves, will be a very messy country.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br><br>For me, I must have enough backup to last for myself, before seeking a wife. I'm quite a bit of old so don't think I will be able to hang around the workforce for long, a few years down the road, maybe eating grass soon, the kind of jobs that I will be taking up down the road will be quite menial and pay will be low.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br><br>Girls normally would not want to get married when they grow older so my choices get less with time. Getting a bride from Viet and stuff like that is going to be a financial burden, not all can work in Sunkapore, the language and stuff like that also problem, getting PR also problem, have to fly here and there sometimes just to see her, then if she at her country long, don't know what she's up to.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br><br>I'm still opeing to finding one, but she must be willingly to ride out the tough days with me til the days I die or else if divorce, I will have to jump airplane. I think slowly, I will put that thought away for good, I can't be applying for a HDB at 45 and expect to pay 30 years for it, even if I'm willingly, HDB will be scared of me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br><br>All in all, 70% of my thoughts are that having money by my side is better than having a wife.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Mmm, maybe can find a rich fat girl to get married to, that would be best, provided I don't get crushed to death first.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>I'm saving too little for my retirement, so don't think I want
              to spend more money. My CPF was robbed suddenly by PAPist so ......
              Think Sunkapore will  be very unstable in the long run,
              especially if the PAPist win majority, there will be different kind
              of MPs and ministers soon, some from Phillipines, some from China
              and stuff like that, with different views on things, hardly will
              there be any more ministers will help anyone except themselves,
              will be a very messy country.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br> <br> For me, I must have enough backup to last for myself, before
              seeking a wife. I'm quite a bit of old so don't think I will be
              able to hang around the workforce for long, a few years down the
              road, maybe eating grass soon, the kind of jobs that I will be
              taking up down the road will be quite menial and pay will be
              low.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br> <br> Girls normally would not want to get married when they grow older
              so my choices get less with time. Getting a bride from Viet and
              stuff like that is going to be a financial burden, not all can work
              in Sunkapore, the language and stuff like that also problem,
              getting PR also problem, have to fly here and there sometimes just
              to see her, then if she at her country long, don't know what she's
              up to.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br> <br> I'm still opeing to finding one, but she must be willingly to ride
              out the tough days with me til the days I die or else if divorce, I
              will have to jump airplane. I think slowly, I will put that thought
              away for good, I can't be applying for a HDB at 45 and expect to
              pay 30 years for it, even if I'm willingly, HDB will be scared of
              me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"><br> <br> All in all, 70% of my thoughts are that having money by my side is
              better than having a wife.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Mmm, maybe can find a rich fat girl to get married to, that
              would be best, provided I don't get crushed to death
              first.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>For most newly wed couples,  both are working. The wife will also pay for the house. Otherwise its too expensive for the husband to pay it all by himself. So getting married may also be a good thing. The wife must share this responsibility for the marriage to be successful.</p>
