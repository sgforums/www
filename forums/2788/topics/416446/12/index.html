              <p>I dun really think that "Parn" you should classify men who are capable as bad or good....it is just how the different individuals want to lead their life....And let's face it once a man has everything, there's virtually no way he will want to settle down with the so call capable woman.</p>
              <p>The last thing any men with the right mind would want to do is choose a girl who is over capable...why would a man who has everything want to submit to awoman. I am sure he would rather choose a bimbo who would submit to all his whims and needs.</p>
              <p>I also do not think that it is woman who make the relationship possible for men...this only apply to men who are less capable then the women themselves....when a woman eye is only onto capable men. The moment she met such a man, there is an extremely high chance that she will throw herself at the man himself. Man who are extremely capable earning tons of money will have women queuing up to throw themselves at their feet.</p>
              <p>So really there is no such thing as either gender having the upper hand in the relationship...</p>
              <p>Last but not least, in a marriage a man stands to lose a lot of things if it dun works out. Wheras for a woman they will always have the upper hand in the event of a divorce(With Woman Charter Protecting Them)....any man who is capable enough to be earning tons of money would definitely be smart enough to think twice before marriage....</p>
              <p>That is the reason why a lot of men who are earning tons of $$$ only get married when they are into their 40s or 50s and the need for future generation arise. And usually their wife would be a young nymph....Since in exchange for the girl's youth and body...she get to use his money...Marriage nowadays is no longer about love...but more like a trading relationship....&gt;&lt;"</p>

              <p>I dun really think that "Parn" you should classify men who are capable as bad or good....it is just how the different individuals want to lead their life....And let's face it once a man has everything, there's virtually no way he will want to settle down with the so call capable woman.</p>
              <p>The last thing any men with the right mind would want to do is choose a girl who is over capable...why would a man who has everything want to submit to awoman. I am sure he would rather choose a bimbo who would submit to all his whims and needs.</p>
              <p>I also do not think that it is woman who make the relationship possible for men...this only apply to men who are less capable then the women themselves....when a woman eye is only onto capable men. The moment she met such a man, there is an extremely high chance that she will throw herself at the man himself. Man who are extremely capable earning tons of money will have women queuing up to throw themselves at their feet.</p>
              <p>So really there is no such thing as either gender having the upper hand in the relationship...</p>
              <p>Last but not least, in a marriage a man stands to lose a lot of things if it dun works out. Wheras for a woman they will always have the upper hand in the event of a divorce(With Woman Charter Protecting Them)....any man who is capable enough to be earning tons of money would definitely be smart enough to think twice before marriage....</p>
              <p>That is the reason why a lot of men who are earning tons of $$$ only get married when they are into their 40s or 50s and the need for future generation arise. And usually their wife would be a young nymph....Since in exchange for the girl's youth and body...she get to use his money...Marriage nowadays is no longer about love...but more like a trading relationship....&gt;&lt;"</p>
