              <p>And so spawn their out of control children whom none of them are capable of providing efficient upbringing and the lineage of humans will thus end in the worst way impossible to imagine by mankind.</p>

              <p>depends. if you marry the right right that suits you, then its happiness all round. but if you are to marry a partner, who nags and shout at you at the slightest of things, then good luck to you. you will get a earful at home. then you think to yourself, how I wish I remained single.</p>

              <p>most important to know,</p>
              <p>1) is she materialistic</p>

              <p>If the answer is yes, then you must be able to smile and grovel before her 3 demands, but also to her 300 demands.</p>
              <p>Sparta men would be able to do it for their women, Singaporean men are falling very far behind nowadays.</p>
