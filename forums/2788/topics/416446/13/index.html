              <p>i couldn't agree more with the lack of a more balanced system of gender equality...</p>
              <p>but there is still a little ray of hope for men ......to stand united...u have to look at what the butterfly effects some of the gender policies have caused....that has to be rectified to sustain what you consider equal opportunities and i add legal protection for all....not just one side of the gender</p>

              <p>I am currently 27 years old. Never have any local gf before. The one and only gf i had before was when i was working as a part-time waiterm and she is a PRC student studying in NAFA. Shortly after, i entered the army and forget about the whole rs. May be a blessing in disguise when i see how scheming PRC girls are nowadays in media, news report.</p>
              <p>I hold a great job in the oil/energy industry, taking home around SGD4000 every month. Can easily buy a medium-range car anytime despite the COE spiking up. But choosen to invest whatever i have in equities, currencies etc to grow my wealth.</p>
              <p>I am not good looking but have chased local girls before back in polytechnic days. But my introvert character make it difficult for me to reach out and find a gf. Of course, being rejected a few times. Shitty feeling for sure. What qualify them to disqualify me? I asked them whether is it the way i look. All friends reassure me i am normal looking, not ugly, not handsome. Not fat, not thin. Plain guy next door.</p>
              <p>Right now, i am too sick and tired to go after girls. I just focus on making more money and let them come to me. When they come to me, i will introduce them to the F&amp;D industry. Its payback time. If i were to get any gf, i will make fuking sure she never has a bf before. Money is the devil and i shall work on it.</p>

              <p>Hey yo Itedino,</p>
              <p>Same sentiment. Don't need intro. I am already into the field of playing/cheonging. Sometime, i played till i 'lost' interest in sex. LOLz.</p>
              <p>But seriously, i think it is better for guys in similar situation as me to visit geylang. Having great sexual tension building up over the years is unhealthy. Learn to release. Think of it this way. You go for those legal prostitute, it is standard 50/hour/shot. If you go dating with local girls, its definitly excess sgd50.00</p>
              <p>For just 50 dollars, its will ease your sexual curiousity about female, ease that drying urge to get a gf, allow yourselves to think properly and not easily tio taken advantage by beautiful women in workplace etc Sometime when your colleague are those beautiful type, your sexual urge took over and you begin not able to think probably and eventually lost your career, job, money eventually.</p>

              <p>Men should not care about what women like Parn thinks. If we, men were to care that would put women like Parn in the driving seat and thus giving them the power that they do not deserve. Think to yourselves what they can give you that you cannot get anywhere else and for less complications too.</p>
              <p>Furthermore the women who thinks that they are superior to men are growing old each day whereas the men if we work hard the right way are getting richer each day. Even if she is very attractive, believe me, a more attractive woman is just round the corner. </p>
              <p>In this way you would understand, we men just need to properly concentrate on our careers and with a bit of luck we can have power to do most of the things we desire.</p>
