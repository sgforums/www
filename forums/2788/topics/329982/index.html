              <p>"equality means you have equal responsibility to get married and

              <p>Getting married and having children are individual &amp; couple
              choices and it also depends on many other complex factors
              (biological, social, psychology, economic, happiness etc). It
              cannot be stated as 'RESPONSIBILITY'. We are humans and not
              MACHINES. From the begin of this world, who stated that it is
              Human's Responsibility to married &amp; pro-create?</p>
              <p>Where equality is concerned, citizens should be given equal
              benefits at certain stage of their life (by choice or not of them
              on whether they wanted to get married or have children), agree?</p>

              <p>thats wat u think but not wat the govt has in mind..we are nth more then money making MACHINES..</p>
              <p>jus to have fun,frm the beginning,as according to bible,God made it clear that man's purpose is to procreate..</p>
              <p>and equality u said at certain stages of their life should have equal benefits..if we say the certain stage of a person life to be able to buy hdb is getting married, den the other person stage of live to get the same benefit of buying a hdb is after 35 lor..same equal benefit at certain stages of their lives..</p>
