            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DID I MARRY THE RIGHT PERSON?<br></span></strong><br>During one of our seminars, a woman asked a common question. She said, <br>"How do I know if I married the right person?"<br><br>I noticed that there was a large man sitting next to her so I said, "It <br>depends. Is that your husband?" In all seriousness, she answered "How <br>do you know?"<br><br>Let me answer this question because the chances are good that it's <br>weighing on your mind. Here's the answer.<br><br>EVERY relationship has a cycle. In the beginning, you fell in love with <br>your spouse. You anticipated their call, wanted their touch, and liked <br>their idiosyncrasies. Falling in love with your spouse wasn't hard. In <br>fact, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You <br>didn't have to do anything. That's why it's called "falling" in love...<br>Because it's happening TO YOU. People in love sometimes say, "I was <br>swept of my feet." Think about the Imagery of that expression. It <br>implies that you were just standing there doing nothing, and then <br>something came along and happened TO YOU.<br><br>Falling in love is easy. It's a passive and spontaneous experience. But <br>after a few years of marriage, the euphoria of love fades. It's the <br>natural cycle of EVERY relationship. Slowly but surely, phone calls <br>become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not always welcome <br>(when it happens), and your spouse's idiosyncrasies, instead of being <br>cute, drive you nuts. The symptoms of this stage vary with every <br>relationship, but if you think about your marriage, you will notice a <br>dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and <br>a much duller or even angry subsequent stage. At this point, you and/or <br>your spouse might start asking, "Did I marry the right person?" And as <br>you and your spouse reflect on the euphoria of the love you once had, <br>you may begin to desire that experience with someone else. This is when <br>marriages breakdown.<br><br>People blame their spouse for their unhappiness and look outside their <br>marriage for fulfillment. Extramarital fulfillment comes in all shapes <br>and sizes. Infidelity is the most obvious. But sometimes people turn to <br>work, church, a hobby, a friendship, excessive TV, or abusive <br>substances. But the answer to this dilemma does NOT lie outside your <br>marriage. It lies within it. I'm not saying that you couldn't fall in <br>love with someone else. You could. And TEMPORARILY you'd feel better.<br>But you'd be in the same situation a few years later. Because (listen <br>carefully to this):<br><br><br><br>THE KEY TO SUCCEEDING IN MARRIAGE IS NOT FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON; IT'S <br>LEARNING TO LOVE THE PERSON YOU FOUND.<br><br>SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience. It'll NEVER <br>just happen to you. You can't "find" LASTING love. You have to "make"<br>it, day in and day out. That's why we have the expression "the labor of <br>love." Because it takes time, effort, and energy. And most <br>importantly, it Takes WISDOM. You have to know WHAT TO DO to make your <br>marriage work.<br><br>Make no mistake about it. Love is NOT a mystery. There are specific <br>things you can do (with or without your spouse) to succeed with your <br>marriage.<br><br>Just as there are physical laws of the universe (such as gravity), <br>there are also laws for relationships. Just as the right diet and <br>exercise program makes you physically stronger, certain habits in your <br>relationship WILL make your marriage stronger. It's a direct cause and <br>effect. If you know and apply the laws, the results are predictable...<br>You can "make" love.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Love in marriage is indeed a "decision"... Not just a feeling.</strong></span></p></div>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DID I MARRY THE RIGHT PERSON?<br></span></strong><br>During one of our seminars, a woman asked a common question. She said,<br>"How do I know if I married the right person?"<br><br>I noticed that there was a large man sitting next to her so I said, "It<br>depends. Is that your husband?" In all seriousness, she answered "How<br>do you know?"<br><br>Let me answer this question because the chances are good that it's<br>weighing on your mind. Here's the answer.<br><br>EVERY relationship has a cycle. In the beginning, you fell in love with<br>your spouse. You anticipated their call, wanted their touch, and liked<br>their idiosyncrasies. Falling in love with your spouse wasn't hard. In<br>fact, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You<br>didn't have to do anything. That's why it's called "falling" in love...<br>Because it's happening TO YOU. People in love sometimes say, "I was<br>swept of my feet." Think about the Imagery of that expression. It<br>implies that you were just standing there doing nothing, and then<br>something came along and happened TO YOU.<br><br>Falling in love is easy. It's a passive and spontaneous experience. But<br>after a few years of marriage, the euphoria of love fades. It's the<br>natural cycle of EVERY relationship. Slowly but surely, phone calls<br>become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not always welcome<br>(when it happens), and your spouse's idiosyncrasies, instead of being<br>cute, drive you nuts. The symptoms of this stage vary with every<br>relationship, but if you think about your marriage, you will notice a<br>dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and<br>a much duller or even angry subsequent stage. At this point, you and/or<br>your spouse might start asking, "Did I marry the right person?" And as<br>you and your spouse reflect on the euphoria of the love you once had,<br>you may begin to desire that experience with someone else. This is when<br>marriages breakdown.<br><br>People blame their spouse for their unhappiness and look outside their<br>marriage for fulfillment. Extramarital fulfillment comes in all shapes<br>and sizes. Infidelity is the most obvious. But sometimes people turn to<br>work, church, a hobby, a friendship, excessive TV, or abusive<br>substances. But the answer to this dilemma does NOT lie outside your<br>marriage. It lies within it. I'm not saying that you couldn't fall in<br>love with someone else. You could. And TEMPORARILY you'd feel better.<br>But you'd be in the same situation a few years later. Because (listen<br>carefully to this):<br><br><br><br>THE KEY TO SUCCEEDING IN MARRIAGE IS NOT FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON; IT'S<br>LEARNING TO LOVE THE PERSON YOU FOUND.<br><br>SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience. It'll NEVER<br>just happen to you. You can't "find" LASTING love. You have to "make"<br>it, day in and day out. That's why we have the expression "the labor of<br>love." Because it takes time, effort, and energy. And most<br>importantly, it Takes WISDOM. You have to know WHAT TO DO to make your<br>marriage work.<br><br>Make no mistake about it. Love is NOT a mystery. There are specific<br>things you can do (with or without your spouse) to succeed with your<br>marriage.<br><br>Just as there are physical laws of the universe (such as gravity),<br>there are also laws for relationships. Just as the right diet and<br>exercise program makes you physically stronger, certain habits in your<br>relationship WILL make your marriage stronger. It's a direct cause and<br>effect. If you know and apply the laws, the results are predictable...<br>You can "make" love.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Love in marriage is indeed a "decision"... Not just a feeling.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Very good article from u, I cldnt agree more. </p>
              <p>But still, it takes BOTH parties to understand that theory to make it work.  Sad to say, not many couples realise that simultaneously.</p>
