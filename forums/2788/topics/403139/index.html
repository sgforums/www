              <p>NEVER invest your heart, time, money or energy with a woman who is not 
              interested in you. Although this might seem like common sense, in 
              reality we always see the exact opposite scenario. Love is a two way 
              street. A one sided affair will only be just that, one sided. <br> <br> Men have been brainwashed by mainstream media into thinking that he 
              should have perseverance/determination when pursuing a woman he is 
              interested in. We see it all the time in cinemas and on TV. The usual 
              story goes like this. A guy goes after a lady he is interested in. After
               being rejected for the first time, he refuses to give up. He thinks of 
              ways and means to win her heart. He starts to do various nice things for
               her in a bid to win her over. And after a while, the lady finally falls
               for him due to all his efforts. This is classic brainwashing because 
              this is not how it works in reality. And every time men watch these 
              scenarios in movies and drama serials, we begin to think that this is 
              how it’s supposed to be. It can’t be further from the truth. This 
              bullshit out there is seriously ruining our chances with women and is 
              counter-productive. If the lady is interested in the guy, she will 
              display certain signs. If she is not, then she is not. No matter what 
              you do, she will never be interested in you. Period.<br> <br> Men need to learn to read signs of interest. When you see the red man on
               the traffic light, you do not cross the road. When you see the green 
              man, you cross. Men are crossing even when the red man is on. It’s 
              suicide, my fellow brothers. Here are some green signs you can rely on 
              to gauge her interest in you. <br> <br> Before you approach her, you notice that she is repeatedly looking at 
              your direction and checking you out. Some girls who are shy or nervous 
              might resort to stealing glances instead. When you approach her to 
              initiate small talk, her eyes seem extra bright and she’s all smiles. 
              Some of them will try very hard to contain their high interest in you 
              but it will show through their nervousness. When talking to her, the 
              conversation is flowing freely. Her responses are NOT short or one word 
              answers or utter silence. After 5-8 minutes of small talk, you ask her 
              for her number. She gives it to you WITHOUT hesitation. She doesn’t come
               up with some stupid excuse like “Why don’t you give me your number 
              instead”, “I don’t have a phone”, “I don’t even know you well”, “We’ve 
              only spoken for 5 minutes”. The list goes on, but I think you guys get 
              the drift here. As long she does not give you her number, she has 
              absolutely no interest in you. It’s time to move on to the next girl! On
               very rare occasions there might be exceptions, but she will still offer
               some other contact alternative such as email address with enthusiasm 
              and without you asking for it.<br> <br> When you ask her out for a specific date, such as Tuesday 8pm Marina 
              Square Starbucks, she agrees or counters with another specific date and 
              time if she cannot make it on your proposed date. If she does not 
              counter with another specific date and time, it’s a sign of lack of 
              interest in you. It’s time to delete her number and hustle other girls. 
              If she agrees and subsequently breaks the date on the actual day few 
              hours before with some stupid excuse like her sister is giving birth and
               she needs to be at the hospital, it means lack of interest. It’s time 
              to delete her number and hustle other girls. The exception is when she 
              breaks the date DAYS IN ADVANCE and counter offers another specific date
               and time to make up for it. <br> <br> When you finally meet her on the actual date, her eyes are still bright 
              and she’s still all smiles. Conversation is still flowing freely. She 
              will tend to ask you a lot questions that are too personal for a friend.
               Do note that she should not be asking you questions in an interrogative
               manner. You will know because it will feel like you are being grilled 
              by the police at Criminal Investigation Department. She laughs at your 
              corny jokes. She does NOT offer to pay for her own share of drinks/food.
               She will create chances to accidentally touch or bump into you. She 
              mentions the future with you included. Like “I had fun, hope to see you 
              again” or “My favorite band is playing next Saturday, would you like to 
              come with me to watch them perform”.<br> <br> If you are getting none of the green signs and full of red signs, you 
              better get out of there and start hustling other women. NEVER invest 
              your heart, time, money or energy with a woman who is not interested in 
              you.</p>

              <p>Men are not shallow, men are just more visual than women. Looking attractive is only the beginning, women need to be more than that of course. I don't need the internet or movie to give me any ideas, just look at how much women spend money on make up and other stuff to make sure they look pretty to attract men.</p>
