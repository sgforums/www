              <p>in order to last, it has to be give and take. but most of the time, people will tend to take each other for granted and the relationship will suffer. the key is for men to only get involved with women who are more giving than taking.</p>

              <p>My ex broke up with me yesterday.</p>
              <p>The amazing thing is she had betrayed my faithfulness in her. I never went out with any girl one on one cos i respect her as my gf and she stated that she doesn't wan me to do it.</p>
              <p>She got into contact with this guy during a period of maybe 2 days which she claimed we broke up yet i did not have any idea of. She said she got quite interested in the guy. Then after the 2 days we patched. After that, she went out with this guy one on one. </p>
              <p>So do you still think that faith in a person can be repaid by faithfulness? i kind of doubt that. It only makes u vulnerable and also taken advantage of.</p>
              <p>What is more surprising is she push all the blame to me saying that i was not there for her everytime she needs me, but she is the one who doesn't wan me to be there or keeps to herself every single shit and no matter wat also won't reveal her inner self. She doesn't wan anyone to know she's attached except close frenz. And she said this is the best thing for me.</p>

              <p>My ex broke up with me yesterday.</p>
              <p>The amazing thing is she had betrayed my faithfulness in her. I
              never went out with any girl one on one cos i respect her as my gf
              and she stated that she doesn't wan me to do it.</p>
              <p>She got into contact with this guy during a period of maybe 2
              days which she claimed we broke up yet i did not have any idea of.
              She said she got quite interested in the guy. Then after the 2 days
              we patched. After that, she went out with this guy one on
              one. </p>
              <p>So do you still think that faith in a person can be repaid by
              faithfulness? i kind of doubt that. It only makes u vulnerable and
              also taken advantage of.</p>
              <p>What is more surprising is she push all the blame to me saying
              that i was not there for her everytime she needs me, but she is the
              one who doesn't wan me to be there or keeps to herself every single
              shit and no matter wat also won't reveal her inner self. She
              doesn't wan anyone to know she's attached except close frenz. And
              she said this is the best thing for me.</p>
              <p>Anyone can tell me what would you have done if you were me?</p>

              <p>She is definitely in the wrong for dating another guy while in a exclusive relationship with you. She cheated on you behind your back. She is untrustworthy.</p>
              <p>When she claimed that during that two days she already broke up with you and you had absolutely no idea, she was lying to justify her sin of cheating. She is a liar.</p>
              <p>She push the blame to you to justify her cheating. No guy should ever date this kind of woman. Even if what she about you not being there for her is the truth, it does not justify her to cheat behind your back. If she wants to date another guy, she should break up with you first.</p>
              <p>She doesn't want anyone to know she is attached except close friends. Nothing wrong with that. Maybe she is not proud of having you as her boyfriend. Or she has some other reasons.</p>
              <p>This woman has no loyalty, no trust, no honesty, no integrity. Any guy who choose not to dump her should shoot himself in the head.</p>

              <p>are you implying not to get married to any woman due to the lop sided legal framework?</p>
              <p>even though the legal framework might be lop sided, there is still hope for men. But he has to be very very extra careful what kind of woman he chooses to be with over the long term. And he has to know exactly how to keep the woman in love with him over the long term. otherwise, the lop sided legal framework will be the final nail in the coffin for his 'demise'.</p>

              <p>every good woman will play her part and put in fair share of effort in a relationship. but to bring out the goodness in a good woman, the man needs to know how. but men do not know how.</p>
              <p>even if the situation seems to be the lack of good women these days, men can protect themselves by not getting involved with such women. but men lack of knowledge of how to distinguish which women are good or bad for them.</p>

              <p>So what you’re trying to imply is that men are shallow, so looking pretty and revealing flesh is all that needs to be done by women? Is that what you have observed on the internet? Or did the latest movie you caught gave you the idea?</p>
              <p>statement is flawed, woman!</p>
              <p>Don go around acting like a guy!.</p>

              <p>Revealing flesh is what shallow men would do if they became ah kuas.</p>
