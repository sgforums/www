            <div class='col-md body'>A small touching story..<br><br>A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his<br>5-year old son waiting for him at the door.<br><br>SON: "Daddy, may I ask you a question?"<br><br>DAD: "Yeah sure, what is it?" replied the man.<br><br>SON: "Daddy, how much do you make an hour?"<br><br>DAD: "That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?"<br>the man said angrily.<br><br>SON: "I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an<br>hour?"<br><br>DAD: "If you must know, I make SGD100 an hour."<br><br>SON: "Oh," the little boy replied, with his head down.<br><br>SON: "Daddy, may I please borrow SGD50?"<br><br>The father was furious, "If the only reason you asked that is so you<br>can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then<br>you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about<br>why you are being so selfish. I work hard everyday for such this<br>childish behavior"<br><br>The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.<br><br>The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little<br>boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some<br>money?<br><br>After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to<br>think: Maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that<br>RM.50 and he really didn't ask for money very often The man went to<br>the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.<br><br>"Are you asleep, son?" He asked.<br><br>"No daddy, I'm awake," replied the boy.<br><br>"I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier" said the<br>man.<br><br>"It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the<br>SGD50 you asked for."<br><br>The little boy sat straight up, smiling. "Oh, thank you daddy!" He<br>yelled.<br><br>Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills.<br>The man saw that the boy already had money, started to get angry<br>again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up<br>at his father.<br><br>"Why do you want more money if you already have some?" the father<br>grumbled.<br><br>"Because I didn't have enough, but now I do," the little boy replied.<br><br>"Daddy, I have SGD100 now. Can I buy an hour of your time?<br><br>Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you."<br><br>The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little son, and he<br>begged for his forgiveness.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Often, we are too engaged in our own busy lives that we might have neglected our love ones.
