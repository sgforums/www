Sales executives or sales assistants working in retail shops have it lousy. They sell with minimum or no commission.<br><br>For property and car salesmen, the moment you meet up with them it's more or less a deal you want to close. You think about the number of loopholes they don't clarify with you, the small prints on that paper they cleverly forget to mention and you think about that 4 or 5 figure commission they're ripping off from the deal, you won't feel sympathy for their acting anymore.
