            <div class='col-md body'><p>When I was younger I really thought dating websites were garbage. I thought that they were for losers. Younger people have more time for dating and mating play. As I got older, I needed a woman on my level when I dated. I needed someone who knew who I was, and how I wanted to grow. I am an executive, and I married an executive/professor I met on an on-line dating website. We were matched, we met at Starbucks and our lives took off from there. Who knew that one night over a caramel machiato that I'd meet the woman of my dreams? What I saw that night in that dimly lit cafe was magic. I knew when she came in, she just might be the one! But there was more on that website for me. I met four high-powered women on-line. I met a food service executive, I met a very successful criminal lawyer, a trauma surgeon and my wife, an educational executive. While I married my choice, the other women weren't bad choices. I had no idea that even though I'd dated in Detroit for 3 years, all of a sudden I was meeting EXACTLY the kind of women I was looking for. Until this time, I'd dated a saleswoman secretly addicted to drugs, had some dating experiences so bad I literally got up and walked out. Suddenly I met a huge pack of WINNERS. So the right dating website can change your life. It changed mine. I'd like to recommend a website similar to the one I used: synthebyte dot com/affredir.cfm?bid=1133&amp;lpid=100941&amp;rid=rp110525<br>I want you to take sometime and at least register to meet someone. I am glad I gave online dating a chance. Today my little girl owes her existence to this blessing. Won't you register and see. Good Luck!<br>Â <br>Christopher Dixon</p></div>
