              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #008254;"><strong>Counselors</strong></span> have an exceptionally strong desire to contribute to the welfare of
                  others, and find great personal fulfillment interacting with people,
                  nurturing their personal development, guiding them to realize their
                  human potential. Although they are happy working at jobs (such as
                  writing) that require solitude and close attention, Counselors do quite
                  well with individuals or groups of people, provided that the personal
                  interactions are not superficial, and that they find some quiet,
                  private time every now and then to recharge their batteries. Counselors
                  are both kind and positive in their handling of others; they are great
                  listeners and seem naturally interested in helping people with their
                  personal problems. Not usually visible leaders, Counselors prefer to
                  work intensely with those close to them, especially on a one-to-one
                  basis, quietly exerting their influence behind the scenes.</p>
              
              <p>Counselors
                  are scarce, little more than one percent of the population, and can be
                  hard to get to know, since they tend not to share their innermost
                  thoughts or their powerful emotional reactions except with their loved
                  ones. They are highly private people, with an unusually rich,
                  complicated inner life. Friends or colleagues who have known them for
                  years may find sides emerging which come as a surprise. Not that
                  Counselors are flighty or scattered; they value their integrity a great
                  deal, but they have mysterious, intricately woven personalities which
                  sometimes puzzle even them.</p>
              <p>Counselors tend to work effectively
                  in organizations. They value staff harmony and make every effort to
                  help an organization run smoothly and pleasantly. They understand and
                  use human systems creatively, and are good at consulting and
                  cooperating with others. As employees or employers, Counselors are
                  concerned with people's feelings and are able to act as a barometer of
                  the feelings within the organization.</p>
              <p>Blessed with vivid
                  imaginations, Counselors are often seen as the most poetical of all the
                  types, and in fact they use a lot of poetic imagery in their everyday
                  language. Their great talent for language-both written and spoken-is
                  usually directed toward communicating with people in a personalized
                  way. Counselors are highly intuitive and can recognize another's
                  emotions or intentions - good or evil - even before that person is
                  aware of them. Counselors themselves can seldom tell how they came to
                  read others' feelings so keenly. This extreme sensitivity to others
                  could very well be the basis of the Counselor's remarkable ability to
                  experience a whole array of psychic phenomena.</p>

              <p><span id="ResultsSpan"><span style="color: #008254;"><strong>Idealist Portrait of the Teacher (ENFJ)</strong></span>
              </span></p><p>Even more than the other Idealists, <span style="color: #008254;"><strong>Teachers</strong></span> have a natural talent for leading students or trainees toward learning,
              or as Idealists like to think of it, they are capable of calling forth
              each learner's potentials. Teachers (around two percent of the
              population) are able - effortlessly, it seems, and almost endlessly-to
              dream up fascinating learning activities for their students to engage
              in. In some Teachers, this ability to fire the imagination can amount
              to a kind of genius which other types find hard to emulate. But perhaps
              their greatest strength lies in their belief in their students.
              Teachers look for the best in their students, and communicate clearly
              that each one has untold potential, and this confidence can inspire
              their students to grow and develop more than they ever thought
              possible.</p>
              <p>In
              whatever field they choose, Teachers consider people their highest
              priority, and they instinctively communicate personal concern and a
              willingness to become involved. Warmly outgoing, and perhaps the most
              expressive of all the types, Teachers are remarkably good with
              language, especially when communicating in speech, face to face. And
              they do not hesitate to speak out and let their feelings be known.
              Bubbling with enthusiasm, Teachers will voice their passions with
              dramatic flourish, and can, with practice, become charismatic public
              speakers. This verbal ability gives Teachers a good deal of influence
              in groups, and they are often asked to take a leadership role.</p>
              <p>Teachers
              like things settled and organized, and will schedule their work hours
              and social engagements well ahead of time-and they are absolutely
              trustworthy in honoring these commitments. Valuing as they do
              interpersonal cooperation and harmonious relations, Teachers are
              extraordinarily tolerant of others, are easy to get along with, and are
              usually popular wherever they are.</p>
              <p>Teachers are highly sensitive
              to others, which is to say their intuition tends to be well developed.
              Certainly their insight into themselves and others is unparalleled.
              Without a doubt, they know what is going on inside themselves, and they
              can read other people with uncanny accuracy. Teachers also identify
              with others quite easily, and will actually find themselves picking up
              the characteristics, emotions, and beliefs of those around them.
              Because they slip almost unconsciously into other people's skin in this
              way, Teachers feel closely connected with those around them, and thus
              show a sincere interest in the joys and problems of their employees,
              colleagues, students, clients, and loved ones.</p>

              <p>Profile: ENTP<br>Revision: 3.0<br>Date of Revision: 26 Feb 2005</p>
              <p>"Clever" is the word that perhaps describes ENTPs best. The professor who juggles half a dozen ideas for research papers and grant proposals in his mind while giving a highly entertaining lecture on an abstruse subject is a classic example of the type. So is the stand-up comedian whose lampoons are not only funny, but incisively accurate.</p>
              <p>ENTPs are usually verbally as well as cerebrally quick, and generally love to argue--both for its own sake, and to show off their often-impressive skills. They tend to have a perverse sense of humor as well, and enjoy playing devil's advocate. They sometimes confuse, even inadvertently hurt, those who don't understand or accept the concept of argument as a sport.</p>
              <p>ENTPs are as innovative and ingenious at problem-solving as they are at verbal gymnastics; on occasion, however, they manage to outsmart themselves. This can take the form of getting found out at "sharp practice"--ENTPs have been known to cut corners without regard to the rules if it's expedient -- or simply in the collapse of an over-ambitious juggling act. Both at work and at home, ENTPs are very fond of "toys"--physical or intellectual, the more sophisticated the better. They tend to tire of these quickly, however, and move on to new ones.</p>
              <p>ENTPs are basically optimists, but in spite of this (perhaps because of it?), they tend to become extremely petulant about small setbacks and inconveniences. (Major setbacks they tend to regard as challenges, and tackle with determin- ation.) ENTPs have little patience with those they consider wrongheaded or unintelligent, and show little restraint in demonstrating this. However, they do tend to be extremely genial, if not charming, when not being harassed by life in general.</p>
              <p>In terms of their relationships with others, ENTPs are capable of bonding very closely and, initially, suddenly, with their loved ones. Some appear to be deceptively offhand with their nearest and dearest; others are so demonstrative that they succeed in shocking co-workers who've only seen their professional side. ENTPs are also good at acquiring friends who are as clever and entertaining as they are. Aside from those two areas, ENTPs tend to be oblivious of the rest of humanity, except as an audience -- good, bad, or potential.</p>
              <h4>Some Famous ENTPs:</h4>
              <p>Alexander the Great<br>Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart<br>Sir Walter Raleigh</p>
              <h4>Fictional:</h4>
              <p>Mercutio, from <em>Romeo and Juliet</em><br>Horace Rumpole, from John Mortimer's <em>Rumpole of the Bailey</em> series<br>Dorothy L. Sayers's detective Lord Peter Wimsey</p>
              <hr>
              <p><a style="font-size: 21px; color: #666677;" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2788/topics/fa.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Functional Analysis</span></a> -- by Joe Butt</p>
              <h4>Extraverted iNtuition</h4>
              <p>ENTPs are nothing if not unique. Brave new associations flow freely from the unconscious into the world of the living. Making, discovering and developing connections between and among two or more of <em>anything</em> is virtually automatic. The <em>product</em> of intuition is merely an icon of <em>process</em>; ENTPs are in the business of change, improvement, experimentation.</p>
              <p>The attraction Extraverted iNtuition has toward the real and physical amounts to a cosmic non sequitur: theory is drawn to practice. Such encounters are clearly puzzling. Both parties--the intuitor and the realist--are aware of a xenic quality in their meeting, with reactions ranging from recoil to reverie.</p>
              <h4>Introverted Thinking</h4>
              <p>Thinking is iNtuition's ready assistant, an embodiment of the sort of logic found in laws, boards and circuits. Thinking's job is to lend focus and direction to iNtuition's critical mass. The temporary habitations of changeling iNtuition are constructed of Boolean materials from Thinking's storehouse. Ultimately, Thinking is no match for iNtuition's prodigiousness. Systems lie in various states of disarray, fragmentary traces of Thinking's feverish attempts to shadow and undergird the leaps of the dominant function. One can only suppose that Thinking must continue to work during REM sleep pulling together iNtuition's brainchildren into integral wholes.</p>
              <h4>Extraverted Feeling</h4>
              <p>To the extent that Feeling is developed, ENTPs extravert Feeling judgment. As a result, it is not uncommon to find affability and bonhomie in members of this species. Tertiary functions are potentially utilitarian. Their limitations appear in their relative underdevelopment, diminished endurance, and vulnerability. ENTPs may harness Feeling's good will in areas such as sales, service, drama, humor and art. ENTP loyalty often runs high and can be hooked by those the ENTP counts as friends.</p>
              <h4>Introverted Sensing</h4>
              <p>Like a tail on the kite of iNtuition, Introverted Sensing counterweighs these beings drawn to nonconformity and anarchy. These shadowy sensory forms, so familiar to SJ types, serve as lodestones which many ENTPs employ Herculean measures to escape. "Question authority! (then do exactly what it tells you)" sums up the dilemma in which ENTPs may find themselves by attempting to best the tarbaby Sensing. Occasionally acknowledging awareness of norms and abnormality could, in theory, be potentially freeing.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I've noticed that ENTPs have the need to have areas of expertise/excellence/uniqueness in which one is second to none. I've never beaten an ENTP at his/her own game--not in the final analysis. (e.g., just tonight, my neighbor who is recuperating from an illness received a call from an ENTP friend offering his special recipe for tea. The instructions required only the finest ingredients, a particular brand of orange juice, tea made with a ball--none of those horrid teabags--..., which will of course make the <strong>best</strong> tea of which he himself drinks 50 gallons each winter!)</p>
              <h4>A Few More Famous ENTPs</h4>

              <span style="color: #0f5fa4;"><strong>Rational Portrait of the Inventor (ENTP)</strong></span>
              <p><span style="color: #0f5fa4;"><strong>Inventors</strong></span> begin building gadgets and mechanisms as young children, and never really stop, though as adults they will turn their inventiveness to many kinds of organizations, social as well as mechanical. There aren't many Inventors, say about two percent of the population, but they have great impact on our everyday lives. With their innovative, entrepreneurial spirit, Inventors are always on the lookout for a better way, always eyeing new projects, new enterprises, new processes. Always aiming to "build a better mousetrap."</p>
              <p>Inventors are keenly pragmatic, and often become expert at devising the most effective means to accomplish their ends. They are the most reluctant of all the types to do things in a particular manner just because that's the way they have been done. As a result, they often bring fresh, new approaches to their work and play. They are intensely curious and continuously probe for possibilities, especially when trying to solve complex problems. Inventors are filled with ideas, but value ideas only when they make possible actions and objects. Thus they see product design not as an end in itself, but as a means to an end, as a way of devising the prototype that works and that can be brought to market. Inventors are confident in their pragmatism, counting on their ability to find effective ways and means when they need them, rather than making a detailed blueprint in advance. A rough idea is all they need to feel ready to proceed into action.</p>
              <p>Inventors often have a lively circle of friends and are interested in their ideas and activities. They are usually easy-going, seldom critical or carping. Inventors can be engaging conversationalists, able to express their own complicated ideas and to follow the ideas of others. When arguing issues, however, they may deliberately employ debate skills to the serious disadvantage of their opponents.</p>
              <p>Inventors are usually non-conformists in the workplace, and can succeed in many areas as long as the job does not involve too much humdrum routine. They make good leaders on pilot projects that test their ingenuity. And they are skilled at engineering human relationships and human systems, quickly grasping the politics of institutions and always wanting to understand the people within the system rather than tell them what to do. No matter what their occupation, however, Inventors display an extraordinary talent for rising to the demands of even the most impossible situations. "It can't be done" is a challenge to an Inventor and elicits a reaction of "I can do it."</p>
