              </span></p><p>All Rationals are good at planning operations, but <span style="color: #0f5fa4;"><strong>Masterminds</strong></span> are head and shoulders above all the rest in contingency planning.
              Complex operations involve many steps or stages, one following another
              in a necessary progression, and Masterminds are naturally able to grasp
              how each one leads to the next, and to prepare alternatives for
              difficulties that are likely to arise any step of the way. Trying to
              anticipate every contingency, Masterminds never set off on their
              current project without a Plan A firmly in mind, but they are always
              prepared to switch to Plan B or C or D if need be.</p>
              Masterminds
              are rare, comprising no more than, say, one percent of the population,
              and they are rarely encountered outside their office, factory, school,
              or laboratory. Although they are highly capable leaders, Masterminds
              are not at all eager to take command, preferring to stay in the
              background until others demonstrate their inability to lead. Once they
              take charge, however, they are thoroughgoing pragmatists. Masterminds
              are certain that efficiency is indispensable in a well-run
              organization, and if they encounter inefficiency-any waste of human and
              material resources-they are quick to realign operations and reassign
              personnel. Masterminds do not feel bound by established rules and
              procedures, and traditional authority does not impress them, nor do
              slogans or catchwords. Only ideas that make sense to them are adopted;
              those that don't, aren't, no matter who thought of them. Remember,
              their aim is always maximum efficiency.
              <p>In their careers, Masterminds
              usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and
              hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their
              own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees.
              Problem-solving is highly stimulating to Masterminds, who love
              responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out.
              Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a
              negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization
              forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past.</p>
              <p>Masterminds tend
              to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals,
              having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to
              them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and
              decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research.
              Masterminds are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all
              available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of
              any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked
              against reality.</p>

              <p>In their careers, Masterminds usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees. Problem-solving is highly stimulating to Masterminds, who love responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out. Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past.</p>
              <p>Masterminds tend to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals, having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research. Masterminds are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked against reality.</p>

              <p><span id="ResultsSpan"><span style="color: #008254;"><strong>Idealist Portrait of the Champion (ENFP)</strong></span>
              </span></p><p>Like the other Idealists, <span style="color: #008254;"><strong>Champions</strong></span> are rather rare, say two or three percent of the population, but even
              more than the others they consider intense emotional experiences as
              being vital to a full life. Champions have a wide range and variety of
              emotions, and a great passion for novelty. They see life as an exciting
              drama, pregnant with possibilities for both good and evil, and they
              want to experience all the meaningful events and fascinating people in
              the world. The most outgoing of the Idealists, Champions often can't
              wait to tell others of their extraordinary experiences. Champions can
              be tireless in talking with others, like fountains that bubble and
              splash, spilling over their own words to get it all out. And usually
              this is not simple storytelling; Champions often speak (or write) in
              the hope of revealing some truth about human experience, or of
              motivating others with their powerful convictions. Their strong drive
              to speak out on issues and events, along with their boundless
              enthusiasm and natural talent with language, makes them the most
              vivacious and inspiring of all the types.</p>
              <p>Fiercely
              individualistic, Champions strive toward a kind of personal
              authenticity, and this intention always to be themselves is usually
              quite attractive to others. At the same time, Champions have
              outstanding intuitive powers and can tell what is going on inside of
              others, reading hidden emotions and giving special significance to
              words or actions. In fact, Champions are constantly scanning the social
              environment, and no intriguing character or silent motive is likely to
              escape their attention. Far more than the other Idealists, Champions
              are keen and probing observers of the people around them, and are
              capable of intense concentration on another individual. Their attention
              is rarely passive or casual. On the contrary, Champions tend to be
              extra sensitive and alert, always ready for emergencies, always on the
              lookout for what's possible.</p>
              <p>Champions are good with people and
              usually have a wide range of personal relationships. They are warm and
              full of energy with their friends. They are likable and at ease with
              colleagues, and handle their employees or students with great skill.
              They are good in public and on the telephone, and are so spontaneous
              and dramatic that others love to be in their company. Champions are
              positive, exuberant people, and often their confidence in the goodness
              of life and of human nature makes good things happen.</p>

              Sinclair are examples of Idealist Champions</p>
