I feel happy with another guy, he tells mi he likes mi, but i dun feel for him... 
              
              i am confuse, shall i continue to wait for my ex to turn back. (which might not happen or takes a long long time)or shall i be with the other guy and try to develop feeling for him? or maybe there are other things that could help mi feel better?
              
              to add on, cuz he is my 1st bf and we hav been tgh for a few years... =( help mi out pls... tell mi wad i sld do... tell mi pros of being single! thanks!

              <p>Well to get over your 1st ex bf, it may take half a year or more. It all depends on you, firstly you gotta stop thinking about him. The more you think about him, the harder it is to get him out of your head. Don't wait for the guy to come back to you, if he really loved you he would have gone back to you by now.</p>
              <p>I would recommend you to remain single and wait until the time is right to find a new one. You shouldn't be finding a new guy to replace the old, you will just simply hurt the new guy you date. When my ex-gf (almost 2 years together) broke up with me august last year, I was heartbroken. It took me about 6 months or so to get over it. A friend of mine was with her bf of 3 years when they suddenly broke up, she has been singapore for about a year and a half now.</p>
              <p>When your alone and you know your about to cry or whatever, just go out by yourself or go find someone you can talk to. Keeping all these internal problems inside won't help, tell a friend or a family member about these issues.</p>

              <p>the key is to keep your body and mind busy.</p>
              <p>take a new sport or hobby. or participate in other healthy activities.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks lot for your advice! i noe i sldn't hurt another person so i didn't do that. is juz a selfish thought at tat time to heal my wound. he is nice, i dun wan to hurt him. =) i noe i shouldn't wait, but i juz feel abit wasted that we spent so long together and now we hav to part... i feel like waiting to give each of us another chance. after knowing how he i senjoying himself with another gal i felt kinda dumb to wait for sth that nv happen(like my friend said) it juz hurts even more that i feel like giving up. shall i still wait? like you said if he loves mi he would hav return but he hasn't, maybe he don't love mi. Is time to give up? btw cuz i was with him for more than 3 yrs that why the pain =( i did talk to a few of my close friends and even mother. Actualli, i feel,i am getting more emotional also cuz of 1 of my besties who juz broke up with bf too...</p>

              <p><br>that's good then, well there are times to let go. Since you guys have been together for more than 3 years, i know its hard to let go and forget about it. Don't drown your sorrows into alcohol or drugs, there won't help. The best thing is try new stuff in life, you can probably talk to your mum about it or whoever you get along well in the family. I normally talk to my mum about my love life issues. I know how it feels when your see your ex lover with someone else, when we broke up August last year, she went to find a guy to sleep with just 3 days after we ended our relationship. When I heard this, I felt so heart broken that I went on a drinking spree, got drunk almost every night.</p>
              <p>Well I think it's time to give up on him, even if you wait he won't come back. If your ex bf does come back to you, it will be either because he got cheated or played by that girl. And if he does, just say no.</p>
              <p>Firstly why wait? Since you know they are plenty of guys out there you can choose, why wait for your ex bf to return? Right now, you should be enjoying life. Make changes to your life, try to find something you haven't done before, make new friends and change your placement of your room. If you do think about your ex bf or miss him, go for a walk outside or play sports or do excercises to keep your mind busy.</p>
              <p>For example, its like you want to <strong>quit smoking</strong> but you can't hard because there is something there that makes you want to smoke probably peer groups. Then take the <strong>quit smoking </strong>process as your ex bf, the more you think about your ex bf the more you want him back. It's just like the more you think about smoking, the more you want to smoke.</p>

Well when you break up with someone, it will be hard to get by even for the first week. But yeah, your still young.. im guessing from 17 to 20?

              <p>Like I've always said. The past is past and should serve no more than a lesson - the past doesn't die just like that, it's something we carry along with us. We only do not fight lost causes.</p>
              <p>Take the time you need to properly mourn for the death of a relationship, it's very natural and we're only humans. But also realize, the time awaits for no man - while you're holding on tightly to the past, you're losing the present.</p>
              <p>We can tell you a hundred reasons, but at the end of the day it's still your fight. I'd encourage you to start going out and work on your social life again. The end of a relationship is not an end of your life.</p>
              <p>Start to look forward to the future, girl. And best of luck.</p>
