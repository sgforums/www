            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><p>The sleepiest day…………… <br><br>It was the sleepiest day for today…………. <br><br>Played Eminem and Snoop Dogg but the same old songs are beginning to be a bore (when you know the lyrics by heart, it’s really time to stop listening) and feels like all rappers have gone soft or kicking beats on their sports car and operated ladies - it’s nothing like the old days (I guess old is gold, it stays the same but eventually staring it day after day diminishes it’s glamour). Watched some funny videos on Youtube but I am watching faster than the rate of uploads of new videos. I stumble on a few goods ones………..oh wait……….I saw that last week. Switched on the tube. You could have 30 channels, but not one is entertaining enough to keep you glued to a single channel. It was more fun switching through them waiting for something entertaining to pop up soon. TV – funny, it’s really like a lady – it can get boring after a while, but you can’t live without one. <br><br>I checked the time to see if it was bed time but it was 8 pm..............too early to sleep but my eyes were droopy already. I guess I can’t blame the TV station for their boring channels – with their market intelligence they would know most are out on a Saturday night..........they would rather keep the best for those days when everyone else was at home. Why isn’t the phone ringing – oh crap, I must have left it on silent – no wonder I didn’t hear any calls. Oh wait............it’s not on silent. <br><br>I thought I take a walk, grab some dinner. Stopped at Dhoby Gaut Station. Wanted to check out the books in Kinokuniya at Takashimaya. I had time to spare – no one is calling me out yet - so why not walk from Dhoby down to keep myself entertained and on the way there, watch the pretty girls walk with their bfs, listen to the bellowing laughs as the boys are out drinking themselves silly, families out for dinner and trying to hold on to their lil ones, and absorb in the lime lights of the night. <br><br>Oh, I hadn’t noticed, Orchard is in preparations for X’mas already. The streets are sparkling. Wonder what I will do on the day? Maybe I will order in Pizza when I get home from the office. <br><br>I strolled through Orchard, passing by the people, slowly getting irritated by the crowds walking as slow as the moving globe, dodging or waiting for the Jap and China tourists to take their photos in Newfoundland, or just standing behind and taking small steps as a group laughs and chats to themselves, oblivious to everyone else behind them. Again I see the pretty girls hand in hand with their bfs. Lucky BAS%&amp;$DS – I would love to kick their A$#. What do these girls see in them that they don’t in me? <br><br>I thought I stop by at a corner to have a cigarette before I continue with my journey. It’s not like I got anywhere else to go or be. I got time..........have a ciggie............it’s only 8:30. <br><br>While I puff and eye the pretty girls in their skimpy clothes walk by..........one of them walks by my side to have a puff as well. I start checking her out, size her up, through the corners of my eye. Hmm..............nice. Goods looks, nice fashion style. She might be single? But wait, hot girls don’t stay single. But she isn't out with anyone else. She is standing alone. Who knows, maybe today is my lucky day. God is finally giving me a break for all the failures I have had with the opposite species. I am glad I went to the temple yesterday. My mum was right. Pray hard, you will get what you prayed for. <br><br>A guy comes by. Not bad looking. They start talking. She butts out the ciggie. They are off. BAS%$&amp;RD!! <br><br>‘GMAT Verbal Review’………….considering studying again. This book is one I need to get soon. Kinokuniya looks busy today. Parents with their kids buying out study guides, serious looking expats over at the Business section, geeky looking dude next to me checking out the LSAT. Well as I continue reading......... WOAH.......distraction...........can’t focus.......hot girl just walked over to the discount counter. As I pretended to read, I looked over the pages at her pretty face. What a beauty. I could stare at her all day long. <br><br>She looked up over the counter and caught me. Stared right at me. I froze. Subconciously I immediately look down. Continued looking into my book, pretending to read, my heart beating like a car on the F! tracks...................why the hell did you look at her................she is going to come over and slap you.............After a while, when I felt it was safe again, I looked up at her. She was talking to the counter lady. Took her bags. Left. I will never see her again.................... <br><br>I am out of the book store. Didn’t buy anything this time. White Tiger was an interesting read but didn’t think I should get it. The work load for the coming month was heavy enough.........I don’t believe I need to look at anymore papers. <br><br>Out of Takashimaya..............Dhoby Gaut MRT............I was home.............10:00...............boiled some noodles...............the TV was still on..........it was 10:30............I was asleep..............I really did feel sleepy................ <br></p></div>
