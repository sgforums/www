              <p>There are many valid reasons why the parents would disapprove. In this day and age, I'd think they are coming from a rational and objective point of view. I am quite certain they are thinking for their child even if the relationship is not their place and not for their business.</p>
              <p>If, I am not financially independent and capable of my own life, say below 21, I'll take a back seat, pull back from romantic involvement with my bf and maintain platonic friendship. If I can't even be responsible enough for my own life, there is no chance in hell I'll be good enough hanging around a guy who has enough problems of his own and a long term illness to boot.</p>
              <p>If I'm confident of holding up in times of need after evaluating all the negatives, then the choice I make is the choice that works. Best to take a principled stand, inform my parents they're going to have to respect this decision if I'm expected to remain a part of their lives. </p>
