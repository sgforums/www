            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand the reason why TS would wish for a verbal confirmation. Guy tend to be logical in thinking. 1+1 must = 2. So hold hand + kiss = U must admit u are my gf.<br><br>At least that is how most younger guy tend to think. They are still rather limited in their exposure to woman and therefore cant see the reason behind. I can foresee a few, the ger could be shy, after all she did make all the 1st move, that dun mean she dun feel shy when confronted for an answer. Other then that, some ger might just like to take the romance route and keep certain "Known" fact unsaid. R/s isnt a contract binding or anything like that (except married) so what is the point of bring everything out in the open.<br><br>Like What soleachip said, u bought the ticket, dun try to understand too much, juz observe, view the scenery and enjoy the ride.<br><br>Sometime, you dun have to understand the reason behind ger's action, just only need to open ur eyes and see it coming and then decide how best to react on it.</div>
