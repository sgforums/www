              <p>Hello to YOU who is reading this =) I am a final year undergrad from NTU studying sociology and my FYP is on <em>singles in singapore</em>. As my fyp prof set requirements for me to be very specific in my line of research, I have chosen to focus specifically on people who CHOOSE not to get married. I am looking for women in particular, who have made the choice not to get married, and are contented with singlehood.These women may be people who choose to co-habitat, are lesbians, remaining single for religious reasons etc...It is really worth finding out how you women have such determination to make such a decision! =)</p>
              <p>Is there anyone who doesnt mind me interviewing them? It can be done via e-mail or face to face..and confidentiality is promised!</p>
              <p><br>Do contact me at tanm0060@e.ntu.edu.sg, or wendy_paws@hotmail.com.</p>
              <p><br>Really hope some of the single women here who fall into any of those categories are willing to help me out and share your stories with me!</p>
              <p>Cheers,</p>

              <p>i can't help you further....but there r many real life cases and views you can read either on news, articles, journals...perhaps...</p>
              <p>most importantly, your conclusion should be balanced...a merger of the interests of both gender (but not skewed specifically towards women just because of women charter and because the law said so or the world's sympathies)....times have changed with great strides in women's equality) as a foundation towards resolving the rising singles and divorces as one of the key solution...</p>
              <p>your generation of women is the only hope to help adjust that traditional view of women charter which is already out of tune and to the social disadvantage of men...or your sons of the future...</p>
              <p>From the above, your FYP would be unique...as compared to other feminist writers</p>

              <p>every action causes a reaction...as u are well aware of that universal law....the cause of women charter has affected men in many ways...and mostly psychological...which causes more reaction for men such as identity issue etc. ...arising with greater conflicts...and this also coincides with greater rise in gays and lesbians (some are biological...some transformed into it)...</p>
              <p>the rise of women charter has changed men's views...for better or worse....looking back to the history, men started to fight it out for women as those times it was real bad for women...(along with my personal sympathy) ....but that was more than 100 years ago...and the first bill of rights for women was born out of UK parliament ...and spread to the rest of the world...the rest is history...</p>
              <p>women charter does have certain social side effects...good at one end for the women....but resulted also adverse psychological conflict for men</p>

              <p><br>law should be flexible not dead..</p>
              <p>like the law says a person has to be given the death sentense if he commit murder..but if he got mental problem etc, the law can be more lenenient to him..</p>
              <p>similarily, the law should should be flexible towards divorce too and not always protect women..</p>
