              <p>Men are always going too heavy too fast too soon. That’s the biggest 
              complaint from women today. In so doing, men come across as desperate 
              and too available, which is a major turn off to women. <br> <br> So at what pace should men go and who dictates that pace? Ever since 
              Adam and Eve, men have always been the aggressor. Men approach women. 
              Women almost never have to or never want to approach men. Why would they
               want to put themselves at the risk of rejection when men are already 
              doing it anyway? If she ever wants a guy, she will choose to flirt 
              instead and get you to do the dirty work of approaching. That’s how it 
              is in most societies, whether we like it or not, that is the reality. So
               by default, women have been given the choice of accepting versus 
              rejecting and also the choice of setting the pace in any pursuit.<br> <br> Since only the woman herself will know when she is comfortable to shift 
              gears, we have to go very slowly with them. Patience is the key. When 
              you are able to be patient with them, they will find you different from 
              the rest of the other guys who are always going too heavy too fast too 
              soon. Patience will set you apart from the competition. Let the rest of 
              the guys rush in, turn the woman off and get dumped. We will not attempt
               to shift gears unless given cues to do so. Women will seldom tell men 
              directly to go faster but they definitely show signs or behave in 
              certain manner to hint to us she is ready to take things to the next 
              level. When we receive those hints, she is indirectly approaching us to 
              take things to the next level. The choice is now ours to make and the 
              tables are now turned. If you have yet to realize by now, love is a 
              power play. In order for the relationship to last, men have to come out 
              stronger in the power struggle because women are subconsciously looking 
              for leaders in their men.<br> <br> So specifically, how should we go about this whole idea of patience and 
              playing it cool in the beginning stages of dating? First and foremost, 
              always wait five to nine days to call after you have got her number and 
              between dates. Most guys predictably call within two days. But you are a
               cut above the rest. Secondly, you will only give her a call between 
              Sunday to Thursday and ask her out for a date between Sunday to 
              Thursday. In other words, never call her on a Friday or Saturday and 
              never ask her for a date on Friday or Saturday. What’s the big deal with
               Fridays and Saturdays? These two days are only reserved for that 
              special someone. She has yet to attain that status yet. You are always 
              busy on Fridays and Saturdays, regardless of whether you are busy. Get 
              the drift? <br> <br> By the 4th to 7th date, she will ask you why you don’t ask her out for 
              Fridays or Saturdays, this is supposed to happen if her interest in you 
              has been increasing since the first date. Her interest should be on the 
              rise if you have not done anything to turn her off since date one. When 
              she asks that question, that is her first indirect approach. Ask her why
               going out on Friday or Saturday is important. Act dumb and make her 
              reveal her feelings for you. If she refuses to, just continue taking her
               out on the other days. Only take her out on a Friday or Saturday when 
              she asks you to.<br> <br> By the 8th to 12th date, she will ask you where the relationship is 
              going. In other words, she is asking you whether you want her to be your
               girlfriend and make the relationship exclusive. When she asks that 
              question, ask her “Are you asking me to be your boyfriend?”</p>
