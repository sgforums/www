            <div class='col-md body'>I used to have a crush on this girl from my church and I carelessly keep mentioning about how I like her in church. I even tried to start a conversation with her but failed terribly as she was kinda like those pretty girl type who usually tends to be stuck up. Few days later I asked her if she could sell me a book she had. She agreed and after I bought it, I said thanks but she gave me an awkward silence and we simply stared at each other awkwardly for a few seconds before she walked off. A few months later I texted her asking her if she had any more good books to recommend but she did not reply me. I felt angry and my crush for her seemed to turn into a slight hatred. From that day I didn't bother her nor contact her and more. During church services I have a habit of looking around during worship as I love looking at people worshipping God. It was until one day I notice someone looking backwards toward my direction and I realized it was that girl. As I was angry with her still, I looked away as I did not want to have anything to do with her. I'm a proud guy and I'm confident that my looks are good enough to get other girls. I felt that I did not need to bow myself down to this girl. Therefore I couldn't care less about her. But ever since that service, she has been sneak peeks at me everytime. I'm starting to wonder is it because I offended her somehow? Or is it because I look weird or something on my nose or whatever? Because today I caught her and her friends this time, taking sneak peeks at me. I'm starting to feel that I look weird. But pls ppl tell me if I did something wrong. Coz I need to know if I have to apologize to her or not. Lost guy here. :(</div>

              <p>She could be confuse about whether to approach you or not.</p>
              <p>Or she could be just keeping a look out for you and staying away from you.</p>
              <p>You can try talking to her again (not sending messages, literally go up and talk to her). It could turn out good, it could turn up bad, we don't know. But make sure you have something to talk about first before even approaching her.</p>

              <p><br>I know u are still young, thus ur reply is like that. Let me tell u a honest thing... She dont own u a living by picking ur call. Understand? She has a life and so do u. So if u are treat this as rejection then fine, leave it. But to have this kind of mindset makes me think that u are a sore loser... sorry to say that. Be a gentleman, laugh at it and move on to next one. You 2 still haven start parktohing or hold hands and you already feel annoyed for not reply u or call u back... next time really become gf / bf i think die lar, must fall in and report at 2359.

              <p>Well, I dun think your point is valid at all. Btw, you are not the only one who has her number... and so what if you are the only one? It's still her phone, she paid for it and not you. So, what make you think she should pick up your call or reply your sms? You did not even pay for such service nor is she providing you with one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm should you have people in your list calling you and you are not picking up. To be frank, I think I have like 500+ contact in my phone but I barely interact with like less than 10% of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you can only call 1900 numbers... they will answer you call... cos they are paid to... maybe try calling service centers.... They are free but they will still bother to entertain you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speedstar and Caleb_chiang.. Thx for ur lovely criticism. But I personally feel that if a person refuses to reply my SMS at all, might as well not give me her number in the first place. U old people may have ur own ideals but I have my fresh ideals too. Sometimes ur old ways of thinking is not practical today for youngsters like us. And I'm sincerely happy that even I'm a stranger to you all, u all take the time to reply this thread which most of u see as childish. I thank u all for ur effort and time to stand such nonsense. I love old people criticisms which have logic and reasoning.</div>
