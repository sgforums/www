              <p>Want to ask the ladies here...</p>
              <p>What do girls really look for in guys...when choosing a life partner?</p>
              <p>Are there different qualities girls look for in bf vs husband? aka some guys are bf standard while some are husband standard</p>
              <p>I know some of the usual answers will be character...financial stability...and so on. If you were to answer along those lines, can you be more specific, like what type of character, personalities etc. Is it true that girls really go for looks and physique?</p>
              <p>I know some don't, because I  do see girls holding hands or married to guys who ain't good looking. Some of those guys are 'horizontally challenged', pot-belly etc and yet some girls can go gaga over the handsome waiter/guy in the mrt/some Korean actor/singer etc....</p>
              <p>So i know that girls don't just go for looks right?!?! So how does the average looking guy get to ask girls out? What are the things that give the first impressions?</p>
              <p>Humor?!?!?! If the guy doesn't have/little humor, i think it'll be quite sad. What are some qualities that can compensate for this 'loss of quality'??</p>

              <p>Well, different girls will have different expectations, so they will unlikely be all interested in guys with only a certain specific character/personality.</p>
              <p>In short, it is up to the individual.</p>
              <p>Looks and physique somewhat apply only to bf, they will expect a lot more than that for someone who is husband material. You can't expect someone who is cool and handsome but can only earn less than $1000 a month to start a family with you, can you? </p>
              <p>Of course, there are girls who are blinded by physical appearance and sweet speaking that they will do anything the guys say (even marriage), but it will be bias to say that most girls are like this.</p>

              <p>I know Im kinda new, may not be my place to put in my 2 cents... but I wrote an article on this particular subject a few years ago that was published in the US magazine, "Elle."</p>
              <p>How Love Should Be</p>
              <p>I was at B&amp;N a few days ago, was looking for the new Maxim when I 
              came across this new magazine called Ramp. Now who can resist a mag with
               half-naked girl on the cover and headlines like Sex Threesomes and 69 
              Great Guy Inventions? The content seems very much like popular guy mags 
              Maxim and FHM etc. I was reading through it, yeah I do read sometimes, 
              and of course being the pervert that I am, I’m reading the article on 
              Threesomes. I come across this section on the 5 Wildest Female 
              Fantasies. Wow, yeah they have 5!! You know guys only have one, like sex
               with 2 girls at once and I'd be a happy camper. Ok so they have 5, in 
              no particular order: sex with a stranger, being submissive, being 
              dominant, and threesomes (betcha didn't know that huh). Oh wait, I did 
              say 5 right, well get this.. The fantasy number 1 is "being in love." 
              They even interviewed porn star Tera Patrick and she says, "I really 
              want to fall in love, and make love, with someone who'll sweep me off my
               feet, make love to me in the sunset, feed me breakfast, treat me like a
               queen." Now isn't that just grand. <br> <br> So here you are thinking to yourself, is that what women really want? I 
              need to tell you, I think that is what men and women both want. Most are
               a bit too proud to admit it, and a few claim they are happy being the 
              playas they are and don't need love. But I honestly believe everyone, 
              needs and want love. In most cases, people stop believing in the 
              existence of love because they had it at one time and lost it, or they 
              fell for it and got hurt, or they just can't help it but keep meeting 
              assholes and bitches. Yes love is grand, love does exist and not 
              something flower growers and greeting card manufacturers came up with on
               their own. There are no true words to describe it, it's just there, in 
              your heart you feel it and then your whole persona just gives off that 
              vibe that you’re in love. It's not something you can look for, it just 
              comes to you. You ask me how do I know. Well I've seen it first hand and
               no I’m not in love at the current moment. I saw it with my roommate and
               his girlfriend. It’s a real phenomenon, there we were at Ibiza, among 
              hundreds of young and attractive females, my buddy is faded and just 
              wondering around. He sees this tall and gorgeous lady standing by 
              herself, with legs from here to China, and what the hell, asks her what 
              her tattoo says. I mean come on now, if that isn't meant to be, what is?
               Something as simple as that, and two souls meet and come together as 
              one, and love is formed yet again.<br> <br> You think that's it don't you? Well it's not that simple, nothing is 
              that simple. Love, like all other aspects of life, need to be worked on.
               You can't just fall in love and expect it to be there forever. Men take
               that for granted all the time. Love is a relationship, and all 
              relationships need to be reinforced and you need to keep working at it 
              to make it stronger and better. You figure, she's with me, therefore she
               will always be with me, and then you cry and sulk when they tell you 
              they don't feel it anymore and that they found someone else that is 
              perhaps their true soul mate. Guys! You need to keep it going, you need 
              to keep her in love as much as she has to keep you in love. Why you 
              think she gets all dressed up when she goes out with you and gets those 
              hot outfits from Victoria's Secret, and those lotions that make you go 
              berserk? Its cause she knows how to keep you interested, but you gotta 
              return the favor, you gotta do things to make her feel like she is in 
              love. Not just in the beginning, all the time, you need to do little 
              things that keep her interested.<br> <br> The key word here is little things. Women are generally much more 
              sensitive than us men. I don't mean she breaks out in rashes when she 
              gets something on her skin. Women notice a lot more than us guys, and 
              they expect you to notice them too, and when we don't, they trip out. 
              They want us to notice they did their hair differently, notice that they
               are feeling down, and that when your mom tells them they have gained 
              weight, it means much more than when your mom tells you that. 
              Subconsciously, most women want approval, from you, from those around 
              you, from their co-workers, and most of all from your parents. Why do 
              you think women say they prefer a more sensitive guy? It's not they want
               a guy that cries at the push of a button, they want a guy with more 
              emotions, that can feel what they feel, that can understand how to deal 
              with it, and must of all to notice all the little things. You don't 
              think she is keeping tabs, but she does; she, like you is out there 
              searching for the ONE also.<br> <br> Is there such thing as the ONE, your lifelong partner and companion, 
              your soul mate. Yes I truly believe there is someone like that out there
               for everyone. Someone you can love, trust, respect, believe in, depend 
              on, and through it all, will always be there for you. For most of us, 
              that may still be our parents, for a few that has found true love, kudos
               to you. That one needs to truly understand you, love you for who you 
              are, and they need to be your best friend, someone that will support you
               in whatever you do, yet not trip when you check out that babe at the 
              mall, or even if you talk to a few attractive girls at a party. They 
              need to be secure with themselves in order to be secure with you. When 
              it comes down to it, romance wins. (Please refer to my previous article 
              on romance) Remember, when women are in love, they are more comfortable 
              with you, willing to do many more exciting things that will WOW you. 
              Finding the ONE, will make you both feel very sexy about yourselves.</p>
