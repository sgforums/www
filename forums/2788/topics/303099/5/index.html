But however, we cant deny the fact tat there are "people" who r willing to accept pre-arranged marriage... And these "people" is proven to have some similar characters in them since they choose the similar path...<br><br>Sadly, nothing last forever... Human's character also does not last... Human's personality changes thru time and events... For those normal marriage tat we experience, the click can be very high... But the high is only at tat particular time when both parties gladly say "I do"... But tat doesnt means tat thru time and events, the click will be at the same level... However, wat makes a marriage works is the affections between both parties... The amount of affection is either increased thru time, effort and "click". To further illustrate these type of affection:<br><br>Take for example :<br>if u have used a brand colgate toothpaste for 20 over years, will it be easy for u to switch brand after 20 years ???<br><br>This is how I define affection ... And tat type of affections last till one dies...<br><br>And of coz, taking back the colgate example... Parents buy toothpaste for their kids... And kids uses the toothpaste without looking at the spec , noeing the cost, noeing the bland and blah blah... Anyway, a toothpaste is just a toothpaste...<br>After 20 years of using the similar, some kids will grow affection on tat particular brand of toothpaste tat the parents buy for them and will still continue to use it till ....<br><br>Well... u still can say tat love, destiny and fate still works in a differrent sense<br><br>( Say first hor.. this is debate... And sorry for poor english hor )<br></div>

But tat doesnt means tat thru time and events, the click will be at the same level... However, wat makes a marriage works is the affections between both parties... The amount of affection is either increased thru time, effort and "click". To further illustrate these type of affection:<br><br><span style="color: red;">(Above just tells tat normal marriage and pre-arranged marriage does not have much difference in long term)</span><br><br>Take for example :<br>if u have used a brand colgate toothpaste for 20 over years, will it be easy for u to switch brand after 20 years ???<br><br>This is how I define affection ... And tat type of affections last till one dies...<br><br><span style="color: red;">(Just proving the fact tat marriage does not depend solely on click)</span><br><br>And of coz, taking back the colgate example... Parents buy toothpaste for their kids... And kids uses the toothpaste without looking at the spec , noeing the cost, noeing the bland and blah blah... Anyway, a toothpaste is just a toothpaste...<br>After 20 years of using the similar, some kids will grow affection on tat particular brand of toothpaste tat the parents buy for them and will still<br>continue to use it till ....<br><br><span style="color: red;">(Just illustrating the fact tat the pre arranged concept does happen since the parents have the most experience in marriage... And we r like a kid to parents' eyes)</span><br><br>Well... u still can say tat love, destiny and fate still works in a differrent sense<br><br>( Say first hor.. this is debate... And sorry for poor english hor )<br></div></blockquote></div>

U haven see the person before how u noe u can click?<br><br><span style="color: red;">There r many kinds of people... Some people willing to marry without meeting his/her partner...Probably to save time or watever... However, such people are very few... And usually this people already belong to the same grp liao... And hence, they have some level of click in them</span><br><br>We talking about a marriage here. It's a lifetime commitment, sacred and not child's play.<br><br><span style="color: red;">To our parents' eyes, we r just like kids towards marriage... Since it is a lifetime commitment, we do not have any experience in marriage at all... Wont it be better to let the experience 1 help to take care of our marriage??? Besides, it save u the trouble of building up the relationship between yr husband/wife to yr parents... After all, most case of marriage unhappiness is their in-laws</span><br><br>There are too many "what if's" in a blind marriage that may result in an ugly outcome.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Well... marriage tat u choose may also result in an ugly outcome... At least, if these type of blind marriage tat result in an ugly outcome, u r not alone... coz, the decision is came mainly from yr family... at least, u do not need to bear the whole burden... hahahaa...</span><br><br>Maybe 1 in 10 blind marriages work, but with such low statistics, surely people will rather choose their own partners. Someone that they love, someone that they can 'click' with and with similar interests, goals and etc.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Because of such low statistics and people even want to choose blind marriage tat proves tat they r really different from normal people... Think it will be better for them to choose people of their same kind... N beside 'click' is not the only factor tat contributes to marriage work </span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
