Give myself another 16 more years - I could star in the 40-year old virgin if they ever had a re-make and we could start the movie with 'based on true events.'</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well here's my story - I am 24 year-old and I have been single for the last 24 years of my life - yep, never been on a date, never came close to a girlfriend, let alone a naked chick under my bedcovers.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So how did it all started? - some of you might be guessing I am probably an ugly looking freak straight out of the comic book guy or Moe in Simpsons or perhaps there was something wrong with the male genitilia, making a banana seems more appealing. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have no idea......honestly. I do have female friends and we get along extremely well.......but there is always something that got in the way - she was attached, she was older or before I could think of making a move, we ended in the 'FRIENDS' zone (and there is no going back from there once you are in the zone) and just end up as the meterosexual gay friend she could spurt out everything about to and sleep with her boyfriend.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well I am no Ng Teng Fong (though I aspire to be), not from the Khoo family, look nothing like Edison Cheng, don't cook like Jamie Oliver or with the smarts of Christopher Langan. </span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yeah, I will admit that.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But I am on a fast-track to a successful career with a pretty good income, have concrete plans ahead of my life, not a bad looking guy (some girls have said I look atleast average, but I am starting to get suspicious with their honesty with the way things are turning out) and as far as my attitude goes - I am very confident, eloquent, chatty, outgoing and easy-going, except when I am in the office and growling after my juniors with a face that makes Hell Boy look like an angel.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I mean, I am not perfect, not great - but I do feel I deserve a chance, I do feel I am better than some (well atleast a few) of the guys out there in the world today to deserve atleast a date, and especially those A%^^ who are disrespectful to their gfs and maltreats them, having no idea how lucky they are, and eventually cheating on or dumping their girls for others. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I guess you really need to be single and have a string of dry seasons before you realise how lucky you are to be even on a date.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Or perhaps the problem is of my race. Well, I am of Indian descent (though not from India or local). A little bit of my childhood and my current life - I grew up in a Chinese neighbourhood, both the school I went to and the office I am going is 99% populated by the Chinese, and my closest mates are Chinese. So perhaps that's the problem?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">No, no, no - it's not that I am not into Chinese girls - I am fine with any girl from any background (except Russia and Germany perhaps, think the World War and Cold War turned them into fierce, rugby players or am I wrong?). </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But I am guessing its the reverse - the Chinese girls are not into an Indian guy? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yep, this need not any verification cause the truth is they aren't - the dark skin, funny body odour, funny accent and monkey fur seems to be turn-offs. Oh yeah -I have alot of these comments and insults thrown at me through my life - so there is nothing new about it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I know this is a long story about my rather pathetic life. But I am guessing it would be something ginteresting to talk about, make fun of, and read, lol.</span></span></p>

              <p>first of all, it was an interesting read.</p>
              <p>now, my humble two cents worth:</p>
              <p>i think awareness is a first step, which you obviously have taken. pondering over the possibilities of why you are in such a state (not pathetic, definitely), considering the insults ppl throw at you in yr life, the fact that chinese girls generally don't go for indian guys etc. i wouldn't say they are not true, but they are not absolute either, aft all there are trends in every culture.</p>
              <p>having said that, assuming you've covered yr grounds (looks, cash, personality, religion, physique...), then maybe you are right, you don't seem to be the problem because you are not the problem. if that's the case, the opportunity just hasn't surfaced yet. at 24, yr life journey has barely begun. maybe it's a problem of perspective. why did you use the word 'virgin'? is yr goal to lose yr virginity? if it is, i think the answer is easy. if it isn't, be patient.</p>
              <p>when the chance presents itself, be sure to seize the day</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p>Modern Indians usually put cologne and we have no problems with that, but the major issue is culture and religion. would we have to convert our religion when we're with you? let's say to each his own, what about the kid? marriage culture is also different, everything is so different and difficult. it's not impossible though, my mom's boss' child marries a chinese (i know it's long lol)</p>
              <p>anyway good luck =) </p>

              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yep - the title basically
              summarizes it well for me about my current state of affairs (funny,
              affairs? wouldn't mind finding myself in one - its about the
              closest I had come to having a girlfriend). Give myself another 16

              had a re-make and we could start the movie with 'based on true
              events.'</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well here's my story - I am 24
              year-old and I have been single for the last 24 years of my life -
              yep, never been on a date, never came close to a girlfriend, let
              alone a naked chick under my bedcovers.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So how did it all started? - some
              of you might be guessing I am probably an ugly looking freak
              straight out of the comic book guy or Moe in Simpsons or perhaps
              there was something wrong with the male genitilia, making a banana
              seems more appealing.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Nope none whatsoever - yet a
              conundrum I face through my life..........wondering what exactly is
              wrong with me?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Any comments? Opinions? Insults?
              Jokes?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have no idea......honestly. I do
              have female friends and we get along extremely well.......but there
              is always something that got in the way - she was attached, she was
              older or before I could think of making a move, we ended in the
              'FRIENDS' zone (and there is no going back from there once you are
              in the zone) and just end up as the meterosexual gay friend she
              could spurt out everything about to and sleep with her
              boyfriend.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well I am no Ng Teng Fong (though I
              aspire to be), not from the Khoo family, look nothing like Edison
              Cheng, don't cook like Jamie Oliver or with the smarts of
              Christopher Langan.</span></span> <span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yeah, I will admit
              that.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But I am on a fast-track to a
              successful career with a pretty good income, have concrete plans
              ahead of my life, not a bad looking guy (some girls have said I
              look atleast average, but I am starting to get suspicious with
              their honesty with the way things are turning out) and as far as my
              attitude goes - I am very confident, eloquent, chatty, outgoing and
              easy-going, except when I am in the office and growling after my
              juniors with a face that makes Hell Boy look like an
              angel.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I mean, I am not perfect, not great
              - but I do feel I deserve a chance, I do feel I am better than some
              (well atleast a few) of the guys out there in the world today to
              deserve atleast a date, and especially those A%^^ who are
              disrespectful to their gfs and maltreats them, having no idea how
              lucky they are, and eventually cheating on or dumping their girls
              for others.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I guess you really need to be
              single and have a string of dry seasons before you realise how
              lucky you are to be even on a date.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Or perhaps the problem is of my
              race. Well, I am of Indian descent (though not from India or
              local). A little bit of my childhood and my current life - I grew
              up in a Chinese neighbourhood, both the school I went to and the
              office I am going is 99% populated by the Chinese, and my closest
              mates are Chinese. So perhaps that's the problem?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">No, no, no - it's not that I am not
              into Chinese girls - I am fine with any girl from any background
              (except Russia and Germany perhaps, think the World War and Cold
              War turned them into fierce, rugby players or am I
              wrong?).</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But I am guessing its the reverse -
              the Chinese girls are not into an Indian guy?</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yep, this need not any verification
              cause the truth is they aren't - the dark skin, funny body odour,
              funny accent and monkey fur seems to be turn-offs. Oh yeah -I have
              alot of these comments and insults thrown at me through my life -
              so there is nothing new about it.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 6.5pt 0cm;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I know this is a long story about
              my rather pathetic life. But I am guessing it would be something
