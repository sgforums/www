              <p>I thank life for
              allowing me to get to know so many beautiful and wonderful women in my
              short life thus far. Because it allowed me to understand that I'm
              better off alone. It's not the women's fault that my life is such but
              my own's.</p>
              <p>There are no women who are made to suit us men, for
              when you love, you love her everything. But for men like me who are
              perfectionists, it makes us ponder and wonder why the curse of man is
              to love imperfection despite his intelligence.</p>
              <p>I do not hate
              women but in fact still very much love them so, for when I'm in the
              chase, I'm always charming and suave just so I can impress these
              sirens. It's when I'm bound by the chains of the curse, that my wings
              are nipped. My perfectionist side emerges in a few months and allow for
              no misgivings on my side in a r/s. The stress and pressure overshadows
              the smiles and pleasure. I become serious and often a stranger to be
              with. My smile is but a weak twitch of my lips, for I'm thinking all
              the time, on how to be better than yesterday so that she will love me
              more. I'm no longer spontenous and become apprehensive to every idea
              fearing that it might turn out a disaster. I strive hard to please my
              woman in every single way, hoping that she will be happy with my every
              action, only to forget that what she loved me for, was for the one I
              was previously. I attempt to fulfill every role she needs me to be in
              her life, only to realise that all these are a novelty to her. What she
              needs me to be, is just me.</p>
              <p>Thus is the curse of a man like me,
              charming and suave I might seem, but really just full of sadness and
              insecurities. So women are better off without me, just like me without
              them. For I'm only my best when I try not to be.</p>

              <p>This essay reminds me of one of my childhood incident..... We seldom have sweets or snacks in our home as we are not well off to do so..... Therefore, when it comes to CNY, and we will go to our relatives' home, pick those favourite sweets n chocolate to put inside our mini handbag to bring home....</p>
              <p>So when we reach home, we will "bao bei" our mini handbag n put it under our pillow...... So our friends start to come n share our sweets n chocolate....... In the end, all our favourite sweets n chocolate being thrown away n get ourselves a canning session from mama....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes when we over protective someone or something, that does not help the situation. We should "yi ping chang xin qiu mian du shuo you de shi". But not all of us can do that......... Sign.....</p>

              <p>I thank life for allowing me to get to know so many beautiful and wonderful women in my short life thus far. Because it allowed me to understand that I'm better off alone. It's not the women's fault that my life is such but my own's.</p>
              <p>There are no women who are made to suit us men, for when you love, you love her everything. But for men like me who are perfectionists, it makes us ponder and wonder why the curse of man is to love imperfection despite his intelligence.</p>
              <p>I do not hate women but in fact still very much love them so, for when I'm in the chase, I'm always charming and suave just so I can impress these sirens. It's when I'm bound by the chains of the curse, that my wings are nipped. My perfectionist side emerges in a few months and allow for no misgivings on my side in a r/s. The stress and pressure overshadows the smiles and pleasure. I become serious and often a stranger to be with. My smile is but a weak twitch of my lips, for I'm thinking all the time, on how to be better than yesterday so that she will love me more. I'm no longer spontenous and become apprehensive to every idea fearing that it might turn out a disaster. I strive hard to please my woman in every single way, hoping that she will be happy with my every action, only to forget that what she loved me for, was for the one I was previously. I attempt to fulfill every role she needs me to be in her life, only to realise that all these are a novelty to her. What she needs me to be, is just me.</p>
              <p>Thus is the curse of a man like me, charming and suave I might seem, but really just full of sadness and insecurities. So women are better off without me, just like me without them. For I'm only my best when I try not to be.</p>
