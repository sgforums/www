              <p>A club 30 rip off. Hehehe...</p>
              <p>Thought it might be interesting to find out whether SC members read at all. If yes, what are your favourite titles?</p>
              <p>I'll start.</p>
              <p>My favourite book: The Rum Diary by hunter thompson.</p>
              <p>The grandpap of gonzo said, that The Rum Diary would "in a twisted way . . . do for San Juan what Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises did for Spain.</p>
              <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/The_Rum_Diary.jpg/386px-The_Rum_Diary.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="379"></p>
              <p>The story involves a journalist named Paul Kemp, who moves from New York to work for a small newspaper, <em>The Daily News</em>, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Set in the late 1950s,  the novel encompasses a tangled love story of jealousy, treachery and violent alcoholic lust among the American expatriates who staff the newspaper.</p>
              <p>Thompson himself traveled from New York to San Juan in 1960 to write
                  for an ill-fated sports newspaper on the island. Thompson had
                  unsuccessfully applied to work at the larger English-language daily
                  called the <em>San Juan Star </em>while novelist William J. Kennedy<a title="William J. Kennedy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Kennedy"></a> was the editor. While in Puerto Rico, Thompson befriended many of the writers at the <em>Star</em>, providing the context for <em>The Rum Diary's</em> fictional storyline.</p>
              <p>Although Thompson was only 22 when he wrote the story, it deals
                  extensively with a fear of “going over the hill” and growing old. The
                  prominent characters are typical of Thompson's work; violent, maniacal
                  and alcoholic, stumbling through life. It is written in a highly paced
                  and rather exciting style, also typical of his work.</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>An excerpt:</p>
              <p><strong>“Yeamon was familiar too…He was probably twenty-four or five
                  and he reminded me of myself at that age - not exactly the way I was,
                  but the way I might have seen myself if I had stopped to think about
                  it.  Listening to him I realized how long it had been since I’d felt
                  like I had the world by the balls, how many quick birthdays had gone by
                  since that first year in Europe when I was so ignorant and so confident
                  that every splinter of luck made me feel like a roaring champion. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>I hadn’t felt that way in a long time.  Perhaps in the
                  ambush of those years, the idea that I was a champion had been shot out
                  from under me.  But I remembered it now and it made me feel old and
                  slightly nervous that I had done so little in so long a time.”</strong></p>

              <p>My second fav: A Farewell to Arms (morbid stuff I know... ) by the greatest romantic of all times, bad boy of literature, Hemingway.</p>
              <p><img src="http://zamczysko.org/images/a_farewell_to_arms.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="316"></p>
              <p><em><strong>A Farewell to Arms</strong></em> is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Ernest Hemingway, first published in 1929. Considered by some critics to be the greatest war novel of all time,<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since January 2008"> </span></sup>the novel is told through the point of view of Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American serving as an ambulance driver in the Italian army during WWI. </p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>An excerpt:</p>
              <p><strong>"You do not know how long you are in a river when the current moves
              swiftly. It seems a long time and it may be very short. The water was
              cold and in flood and many things passed that had been floated off the
              banks when the river rose. I was lucky to have a heavy timber to hold
              on to, and I lay in the icy water with my chin on the wood, holding on
              as easily as I could with both hands."</strong></p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>An of course the once famous but now cheesy line, "This was what you did, you died."</p>

              <p>Final favourite: Catch 22, Joseph Heller</p>
              <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2c/Catch22_cover.jpg/396px-Catch22_cover.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="464"></p>
              <p>The novel, set during the later stages of WWII from 1943 onwards, is frequently cited as one of the great literary works of the Twentieth century.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_1-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22#cite_note-BBC-1"></a></sup></p>
              <p>The novel follows Yossarian<a title="Yossarian" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossarian"></a>, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier<a title="Bombardier (air force)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_%28air_force%29"></a>,
              and a number of other characters. Most events occur while the airmen of
              the fictional Fighting 256th (or "two to the fighting eighth power<a title="Exponentiation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation"></a>") Squadron are based on the island of Pianosa<a title="Pianosa" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pianosa"></a>, west of Italy<a title="Italy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"></a>.
              Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points
              of view, so the reader learns more about the event from each iteration<a title="Repetition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition"></a>,
              with the new information often completing a joke, or setup, the
              punchline of which was told several chapters previous. The narrative
              often describes these events out of sequence, and are referred to as if
              the reader already knows about them.</p>

              <p>I've read all his novels and <em>'To Have or Have Not'</em>,
                  <em>'A Farewell to Arms'</em> and <em>'The Old Man and The

              <p>Any recommended titles for Fitzgerald? Great Gatsby was said to have influenced Fiesta</p>
              <p>Let's see... Torrents of Spring.</p>
              <p>Fiesta.</p>
              <p>Farewell to Arms.</p>

              <p>Across the river and into the trees. One of my favourite cuban tales.</p>
              <p>Islands in the stream, Old Man and the Sea check. Men without Women, In Our Time, Snows of Kilimanjaro and Winner Takes Nothing check.</p>
              <p>Didn't manage to finish True at First Light and The Garden of Eden, probably because it seemed unlike Hemingway in many ways.</p>
              <p>Fifth Column and First 49 Stories.</p>
              <p>I like the ending to The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.</p>
              <p><em>Fear gone like an operation. Something else grew in its place. Main
              thing a man had. Made him into a man. Women knew it too. No bloody fear.</em></p>
