              <h3>The finance technology recruitment market has been transformed and demand 
              for skills is now incredibly high, says Chris Mead, general manager of Hays in 
              Singapore.</h3>
              </div>
              <p>After several years in which Hong Kong and Tokyo were the finance technology 
              leaders, Singapore has rapidly become a leading financial centre and technology 
              hub in its own right, offering a wider range of products and services to local 
              and global markets than ever before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While for some time Singapore has been considered an ideal location for 
              global banks to build development, support and infrastructure hubs to support 
              their expanding global requirements, more firms are now enhancing their presence 
              there to align these technology centres to trading desks. While few firms house 
              their regional trading franchises locally, they are looking to Singapore to 
              provide a range of trading-specific functions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is creating a greater need for technologists with a more diverse skill 
              set, including specific knowledge of traded instruments. As a result, the demand 
              for finance technology candidates has never been higher. Demand is across the 
              full gamut of skills, from the traditional focus of development and support 
              functions to the increasingly popular project skills such as business analysts, 
              project and programme managers, service and delivery lead skills, as well as QA 
              and testing functions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C++ and Java developers with strong server-side/real-time specific 
              development skills are in particular demand, as are Unix, SQL, Oracle and C# 
              developers (Winforms). FX, fixed income, commodities and derivatives (generic) 
              are also popular.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In light of the demand for staff, salaries have risen. For example, business 
              analysts are in short supply (a reflection of Singapore becoming locally 
              responsible for regional projects), and there is a definite willingness from 
              most employers to increase their salaries, especially where candidates have a 
              high level of relevant business knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many advantages to working in Singapore as a technologist. The 
              favourable taxation system and quality of life offered in Singapore compared to 
              Hong Kong or Tokyo are particular attractions to the market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And while more exposure to the business can often be gained through Hong Kong 
              roles, given the demand for the very best technologists and a shallow local 
              candidate pool, most top-tier firms are now prepared to recruit individuals 
              without a finance background, providing they have first-rate skills in their 
              specialist area. This provides an ideal opportunity for candidates looking to 
              enter the banking market for the first time.</p>

              <p>I tried enrolling into Business Admin after the O levels but never quite made it. Left after one semester and enrolled in the course of my choice. Me thinks education don't stop even after graduation. After a period of time, you'll start wanting to do it for personal growth etc. I think it goes on and on.</p>
