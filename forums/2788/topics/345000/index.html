              <p>An article I wrote a long time ago....call this a sequel to my other thread.</p>
              <p>Can some intelligent women discuss this issue with me please? I'm really very into women of such calibre. Such women always attracts me. Yes, I'm contradicting myself.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I know my ass will be flamed by hordes of people, my life will
                                      be on the line, my reputation at stake, my ego busted and women might want to hold me by my balls and squeeze...<br> <br> Ok basically, you people out there will either love me or hate me
                                      for saying these. <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"><br> <br> Before any rocket launchers come pointing my way...just hear me on
                                      what I have to say...<br> <br> I have many woman friends. I have had girlfriends. Not many
                                      really....but enough to know about woman. I often have
                                      conversations over some Earl Grey with these woman friends of mine,
                                      and sometimes the topic will revolve around the differences of the
                                      sexes. I have always respected woman, believing them to be an equal
                                      of a man, only that we behave and react differently to different
                                      situations. In fact I have some woman friends who packs quite a
                                      powerhouse background. Some are their own boss, some are hold in
                                      high regard due to their work ability, some are potential directors
                                      for MNCs...yes...they are good and capable people. So why am I
                                      saying that woman are contradiction? This has nothing to do with
                                      their work ability, nor capability. It is the thought process
                                      itself that I am pointing to here.<br> <br> I have asked them sometimes...what do you ask in a man?<br> <br> I get varied answers....but I sum these up as the most common
                                      answers.<br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> I want a man who is not very handsome, but must be lookable.<br> <br> I want a man who is chivalrous (or gentlemanly) but chauvinistic
                                      enough at the same time.<br> <br> I want a man who is not very successful in his career, but must
                                      have amass enough success in his work to maintain his
                                      position.<br> <br> I want a man who is not rich, but financially stable enough to
                                      maintain my lifestyle.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that
                                      they are all looking for a Mr. Average? Look at the woman on the
                                      streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must
                                      be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it
                                      must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, why else are so many
                                      Mr. average (me included) not attached? Something is wrong with the
                                      fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average
                                      around. The one which so many woman wants.<br> <br> Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not
                                      necessary what you get...well...here are some of the contradicting
                                      conditions you gals ask for in a man.<br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> I want a man who has time for me but successful in his
                                      career.<br> <br> I want a man who is good in bed but not have sex very often.<br> <br> I want a man who knows how to treat a woman good but knows how to
                                      tease her to love him at the same time.<br> <br> I want a man who loves his parents...but must love me just as
                                      much.<br> <br> I want a man who is athletic, has a great body...but not crazy
                                      about sports.<br> <br> I want a man who takes good care of me and gives me the sense of
                                      security, but must give me space to lead a independent
                                      life.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The list goes on and on...and I did not make them up...they are
                                      all from...you guessed correctly...woman.<br> <br> Now let's see....what do we have? A man who is successful in his
                                      career most probably dun have a lot of time for his girlfriend or
                                      wife...I am a business person...and I have seen many successful
                                      guys who dun have time for the family. And basically a man who is
                                      good in bed is most of the time a man who gets a lot of
                                      practice...in this case...how can he not have sex very often? And
                                      of course a man who treats a woman good would not want to play mind
                                      games with her. As for the parents part....for those out there who
                                      are married Â… I am sure you all know how it works...most of the
                                      time it is either mum and pa or just wife and the children....it
                                      always have to be a choice between them. Basically if a man has a
                                      great body...he works out a lot. And if a woman is
                                      independent...she would not need a man to take care of her.<br> <br> So how are these contradictions summing up?<br> <br> Well...another contradiction of woman which I am sure a lot of you
                                      guys here have seen before....the way they rejects us. Here are a
                                      couple of examples...<br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> Callan, it is not you it is me...you are too good for me.<br> <br> The problem does not lie with you, the problem lies with me. You
                                      are a perfect guy, but I am not a perfect girl.<br> <br> I treat my friends better than my lover, and I think you deserve
                                      good treatment from me, so let's just be friends.<br> <br> You are my greatest friend, and I treat my friends better than my
                                      lovers.<br> <br> I am not your type, so it would not be possible.<br> <br> I am not for you, you would not like me.<br> <br> This is not a rejection line...but...<br> ^------(contributed by Sonic)------^</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well...looking at these rejection lines...I just sense each and
                                      everyone as a contradiction. Well...if I am good...perfect....why
                                      would you not want me? It just does not make sense...well....as for
                                      the friends part...I once got so piss at the answer that I cursed
                                      under my breath.."yah you screw your lover but you would not screw
                                      me, is that it?". Didn't woman always wanted a man who can be a
                                      lover and friend at the same time? Well....if you are not my type I
                                      would not have asked you in the same place...you can say that I am
                                      not your type...but you can't tell me that I am not your type
                                      simple because you are not me.<br> <br> Well...another thing about woman....have you people not notice a
                                      rather strange trend nowadays? I give you people a real life
                                      experience I have...<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">I like this gal very much....I am
                                      the very nice guy who would always be there for her...take care of
                                      her when she is sick...lend her my shoulders to cry on....give her
                                      a hug to assure her that I am there for her...well basically...I am
                                      the nicest guy she has ever met.(She told me that, I am not blowing
                                      my own trumpet) Well....there is a problem...she had a
                                      boyfriend...a total jerk...he would humiliate her in public...treat
                                      her like a property...take her as his free maid...and of course the
                                      object to vent his sexual frustrations on. Well...she refuses to
                                      leave him because she says she loves him too much to give up. (what
                                      is there to love in him anyway?!?) Of course she got dump in the
                                      end after he found his next fresh free maid. She came crying to
                                      me...blah blah blah...and then say that I am the best thing that
                                      happen to her...blah blah blah...of course I comforted her and she
                                      felt better after a couple of months...then I decided maybe it is
                                      time I pop the question...and guess what? She rejected me, saying
                                      she found someone better...and runs off with the next best jerk
                                      that comes along....ok I told myself that I am not for her...and of
                                      course history repeats itself....she got dump by another jerk...and
                                      I again becomes her fairy god mother who mend her heart...and of
                                      course again she runs off...now she is with the 4th best jerk...and
                                      I can only say good luck to her...and give up on her...I dun wanna
                                      be a dunlopillo Mattress cushioning her every time she falls...and
                                      then be alone again till she decides fall again.</span><br> <br> So the moral of the story is? Well...How can woman be so
                                      contradictory? Well..the perfectly nice young man is right in front
                                      of her begging and waiting for her to nod her head, off she runs
                                      off begging the jerks to take her in. and no she is not the only
                                      woman whom I have met in life who falls into this cycle...there are
                                      a whole lot of them out there....is it not contradicting?<br> <br> Of course...these contradictions does not only stops in R/S
                                      problems...The modern woman too often cries out loud for equality
                                      of the sexes....and than they will claim that man are not
                                      gentlemanly to them...that we do not carry their shopping bags for
                                      them...that we do not open the doors for them...hmmm...I am
                                      wondering if they want equality....or the perks of equality with
                                      the original benefits of being a woman kept intact....what do they
                                      want at all?!?!?<br> <br> Ain't women supposedly to be better at managing emotions than men?
                                      If so....why are they causing so much trouble for themselves then?
                                      It is one big contradiction all together.<br> <br> BUT...one thing I still believe in...it is that...the very reason
                                      woman are so intriguing...and interesting...is simply because of
                                      such contradictions...and man can be quite a contradiction to like
                                      them for it themselves. <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>An article I wrote a long time ago....call this a sequel to my other thread.</p>
              <p>Can some intelligent women discuss this issue with me please? I'm really very into women of such calibre. Such women always attracts me. Yes, I'm contradicting myself.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I know my ass will be flamed by hordes of people, my life will be on the line, my reputation at stake, my ego busted and women might want to hold me by my balls and squeeze...<br><br>Ok basically, you people out there will either love me or hate me for saying these. <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"><br><br>Before any rocket launchers come pointing my way...just hear me on what I have to say...<br><br>I have many woman friends. I have had girlfriends. Not many really....but enough to know about woman. I often have conversations over some Earl Grey with these woman friends of mine, and sometimes the topic will revolve around the differences of the sexes. I have always respected woman, believing them to be an equal of a man, only that we behave and react differently to different situations. In fact I have some woman friends who packs quite a powerhouse background. Some are their own boss, some are hold in high regard due to their work ability, some are potential directors for MNCs...yes...they are good and capable people. So why am I saying that woman are contradiction? This has nothing to do with their work ability, nor capability. It is the thought process itself that I am pointing to here.<br><br>I have asked them sometimes...what do you ask in a man?<br><br>I get varied answers....but I sum these up as the most common answers.</p>
              <p>Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that they are all looking for a Mr. Average? Look at the woman on the streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, why else are so many Mr. average (me included) not attached? Something is wrong with the fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average around. The one which so many woman wants.<br><br>Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not necessary what you get...well...here are some of the contradicting conditions you gals ask for in a man.</p>
              <p>The list goes on and on...and I did not make them up...they are all from...you guessed correctly...woman.<br><br>Now let's see....what do we have? A man who is successful in his career most probably dun have a lot of time for his girlfriend or wife...I am a business person...and I have seen many successful guys who dun have time for the family. And basically a man who is good in bed is most of the time a man who gets a lot of practice...in this case...how can he not have sex very often? And of course a man who treats a woman good would not want to play mind games with her. As for the parents part....for those out there who are married Â… I am sure you all know how it works...most of the time it is either mum and pa or just wife and the children....it always have to be a choice between them. Basically if a man has a great body...he works out a lot. And if a woman is independent...she would not need a man to take care of her.<br><br>So how are these contradictions summing up?<br><br>Well...another contradiction of woman which I am sure a lot of you guys here have seen before....the way they rejects us. Here are a couple of examples...</p>
              <p>Well...looking at these rejection lines...I just sense each and everyone as a contradiction. Well...if I am good...perfect....why would you not want me? It just does not make sense...well....as for the friends part...I once got so piss at the answer that I cursed under my breath.."yah you screw your lover but you would not screw me, is that it?". Didn't woman always wanted a man who can be a lover and friend at the same time? Well....if you are not my type I would not have asked you in the same place...you can say that I am not your type...but you can't tell me that I am not your type simple because you are not me.<br><br>Well...another thing about woman....have you people not notice a rather strange trend nowadays? I give you people a real life experience I have...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I like this gal very much....I am the very nice guy who would always be there for her...take care of her when she is sick...lend her my shoulders to cry on....give her a hug to assure her that I am there for her...well basically...I am the nicest guy she has ever met.(She told me that, I am not blowing my own trumpet) Well....there is a problem...she had a boyfriend...a total jerk...he would humiliate her in public...treat her like a property...take her as his free maid...and of course the object to vent his sexual frustrations on. Well...she refuses to leave him because she says she loves him too much to give up. (what is there to love in him anyway?!?) Of course she got dump in the end after he found his next fresh free maid. She came crying to me...blah blah blah...and then say that I am the best thing that happen to her...blah blah blah...of course I comforted her and she felt better after a couple of months...then I decided maybe it is time I pop the question...and guess what? She rejected me, saying she found someone better...and runs off with the next best jerk that comes along....ok I told myself that I am not for her...and of course history repeats itself....she got dump by another jerk...and I again becomes her fairy god mother who mend her heart...and of course again she runs off...now she is with the 4th best jerk...and I can only say good luck to her...and give up on her...I dun wanna be a dunlopillo Mattress cushioning her every time she falls...and then be alone again till she decides fall again.</span><br><br>So the moral of the story is? Well...How can woman be so contradictory? Well..the perfectly nice young man is right in front of her begging and waiting for her to nod her head, off she runs off begging the jerks to take her in. and no she is not the only woman whom I have met in life who falls into this cycle...there are a whole lot of them out there....is it not contradicting?<br><br>Of course...these contradictions does not only stops in R/S problems...The modern woman too often cries out loud for equality of the sexes....and than they will claim that man are not gentlemanly to them...that we do not carry their shopping bags for them...that we do not open the doors for them...hmmm...I am wondering if they want equality....or the perks of equality with the original benefits of being a woman kept intact....what do they want at all?!?!?<br><br>Ain't women supposedly to be better at managing emotions than men? If so....why are they causing so much trouble for themselves then? It is one big contradiction all together.<br><br>BUT...one thing I still believe in...it is that...the very reason woman are so intriguing...and interesting...is simply because of such contradictions...and man can be quite a contradiction to like them for it themselves. <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>

              <p>I agree with tare......... A perfect guy may not have a perfect gal in life. A devil may ends up with his angel. Human beings are not logical in their senses. They love to be treasured, yet stingy to give. She maybe the ugliest creature on earth but yet a lovely partner of yours........ </p>
              <p>Mostly imptly is the chemistry during the relationship. Treasure the relationship when chemistry is still ard. Look ahead after the chemistry is gone.</p>

              <p>I have a big social circle of women (you included). And I agree with
              you, a woman is contradicting when she does not knows what she wants,
              but I somehow felt that this statements describe the majority of the
              women population. Looking at the ratio then, there are not many women
              left to fall in love with who are not in that category. Dun you women
              always claim that "All the good men are dead, married or gay." too?
              Then can I say "good luck" if you fall for a man who is not dead,
              married or gay?</p>
              <p>What is the use of communication if you dun intend to say what
              you meant in the first place? Or rather to be fair at least most of the
              time. Most men does, but I figured that it is the logical thought
              process in a man and a women that makes the difference. Dun
              misunderstand me, most of the time I understand what women are trying
              to say to me. Most of them are quite happy with my ability to
              communicate with them on their level, emotionally or intellectually. 
              But that does not mean that what they are saying is not what they
              really intend to say.</p>
              <p>As for excuses for rejection, well, just to
              let you know more about men here. We are logical people, we dun really
              need women to let us feel life is a bed of roses. I think we are strong
              enough emotionally to know that we are ugly or not your type. We rather
              have the truth and break our "Frail ego" (Another assumption women have
              of men), then to listen to fairy tales. Try rejecting a man outright
              next time, you will find that it is definitely more effective and you
              might still end up as "friends"(because based on the ladder theory, men
              and women can never be friends) unlike what many women thinks to be.
              You can try it on me if you want, but like I said, I'm special...so the
              results might be otherwise.</p>

              <p>I agree with tare......... A perfect guy may not have a perfect
              gal in life. A devil may ends up with his angel. Human beings are
              not logical in their senses. They love to be treasured, yet stingy
              to give. She maybe the ugliest creature on earth but yet
              a lovely partner of yours........ </p>
              <p>Mostly imptly is the chemistry during the relationship. Treasure
              the relationship when chemistry is still ard. Look ahead after the
              chemistry is gone.</p>

              <p>When did I say we are looking for a perfect girl? And unless there is a
              mistake here, I'm very much more a giver than a taker. And since 22
              years old (let's forget those teenage years), I have always been very
              serious in all my r/s, I always try to love my 100% though I can't say
              I have actually loved 100% before. Once again, let me state my belief
              in r/s again, "The beginning of a r/s, is the beginning of a marriage."
              I dun think I can take r/s more serious or treasure a r/s more than
              this. But how is this related to women being a contradiction?</p>

              <p>First of all let me thank you. You have just proven tare wrong. You
                  seem to have found yourself a nice catch and that I congratulate you.</p>
              <p>Now let me quote myself again.</p>
              <p><em>"Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that
                                          they are all looking for a <strong>Mr. Average</strong>? Look at the woman on the
                                          streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must
                                          be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it
                                          must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, <strong>why</strong> <strong>else are so many
                                          Mr. average (me included) not attached</strong>? Something is wrong with the
                                          fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average
                                          around. <strong>The one which so many woman wants.</strong><br> <br> Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not
                                          necessary what you get..."</em></p>
              <p>By
                  elaborating on my point 1-4 , I think you have just agreed with what I
                  have said. I'm not saying that they are contradictions, I'm saying that
                  such guys are all around, so where are the women clamouring after them?</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>I agree not everyone can do that but I know a
                                          lot of successful ppl who have time for their wife and family."</em></strong></p>
              <p>Since
                  you agree, then can I say that it is quite a contradiction? Do I have
                  to specify that this means the majority? Talking about the minority
                  seldom represents the rest in the world. And to support the
                  contradiction behind this statement, if the men you are talking about
                  is not really a majority, then how can they be the average joe that was
                  describe earlier in my point 1-4 then?</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>Skill and sex drive very different things
                                          leh"</em></strong></p>
              <p>Do
                  I have to explain that skill comes with practice? Wait, I think I did.
                  Did you read that part? I'm not talking about the man's high sex drive
                  here, but I'm talking about the woman's low sex drive. I believe that
                  no man is born a lover, we all learn through practice. And normally the
                  more practice a man get with his woman, the more he knows how to please
                  her. Every woman is different in her likes and whims, you dun dig every
                  tunnel the same way. (no puns intended) I have come to learn that
                  through.....practice.</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>Ok
                                          this one got me, treating a woman well and teasing her is 2 very
                                          different things and I don't see how teasing is treating a woman
                                          badly"</em></strong></p>
              <p>Maybe
                  I have to elaborate, when I say "tease her to love him", I mean to play
                  mind games. But then again...I think I did say that. Mind if I ask if
                  you were actually reading the whole piece?</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>I see lots of guys who manage that very
                                          well."</em></strong></p>
              <p>Well,
                  I KNOW a lot of guys with this problem. I was once in this position
                  myself and a lot of other friends. Let's be realistic, most people have
                  this problem. They would be living with parents after marriage if this
                  is not a problem. Distance does makes the relationship less tense.</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>I think crazy about sports here means his mind is filled with
                                          nothing but sports and talks about his fav sportsmen or women all
                                          day la."</em></strong></p>
              <p>I
                  think when the women told me that, they did implied to me that they
                  hates to excercise herself, and that they would prefer someone who does
                  not outshine them in that department because it would be difficult to
                  find common activities with him. I did say it is a contradiction, so I
                  think I know what a contradiction meant when I wrote this. Darling,
                  let's not assume that I might be drunk when I wrote this, can we?</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>"This is not contridictary at all. I'm living that life right now.

              <p>I'm
                  really beginning to doubt you read everything I wrote. Personally I
                  think my words stirred your emotions more than your logic, you seem to
                  miss out on the important points. Make love, not war my dear,
                  personally, I love to make love, but for now, let's discuss. I did say
                  that this statement is contradicting, not the condition itself. Why
                  would an independant women want a man who can take care of her? Independant
                  ,and "to take care of me", they sound like an oxymoron here, dun they? But
                  still I congratulate you for finding a man who lets you go out with
                  friends of the opposite sex. But that does not make you an independant
                  women. You would rather be on your own if you REALLY want to be
                  independant. Most independant women I know are single and happy being
                  single.</p>

              <p>First of all let me thank you. You have just proven tare wrong. You seem to have found yourself a nice catch and that I congratulate you.</p>
              <p>Now let me quote myself again.</p>
              <p><em>"Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that they are all looking for a <strong>Mr. Average</strong>? Look at the woman on the streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, <strong>why</strong> <strong>else are so many Mr. average (me included) not attached</strong>? Something is wrong with the fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average around. <strong>The one which so many woman wants.</strong><br><br>Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not necessary what you get..."</em></p>
              <p>By elaborating on my point 1-4 , I think you have just agreed with what I have said. I'm not saying that they are contradictions, I'm saying that such guys are all around, so where are the women clamouring after them?</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>I agree not everyone can do that but I know a lot of successful ppl who have time for their wife and family."</em></strong></p>
              <p>Since you agree, then can I say that it is quite a contradiction? Do I have to specify that this means the majority? Talking about the minority seldom represents the rest in the world. And to support the contradiction behind this statement, if the men you are talking about is not really a majority, then how can they be the average joe that was describe earlier in my point 1-4 then?</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>Skill and sex drive very different things leh"</em></strong></p>
              <p>Do I have to explain that skill comes with practice? Wait, I think I did. Did you read that part? I'm not talking about the man's high sex drive here, but I'm talking about the woman's low sex drive. I believe that no man is born a lover, we all learn through practice. And normally the more practice a man get with his woman, the more he knows how to please her. Every woman is different in her likes and whims, you dun dig every tunnel the same way. (no puns intended) I have come to learn that through.....practice.</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>Ok this one got me, treating a woman well and teasing her is 2 very different things and I don't see how teasing is treating a woman badly"</em></strong></p>
              <p>Maybe I have to elaborate, when I say "tease her to love him", I mean to play mind games. But then again...I think I did say that. Mind if I ask if you were actually reading the whole piece?</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>I see lots of guys who manage that very well."</em></strong></p>
              <p>Well, I KNOW a lot of guys with this problem. I was once in this position myself and a lot of other friends. Let's be realistic, most people have this problem. They would be living with parents after marriage if this is not a problem. Distance does makes the relationship less tense.</p>
              <p><strong><em><strong>"</strong>I think crazy about sports here means his mind is filled with nothing but sports and talks about his fav sportsmen or women all day la."</em></strong></p>
              <p>I think when the women told me that, they did implied to me that they hates to excercise herself, and that they would prefer someone who does not outshine them in that department because it would be difficult to find common activities with him. I did say it is a contradiction, so I think I know what a contradiction meant when I wrote this. Darling, let's not assume that I might be drunk when I wrote this, can we?</p>
              <p><strong><em>"This is not contridictary at all. I'm living that life right now. My husband takes good care of me, I feel secure with him but at the same time I can go out with my friends without him breathing down my neck and likewise he does the same. Yes we go out alone with opposite sex friends as well alone."</em></strong></p>
              <p>I'm really beginning to doubt you read everything I wrote. Personally I think my words stirred your emotions more than your logic, you seem to miss out on the important points. Make love, not war my dear, personally, I love to make love, but for now, let's discuss. I did say that this statement is contradicting, not the condition itself. Why would an independant womenwant a man who can take care of her? Independant , take care of me, they sound like an oxymoron here, dun they? But still I congratulate you for finding a man who lets you go out with friends of the opposite sex. But that does not make you an independant women. You would rather be on your own if you REALLY want to be independant. Most independant women I know are single and happy being single.</p>
              <p>As for the rejection lines. Please read my reply to tare.</p>
