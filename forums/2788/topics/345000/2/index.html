              <p>1. Yes. Most women are walking contradictions of themselves. Men too. Just that men often are less expressive, so you don't get to see the 'obvious' side of things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Anybody can come up with any form of excuses they want when they want to do something in a certain way. Just that women don't bother to fabricate excuses with 'logic', while men often do... They can just be made up of distorted 'logics'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. It's common. Some things are too good to lose. 'Friend' &amp; 'Lover' are often contradictions to each other. Not that they cannot co-exist, except that it's VERY difficult to especially when one has already weigh heavily in a relationship (note. Here I refer to any relationship in general terms). A 'friend' into a 'lover' is a breach of line, often from orderliness into chaos. Hence, hardly accepted. A 'lover' into 'friend' is often the bloom of a BGR or love relationship. When it deepens, either stabilised into something very difficult or risk destruction at cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Girl going into the same kinda jerk is quite a deep topic by itself. I've gone through this topic in the past. Basically, it's something something like women think by 'heart'. It's not something which is so really 'wrong' about. It's just their 'made up' which I would refrain from discussing in depth here. See it this way.. There're things they're more capable of and others which they're not. Of course, varies among individuals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Do women want it all or just wanted to be treated equally? I think this is very subjective. Depends on which women you're talking about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. Nope. Women in general are not better at handling emotions as compared to men.</p>

They love to be treasured, yet stingy to give. She maybe the ugliest creature on earth but yet a lovely partner of yours........ </p>

              <p>When did I say we are looking for a perfect girl? And unless there is a mistake here, I'm very much more a giver than a taker. And since 22 years old (let's forget those teenage years), I have always been very serious in all my r/s, I always try to love my 100% though I can't say I have actually loved 100% before. Once again, let me state my belief in r/s again, "The beginning of a r/s, is the beginning of a marriage." I dun think I can take r/s more serious or treasure a r/s more than this. But how is this related to women being a contradiction?</p>

              <p>Dear Callan,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I`ve read most of ur post,</p>
              <p>somehow, i`ll like to pay my compliments to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First for stirring up such thoughts amongst the most educated and free thinking women in both geological and historical aspect. i do agree with you that at time, i used to have such thoughts too.. like what devil said, perhaps, we guys are less expressive thus think that women are generally more contradicting..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, i`m rather contratictory too... i hate ppl who are contradictory, but i love women as well..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, for having such patience to reply everyone regardless of their type of comments really requires some form of unsurpassed patience.. for me, i would choose the `listen to the gd stuff` strategy. well, having such patience of yours, you had been able to pen down all these thought like crystal.. however, perhaps this topic would receive less rebuttals if it were just named as your personal opinions, but well, givin an absolute title as such only proves the reality of life, `Looks does matter` as contrasted to `Title does matter`</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, i`ve been feelin rather down due to many small nitty issue happening all at the same time.. so perhaps u all wanna pardon me for watever rubbish i had made??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and to all the great guys and gals, i`m really glad u had all participated well without giving irresponsible remarks..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>best wishes,</p>

              <p>I dun doubt what you said, not everyone has the same opinions and beliefs in a r/s. I hope you dun misunderstand that I'm trying to blame someone should the relationship not work out. It's just a mismatch. Simple and fair. It's just like religion, there will always be fanatics, and I'm a fanatic on my beliefs on r/s. So it will take another fanatic to go through life with me.</p>
              <p><em>"Another common wrong belief among people (especially males) is
              that how much I put in is = how much I get back for return.
              Remember that a love relationship revolves around 2 people. You
              can't see love as a 'logical' subject because the 2 main subsets
              within it might not be 'logical' in the 1st place."</em></p>
              <p>You can be the one taking control...really. You are the one who choose and decide how much to give and take. And the perfect scenario will of course be 50/50. Though it might not be entirely possible all the time, we alway try ti be close to the median. Please read <a href="/forums/2788/topics/343858">my other article</a> for further insights into my POV.</p>

              not always fall for the same type. And the last thing a woman might
              want is someone who's despair. Don't give up on yourself and don't
              give up on relationship... Or so, relationship would just have to
              give up on you..."</em></p>
              <p>Errmmm....are you talking to me about this? Looking at my history and what others know about me, I think I'm not about to give up just yet, but singlehood for now is fine. I'm enjoying the part of being the rejector for the moment. But who knows...someone might just steal my heart again. And dun talk to me about despair, I'm famous for kicking it in the face.</p>

              <p>An article I wrote a long time ago....call this a sequel to my other thread.</p>
              <p>Can some intelligent women discuss this issue with me please? I'm really very into women of such calibre. Such women always attracts me. Yes, I'm contradicting myself.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I know my ass will be flamed by hordes of people, my life will be on the line, my reputation at stake, my ego busted and women might want to hold me by my balls and squeeze...<br><br>Ok basically, you people out there will either love me or hate me for saying these. <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"><br><br>Before any rocket launchers come pointing my way...just hear me on what I have to say...<br><br>I have many woman friends. I have had girlfriends. Not many really....but enough to know about woman. I often have conversations over some Earl Grey with these woman friends of mine, and sometimes the topic will revolve around the differences of the sexes. I have always respected woman, believing them to be an equal of a man, only that we behave and react differently to different situations. In fact I have some woman friends who packs quite a powerhouse background. Some are their own boss, some are hold in high regard due to their work ability, some are potential directors for MNCs...yes...they are good and capable people. So why am I saying that woman are contradiction? This has nothing to do with their work ability, nor capability. It is the thought process itself that I am pointing to here.<br><br>I have asked them sometimes...what do you ask in a man?<br><br>I get varied answers....but I sum these up as the most common answers.</p>
              <p>Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that they are all looking for a Mr. Average? Look at the woman on the streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, why else are so many Mr. average (me included) not attached? Something is wrong with the fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average around. The one which so many woman wants.<br><br>Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not necessary what you get...well...here are some of the contradicting conditions you gals ask for in a man.</p>
              <p>The list goes on and on...and I did not make them up...they are all from...you guessed correctly...woman.<br><br>Now let's see....what do we have? A man who is successful in his career most probably dun have a lot of time for his girlfriend or wife...I am a business person...and I have seen many successful guys who dun have time for the family. And basically a man who is good in bed is most of the time a man who gets a lot of practice...in this case...how can he not have sex very often? And of course a man who treats a woman good would not want to play mind games with her. As for the parents part....for those out there who are married Â… I am sure you all know how it works...most of the time it is either mum and pa or just wife and the children....it always have to be a choice between them. Basically if a man has a great body...he works out a lot. And if a woman is independent...she would not need a man to take care of her.<br><br>So how are these contradictions summing up?<br><br>Well...another contradiction of woman which I am sure a lot of you guys here have seen before....the way they rejects us. Here are a couple of examples...</p>
              <p>Well...looking at these rejection lines...I just sense each and everyone as a contradiction. Well...if I am good...perfect....why would you not want me? It just does not make sense...well....as for the friends part...I once got so piss at the answer that I cursed under my breath.."yah you screw your lover but you would not screw me, is that it?". Didn't woman always wanted a man who can be a lover and friend at the same time? Well....if you are not my type I would not have asked you in the same place...you can say that I am not your type...but you can't tell me that I am not your type simple because you are not me.<br><br>Well...another thing about woman....have you people not notice a rather strange trend nowadays? I give you people a real life experience I have...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I like this gal very much....I am the very nice guy who would always be there for her...take care of her when she is sick...lend her my shoulders to cry on....give her a hug to assure her that I am there for her...well basically...I am the nicest guy she has ever met.(She told me that, I am not blowing my own trumpet) Well....there is a problem...she had a boyfriend...a total jerk...he would humiliate her in public...treat her like a property...take her as his free maid...and of course the object to vent his sexual frustrations on. Well...she refuses to leave him because she says she loves him too much to give up. (what is there to love in him anyway?!?) Of course she got dump in the end after he found his next fresh free maid. She came crying to me...blah blah blah...and then say that I am the best thing that happen to her...blah blah blah...of course I comforted her and she felt better after a couple of months...then I decided maybe it is time I pop the question...and guess what? She rejected me, saying she found someone better...and runs off with the next best jerk that comes along....ok I told myself that I am not for her...and of course history repeats itself....she got dump by another jerk...and I again becomes her fairy god mother who mend her heart...and of course again she runs off...now she is with the 4th best jerk...and I can only say good luck to her...and give up on her...I dun wanna be a dunlopillo Mattress cushioning her every time she falls...and then be alone again till she decides fall again.</span><br><br>So the moral of the story is? Well...How can woman be so contradictory? Well..the perfectly nice young man is right in front of her begging and waiting for her to nod her head, off she runs off begging the jerks to take her in. and no she is not the only woman whom I have met in life who falls into this cycle...there are a whole lot of them out there....is it not contradicting?<br><br>Of course...these contradictions does not only stops in R/S problems...The modern woman too often cries out loud for equality of the sexes....and than they will claim that man are not gentlemanly to them...that we do not carry their shopping bags for them...that we do not open the doors for them...hmmm...I am wondering if they want equality....or the perks of equality with the original benefits of being a woman kept intact....what do they want at all?!?!?<br><br>Ain't women supposedly to be better at managing emotions than men? If so....why are they causing so much trouble for themselves then? It is one big contradiction all together.<br><br>BUT...one thing I still believe in...it is that...the very reason woman are so intriguing...and interesting...is simply because of such contradictions...and man can be quite a contradiction to like them for it themselves. <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> <img title="Very Happy" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>

              <p><br>You need to realise that there are many types of woman out there. And I can tell you there are probably enough retarded women out there for those retarded men.</p>
              <p>If you always asked the same stupid question to the women that you've met or known, then of course you would only end up receiving stupid answers from them.</p>
              <p>I don't need to ask you I already know those women that you have met or known aren't very smart or sensible types. And do note that doing well in their educations/careers doesn't means they are smart and sensible. One good example would be referenced to MPs and Politicians and Businesswomen and Educators.</p>
              <p>I can tell you I will be with a man because I like him. There's no such things as what do you look for in a man, except if you want to ask such question to add insult to humilation to the retarded being that you are conversing actually with. Do you enjoy conversing with a retard?</p>
              <p>Liking someone is alot like shopping actually. You can be shopping for a certain item, but they comes in different brands and packaging and prices. Ultimately you will end up buying the one that you really liked, of course there is no convincing explainations behind the choice why you ended up buying this one instead of the others. That is because you have made a subjective choice.</p>
              <p>The keyword to all this should be "The entire package", you like something or someone is not because you are able to list out enough reasons to like that item or person. It is because you like that item or person based on the overall package that combines all the good and bad which happens to stir up sufficient comfortable and desirable emotions in you to trigger your heart to tell your brain that "This is the one I want".</p>
              <p>I'm not surprised that guys like yourself are constantly seeking for the reasons behind attractions. But this is only because you all don't really have your own personalities or maybe you despised your own true real personalities? Guys who can change themselves by self-realisation are good, but most guys ended up as fakers who need to fake themselves to the death in order to attract the girl that they like. But seriously, I am sure even you guys are unable to reply why you preferred this girl instead of another.</p>
              <p>And do you know why you are not able to reply this question? That is because the question itself is SUBJECTIVE! So there is no right or wrong answers to it, only got retarded question produces retarded answers from subjectively retarded people.</p>
              <p>My opinions are not debatable as I am absolute. If you cannot understand my post, then I can tell you this post will be here long enough for you to understand it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              capable of loving on two fronts. Love for your parents and love for

              <p>I think most of the time guys try to be like that, but then there are always posuers. I got to hear a story about one recently that was very much considered a "man who got no pride". Basically he asked for all the money he spent on his ex back after a breakup. He even force the lady to go to the atm to withdraw every bit of cash she had and left her penniless on the street. Last year, I was told by the same lady that he is a fine young gentleman. So to the guys out there who got no pride, my word to you is, "Save the act for the nymphos who just care if you have a big dick." That is definitely no male chivarly.</p>

              <p>Singapore has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in asia. I tend to believe that if you are willing to work in SG, you cannot go jobless. So why are the ladies still looking?</p>

              <p>Again, easier said than done.</p>
              <p><em>"A man who is able to control his desires?
              Anyway, i think women want a man who can let them satisfy their
              deepest darkest fantasies in the bedroom, and still is in control
              when out."</em></p>
              <p>I think I said it before, skills comes with practice. That does not mean that you are a over zealous ape with raging hormones when you are out of the bedroom. Tell me who is? I'll alert the zoo.</p>
              <p><em>"A man
              who is capable of pampering his girl with his love, and still is
              independent enough to draw back and let her chase him."</em></p>
              <p>Mind games? ok, maybe this point is a bit rusty. But In my point of view, you dun treat your woman good when you play mind games with her.</p>
              <p>"Simply, a loving person. Or rather a person
              capable of loving on two fronts. Love for your parents and love for
              your girl is simply two different subjects and they can be just as
              much as each other."</p>
              <p>Are you or have you been married? You would wish women would understand what you just said about "two different subjects". They would not ask you funny questions then.</p>
              <p><em>"Plays sports, maybe like every thursday night a sports activity but
              not till the point of crazy fandom over the sports itself."</em></p>
              <p>I dun know. Can you get a great bod with just thursday night? Let me know the routine, the last time I had a great bod, I was burning 12 hours in the gym weekly.</p>
              <p><em>"Confident of living his own life. Confident in his girl being able
              to hold her in the world and if she cant, to look to him for help.
              And he MUST be able to listen to her, understand what she's NOT
              saying."</em></p>
              <p>That's security you are talking about. But the woman actually wants to be independant and live her own life here, without you! So what are you doing in the picture?</p>

              <p>Dear Callan,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I`ve read most of ur post,</p>
              <p>somehow, i`ll like to pay my compliments to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First for stirring up such thoughts amongst the most educated
              and free thinking women in both geological and historical aspect. i
              do agree with you that at time, i used to have such thoughts too..
              like what devil said, perhaps, we guys are less expressive thus
              think that women are generally more contradicting..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, i`m rather contratictory too... i hate ppl who are
              contradictory, but i love women as well..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, for having such patience to reply everyone regardless
              of their type of comments really requires some form of unsurpassed
              patience.. for me, i would choose the `listen to the gd stuff`
              strategy. well, having such patience of yours, you had been able to
              pen down all these thought like crystal.. however, perhaps this
              topic would receive less rebuttals if it were just named as your
              personal opinions, but well, givin an absolute title as such only
              proves the reality of life, `Looks does matter` as contrasted to
              `Title does matter`</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, i`ve been feelin rather down due to many small nitty issue
              happening all at the same time.. so perhaps u all wanna pardon me
              for watever rubbish i had made??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and to all the great guys and gals, i`m really glad u had all
              participated well without giving irresponsible remarks..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>best wishes,</p>

              <p>Is this considered fan mail? Pardon me, but I normally recieve these in my PMs. But still thank you very much for the appreciation. I know I'm very cocky sometimes. So please do pardon my language.</p>
              <p>p.s. I'm not really patient, I'm just too bored as most of my friends feels about my lenghty posts.</p>
