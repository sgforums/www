              <p><em>I think most guys from SG fulfill this requirement. Correct me
              if I'm wrong. We are not in Rwanda right?</em></p>
              <p>Not. Too many guys here in singapore HAS their mothers dressing them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I think most of the time guys try to be like that, but then
              there are always posuers. I got to hear a story about one recently
              that was very much considered a "man who got no pride". Basically
              he asked for all the money he spent on his ex back after a breakup.
              He even force the lady to go to the atm to withdraw every bit of
              cash she had and left her penniless on the street. Last year, I was
              told by the same lady that he is a fine young gentleman. So to the
              guys out there who got no pride, my word to you is, "Save the act
              for the nymphos who just care if you have a big dick." That is
              definitely no male chivarly.</em></p>
              <p>I think u mistook my meaning of chauvinistic for something else. Mine simply meant proud to be a man, to be proud to be able to do what a man can do and be sure of it.<em><br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Singapore has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in asia. I
              tend to believe that if you are willing to work in SG, you cannot
              go jobless. So why are the ladies still looking?</em></p>
              <p>With respect to this, you must consider the current economy and cost of inflation.</p>
              <p><em>I'm an average drone, so where are the thrifty ladies?</em></p>
              <p>Keep looking. You just havent found them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Again, easier said than done.</em></p>
              <p>Practice. Keeping a planner helps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I think I said it before, skills comes with practice. That does
              not mean that you are a over zealous ape with raging hormones when
              you are out of the bedroom. Tell me who is? I'll alert the zoo.</em></p>
              <p>Not neccessary practice. She could jolly well enjoy herself without you. Its the elements of how you can bring her fully out to enjoy the moment and the outpouring of emotions. Ever wonder why some girls cry during the act itself even though they're enjoying it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Mind games? ok, maybe this point is a bit rusty. But In my point
              of view, you dun treat your woman good when you play mind games
              with her.</em></p>
              <p>Consevative views. Its not mind games but rather a game of catch. Would you play if you're the one being chased forever?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Are you or have you been married? You would wish women would
              understand what you just said about "two different subjects". They
              would not ask you funny questions then.</em></p>
              <p>The main thing IS they all want to hear what they want to hear. But deep in you, you know you can have just as much love for your parents as to that for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I dun know. Can you get a great bod with just thursday night?
              Let me know the routine, the last time I had a great bod, I was
              burning 12 hours in the gym weekly.</em></p>
              <p>Controlled diet + frequent exercising like walking up stairs, getting off buses two stops earlier to walk to your destinations can help. Not to mention you can over tired your body if gyming without the correct form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>That's security you are talking about. But the woman actually
              wants to be independant and live her own life here, without you! So
              what are you doing in the picture?</em></p>
              <p>Thats where you are wrong. The security im talking about is like you're the grassland with fences around you. The girl is the sheep roaming in the grassland.. free to do whatever it likes and still protected to a certain extend. Anyway, I believe in having my own independent life and "inviting" the girl to have a taste of my life by joining me on my activities such as shopping for groceries.</p>

              <p><br> You need to realise that there are many types of woman out there.
              And I can tell you there are probably enough retarded women out
              there for those retarded men.</p>
              <p>If you always asked the same stupid question to the women that
              you've met or known, then of course you would only end up receiving
              stupid answers from them.</p>
              <p>I don't need to ask you I already know those women that you have
              met or known aren't very smart or sensible types. And do note that
              doing well in their educations/careers doesn't means they are smart
              and sensible. One good example would be referenced to MPs and
              Politicians and Businesswomen and Educators.</p>
              <p>I can tell you I will be with a man because I like
              him. There's no such things as what do you look for in a man,
              except if you want to ask such question to add insult to humilation
              to the retarded being that you are conversing actually with. Do you
              enjoy conversing with a retard?</p>
              <p>Liking someone is alot like shopping actually. You can be
              shopping for a certain item, but they comes in different brands and
              packaging and prices. Ultimately you will end up buying the one
              that you really liked, of course there is no
              convincing explainations behind the choice why you ended
              up buying this one instead of the others. That is because you have
              made a subjective choice.</p>
              <p>The keyword to all this should be "The entire package", you like
              something or someone is not because you are able to list out enough
              reasons to like that item or person. It is because you like that
              item or person based on the overall package that combines all the
              good and bad which happens to stir up sufficient comfortable and
              desirable emotions in you to trigger your heart to tell your brain
              that "This is the one I want".</p>
              <p>I'm not surprised that guys like yourself are constantly seeking
              for the reasons behind attractions. But this is only because you
              all don't really have your own personalities or maybe you despised
              your own true real personalities? Guys who can change themselves by
              self-realisation are good, but most guys ended up as fakers who
              need to fake themselves to the death in order to attract the girl
              that they like. But seriously, I am sure even you guys are unable
              to reply why you preferred this girl instead of another.</p>
              <p>And do you know why you are not able to reply this question?
              That is because the question itself is SUBJECTIVE! So there is no
              right or wrong answers to it, only got retarded question produces
              retarded answers from subjectively retarded people.</p>
              <p>My opinions are not debatable as I am absolute. If you cannot
              understand my post, then I can tell you this post will be here long
              enough for you to understand it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Ahh....finally this little discussion here caught your eye. I was wondering how come my favourite women representative is not here. Please take this as a compliment. And no, I'm not trying to be nice here.</p>
              <p>I not sure about other guys. But generally, a MAN knows what he wants. Anyone else would be considered as frills and thrills.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you what I want in a woman.</p>
              <p><em>1) I like a nice butt. Fleshy and tight. Pouting and ready. <br></em></p>
              <p><em>2) A nice tear drop shape for breast is always very attractive to me. Anything beyond a C cup is too much.</em></p>
              <p><em>3) I like long hair. Straight or big curls, I like them both.</em></p>
              <p><em>4) I like a slim waist, anything from 23-28 is acceptable.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>5) Clear flawless skin is a plus regardless of whether she is tanned or fair. It's the smoothness that counts.</em></p>
              <p><em>6) A woman who enjoys a roll in the hay with ME makes my day, any day.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>7) A woman with who can hold long conversations into the night today and still makes me want to conversate more tomorrow night.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>8) A romantic woman who can appreciate romance as it comes, surprise or sunrise.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>9) A loyal woman who sticks to her mate through thick and thin.</em></p>
              <p><em>10) A woman whom I can afford to upkeep her whims and fancy.</em></p>
              <p>Notice there are no buts in my wants? That I have to say is the attribute of a man. WE know what we want. It's just the getting them that is difficult.</p>
              <p>I'm not seeking for the reason behind attraction. I know there are none. It's just like you are asking me why do I like a nice butt but not gigantic breasts. I have no answer to that. My question is really why do woman contradict their own wants?</p>
              <p>It's just like woman wants to be equals as man, but they would not give up labelling a man ungentlemanly should he not open the door for a lady. Can a man say that a lady is unlady like should she not open the door for a man? That would be so unheard of. Woman has already more or less achieve equality in the working environment and at home. But most are still holding on to their petticoats crying "Man is a brute". So how do we achieve equality should this contradiction go on?</p>
              <p>Dun worry about me understanding your post. I believe it is definitely within my humble capability to read it, it is in simple english after all.</p>

              <p><em>I think most guys from SG fulfill this requirement. Correct
              me if I'm wrong. We are not in Rwanda right?</em></p>
              <p>Not. Too many guys here in singapore HAS their mothers dressing
              them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I think most of the time guys try to be like that, but then
              there are always posuers. I got to hear a story about one recently
              that was very much considered a "man who got no pride". Basically
              he asked for all the money he spent on his ex back after a breakup.
              He even force the lady to go to the atm to withdraw every bit of
              cash she had and left her penniless on the street. Last year, I was
              told by the same lady that he is a fine young gentleman. So to the
              guys out there who got no pride, my word to you is, "Save the act
              for the nymphos who just care if you have a big dick." That is
              definitely no male chivarly.</em></p>
              <p>I think u mistook my meaning of chauvinistic for something else.
              Mine simply meant proud to be a man, to be proud to be able to do
              what a man can do and be sure of it.<em><br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Singapore has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in
              asia. I tend to believe that if you are willing to work in SG, you
              cannot go jobless. So why are the ladies still looking?</em></p>
              <p>With respect to this, you must consider the current economy and
              cost of inflation.</p>
              <p><em>I'm an average drone, so where are the thrifty
              ladies?</em></p>
              <p>Keep looking. You just havent found them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Again, easier said than done.</em></p>
              <p>Practice. Keeping a planner helps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I think I said it before, skills comes with practice. That
              does not mean that you are a over zealous ape with raging hormones
              when you are out of the bedroom. Tell me who is? I'll alert the
              zoo.</em></p>
              <p>Not neccessary practice. She could jolly well enjoy herself
              without you. Its the elements of how you can bring her fully out to
              enjoy the moment and the outpouring of emotions. Ever wonder why
              some girls cry during the act itself even though they're enjoying
              it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Mind games? ok, maybe this point is a bit rusty. But In my
              point of view, you dun treat your woman good when you play mind
              games with her.</em></p>
              <p>Consevative views. Its not mind games but rather a game of
              catch. Would you play if you're the one being chased forever?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Are you or have you been married? You would wish women would
              understand what you just said about "two different subjects". They
              would not ask you funny questions then.</em></p>
              <p>The main thing IS they all want to hear what they want to hear.
              But deep in you, you know you can have just as much love for your
              parents as to that for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I dun know. Can you get a great bod with just thursday
              night? Let me know the routine, the last time I had a great bod, I
              was burning 12 hours in the gym weekly.</em></p>
              <p>Controlled diet + frequent exercising like walking up stairs,
              getting off buses two stops earlier to walk to your destinations
              can help. Not to mention you can over tired your body if gyming
              without the correct form.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>That's security you are talking about. But the woman
              actually wants to be independant and live her own life here,
              without you! So what are you doing in the picture?</em></p>
              <p>Thats where you are wrong. The security im talking about is like
              you're the grassland with fences around you. The girl is the sheep
              roaming in the grassland.. free to do whatever it likes and still
              protected to a certain extend. Anyway, I believe in having my own
              independent life and "inviting" the girl to have a taste of my life
              by joining me on my activities such as shopping for groceries.</p>
