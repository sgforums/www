              <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: small;">LET’S BE A BLOGGER</span></p>
              <p>                                                            by <a href="http://oaseditamanhati.multiply.com/">annisa</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you feel your real
              life is so miserable, you perhaps can give a try to live a life as a
              blogger on internet. Why? There are so many good things that you
              impossibly have it in your real life.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do
              you wanna some easy to find proofs? First of all, the facilities on
              internet allow you to keep the person you despise from entering your
              site. If<span>  </span>you <span> </span>happen to despise a certain person on internet, perhaps<span>  </span>the person is so annoying, or always get your nerve, all you have to do just click the word <em>block</em> and the person cannot visit your blog anymore. That’s very simple just
              like snapping your fingers. But in real life, you cannot just send away
              any person you resent just like that. Very often, you have to put up
              with the person you don’t like since there are things that do not allow
              you to escape or, on the other hand, make the person away from your
              life. It’s too bad actually that, in real life, you do not have that
              kind of tool on a sidebar ready to click <span style="font-family: Wingdings;"><span>J</span></span> So… try to be patience to everybody and be nice to everyone....</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: small;">The
              last but not the least, when things tend to get worse because something
              you said, or something you did not mean to offend but someone gets
              hurt, or because you were just broken hearted, or your life romance
              does not work well on internet (since you expected a person on internet
              to be the one), all you have to do just lose you life on internet. It’s
              painless and no hustle. How come? Because all you have to do just
              permanently delete your site by clicking the icon on the tool bar and
              taraaa…. Uncle Google will automatically tell everyone who tries to
              find you that your site does not exist anymore. Case is closed and you
              can start a new life with a new site under new name. What a beautiful
              life, right? <span style="font-family: Wingdings;"><span><img src="http://images.multiply.com/common/smiles/smile.png" alt=""></span></span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">You can start your new life on internet as soon as you feel much better about things you’ve been upset about. <span> </span>You
              can always reincarnate yourself under any other name completed with
              your new home and new concept. That’s definitely the thing you
              impossibly do in your real life since life teaches you to be tough with
              everything you go through. Life also teaches you to be responsible with
              everything you do. Life makes your character mature. Hardship in life
              very often can turn people into wisdom. Life is certainly the best
              teacher ever. As good “teacher”, they will never ground you for good or
              give you rewards all the time. Life will certainly give you ups and
              downs. So…never impulsively grab your bag and leave your “teacher”
              irresponsibly by taking your life just because sometimes in our life
              things are not too favorable to you.. <img src="http://images.multiply.com/common/smiles/wink.png" alt=""></span></p>
