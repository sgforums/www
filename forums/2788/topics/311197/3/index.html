              <p>actually finding your other half is hard, it's not as easy as it seems. applies everywhere. in my view, the people who truly love you for you are, not because of what you have or what you do not have, not because of what you can achieve or that kind of thing. but loving you for who you are is the person you seek for. not focus on the person that you cannot have that kind of thing.</p>

              <p>i think what cat knight meant was that he is looking another
              christian that share his beliefs and his goal in life. he meant no

              <p>Heh, I suspect what the Knight of Cats meant was, for most of the things going wrong in our lives, first blame it on the government. Then blame it on the opposite gender. If all else fails, blame it on the church.</p>
