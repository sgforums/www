              <p>sometimes the church is at fault too la. they can become a holy
              huddle unknowingly. and only nice to their own group of friends. i
              have to actively remind myself not to become that too.</p>

              <p><br>i mean the church might have fault but i would think it starts with one person to change. kinda like the pay it forward that kind of ting.</p>
              <p>but my opinon is that catknight is like blaming ppl in church instead of reflecting on himself first. before you judge other ppl, pls look at urself first if you are too doing the same thing.</p>

              <p>it does not have to be that complicated at all. it's you who want it to be so complicated though. it's ur choice. but ultimately going to church is to worship God. the other things are just secondary.</p>
