              <p>The theory of attractions is very much based on darwinism. It is an age old theory where the alpha male would want to look for the alpha woman to mate with thus producing more alpha babies with the best genes from both side. That was what Hitler tried to do during the world war.</p>
              <p>In olden days, the alpha males were determined by their physical poweress and athletics ability. This is based on the theory of survivability. A man who has such qualities would be one who can hunt better and bring more food home.</p>
              <p>Base on current society context, the alpha male is most of the time firstly determined by his success in his career or potential in his career and then secondly by looks. This is again based on the theory of survivability. A male with a good career is most probably one with some brain matter in him. But make no mistake he could just be a lucky man.</p>
              <p>This is also one reason why geeks and nerds are becoming the new epitome of the alpha male nowadays. They have better earning potential. But this is true till maybe 10 years ago. Women nowadays are very much able to provide for themselves and in some cases even able to provide for their male counterparts. But sadly most men has yet to accept this fact. A women who is still looking for a provider in men would be considered as "conservative" 30 years from now. The modern women tends to look out for an attractive male in this case since the need for a provider is not so important now. This would be the case of genetics working on them without their knowledge. A good looking male would be one where their investments, or "eggs", would be carefully utilized for an alpha offspring.</p>
              <p>Now when it comes to man, like I said we have yet to learn or rather evolved and tend to look out for beautiful women to spread our seeds with. It is actually time to look out for other qualities in a woman when we choose our mate. Characteristics that makes a woman unique from others like intelligence, maturity, motherlyness and of course financial security should be what we need to look out for. These characteristics are actually what would make a good mother for our offsprings to grow up with. They will grow up to be great adults.</p>
              <p>So what should man be doing now? Like I said, the roles are more or less reversed. Earning more money is just not enough nowadays. The women can jolly well do that themselves. Man should start looking good to attract these capable women into their lives. Of course some wit and intelligence would help with communication on their level. So let's not laugh at the "toyboy" next time. They might possibly be the next modern man!</p>

              <p><br>yes, although once i am a engineering student too, but i really don't know what's the scientific term, i only know how to talk in human term,<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Bell curve i have not heard it at all, forgive my ignorance,</p>
              <p>if you say some one is unattractive, compare to someone attractive, i think the guys attractive can attract more gal, but if we are talking about marriage how many girls do we need to attract, i will say not many, and i think those who can attact alot gal, will not have a good marriage, if we are talking about marriage, not extra marital affair.</p>
              <p>God is mercy, just like your mother, not matter how many child she have, she will treat them the same.</p>
              <p>So i guess, fertility, is always the top or second top concern, for women to choose their mate, just like alot guys trying to prove their dick is big, display their fertility conciously or subconciously.</p>
              <p>but i guess, after many of these, as a human what should we compete, is not who have big dick , nuts, it's the meaningfullness and contentment, come to this part i better not to use the word compete,</p>
              <p>self contentment or meaningfullness, is not predetermined, it's really up to each of you.</p>
              <p>And the understanding of life always helping you solve any problem in relationship, or build relationship.</p>
              <p>So i guess Darvinism is not universally true, it have been proved wrong somehow, but i don't know exactly how, again, my ignorance,</p>
              <p>I guess, what you said, probably ignore the importance of spirituality, anyway human is not ape, just attract female by fertility, human have more width and depth than apes,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ps, i never heard of hilter is infuluence by darwinism for committing war crime,i think at least he is more infuluence by machiavellianism,</p>

              <p>i dont understand why most of the guys cant accept gals who r
              fat or chubby?? it's not that they wanted way, i mean they also
              would like to slim down, but everybody got their own problems.. Why
              guys cant accept the inner beauty of chubby gals?? And sometimes
              friends around me, if they see a chubby gal hanging out with a
              handsome guy, holding hands or wat, the way they look at them is
              like "how can it be??" "How can that guy like that fat woman?" "Muz
              be that gal is rich so that guy willing to accpet her!" Why ppl
              have to use this kind thought?? I really doesnt understand~~</p>
