              <p>So why do u care if most guys dun like fat gal?Just aim for those that like fat gals.</p>

              <p>If you are fat urself, would u like a fat guy? If u want to be with guy that go for outer beauty, then dun complain him being shallow. Either u change urself or go for those that would love you the way u are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But please dun be a double standard by expecting someone else to be something which u are not.</p>

              <p>i dont understand why most of the guys cant accept gals who r fat or chubby?? it's not that they wanted way, i mean they also would like to slim down, but everybody got their own problems.. Why guys cant accept the inner beauty of chubby gals?? And sometimes friends around me, if they see a chubby gal hanging out with a handsome guy, holding hands or wat, the way they look at them is like "how can it be??" "How can that guy like that fat woman?" "Muz be that gal is rich so that guy willing to accpet her!" Why ppl have to use this kind thought?? I really doesnt understand~~</p>

              <p><br>Hmm I think most men are looking for sexual relationship in having girlfriend which eventually become their wife and for that reason you also know that being fat is not a very sexy thing. So that's the reason I guess most men avoid fat or ugly girls.</p>
              <p>As for the inner beauty part.....hell most people are not able to tell right away what's inside other people's hearts. So to them all other people are primarily judged by mere outer physical appearance and social status. To put into simple words: Most people are narrow minded and shallow. Most men are being deceived by their senses and the lack of it. That's why the worship of physical attractiveness.</p>

              <p>The thing about inner beauty is that it takes time for people to see it..</p>
              <p>Hypothetically, if I were to put Girl A who is a hot babe (Elisha Cuthbert kinda hot) and Girl B who's lacking in the exterior aspect but a wonderful person... Naturally, people would be attracted to Girl A first...</p>
              <p>It takes roughly 7 seconds for one to form a first impression of somebody, but it takes weeks, months and years for one to have an understanding of the other... See the point now?</p>
              <p>Besides, it's just in our nature to go for the 'most perfect one'... We're animals.. and that's animalistic <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>But it also takes from a few days to a few years to realize that that pretty girl you hang out with is an ugly witch deep inside. lol. Detached was right. It takes time to see and realize inner beauty just as it takes time to see the ugliness inside</p>

              <p>Sooner or later physical attraction will fade and it will boil down to character match. Really.</p>
              <p>There are many pretty attractive girls who are not that attractive anymore once they are engaged in conversation. Lacking grace and brain. And there are some ladies out there who may not look that hot at first but with a poise of a royalty and a brain power to match her grace that leave you with a deep impression.</p>

              <p>And I strongly disagree that human are to be regarded as just another animal.</p>
              <p>Since there are people whose behavior is worse than animal. It's an insult to the animal kingdom to regard those people as animal. The animal kingdom feels strongly objected with being equated with the humankind. Believe me. They almost went to court with their objection. I convinced them otherwise that perhaps the humankind needs another chance to redeem itself to be worthy to be regarded at the very least to be on par with the animal kingdom, their kindship.</p>
