              <p>I'll be moving to Singapore within 2 months for work. I'm originally from India (North India to be specific, I'm not Tamil).

So are Chinese girls in Singapore open to dating Indian men? Is it common to see Indian guy-Chinese girl couples in Singapore?

              If I am race-conscious, caste-conscious - to pretend that I wont be consious of another''s is lying to oneself.
              Only when I do see myself and expereince myself as a human being first and the other appendages( eg I am chinese, I am a professor, I am ... ) as mere utilities to be used and put aside - m i being human.
              
              One can reconcile to the the above and still relate or one can ignore and still relate -the difference is the first is qualitative and the second would seem like one is relating - but one is not, one would probably see another as a means to one's ends. Once the ends are met or fulfilled - the other is no longer of value. In other words, it is mutual benefit scheme.

              <p>Chinese women in Singapore? Arrogant, Overly-Ambitious, Money-Hungry..that's pretty much what i got to say..they think the whole world owes them a living..they make lousy wives and can't cook..still wanna date them?</p>
              <p>The fact that you are North Indian is not gonna help either, to them you are INDIAN..period. Racial discrimination is also another problem, do you really think her family will accept you after all the negativity that exists against Indians? Moreover they tend to have a light skin fetish so your olive skin tone probably won't help..to them anything darker then a sun tan is dirty or unattractive.</p>
              <p>Why don't you just settle for a nice Indian girl? Personally interracial relationships are tricky and won't work..at least in Singapore..</p>
              <p>Take it from me, i'm a local Indian guy, if you still insist on going for a Chinese women, then try this: Simply flaunt your wealth at her..</p>

              <p>Well said man. It's a different story if you're white though. I dont know if it is just me, but I get the impression that oriental women tend to go for white men. And vice versa. Some society we live in....</p>

              <p>It's hard but possible if you're a local Indian. If you're a "new" Indian, it's impossible.</p>
              <p>More to the point, Chinese girls aren't even very nice to Chinese guys, they expect to be princesses and will leave if they're not happy. Relatively few will consider Indian guys, and even fewer will consider Indian guys from India. Someone up there said Chinese girls are full of material expectations- it's true. To find one who goes out with you for who you are and not for your wealth, is even tougher.</p>
