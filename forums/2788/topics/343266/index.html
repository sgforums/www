              <p>When She Say "I Just Want to Be Friends" ... And what do you do
                                          about it?<br> <br> Came across this article on the net....I added some of my own
                                          thoughts to it so this piece of work is not entirely by me. Anyway,
                                          you guys tell me if what I'm sharing is true.<br> <br> I think that probably every guy have more or less been through the
                                          below experience before :<br> <br> 1) Meet girl.<br> <br> 2) Get along well with girl.<br> <br> 3) Feel attracted to girl and think she is attracted to you.<br> <br> 4) Tell girl that you like her (after lotsa alcohol
                                          sometimes).<br> <br> 5) Girl disappears.<br> <br> 6) Call girl 999 times, but still no response.<br> <br> 7) Finally girl turns up and says "I only like you as a friend and
                                          sorry if I hurt you".<br> <br> Ouch! I know it's painful, trust me I just been through it but you
                                          might take comfort knowing that this has happened to me and just
                                          about every guy I know MANY times.<br> <br> Let me try to explaine what's going on here, and hopefully help you
                                          guys and the others reading this to avoid this kind of thing as
                                          much as possible in the future. If it helps that is.<br> <br> From my perspective, there are a few main issues going on here all
                                          at once...<br> <br> 1) Women are complex and often illogical or rather in my own words
                                          contradictary.(So are men, but in different ways)<br> <br> Women act on emotion and intuition more than men. They don't do the
                                          "logical" thing as often as men. Women walk into Starbucks and
                                          order a "fat free" cafe mocha, and then get WHIPPED CREAM on top.
                                          No kidding. I see it all the time...Women will go through a full
                                          closet of clothing trying to choose something to wear to the
                                          supermarket, then conclude that "there's nothing to wear in
                                          here"<br> <br> Again, men have their bizarre behaviors, and I'm not trying to
                                          badmouth women... but from my experience women are usually not very
                                          LOGICAL about things... and they're ESPECIALLY illogical when it
                                          comes to relationships. Men are perfectly logical(Or rather too
                                          logical). They want to have sex with everything and everyone. Women
                                          aren't. They only want to have sex with men who DON'T want to have
                                          sex with them. My point is that you have to put your ideas about
                                          how things "should" be OUT OF YOUR MIND. Start a new way of
                                          thinking about things based on reality and not logic.<br> <br> 2) Women are attracted to men for reasons that most men either
                                          don't know, don't understand, or won't accept.<br> <br> As I like to say, "Attraction Isn't A Choice".<br> <br> We don't think about who we'd like to feel attraction for, it just
                                          happens on it's own in most cases. But the thing to remember is
                                          that attraction has a pattern. It's like a combination lock or a
                                          puzzle. There is a way to create it if you know the "recipe". On
                                          the other hand, if you DON'T know the recipe, then you're not
                                          likely to figure it out by trial and error. And the reason for this
                                          again is because IT'S NOT LOGICAL.<br> <br> While men are attracted mostly to looks, women are attracted mostly
                                          to character. In the above situation, we displayed the personality
                                          trait that I refer to as wussy a little too early in the game.
                                          Women generally aren't attracted to men who get too lovey-dovey and
                                          emotional too quickly. There's no mystery or challenge when you
                                          fall in love immediately. And when you call like 31 times a day, it
                                          only makes the problem worse. What you need to do in these
                                          situations is to sit back more and give her some space. Give her
                                          room to think about you and miss you. I know it works...trust
                                          me.<br> <br> 3) The way that women communicate isn't always as "direct and
                                          straightforward" as most of us guys would like.<br> <br> If a woman wants to tell you that she isn't interested in you in a
                                          romantic way, she'll often NOT tell you as her way of telling you.
                                          In other words, she might just disappear for awhile. Or she might
                                          not return calls quickly. Or she might talk about other guys with
                                          you...basically, again you have to put the concept of pure,
                                          rational logic out of your mind when it comes to the world of
                                          attraction.<br> <br> Women are subtle. They read into things and try to tell you things
                                          indirectly. Women don't generally take what you say at face value.
                                          They want to know what everything REALLY means.<br> <br> If you meet a girl, and after the first date you say "I really like
                                          you, you're beautiful and I have feelings for you" they think you
                                          said "I'm a Wuss because I fall in love too quickly". On the other
                                          hand, if you say "Good night, give me a call sometime" she'll think
                                          you said "You were kind of boring, and if you want to talk to me
                                          again you're going to have to call me".<br> <br> There is no exact thing to say, but just think like a woman before
                                          you say it out. At least you try to get most of the grounds
                                          covered. It helps A LOT.<br> <br> 4) It's difficult to un-do one of these situations once it has
                                          reached this point.<br> <br> Unfortunately, once a woman has "made up her mind" about a guy,
                                          it's usually VERY difficult to change that mind.<br> <br> If you're in a situation like this where a woman has said "I only
                                          like you as a friend", then you're best off going out and meeting
                                          some other women, and getting on with your life immdediately! I
                                          did. Don't wait. Get on with it.<br> <br> If you disappear from her life, then turn up a month or two
                                          later... and you're dating a few other attractive women... she
                                          might see you in a new light.<br> <br> Jealousy is a very powerful motivator to women, and this is often
                                          what it takes to get a woman to see you in a new light once you've
                                          let out your wussy self too early in the game.<br> <br> Don't try to un-do it. Just get on with your life and quit
                                          obsessing over her. Even if you can't help yourself, dun let her
                                          know. duh!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Totally agree. SO many girls have sex with guys even though they are not bf/gf, or even when they have a BF already they still go ahead and have sex with other guys. Society is changing now. Get a grip guys. Girls are also having multiple sex partners outside. No surprise. Haha.</p></div>
