              <p>When She Say "I Just Want to Be Friends" ... And what do you do
              about it?<br> <br> Came across this article on the net....I added some of my own
              thoughts to it so this piece of work is not entirely by me. Anyway,
              you guys tell me if what I'm sharing is true.<br> <br> I think that probably every guy have more or less been through the
              below experience before :<br> <br> 1) Meet girl.<br> <br> 2) Get along well with girl.<br> <br> 3) Feel attracted to girl and think she is attracted to you.<br> <br> 4) Tell girl that you like her (after lotsa alcohol
              sometimes).<br> <br> 5) Girl disappears.<br> <br> 6) Call girl 999 times, but still no response.<br> <br> 7) Finally girl turns up and says "I only like you as a friend and
              sorry if I hurt you".<br> <br> Ouch! I know it's painful, trust me I just been through it but you
              might take comfort knowing that this has happened to me and just
              about every guy I know MANY times.<br> <br> Let me try to explaine what's going on here, and hopefully help you
              guys and the others reading this to avoid this kind of thing as
              much as possible in the future. If it helps that is.<br> <br> From my perspective, there are a few main issues going on here all
              at once...<br> <br> 1) Women are complex and often illogical or rather in my own words
              contradictary.(So are men, but in different ways)<br> <br> Women act on emotion and intuition more than men. They don't do the
              "logical" thing as often as men. Women walk into Starbucks and
              order a "fat free" cafe mocha, and then get WHIPPED CREAM on top.
              No kidding. I see it all the time...Women will go through a full
              closet of clothing trying to choose something to wear to the
              supermarket, then conclude that "there's nothing to wear in
              here"<br> <br> Again, men have their bizarre behaviors, and I'm not trying to
              badmouth women... but from my experience women are usually not very
              LOGICAL about things... and they're ESPECIALLY illogical when it
              comes to relationships. Men are perfectly logical(Or rather too
              logical). They want to have sex with everything and everyone. Women
              aren't. They only want to have sex with men who DON'T want to have
              sex with them. My point is that you have to put your ideas about
              how things "should" be OUT OF YOUR MIND. Start a new way of
              thinking about things based on reality and not logic.<br> <br> 2) Women are attracted to men for reasons that most men either
              don't know, don't understand, or won't accept.<br> <br> As I like to say, "Attraction Isn't A Choice".<br> <br> We don't think about who we'd like to feel attraction for, it just
              happens on it's own in most cases. But the thing to remember is
              that attraction has a pattern. It's like a combination lock or a
              puzzle. There is a way to create it if you know the "recipe". On
              the other hand, if you DON'T know the recipe, then you're not
              likely to figure it out by trial and error. And the reason for this
              again is because IT'S NOT LOGICAL.<br> <br> While men are attracted mostly to looks, women are attracted mostly
              to character. In the above situation, we displayed the personality
              trait that I refer to as wussy a little too early in the game.
              Women generally aren't attracted to men who get too lovey-dovey and
              emotional too quickly. There's no mystery or challenge when you
              fall in love immediately. And when you call like 31 times a day, it
              only makes the problem worse. What you need to do in these
              situations is to sit back more and give her some space. Give her
              room to think about you and miss you. I know it works...trust
              me.<br> <br> 3) The way that women communicate isn't always as "direct and
              straightforward" as most of us guys would like.<br> <br> If a woman wants to tell you that she isn't interested in you in a
              romantic way, she'll often NOT tell you as her way of telling you.
              In other words, she might just disappear for awhile. Or she might
              not return calls quickly. Or she might talk about other guys with
              you...basically, again you have to put the concept of pure,
              rational logic out of your mind when it comes to the world of
              attraction.<br> <br> Women are subtle. They read into things and try to tell you things
              indirectly. Women don't generally take what you say at face value.
              They want to know what everything REALLY means.<br> <br> If you meet a girl, and after the first date you say "I really like
              you, you're beautiful and I have feelings for you" they think you
              said "I'm a Wuss because I fall in love too quickly". On the other
              hand, if you say "Good night, give me a call sometime" she'll think
              you said "You were kind of boring, and if you want to talk to me
              again you're going to have to call me".<br> <br> There is no exact thing to say, but just think like a woman before
              you say it out. At least you try to get most of the grounds
              covered. It helps A LOT.<br> <br> 4) It's difficult to un-do one of these situations once it has
              reached this point.<br> <br> Unfortunately, once a woman has "made up her mind" about a guy,
              it's usually VERY difficult to change that mind.<br> <br> If you're in a situation like this where a woman has said "I only
              like you as a friend", then you're best off going out and meeting
              some other women, and getting on with your life immdediately! I
              did. Don't wait. Get on with it.<br> <br> If you disappear from her life, then turn up a month or two
              later... and you're dating a few other attractive women... she
              might see you in a new light.<br> <br> Jealousy is a very powerful motivator to women, and this is often
              what it takes to get a woman to see you in a new light once you've
              let out your wussy self too early in the game.<br> <br> Don't try to un-do it. Just get on with your life and quit
              obsessing over her. Even if you can't help yourself, dun let her
              know. duh!</p>
