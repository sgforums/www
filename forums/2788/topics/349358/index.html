              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I need some opinions.. i had this argument with a girl that i was very close to last weekend. She's never been the best kind of girl to me, in the sense that she's quite aloof and she doesnt show it eventhough she says that she likes me and is willing to try things out.</p>
              <p>Shes claims that she finds it hard to express herself with me and yet she tells me she has alot of other commitments and that she has ALOT of friends around her.</p>
              <p>I got pissed off cause she eventhough ive been trying to voice out my concern about her not being responsive enough to me, she still didnt respond and she could still do things like answer phone calls and smses while i was already quite emotional that night!!!</p>
              <p>The next few days i realised i was wrong for throwing my temper and i tried alot to call her n everything but until now she has not replied or called me back.</p>
              <p>What should i do ???</p>

              <p>If she's not your girlfriend then u can't expect her to response to your every call or sms. Even if she's your girlfriend, she has her life to live. She's not your maid or salve that have to be around upon your calling.</p>
              <p>There are many ways to show concerns and even if you show, not everyone needs to appreciate. Perhaps you should show to someone who's more appreciative of your concerns?</p>

              <p>aiya.. girls are hard to please, but impress by pleasing them. u will stand out from others.</p>
              <p>its ok for her to socialise i guess. she has her own life as well. u too can socialise more like her. its ok to socialise and commit to a relationship concurrently.</p>
              <p>but if u really need some1 that really cares for u and be there for u as and when u want. maybe she isnt the 1 u looking for.</p>

                              <p>Well we'r both in our lower 20s .. n i knew her for very very
              long.. years</p>
              <p>n we had something going on a few yrs ago but i didnt pursue n
              she gave up on me..</p>
              <p>i went back to her recently and he had alot of good things going
              but its just that i felt she was not responding as much eventho she
              said she'd try</p>
              <p>i think ur right, maybe im asking for too much ..but its been
              days and ive decided to give myself and her some space.. i dont
              know if she'll talk to me again now .. she might even have given up
              on this =(</p>
