              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How many of these women have you dated?<br> <br> 1)</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">CRY-BABY</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HER MOTTO: “Waaaa!”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Trap: She makes you feel so guilty that you make promises you can’t keep just to stop her</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">crying. She knows the power of tears. Unfortunately, so do you.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Solution: Wait her out. They are only tears, not bullets. Let her wail all she wants, you’re</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">there while she’s wearing herself out. Being compassionate means being there for her, not caving</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">in to what she wants. Making promises you can’t keep doesn’t make you a better man.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Being yourself, even if she disapproves, and still being there for her is strong, manly stuff.<br> <br> 2)</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">OLD YELLER</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HER MOTTO: “Fuck you!”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Trap: You live in fear of her rages. Or, you shout back and have useless fights with her.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Solution: Don’t fight back. Don’t feed the fire. Understand what she’s saying. Tell her</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">you see she is angry. Slow things down. Make specific requests of her – pin her down on one</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">thing at a time and make specific small promises you can keep.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3)THE ILLOGICAL MANIPULATOR</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HER MOTTO: “I’ll be irrational and drive you nuts, then accuse you of</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">being irrational and therefore WRONG.”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Trap: You argue with her crazy, illogical arguments, then to go insane—which she then</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">uses as proof that you must be wrong.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Solution: She needs to be right, so tell her when she’s right—even if it kills you.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Arguing with her point-for-point is useless; she isn’t logical. She uses what she calls ‘logic’</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">to wear you down. Her goal? To make you flip out or give up. Admit that you are irrational</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">by saying, “Sorry, but that’s just the way I feel.” That gets you out of her accusation that you</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">are ‘irrational.’ Keep staying with what you want; keep the mantra, “This is the way I feel,</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">what can we do about it?” Eventually she’ll calm down. But logic and rationality never works</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">here – only clear, simple persistence. She needs to be right and in control. Give her that as</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">much as you can while maintaining clarity about what you want.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> 4)</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">THE SHAMING FEMINIST</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HER MOTTO: “This is what men have been doing to women for thousands</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">of years!”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Trap: You’ll feel guilty and ashamed about being a guy, and do whatever she wants to get</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">her to back off.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Solution: Refuse to feel ashamed of what other men might have done to other women.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Be proud of being a man. Remember how noble men are. Don’t argue on her terms—keep</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">bringing the conversation back to specific events between the two of you – not some historical</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">smorgasbord of male crimes that you had nothing to do with.<br> <br> 5)</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">THE VICTIM</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HER MOTTO: “You just don’t understand how hard it is to be me!”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Trap: She whines more than is humanly possible. She can’t see that she is totally committed</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">to being helpless. You try to help and suddenly you ‘don’t understand’ and ‘aren’t on her</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">side’. After all, the universe is against her.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Solution: Don’t try to fix her problems. Let her learn her own lessons and realize that</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">there is nothing you can do to make her handle things ‘the right way’, which is how you</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">would handle them.<br> <br> 6)</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">THE BEDTIME BRAWLER</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HER MOTTO: “Are you asleep? There’s something we need to talk</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">about...[fill in the blank]”</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Trap: Ending up in a horrible, middle-of-the-night fight.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Solution: Listen without fixing. Apologize if appropriate. Put her off ‘til later. Give in</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">on small stuff. Make promises you can keep. Show “emotional vulnerability,” and ask to be</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">held without talking.<br><br></span><a href="http://www.askmen.com/dating/curtsmith_100/114_dating_advice.html"><strong>12 Types Of Women To Avoid</strong></a></p>
              <div style="display: inline; cursor: pointer; padding-right: 16px; width: 16px; height: 16px;"> </div>
              <p><br> <br> <strong>1- Miss Feminist</strong><br> This woman postulates that all the ills of society are orchestrated by men and the best<br> thing a man can do to improve himself is cut off his testicles and grow a pair of ovaries.<br> She believes that women are angelic creatures who would make the world a utopia if only the<br> male "patriarchy" would allow them to. Any woman who promotes these absurdities lives in a<br> fantasy world and will have no problem at all treating a man in a way that she would never<br> herself abide by. You can easily identify her by her incessant mantra,<br> "All men think with their penises." Avoid her at all costs. <br> <strong>2- Miss Take </strong><br> She's out for your money — pure and simple. Miss Take is the ultimate in high<br> maintenance. She expects a man to finance her entire life just because she is biologically<br> female. To her, a man should pay for drinks, dinners, trips, flowers, and jewelry, while she<br> feels absolutely no guilt or compulsion to reciprocate.<br> She is nothing but a whitewashed prostitute. Miss Take thinks her vagina is plated with gold and<br> is worth a million dollars. She is greed personified. Since she has no concept of someone<br> else's feelings, her only interest is in getting what she wants.<br> And don't be fooled — some apparently very "nice" girls are the greediest of them all.<br> <strong>3- Miss Romance </strong><br> This type of woman lives in a fantasy world of Lifetime Channel movies
              and romance novels. Every night she goes home alone to spend hours
              flipping through her bride magazines, imagining that, at any moment,
              Prince Charming will ride up on his white horse, sweep her off her
              feet, and offer her a problem-free existence for the rest of her life.
              The Miss Romances of the world have been coddled by parents and family,
              told they are "princesses," and have absolutely no idea that real life
              consists of paying bills and cleaning toilets. Miss Romance will expect
              to be taken care of, will be a dud in bed, and will, almost overnight,
              turn into a shrieking nag. Run.<br> <strong>4- Miss Elusive </strong><br> This woman is closely allied to Miss Romance, but with a dark side. She
              is usually one of the "walking wounded" — someone who has been hurt in
              past relationships and so subconsciously avoids or sabotages new
              relationships in the present. Your association with her will be one of
              utter frustration, as first she shows great interest in you, but very
              quickly runs away — then repeats this cycle over and over again. Miss
              Elusive is the queen of mixed messages. She will flirt with you and
              date you, but you'll never get past "friend" status. What you will get
              is a million excuses for her unavailability, all calculated to deceive
              herself that she just doesn't have time for a relationship. Save
              yourself some heartache — don't get involved with her.<br> <strong>5- Miss Angry </strong><br> Like Miss Feminists, Miss Angrys really don't like men. They scorn the
              male gender and can rattle off all the wrongs and misdeeds of every man
              they've ever encountered. To Miss Angry, there's no such thing as a
              nice guy — they're all "jerks," "creeps" and "pigs." Many of them have
              lots of simmering anger at men, which can explode at any moment like an
              erupting volcano. Unless you're into lots of drama and screaming, stay
              away.<br> <strong>6- Miss Insecure </strong><br> This woman seems great at the start because she's very nice,
              accommodating and treats men well. But her inner insecurities don't
              take long to surface. Pretty soon she's calling you 10 times a day,
              asking to see "where the relationship is going," or because she "just
              wants to hear your voice." She needs constant reassurance that she's
              attractive, and worries incessantly about her makeup, hair and the
              alignment of her clothes. She's clingy, needy and compulsively agonizes
              that you're going to leave her at any moment for "someone better." This
              kind of thing can get really creepy really fast.<br> <strong>7- Miss Bitch </strong><br> Miss Bitches are the sulkers, pouters and ball-busters of the female
              world. They are very unpleasant people who treat their fellow humans
              poorly, care only about themselves, and aren't concerned at all if they
              hurt you or anybody else. Most Miss Bitches qualify as Miss Takes, too.
              Miss Bitches are usually good-looking and well dressed, and you can
              easily identify them by the scowls on their faces as they imperiously
              strut through the world.<br> <strong>8- Miss Me </strong><br> A close relative of Miss Bitch, Miss Me is entirely focused on herself.
              Miss Me needs to be the constant center of attention no matter what she
              does or where she goes. She is a selfish, self-indulgent, self-serving
              narcissist who was raised as "daddy's little girl," and expects the
              same from you. Unless you enjoy the company of spoiled brats, stay far,
              far away.<br> <strong><br> 9- Miss Desperate </strong><br> Whether it's her baby clock ticking or she's the last of her
              girlfriends to trap a man, Miss Desperate wants to get married — now.
              She doesn't care who the guy is or what he does — as long as he's got a
              penis she can drag him to the altar. Watch out for this one!<br> <strong>10- Miss Turncoat </strong><br> She's a conniving little piece of work who's an expert at conning men.
              Miss Turncoat will tell you exactly what you want to hear until you're
              hooked deep into the relationship (or married)… and then the truth
              comes out. Overnight, your sweet little girl turns into a demanding,
              greedy, mercenary harpy who will browbeat you into submission if she
              doesn't get her way.<br> <strong>11- Miss Tease </strong><br> Usually, you can spot Miss Teases a mile away because she flirts with
              anything in pants and flaunt her sexuality at every opportunity.
              Sometimes she sponges off older men; sometimes she's a ball-buster who
              enjoys getting men sexually excited and then walking away; and
              sometimes she just basks in her sexual power by attracting men like
              bees to honey. No matter how she operates, you can't trust her because
              she craves male attention and if somebody better comes along, she'll
              dump you in a heartbeat.<br> <strong>12- Miss Controlling </strong><br> She is a subtly nasty one who will wind up directing every phase of
              your life. She will tell you what to wear, where to go, who to talk to,
              what friends you can have, what you can eat — everything. And if you
              try to stand up for yourself, she will cut off sex, cry, scream, pout,
              or use any other deceptive female tactic until you give in and succumb
              to her demands.</p>
