            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from a mail, read on and enjoy.... I might get flame by ger from this, but well that is life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>This was written by a guy... it's pretty damn smart.<br><br>I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.<br><br>FOR EXAMPLE:<br><br>One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.<br><br>Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, "I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me."<br><br>I said, "WHAT??!! What was that?!"<br><br>So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...<br><br>"You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man."<br><br>She responded to my puzzled look by saying, "Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?"<br><br>Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.<br><br>The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one  to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, "Lets get a pair for each outfit."<br><br>We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.<br><br>I think I threw her for a loop when I said, "That's fine, honey." She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.<br>Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, "I think this is  all dear, let's go to the cashier."<br><br>I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No honey, I don't feel like it."<br><br>Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, "WHAT?"<br><br>I then said, "Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me  to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman."<br><br>And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added,"Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I  buy you?"<br><br>Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either....but at least that bitch knows I'm smarter than her.<br><br>Alright girls. Forward this on if you agree. Hell even if you<br>disagree,forward it on.<br><br>Men, forward this on this because you have balls.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Guy in general have a high sexual need then most women. That don't mean that having sex automatically fall into a guys NEED only. People have sex for different reason, but couple at it tend to be a result of love and you highly penalise guys when u classify it as their need only. I understand everyone have their need, but to exchange a free shopping pass for something that you should do in the name of love put sex no different from those attained in Geyland. But if it is a emotional deficiency on the guy parts, it is totally different. Hence, guy should never even attempt at being a saleman in the bedroom. It is degrading for both gender. Sweet talk on the other hand is more of a foreplay.</div>

It has more to do with the need of a guy and that of a women. Guy in general have a high sexual need then most women. That don't mean that having sex automatically fall into a guys NEED only. People have sex for different reason, but couple at it tend to be a result of love and you highly penalise guys when u classify it as their need.

Something which most guy do and it isnt hard to understand where that is coming from.<br><br></div>
