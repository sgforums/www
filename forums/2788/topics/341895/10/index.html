              <p>well</p>
              <p>what so nice about smoking....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i smoke for like 10 years, and finally now i stopped</p>
              <p>it expensive, not good for health n u smoke more u have headache.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i started with marlboro menthol light, then change to marlboro light, then to marlboro red. </p>
              <p>then last few year, become very heavy smoker, 1 day can smoke 1 pack of red at some stage.</p>
              <p>then i got some thoughts of stopping, then i went to smoke light. Then after that, there a ultra light come out, so i switch to that.</p>
              <p>that was crazy, i can smoke 2-3 stick of ultra light continously. lol</p>
              <p>then... after a while, few month back, i quit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dunno why i can do it also, by the way i smoke, i shuold not be able to quit, as alot of pple say i m super heavy smoker. ha</p>
              <p>guess it my will power n determination</p>
              <p>but somehow i manage to jus stop</p>
              <p>inititally is tough, i do have craving to smoke, sometime i still go n buy. but now ok already, few month without smoke le</p>
              <p>totally no smoke in a few month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those want to quit, jus stop, dun smoke</p>
              <p>ur will power must be strong n determined (determine not to smoke, not determine to take a cigar when being offered! ha)</p>
              <p>dun drink also if u r a drinker also, as somehow drinking can influence ur mind to get a smoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>take up some sports/or activities. For me i went back to swimming reguarly, and also do some other sports.</p>
              <p>Try to mix more with frenz who dun smoke, or made new frenz who dun smoke n mix with them. It can help u also, reduce peer pressure. buy some sweets n put in ur pocket/bag, it might help u when u wan to smoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is roughly what i do</p>
              <p>but it may not work for some pple, it all depend on urlsef</p>
              <p>find urself the best method to help u quit if u want</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, if u chose to carry on smoke, then go ahead.</p>
              <p>it ur life and money :D</p>

              <p>I post my first comment (or rather first thoughts) when i saw the topic</p>
              <p>Then i reliase there some pple here who actually wan to quit, but find it hard</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something which i never mention in my first post, i try quitting alot of time during my 10 years of smoking, but always i stop like 1-2 week (the max) i m back again........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but this time round, i guess i can finally stop. cos it few month le since i last tough a cigar...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No reason to quit smoking is not a reason.</p>
              <p>it a lame excuse just because u dun wan to try or u have no intention to stop at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Smoking keep u awake is another lame reason (which i been telling myself this since i smoke, lol)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>smoking made u look cool is a damn damn childish reason, lol, only ah beng/lian can say tat haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who really determine to stop.... my advise, jus stop</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>throw all ur lighter away, avoid shop selling cigar (if ur will power not tat strong)</p>
              <p>if u wan train ur will power, stay with frenz who smoke, then when they smoke, u dun smoke. stay with them, and train ur will power not to give in. (this is wat i do before also, as my colleague, customer are mostly smoker :(  )</p>
              <p>ermm</p>
              <p>maybe another reason force me stop is medical problem, i went for a check up cos i feel bad during my RT, and found out i have hypertension, and heavy smoking is one of the possible reason of cause according to doctor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>mix more with friend who dun smoke (like i mention in my previous post)  Try not to be alone, as normally when alone, u tend to crave for smoke (my experience).  If got gf/bf who dun smoke, they can be ur motivation to stop smoking.  Nobody would like their partner to smoke.  It stink really. smoker dun feel so, but non-smoker know it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and also, think of the money u cna save</p>
              <p>about 1 week no smoke, u will see the difference in ur money.</p>
              <p>if u endure for 1 month, u should be able to stop already</p>
              <p>initially is tough, really very tough, i been though it, so i know.</p>
              <p>the day are hard to pass without smoking.</p>
              <p>but when u get use to it, everything will become normal.</p>
              <p>and u will find everything is the same again, except that u no longer smoke</p>
              <p>some pple who can endure for 1 week will be able to stop, some need longer time</p>
              <p>as long as u can endure for 2-3 day without smoke, u should be able to stop smoking.</p>
              <p>drink more water, eat sweet, if u have craving, eating some dim sum, snack, etc might help.</p>
              <p>try not to drink beer</p>
              <p>if u wish to, might want to try stop coffee/tea also.  For me i cannot go without coffee, but i manage to stop smoking without stopping coffee, some pple might not be able to do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>try not to talk about smoking in any conversation, it might help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for those need help or need more advice, i dun mind helping u if i can.</p>
              <p>U can msn me <a href="mailto:hee_hee81@hotmail.com">hee_hee81@hotmail.com</a> or email <a href="mailto:chester17_sg@yahoo.com">chester17_sg@yahoo.com</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am not a professional consultant or doctor or advisor, but i can share with u my experience and hope it can help u to stop smoking</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, if u decide to carry on, then carry on ba, it ur money n life :P</p>

              <p>i started with marlboro menthol light, then change to marlboro
              light, then to marlboro red. </p>
              <p>then last few year, become very heavy smoker, 1 day can smoke 1
              pack of red at some stage.</p>
              <p>then i got some thoughts of stopping, then i went to smoke
              light. Then after that, there a ultra light come out, so i switch
              to that.</p>
              <p>that was crazy, i can smoke 2-3 stick of ultra light
              continously. lol</p>
              <p>then... after a while, few month back, i quit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dunno why i can do it also, by the way i smoke, i shuold not be
              able to quit, as alot of pple say i m super heavy smoker. ha</p>
              <p>guess it my will power n determination</p>
              <p>but somehow i manage to jus stop</p>
              <p>inititally is tough, i do have craving to smoke, sometime i
              still go n buy. but now ok already, few month without smoke le</p>
              <p>totally no smoke in a few month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those want to quit, jus stop, dun smoke</p>
              <p>ur will power must be strong n determined (determine not to
              smoke, not determine to take a cigar when being offered! ha)</p>
              <p>dun drink also if u r a drinker also, as somehow drinking can
              influence ur mind to get a smoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>take up some sports/or activities. For me i went back to
              swimming reguarly, and also do some other sports.</p>
              <p>Try to mix more with frenz who dun smoke, or made new frenz
              who dun smoke n mix with them. It can help u also, reduce peer
              pressure. buy some sweets n put in ur pocket/bag, it might
              help u when u wan to smoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is roughly what i do</p>
              <p>but it may not work for some pple, it all depend on urlsef</p>
              <p>find urself the best method to help u quit if u want</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, if u chose to carry on smoke, then go ahead.</p>
              <p>it ur life and money :D</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>A great piece by an ex smoker!<br><br>My 1st ever puff was a marlboro red.<br><br>When i started smoking, it was viceroymenthollights.<br><br>Been smoking for 4 years, and im on my route to snubbing it out for good!<br><br>Haven had a puff for 25 days, and im not gonna waste the effort that easily!<br><br>And again, smoking is a choice. Everyone can and should smoke if they realli want too but keep in mind the effects of it. I understand as a smoker/exsmoker myself.<br><br>P.S.  Smoking in an expensive habit. Only smoke if u can afford it. Its fucking irritating if u cant afford the sticks, and have to go around buying a single stick, or even asking for one for free. So, only smoke if u have the means. . . don be a freaking pest.</p>

              <p>Consulate Menthol. It has reds type of filter but is a menthol cigarette. It's made by british american tobacco( same tt makes viceroy,dunhill) and is expensive at 11.60 per pk.But its the best cig I had in singapore, I get bored of most cigarettes after 1 pack(no kidding, I finish one pack and feel like trying something else) but I've manage to stick with consulate for quite a while.  Try it, is worth a shot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, who knows where to get Lucky Strike and Kool in singapore? I'm trying to find but cannot. I remember when in 2005 in my p6 i see it at 7-11 but I havent smoke yet. Then when i start smoke it's gone</p>
