            <div class='col-md body'>i think the bad habits of the guy and stuff will affect the relationship to a certain extent, but for me i think if the relationship is to be permanent, meaning marriage and stuff, we really have to be practical..<br><br>if the guy doesn't want to study anymore, he has gotta make sure he can earn enuf to support a family..<br><br>and back to TS qn, if we're toking abt can they be happily together for the 1st few yrs, without financial factors, it will be more of the girls' parents' views abt the guy, and family pressure really can really be tough.. sad to say, but the guy shud give up what the society deems as bad habits and appease the parents, if he wants the girl to have less stress from the parents..<br><br>but if its long-term marriage kind, then, again, financial problems comes in.. love is blind and stuff yes.. but love needs to be practical too.. if the guy can support the girl and stuff with his current education level and job income, then there's no problem, but if the guy cant do that and yet he is unwilling to learn new skills and  do the appropriate stuff to earn money, it's not long b4 the r/s breaks down due to practical issues..<br><br>that's my two cents.. good luck..</div>

It only matters when you're well past your 20s and moving into the serious dating / commitment phase. Even then, I know of well educated female colleagues (UCLA grads etc) moving around pubs and hitting home way past midnight and they are far from epitome of badness.<br><br>At the same time, few of the most driven people (locals and ang mohs) I've met are those who cannot spell / speak proper English, but manage more than a decent foothold in my line of work. I don't think education, PSLE or O level aggregates determine how successful you can become, gLC. In my humble opinion, it's mostly discipline and luck.<br><br>The education you receive and places you choose to pursue your studies may influence your social circle - they may fashion your social life as you get older but they don't determine romantic compatibility and we're in the 21st century.<br><br>Unless your girl is born of royal blood or related to the Queen, just hang out with her, laugh a lot and take it easy because I think you're only 18.<br></div>
