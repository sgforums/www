              <p>Just like my username, socky. I'm now 21 years old and now I'm beginning to experience of what most adults happily and painfully went through..... friends, enemies, hatred, love etc. Lets start with my workplace. Back in the day when i'm newly entered this workplace, I could not wait to get out of it but i have to stay due to my contract so i can't run away. My seniors in that place bully me and of course, i saw it coming being a junior and all. Let me alone in the dark, disturb when i'm sleeping etc but as time goes by they are becoming more and more like a friend or should i say brother to me. Reason they did all these because to them, it makes us "closer" in friendship. I just reluctanly agreed. Days and days and days went by, one by one my friends left the workplace because of their contract has been done. It brings sadness yet happiness to me when they left knowing that they are now free and open minded of what they planning to do. My closest ones are "johnny" and "young" in that workplace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These friends of mine who under contract are the ones that I'm working with side by side, lets call these people "orders". There are also another group of the rest of my colleagues that are working with me but not as "side by side"..... they are more of an assistant to us. Lets call these whole group as "watchers. These people in watchers are quite a number of them working. The orders are like only a few of us working... between 10-14? sometimes less. Honestly speaking, i am closer to watchers than to orders... well some of them by the way. You see, last year.... watchers are divided into two different companies but their roles are still the same. To make it short, call them group A and group B. I'm more fond of the people in Group B because they are fun to talk to. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But as times goes by, Some disagreement with their agencies and Group B will be no longer in workplace. I was totally bumped out. I made some cheery friends in Group A but not as much as Group B. Since they be leaving, lots of newcomers will be coming to take over their place and now the entire Group A working with us. There are one of the people in watchers that kinda catch my eye during that time..... she's working in Group A but i didn't talk to her.... not until Group B left the building then i have became so bored so i called up her through my workplace phone. She is rather fun to talk to.... not just looks. We talked and talked till my senior comes by so i have to stop since i don't want to raise any suspicioun. One thing i really enjoy talking to her is that when we communicate, we both dont have feelings towards each other. I know she dont have any feelings towards me... same goes for me. Through my vision, most girls when you spent your time talking majority of the time, she will have a feeling that you liked her. But this girl is different. So i talked to her most of the time until ..... another batch... a new batch came then things in that environment gone... fun but awkward.</p>
