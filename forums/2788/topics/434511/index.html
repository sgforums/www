              <p>Hi, I am not sure where to post this topic but I guess it is ok to post it here. Anyway, I notice sometimes, some girls who are stranger to me and the same 
              class/school as me, they would look at me with this expression but with their 
              eye spread a bit wider when I look up at them and meet eye contact:<br> <br> http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af143/devilgenemugen/girlsface.jpg<br> <br> I am not sure why does they look at me like this, I have check myself 
              that there aren't anything wrong with my look, my face (if there are any
               dirt), my dressing and the way I present, there are nothing wrong with 
              it. I find it weird.</p>
              <p>Recently in my class, there is this girl. I 
              am studying part 
              time course and is the same class as her in two lessons only. When she 
              arrive in class, I look at who is that coming to the class, she look at 
              me with that facial expression as shown in the photo. I look away so as 
              she. In the next subject lesson, she suddenly arrive which she did not 
              come before and I think she change her class and is a surprise that I am
               the same class as her. When she
               arrived, she keep on looking at me since there are one or two students 
              (all male) are the same class in the other subject as me and that girl, 
              she did not look at 
              them but only me. I find it odd and did not bother that much. The next 
              lesson, she seats in front of me, she turn behind and pass the 
              attendance book to me and look straight in my face with eye contact, she
               give me the same facial expression as shown in the photo. I look into 
              her face as well and smile, she did not smile back and when I take the 
              attendance book, she look in front.</p>
              <p>I look in the mirror and use 
              the 
              same smile that I smile to her, it is natural and perfectly normal. I 
              wonder what is wrong. Since then, every lessons when she arrived into 
              the class, she would look at me first and then she seat to her seat. 
              Last week I was having lesson with her, I did not look at her, she just 
              look at me a little and did not look at me often so I guess maybe I am 
              just imagine things or maybe I look at her often so she look back. When 
              it is time to go home, She was walking behind me. After I have walk a 
              few metres, I look behind and see if there are any bicycle passing 
              towards me, I caught her standing there looking at me and she quickly 
              look away. This look has been carrying all over the place whenever I go,
               if it is a normal look, then it is odd.</p>

              <p>You are a really interesting person....<br><br>Based on the reply, like what you've said, you think she's interested in you and da da da da da. <br><br>The truth is, you have your own set of insights into this already which is the girl is interested in you, thats why base on one reply you know she is interested.<br><br>But you're unsure because she treats other guys quite nice and has more real interaction than you.......<br><br>So why post in a forum when you are looking for affirmation to your insights, or trying to convince yourself that you are correct...?<br><br><br><br>You think too much. You like her go talk to her but if she shows disinterest, means she is not interested..  </p>
              <p>anyway i think she stare at you because she knows you are looking at her lol</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p> yeah, you are right, I think I am thinking alots too but I will try to find a chance to talk to her and see how things goes. Yesterday I was having lesson with her and as normal, I seat behind her. I saw her dressing was unusual, she wores a cloth looks like singlet which reveal her bra straps. She keep on adjusting her bra strap to use her singlet to hide her bra strap and she keep on adjusting her short jean like pulling up her pant and pulling down her jean to cover her thigh. I got distracted and do all my experiment wrongly :( and get boxed rapidly by my lecture :P</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I forgot to mention the reason why I look at her often because she remind me of my previous classmate, her looks that is why she thinks that I am interested in her and she look at me often. But there is something odd is that after she notice I look at her often, she give me that look as posted in the first post above and she wore a ring in a left hand 2nd or 4th finger which I am not sure and she did not wear it before she notice me. I guess she thinks that I am interested in her and try to reject me that she is attached or someting. I don't think she is attached because I often saw her parents fetch her from and to school often and I overheard some of my classmate conservation that her parents were very cautious about her classmates like one guy was walking with her after class, her parent saw and confront that guy which I saw and maybe, I also caught her parent were looking at me as well, as I had a feeling that the girl was looking at me from behind. I guess all is just misunderstanding as I am not interested in her just that she remind me of my previous classmate in oversea and she thought that I am interested in her. if she is interested in me, she would have smile back to me in the first place when I handed the attendance book to her but she didn't.</p></div>
