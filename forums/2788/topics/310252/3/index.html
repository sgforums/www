              <p>You have to remember that Singapore is an Island surrounded by potential JI or Al Qaeda terrorist members planning and training to destroy Singapore Fortress.....Just like the Israel. This is a fact and you cannot deny it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any intelligence or military personnels know this fact. We need our neighbouring countries Leaders close co-operation to fight those terrorists may be living within their countries too.</p>

But on Thursday afternoon, he decided to accompany his wife to the school. <br><br>With Mas Selamat Kastari - terror detainee-turned-fugitive - still at large, Mr Chan did not want to take any chances. <br><br>"I may have not sent my daughter to school if I had known earlier," he told TODAY. <br><br>In what Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng described as a "security lapse", Mas Selamat, head of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terrorist network here, gave his guards the slip while he was being taken to the toilet at the Whitley Detention Centre, which is near SCGS. <br><br>The massive manhunt for the 47-year-old fugitive, who walks with a limp, continued on Thursday. <br><br>"Extensive police, the Singapore Armed Forces and other security resources are still deployed and no efforts will be spared to track him down," the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said last night. <br><br>The soldiers were brought in on Thursday to help the thousands of policemen, Gurkhas and men from the elite Special Operations Forces already deployed cover a wider area. <br><br>As the security forces continued to maintain its presence in the area around the detention centre, SCGS yesterday issued a letter to parents assuring them that extra precautions had been taken to ensure the students' safety. Said SCGS principal Low Ay Nar: "Cars allowed into the premises are scrutinised more stringently." <br><br>Despite the beefed-up security in some areas, it seemed to be business as usual in many parts of Singapore. In Geylang Serai, several people interviewed said they were not worried. <br><br>The owner of a textile outlet, Mr Hashim Mohd Noor, believes that Mas Selamat will be caught "sooner or later". <br><br>Shopkeeper Chng Keng Chai, in his 80s, added: "I am not worried. If I see him, I'll call the police." <br><br>TODAY's checks suggested that many Singaporeans were more curious about the <br>escape itself. <br><br>As Mr K C Cheriyan, director of a childcare centre at Goldhill Avenue and a former military man, said: "How do you escape from such a facility? How is it possible?" <br><br>Other questions that have cropped up: Was Mas Selamat acting alone? Why was he not restrained with handcuffs or electronic tags? Shouldn't there have been fail-safe measures in the first place? Would his escape lead to greater security threats here? <br><br>Four government MPs also had some questions for Mr Wong in Parliament on Thursday. <br><br>Among them was Dr Teo Ho Pin, who wanted to know what was the level of security imposed on Mas Selamat during his detention. "This has raised concerns about our police force's vigilance, and security operating procedures," he said. <br><br>MP Ho Geok Choo - noting the possibility that there could be a network operating in the background to help Mas Selamat escape - asked Mr Wong what more the Home Ministry could do to prepare Singaporeans in the event of an emergency. <br><br>Mr Wong urged the House "not to speculate" until an independent investigation had completed its work. <br><br>He also warned that anyone who helps Mas Selamat would be committing a "grave offence". Under the Penal Code, a person who harbours a fugitive faces a jail sentence that may extend to 15 years or even a life term, as well as a fine. <br><br>TODAY understands that Mas Selamat's posters — with his picture and a number to call — are being put up in places such as bus interchanges and MRT stations. <br>Singapore's neighbours were yesterday also on alert, with Malaysian security forces beefing up patrols and distributing the JI leader's photos to various enforcement agencies. An Indonesian presidential spokesman told online news portal detik.com that Jakarta was coordinating very closely with Singapore’s security and intelligence agencies. <br><br>Even as Singaporeans are waiting for answers to the "how", security experts are already grappling with the question, "what next?" <br><br>Some believe that Mas Selamat — who once plotted to hijack a plane and crash it into Changi Airport — has four options: Hide and wait until there is a lull in the manhunt; make a dash for it and try to escape to a neighbouring country; or, if he feels cornered, Mas Selamat might resort to taking a hostage or even a reckless act of terror. <br><br>Mr Clive Williams, a professor with the Australian Defence Force Academy, predicted that Mas Selamat would try to reach Indonesia. "Because if he stays in Singapore, he’s going to be arrested fairly quickly," Mr Williams told AFP. - </span><a class="path" href="http://http:www/todayonline"><span style="color: #0000ff;">TODAY</span></a><span>/il</span></p>

              <p>Hello Brother Short Ninja,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm a pro anti-terrorist person....During 911...my second elder sister, my niece and brother-in-law were in Arizona and they have migrated there...and their Mosque were pletted by rock missiles by the any Americans just because they were Moslems. They had to seek shelter and safety hiding place from those angry crowds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My Indonesian Ex-wife, was near Sari Club at Legian Street when the first Bali Blast accurred..and luckily she was not injured. Then the Native Balinese population were ready to harm all the Moslems in Bali....luckily the Indonesian Authority managed to calm them down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the 911 event were shown on television..my friend a former CEO can be seen with tears in his eyes..I was speechless too....then a year later when I was informed that Bali was bombed by terrorists...my heart cried for my Indonesian wife and a six year old boy...Bali was my Home...It was a Paradise for me and my family and for many tourists from various countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yishun MRT was the target JI members had planned to bomb...I am staying in Yishun brother...what happened if my loved one is in that MRT Station or in that MRT Train if that terror attacks take place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now you see my brother....pro American....yes...because without the youngmen who had fought in the pacific region to free Singapore and other countries in these region...The Imperial Japanese Forces probably might still be rulers of all us in this region. At the end...The Americans had to use the Atomic bombs to end WW2 in this region. Imagine...how many young U.S. Soldiers died in that WW2 to free us from Imperial Japan Power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for listening.</p>

PAGE H4/HOME</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>BOOKLET ON AVOIDING EXTREMISM</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two terrorism researchers have come up with a booklet that they hope can make a big difference, by teaching Muslims how to avoid falling under the spell of those who propagate extremist views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Authors Muhammad Haniff Hassan, 39, and Mohamed Ali, 34, are associate research fellows at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. Both have studied the works of militants who try to recruit young Muslims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The booklet launched yesterday, Don't Be Extreme In Your Religion, alerts Muslims to the dangers of erroneous teachings - such as that armed jihad is a must for every Muslim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Said Ustaz Haniff: "We want to empower the community with tips on how they can identify extremist ideas, react, and protect themselves and their loved ones."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said that some people might be hesitant about informing the Mufti's office or the authorities about those who spread extreme ideas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We tell them it is okay, religiously and rationally, to come forward because it is for the community's good. The tip-off about the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) network here came from a concerned Muslim member of the community," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The authorities crippled the JI network in 2001 and 2002, arresting about 30 men for planning attacks here. But the terror threat remains, with four young radicals detained here since last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ustaz Mohammed added that as long as radicals continue to try to win Muslims over to their views, religious scholars had a duty to counter their arguments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 20-page booklet was written over four months and is supported by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore and Perdaus, the Singapore Adult Religious Students Association.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About 6,000 copies in English and Malay will be distributed at mosques here, and there are plans for online and Tamil versions too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The booklets also carry images of ordinary people hurt by terror acts and Quranic verses that urge moderation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It warns against the portrayal of issues such as the unjust treatment of Muslims in a way that arouses strong emotions, or a call to pious Muslims to disobey non-Muslims governments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last year, both ustaz also wrote a booklet on the proper understanding of jihad.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>INTERNET RADICALISM 'A THREAT TO S-E ASIA'</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By <strong>SHEFALI REKHI</strong></p>
              <p>Assistant Foreign Editor</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Home-grown terror groups could engage in South-east Asia with individuals taking lessons from the Internet, an American counter-terrorism official said, adding that Al-Qaeda too is using the Web in more sophisticated ways.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"You still have radical elements throughout the region," said Mr Patrick O'Brien, Assistant Secretary in the US Treasury for terrorist financing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Events around the world have shown the ability (of radical leaders) to use the Internet, and other means, to reconstitute a group, to radicalise and bring new people to share their ideology.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"One real charismatic leader might be able to recoalesce some of those who are now more dispersed because of the leadership disruptions we have had," he said, commending the effort of governments in this region to counter terrorism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr O'Brien was sharing his views with The Straits Times on the terror threat in this region, during a visit here yesterday, after stops in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Five years after the Bali attacks, which left more than 200 people dead and several others injured, regional governments have had "tremendous success" in their ability to "incapacitate" a number of senior leaders.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We are encouraged by that, but the work is never done. There are still significant threats in the region that we need to stay mindful of," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While there is concern in the region about some of the militant leaders who are still at large, includingtop Bali bomber Noordin Mohamad Top, Jemaah Islamiah head in the Philippines Umar Patek and head of the SIngapore cell Mas Selamat Kastari, Mr O'Brien drew attention to radical messages on the internet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We are seeing a whole specturm of activity - from radical speeches to radical interpretations of Islam, there are videos glorifying attacks in various places.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Even the Al-Qaeda has much more sophisticated operation. No longer do we see smuggled videos coming out on Al-Jazeera. We are seeing much more sophisticated statements with real-time translations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"There are other products being offered which reflect that, for the Al-Qaeda and other groups, the Internet is an important tool to spread their ideology."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Radicals are using the Internet for communication, training and for the sharing of expertise, and this "might help some of the groups reconstitute in this region", he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The arrest of two young men under the Internal Security Act in Singapore earlier this year has drawn the attention of the local authorities to the threat of self-radicalisation, but in terror circles, there is concern about what could be happening elsewhere in the region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It is hard to contain information in this age," Mr O'Brien said, as he called for collective action by regional governments to engage in discussion and encourage moderate views in the Muslim world.</p>
