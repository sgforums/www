              <p>The meaning of Selamat in Malay Language or in Bahasa Indonesia means 'Safe' or 'No Danger.' Yes, Mas in East Java it means 'Brother' or 'Mister.'</p>
              <p>A life of a fugitive will be always living in fear and he or she will always be looking over his or her shoulder to see if anyone is following behind. And being a fugitive and a wanted JI Leader or Terrorist world wide...he has to plan before his escape and if he when he succeeded to escape...how and where and when to move without being notice. He has to have a safe place to rest and wait for the right time to move again.</p>
              <p>I think he would disguise himself as an Indonesian and if anyone or he wishes to speak...he would speak in Bahasa Indonesia. He has to adjust his walking characteristic...instead of limping on one leg, he would try to limp both leg now or he would be moving on wheelchair or use a crusthers. His would movement would be at night....and when he has to move in day time...he has to wear something to disguise himself....like wear a cap, darkglasses, a scarve, wear a woman clothing if he has too, if he has shave his hair bald..it would harder to detect and other methods to alter his appearance. I think by now...its even harder for the authority to really recognise him because his body and face would be more different because of lack of food....but without food...only with water...he can survive...remember that he is able to fast....and eating meager food intakes.</p>
              <p>I think he is still in Singapore. In fact, if compare Mas Selamat Kastari with other JI members in neighbouring countries or in other part of the countries within this region...Mas Selamat is a peanut case because in Indonesia itself...he did not have any backup support because the other terrorists did not know him....and he is a peanut case because a real terrorist would not inform of his terrorism plan. If a suicider really wish to kill himself or herself, he or she would not inform anyone.</p>
              <p>Having awarded as the Host Country for The Youth Olympic in 2010, and being the first Nation and being the first time in history to have The Youth Olympic event to be held in this region....is very Honourable and is also very responsibility for a Nation. The safety of all the participants from various countries must be guaranteed without any security compromise....and I think Israelis atheletes would be in Singapore too to participate The Youth Olympic in Singapore in 2010.</p>
              <p>Here is the report today. At JB immigration counter, Mas Selamat wanted poster is displayed at the immigration counter..No baggage checks by the Malaysian Immigration. At the coffeeshop in JB, nobody speaks about Mas Selamat. The police post in JB town, no Mas Selamat wanted poster is being displayed. The Singapore Marine Police spread their petrol boats about 100 metre apart. So far, I saw only one Malaysian Coast Guard petrol boat near Danga Bay. My opinion, Mas Selamat would not try to escape via the causeway or checkpoints at the first or second link....if he is thinking of going to Malaysia. Indonesia is too far for him to cross...he may drown if he do not have any floats because of the condition of his limp leg. East Coast Park and Changi...there are canoes and unattended sampans...he could steal them or he could get a ride from Changi Point...disguising as an Indonesian....but this places are too far for him to reach after his escaped and besides...does he have any money in the first place. Probably all the cementaries in Singapore should be checked too.</p>
              <p>This is just a suggestion:-</p>
              <p>The Government of Singapore have to create more buffer zones....the Gurkhas should petrol more often until the boundary of Singapore water with Malaysia at the two causeway links. Snipers to be station at the coast line around Singapore 24 hours a day and maybe military personnel petrolling the coast of Singapore especially at the areas where there are forests.....maybe snipers and military personnel should be designated in the forests of Singapore oftenly...Thats what they are trained for anyway. Malaysian Immigration should also increase their security checks in JB especially on outgoing traffic to Singapore. I think having more eyes and ears in Johor is necessary too.</p>
              <p>Thought I share my view and opinions.</p>

              Let's look into the mind of a fox.With a limp he knows he cant go far on his own and begs for money to improve his odds.If he has some money (only the police would know that) he could try to make a phonecall (which explains why he was at the Petrol Kiosk).Assuming he is unable to get assistance he makes his way to the forest ,his only option knowing the police is already being alerted (of course he didnt know that this happened only 4 hours later).In the cover of darkness he goes deep into upper mandai and found a good spot to hide,has all the time in the world to improvise his cover and he's been there eversince praying,meditating and giggling in silence.
              How do you catch a fox? Get a large search party to comb with hugh bright lights and make lots of noise with the loud speakers and loudhailers.Only an animal would flee even from the best hiding places when the commotion creeps up and Mas Selamat has that animal instinct....meanwhile pockets of special ops personnels are positioned at strategic locations to pick him up when he shows up.The tricky part is the positioning of the traps,the rest is all bright lights and loud noises

              <p>Hello Short Ninja,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the additional information brother.</p>

              <p>Yes, I agree with you Short Ninja, I know you are a well trained soldier in jungle warfare...this method could be use when you searched an enemy or a fugitive in the jungle...especially when there is so many muddy area....I'm just guessing that he would use the muddy areas to escape from being scented by the tracking dogs and to conceal and camouflage himself with the surroundings.</p>
              <p>I really don't understand how he could escape from ISD high security detention guarded by special trained personnel. If the condemned inmates are tightly monitored and guarded in the Condemned Hall; and the normal convicted inmateds are closely watched, monitored and guarded in the Prisons all over Singapore to prevent them from escaping...I wonder how come this Mas Selamat could succeed in escaping from a high security detention....Its quite puzzling. If you could track him down with special trained dogs...he would be captured by now....I know all the prison cells in Singapore Prisons are build with concrete walls and the doors are all made in steels with a small sparrow hole to monitor the inmates inside it and there is no windows except a small air ventilation at the top of the wall near the ceiling. There are no beds too for you to sleep on except on a piece of matress and two blankets....and as for Mas Selamat, I guess he was definitely being isolated from the rest of the JI Members and he would be given a few minutes to shower alone and maybe a few minutes or the most maybe one hour to breathe the fresh air from a small yard alone too. As for his food, it is inside a plate container and usually during meal time, it would be place just outside the cell door and when the warder opened the cell door, the inmate has to carry plate of food into the cell by himself.</p>
              <p>However, I strongly believed that at the end Mas Selamat will be captured again.</p>
              <p>My concerned now is.....we have about two years to prepare for The Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in 2010 and we have to make sure that the Safety and Security for the participants from various countries are GUARANTEED. We have to make sure that there are no more JI Members in Singapore...and if possible the neighbouring countries JI Members are also captured before the Youth Olympic in 2010....So, how do we go about doing all these and we also wish to know....how the reactions of our neighbouring countries that may still have JI Members which is still a treat to our country of Singapore and The Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in 2010.</p>
              <p>Just a reminder to our Singaporeans that We Are At War With Terrorism. Are we Singaporeans vigilant enough and are we aware of the possible Threat Of Terrorism from within the country and most of all from outside the country?</p>
              <p>The security measures must be enforced now and not until the nearing of The Youth Olympic. We do not want to see the same thing that happened in China now with the uprising demonstration in Tibet or the outbreak of violence in other provinces within China. China had a few years to prepare for The Olympic Games in Beijing and definitely the Chinese Government had taken security measures for the safety of all the participants from various countries during this historical event being held in Beijing-China. We are not talking about billions of dollars in revenue alone here but also the guaranteed security for all the people from all over the whole visiting China for The Olympic Games. I roughly guess that the Chinese Government had spend millions of dollars for their security to be upgraded. They know that Terrorism is the main concern for all world leaders when it comes to counter the Terrorists main objectives...the demonstration in Tibet was something that they did not expect to happen I guess.</p>
              <p>Thought it is important to share this view with the members within this forum.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hello Short Ninja,</p>
              <p>Its nice to hear from you brother and I'm glad both of us are talking openly about this matter within this forum.....I guess that is one of the elements that Singapore Government wish to know and hear from Singaporeans themselves....who are living in Singapore and abroad.</p>

              <p>Well, the recent news from an Indonesian JI Member that was captured and sentenced to death for the Bali Blast....JI was not sponsored by the Al Qaeda. He admitted that the JI movement in Indonesia was sponsored by some surrepticious extremists organization in Malaysia and Indonesia...and Al Qaeda has no involment at for the Bali Blast or Marriot Hotel Bombing in Jakarta. Infact as we know already that the mastermind were actually two Malaysians. If you have seen the facts that two well educated Malaysians turned terrorists were capable of influencing Indonesians to carry out suicide bombing within their own country and killing some of its own people...imagine what would happen if there are others like them within Malaysia trying to do the same thing in Singapore. I agree with the International Intelligence Agency that Singapore is one of the terrrorists target....I think Al Qaeda is also looking at Singapore as one of the terror attack because Singapore is an Americans Allied. But for me right now...any terrorists from whatever extremist group with the objective of causing terror to innocent people is a threat to Singapore.</p>

              <p>The existence of JI Members in Singapore I believed has already been contained and destroyed but is there anymore like them Extremist within Singapore that could make themselves like terrorists is another side of the story...but it is quite worrisome for me right now and perhaps to others that there are a large numbers of Indonesians staying in Malaysia as guest workers and can they be recruited by possible JI members or Extremists from Malaysia to cause terror within Singapore. We have thousands of Malaysians going into and coming out from Singapore daily. Who is monitoring them and their activities beside going to work to earn a living? If Mas Selamat managed to escape to Malaysia...I think he would go to Kelantan...I think there he would safe...furthermore Moslems in Kelantan are not like other Moslems from other states in peninsular Malaysia.</p>
              <p>I'm looking at the violence between the Israelis and the Palestinians and also the violence in Southern Thailand....as some of the methods that Al Qaeda or JI or from other terrorist groups may used against Singapore....for instance the mortar attacks from Palestine into Israel....and in Thailand, the Moslem terrorists are using motorcycles to detonate bombs killing innocent people. If you see motorcycles and other vehicles traffics every morning going into Singapore on the causeway...you can see what I mean....it may caused not only economic lossed to Singapore and create fear for the Malaysian workers to go to work to Singapore but also many innocent lives too. One good example was the terrorists' bomb attacked on Iraqis men while they queue-up, waiting and willing to enlist into the Army or Police in Iraq...many Iraqis young men died in that suicide bombing.   </p>

              <p>We have to wait from the Board Of Inquiry report to give us that answer....as what the Singapore Government mentioned recently that Mas Selamat escaped story is still restricted and confidential because it will compromise security....I think we have to wait until Mas Selamat is captured again by the authority.</p>
              <p>I have to go now Short Ninja...I hope there are others who can share their views and opinions.</p>

              <p>I received this news from Mediacorps Channel 5 news last night....Now, the Singapore Government has arrested and detained under the ISA Act, a new JI member by the name of Rijal Yadri Jumari. He is only 27 years old. The news mentioned that he had made contact with foreign JI Elements, has be trained in guerillas warfare in Afghanistan and personally met up with Osama Bin Laden himself.....So, there are still some rats in the house that needed to be captured and terminated though the JI network in Singapore is totally been destroyed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm glad the Singapore Government has taken that security protocol on enemy or enemies of the state. I hope some of those ex-JI members released from ISA detention have changed their perception and rehabilitated to become good citizen of Singapore again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile....Mas Selamat must not escaped from Singapore....so be vigilant Singaporeans.</p>
