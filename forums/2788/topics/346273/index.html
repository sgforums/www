              <p>Interesting movie from the scribs of 'Sex and The City'.</p>
              <p><a href="http://thedatinglogbook.wordpress.com/2009/02/01/hes-just-not-that-into-you/">He's Just Not That Into You - The Movie</a></p>
              <p>Here's an excerpt of the book, 'He's Just Not That Into You'</p>
              <p><em>“</em><em>Dear Greg, </em></p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><em>I’m so disappointed. I have this friend that I’ve known platonically for about ten years. He lives in a different city and recently he was in town for work, so we met for dinner. All of a sudden it felt like we were on a date. He was completely flirting with me. He even said to me, as he was checking me out, “So, what, you’re working the whole ‘model thing’ now?” (That’s flirting, right?) We both agreed that we should get together again soon. Well, Greg, I’m disappointed because it’s been two weeks and he hasn’t called me. Can I call him? He might be nervous about turning the friendship into romance. Can’t I give him a nudge now? Isn’t that what friends are for? </em></p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><em>Jodi</em></p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><em>Dear Friendly Girl, </em></p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><em>Two weeks is two weeks, except when it’s ten years and two weeks. That’s how long ago he decided whether or not he could date a model or a girl who looks like one. Can you be a pal and give him a nudge? Nudge away, friendster — but watch how fast that nudge doesn’t get a return phone call. And if your dinner/date did feel different to him, it’s been two weeks and he’s had time to think about it and decide he’s just not that into you. Here’s the truth: Guys don’t mind messing up a friendship if it could lead to sex, whether it be a “(expletive) buddy” situation or a meaningful romance. Go find someone that lives in your zip code who will be rocked to the core by your deep conversation and model looks.</em></p>
              <p class="inside-copy"><em>I hate to tell you, but that whole “I don’t want to ruin the friendship” excuse is a racket. It works so well because it seems so wise. Sex could mess up a friendship. Unfortunately, in the entire history of mankind, that excuse has never ever been used by someone who actually means it. If we’re really excited about someone, we can’t stop ourselves — we want more. If we’re friends with someone and attracted to them, we’re going to want to take it further. And please, don’t tell me he’s just “scared.” The only thing he’s scared of — and I say this with a lot of love — is how not attracted to you he is. “</em></p>
