              <p><em class="timedate">Mon Jun  2,  1:26 AM ET</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>SYDNEY (Reuters Life!) - 
                  Bachelor Carl Weisman got fed up
                  of being classified as a playboy, a loser or a commitment-phobe
                  so he set out to find out exactly why he and a growing number
                  of eligible men were steering clear of marriage.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1212384541_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: medium none; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Weisman</span>, 49, conducted a survey of 1,533 heterosexual men
                  to research a book aiming to give women an insight into why
                  some smart, successful men opted to stay single -- and help
                  lifelong bachelors understand why they are still the solo man
                  at parties.</p>
              <p>He concluded that most men were not afraid of marriage --
                  but they were afraid of a bad marriage.</p>
              <p>"Men are 10 times more scared of marrying the wrong person
                  than of never getting married at all," Weisman told Reuters in
                  a telephone interview.</p>
              <p>"This is the first generation of people who have grown up
                  with bad divorces. People assume there is something wrong if
                  you don't marry but these are men who have made a different
                  choice and not given in to social pressures."</p>
              <p>The release of his book "So Why Have You Never Been
                  Married? - Ten Insights into Why He Hasn't Wed," comes amid a
                  growing trend for more people to stay single, with less social
                  or religious pressures on men -- and women -- to tie the knot.</p>
              <p>Weisman said U.S. figures showed that in 1980 about 6
                  percent of men aged in their early 40s had never married but
                  this number had now risen to 17 percent.</p>
              <p>AFRAID TO MAKE MISTAKES</p>
              <p>Weisman said his <span id="lw_1212384541_1" class="yshortcuts">online survey</span> found there are three groups
                  of bachelors -- about 8 percent who never want to marry, 62
                  percent want to marry but of which half won't settle for
                  anything less than perfection, and about 30 percent who are on
                  the fence.</p>
              <p>Four out of 10 bachelors did not want children compared to
                  three out of 10 wanting to be a father. The rest were
                  undecided.</p>
              <p>But while 72 percent of <span id="lw_1212384541_2" class="yshortcuts">respondents said they were</span> not
                  afraid of marriage, about half of them said the situation that
                  scared them most was marrying the wrong person.</p>
              <p>"It's so important to these men to get it right. My best
                  advice to single women after bachelors is to be patient. If
                  you're in a hurry to get married you'll be frustrated," he
                  said.</p>
              <p>Weisman also found that financial issues, both positive and
                  negative, played a large part in men's fear of commitment.</p>
              <p>"Those with little money said they would have nothing to
                  offer a partner, with some suffering self-esteem issues and
                  withdrawing from the dating pool," said Weisman, an
                  engineer-turned-author with two books now published.</p>
              <p>"While those who are financially sound were terrified what
                  a bad divorce could do to them."</p>
              <p>Weisman said his research blew away any idea that single
                  men were unhappy.</p>
              <p>"A compelling issue was how many of them had found
                  contentment in a never-married life," he said. "They had
                  created lives full of careers, friends and ambitions. It was
                  not like they walk around all day worried about not being
                  married."</p>
              <p>For him, researching the book made him also look at himself
                  -- and he ended up living with a girlfriend for the first time.</p>
              <p>"Now we're looking at getting married. As I researched the
                  book I found I was looking at men 10 years older than me and it
                  was like looking into the future. If I didn't change, nothing
                  would," he said.</p>
