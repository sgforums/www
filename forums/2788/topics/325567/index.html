              <p>JENNY (not her real name) is struggling to pay off the loans under her name and has to borrow money from friends to buy a meal. She gave more than RM70,000 to a Casanova, who took advantage of her grief after her mother's death.</p>
              <p>The 35-year-old met "Andy" at her mother's funeral in Kuala Lumpur. He was with a friend and after the funeral, they kept in touch by phone and email.</p>
              <p>A year later, the 48-year-old man moved to Kuala Lumpur to look for a job and be closer with Jenny.</p>
              <p>"I was not interested in a relationship. I'd never had a boyfriend and was still mourning my mother," said Jenny.</p>
              <p>"But Andy was so supportive. And after a few months of courtship, I agreed to make a down payment on a taxi."</p>
              <p>Initially, Andy worked hard and paid the instalments. But as months went by, he worked less and ran out of money.</p>
              <p>"When he could not meet the payments, he started borrowing from me. At first, it was small amounts like RM100.</p>
              <p>"But they got bigger and bigger. We used to fight over money."</p>
              <p>Jenny was suspicious at first but Andy's sweet words always melted her heart, and she gave in to him.</p>
              <p>"He never raised his voice when he was angry. He was very sweet and caring, especially after an argument."</p>
              <p>Her family thought he was a "good catch" but she never met any of his friends or relatives.</p>
              <p>Andy talked about marriage many times and even persuaded her to get registration forms.</p>
              <p>"But he always backed out at the last minute. Usually, he used his financial situation as an excuse.</p>
              <p>"To solve that problem, he convinced me to take a loan. He said the banks had blacklisted him and he could not apply for one."</p>
              <p>Jenny took a personal loan of RM40,000 and pawned some of her jewellery. She did not tell her family because she knew they would not agree.</p>
              <p>After settling his "debts", Andy moved to a new job in Johor Baru but returned to visit every month.</p>
              <p>"He never gave me his address in Johor Baru, even though I asked many times.</p>
              <p>"After two months, he asked me to take another loan. This time, it was for RM30,000. I had to pay RM700 a month to settle the loan. That was half of my salary," she said.</p>
              <p>After the second loan, Andy's visits became less frequent. He told Jenny he was busy.</p>
              <p>Eventually, he stopped coming. It's been a year since Jenny last saw him. All his phone lines have been cut.</p>
              <p>Jenny said there were many warning signs but she was <strong>blinded by love</strong>.</p>
              <p>"I heard from a friend that Andy was seen with a girl in Penang. He was also spotted in Johor Baru with a different girl."</p>
              <p>Anyone had a similar experience before?</p>

              <p>This bloke sounds like a psychopathic personality which is one of the worst &amp; most destructive mental ailment which one can be afflicted.</p>
              <p>Typically this God forsaken jerk is excellent in sweet talking, psychological brain-washing &amp; manipulation - &amp; being such a super con artist, he will totally destroy/break/rob the victim's heart/body/soul &amp; money.</p>
              <p>Clinically whether PD is made or born, the expects r still uncertain but the hallmark of a PD is that after the commission of the misdeeds,  this ***hole will feel no remorse, no regret, no guilt &amp; most of all - never learn from his experience of wrong doing &amp; will readily repeat his artistry of conning again even even punishment has been meted to him.</p>
