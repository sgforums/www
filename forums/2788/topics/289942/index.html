Perhaps Miss P (Princess) knows she's got something you want so economics start shooting up. When the price starts going up, you lose control rapidly. I think you're losing a bit of control mate.<br><br>I think you should take the heat off a bit and spend more time with the other 3 girls. Or spend more time on beers and cars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Pardon me for saying, your post sound like you go market to buy thing.  Some popular stuff maybe running out and you go for some reserve or standby.<br><br>Sometime, you go out with a particular girl and it so happen she like you.  You may give her the wrong impression and misunderstanding can arised.  ( it happened to me and that girl hated me like s-h-i-t.  Maybe at that time my action was really wrong lor).  Since you have a target, called PS.  Why don't you try wooing her?  You like her right? Then go for it..  Thing may not be what you think...  maybe after getting together, then you realised you don't really love her, I mean you can like but it is not necessary love.  But then again, true love may blossom between two of you.  I say go for it.  But if you still want to keep your option open, please be sensitive to those around you..  you never know when you will hurt them.....</div>
