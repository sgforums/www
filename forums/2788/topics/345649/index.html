              <p> November 5 people love things that can be proven by science. These <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/scorpio.htm">Scorpios</a> are natural researchers and students. They look for answers and
                  cultivate knowledge to better understand themselves. Their clever sense
                  of humor has a cutting edge, but they never deliberately hurt another
                  person. November 5 people can be the life of the party.</p>

              <p><strong>Friends and Lovers </strong><br><br>Although
                  most Scorpios have a small, close-knit group of friends, November 5
                  natives need a lot of companions. They usually enjoy a stable but
                  exciting <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/love.htm">love</a> life. They often <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/marriage.htm">marry</a> early, sometimes to their high school or college sweetheart. They are devoted to the idea of fidelity in marriage. <br><br><strong>Children and Family </strong><br><br>If
                  there were serious problems in the family during their growing-up
                  years, November 5 people realize they can get beyond the emotional
                  scars. As parents, they are encouraging and helpful. While they don't
                  push their children, they do understand their part in helping their
                  youngsters feel good about themselves. <br><br><strong>Health</strong> <br><br>People
                  born on this date take good physical care of themselves. They eat well
                  but moderately and are always looking for ways to maximize their
                  workout schedule. Pacing is the key. November 5 natives generally
                  prefer simple fare: meat, potatoes, and unadorned vegetables. <br><br><strong>Career and Finances </strong><br><br>November
                  5 people are doers and thinkers. They are likely to go with their
                  instincts instead of analyzing everything before coming to a
                  conclusion. They usually seek careers that require, at minimum, an
                  undergraduate degree. They usually manage their finances, and they are
                  generally the ones who set the budget rules. <br><br><strong>Dreams and Goals </strong><br><br>November
                  5 people don't do anything halfway or recklessly. They understand their
                  academic potential, so that's usually where they put their faith. They
                  are not career-driven, but they believe in living up to their
                  potential. Where their personal life is concerned, they want the usual
                  things: love, partnership, and children.</p>

But in truth, they have a powerful need to display their abilities. Their idealistic streak is powerful, but they don't expect things to come to them easily. They want to earn everything they have.

                  born on February 18 are dedicated to the art of perfection. They can

              <p><strong>Friends and Lovers</strong> <br><br>The men and women
                  born on February 18 are selective about the people they bring into
                  their circle. While they are open-minded, they are more critical than
                  other members of their sign. They are looking for a soul mate and
                  likely remain unattached until they find him or her. <br><br><strong>Children and Family</strong> <br><br>Whatever
                  their beginnings, February 18 natives always seem to stand alone. As
                  children they may have been forced to accept adult responsibilities,
                  and this is likely to have affected their lives. They are strict
                  disciplinarians as parents, but they are also loving and supportive. <br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br> February 18 people are extremists. Fasting is often a part of their
                  health regimen. A diet consisting of raw fruits and vegetables,
                  augmented by grains, nuts, and legumes, offers them everything they
                  need. This regimen provides weight loss without unhealthy consequences.
                  <br><br><strong>Career and Finances</strong><br><br> People born on
                  February 18 do not make career decisions rashly. They often know from
                  an early age what they want to do. Because of their strong humanitarian
                  streak, February 18 people often bring political consciousness to their
                  work. They have good taste and like to live well but would never
                  subvert their beliefs simply to make a good salary. <br><br><strong>Dreams and Goals</strong> <br><br>February
                  18 natives look at every goal as a challenge. They're tough on
                  themselves, always looking to make each challenge more meaningful than
                  the one that came before. When they turn their unstinting vision to
                  personal goals, they are just as motivated to succeed. To be a good
                  spouse, a good parent, and a good citizen are all important to these
                  conscientious individuals.</p>

              of <a href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/time.htm">time</a> to concentrate on their personal sense of fulfillment. They are often drawn to New Age studies and attitudes.</p>
              <p class="articleByLine"><strong>Friends and Lovers </strong><br><br>Few people have as much <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/love.htm">love</a> to give as those born on this date. They take their friendships

              as a pal is second nature to them. They usually experience the greatest
              joy through their primary love relationship. They are loyal and do not

              their way of life. <br><br><strong>Health </strong><br><br>November 7

              to help others. November 7 men and women do not set themselves up as
              "experts." They see themselves simply as good listeners. Although
              financial gain is seldom a major factor when they choose a career, they
              are adept at handling money. <br><br><strong>Dreams and Goals </strong><br><br>November
