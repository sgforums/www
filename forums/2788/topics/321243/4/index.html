              <p>mmm...   in the end , also whether u are financially able to maintain these's relationships. But still enjoyed some of thier company. Be it fake or not. At least i had a great time everytime with them. If i were to weight the cost to my happiness , i dun think it can be measured precisely whether it was worth it or not.</p>
              <p>Sometimes not kissing resisting and wait until a moment u really cant help it just wanna cut the crap and do it, that first kiss is gonna be mega intense and straight to a whole night marathon.</p>

              <p>Of coz kissing must involve feeling lah.... its not like sex where lust alone is more then enough.</p>
              <p>Itis the kinda feeling u felt when ur are draw toward her lip without even moving. Like they move on their own by some magnet or unknown mystery force. And b4 u realise.... the contact of each other soft lip.... tasting the sweetness... and just b4 u lower ur eye lid... u saw the other party following suit... sudden heighten sense of touch and taste... the increase of heart beat.</p>
              <p>That surely is some feeling... but is that love or lust? call it wat u want... but can we base that on when or which date that it happen, as the start of a relationship? If so, when is the supposedly normal correct time frame, so that it isnt classified as too fast?</p>

              <p>If you're talking about a stable type of BGR relationship, of course it'll need more than just sex / lust and physical need / attraction....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in many instances of relationships developing out of ONS, some of them can later develop with additional of love and knowing each other etc....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, some might argue that ONS developed relationships not stable and easier to break up etc... I personally think it's all very subjective... As much as an ONS developed relationship might fail, a normal one could too....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An ONS developed relationship which dies later because it doesn't find sufficient love to substain it? A normal relationship which dies later because of the same reason or because not enough sex to substain it....? And pls don't come telling me that BGR should be about love and not sex... etc... Pls tell them to those who opted out of a relationship because of their own personal preference... I won't comment if they're right or wrong.. I'll just say it's their own option....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's just like there might be many ways to cook and eat a particular dish... Some people think fried kway teow without 'hum' is never complete and meaningless... There're some others who die die won't eat 'hum' in their fried kway teow...? So who's right and who's to judge?</p>
