              <p>Intelligent people seem to think that they are stronger than their
                  emotions. They seem to think that they can suppress or ignore
                  discomforting personal emotions. Daniel Goleman says that it is the
                  fears, anxieties, anger, and other emotions that guide us in our
                  everyday lives, “Even the most academically brilliant among us are
                  vulnerable to being undone by unruly emotions.”</p>
              <p>I don’t advocate being psychotic or annoying to people so that you
                  can get all your bad emotions “out of your system.” For people such as
                  Michael in our example, the problem is in the logical reasoning that
                  the emotions can be ignored. They may see pain as a sign of weakness.
                  As a result, the best way to deal with the emotional pain is
                  suppression. The thought of not being able to solve a problem causes
                  smart people to avoid the issue.</p>
              <p>When intelligent people can’t resolve an issue, they will likely
                  complain and blame others for the outcome. Their knowledge and past
                  experience in solving problems causes them to look outside themselves
                  for a reason as to why the problem still exists. Even when blaming
                  outside influences, a smart person may conclude that because they have
                  an unsolved problem, it can’t be solved or it isn’t worth the effort to
                  solve.</p>
              <p>Pat Wagner from <em>Pattern Research</em>, a Colorado company that
                  provides organisations with a very diverse range of communication
                  development programs, says smart people have a tendency to convert
                  their self-diagnosed failings into virtues. They use their intellect to
                  convert their emotional weaknesses into strengths. Pat terms them as <em>smart flaws</em>.</p>
              <p>One particular smart flaw used by Pat that stood out for me, because
                  I’ve been caught out using the exact same rationalizing to excuse
                  myself, was not engaging in small talk because I reasoned it was a time
                  waster. Now that I’m more aware of the most common smart flaws I use, I
                  try to stop myself in my tracks and identify the real reason as to why
                  I’m rationalizing my behavior. Whenever I don’t talk to someone because
                  “it is a waste of time,” it could be because I’m not dealing with my
                  emotions such as hiding: the fear of talking to strangers, feelings of
                  unhappiness, or the anxiety that I’ll be boring.</p>
              <p>This leads onto another emotional weakness smart people have,
                  particularly guys when they want to approach a woman they like – fear. <a href="http://www.earthlingcommunication.com/blog/double-your-dating-by-david-deangelo-reviewed.php">David DeAngelo</a>,
                  expert dating coach for guys, says, “A smart guy’s strength is his
                  mind. His weakness is often his emotions. Smart guys are often
                  immobilized by fear.”</p>
              <p>Women wonder why a guy won’t come up and talk to her in spite of all
                  the obvious signals she is sending in wanting him to approach her. When
                  the guy wants to talk to a girl he likes, his analytical mind switches
                  on. A million thoughts, scenarios, and potential problems go racing
                  through his head. It becomes a psychological war.</p>
              <div class="cpwrapper">
              <div class="contentpoint">The problem for intelligent people who think a lot is they think a lot.</div>
              </div>
              <p>The guy’s mind has served him very well in the past to get him where
                  he is today. Ancestrally speaking, he’s been able to identify
                  predators, threats, and dangers to protect himself and his tribe. The
                  analytical mind has its purpose. However, the problem for intelligent
                  people who think a lot is they think a lot! They have a tendency to map
                  out everything before taking action. This may cause them to lose
                  spontaneity and avoid doing things “in the moment” in fear of
                  repercussions. Such behaviors may manifest themselves in the form of
                  neediness, validation, and indecisiveness.</p>
              <p>In social situations, over-analysing is a killer mistake to make.
                  The intelligent people try to mind-read those they are talking to. They
                  micro-manage their interactions based on their analytical feedback
                  which drives their fear and uncertainty in conversations.</p>
              <p>The next time you catch yourself micro-managing your conversations
                  and worrying about what the other person is thinking, remember that the
                  other person is likely to be more concerned with what you are thinking
                  about them. Remind yourself that you can’t mind read and that trying to
                  do so only creates anxiety. Live in the moment more often and you’ll
                  notice people naturally becoming more attracted to you. You’ll know
                  when you’re too careless about other people’s thoughts regarding you
                  when you begin to damage relationships or hurt others.</p>
              <p>A few last points I’d like to make on logical strength and emotional
                  weakness deal with conversation. We hunger for emotionally connected
                  conversations. We love drama, fun, and controversy. Facts, logic, and
                  technical subjects are often boring and too complex. The emotional side
                  of conversations is more engaging to people. Academically intelligent
                  people may focus on logic too much. Women are especially interested in
                  any type of drama. Watch their eyes light up when you talk about the
                  latest celebrity fashion stuff-ups and other popular dramas.</p>
              <p>Another emotional weakness, in addition to the subject of
                  conversations, is the vocabulary used. Academics often use technical
                  vocabulary to prove their intelligence – a killer of rapport. Simple,
                  duh-duh, language is often more effective than technical linguistics
                  and non-methodologically circumstantial language that no one gives a
                  stuff about. The same goes for writing to keep people interested. I try
                  to write in a casual way – similar to how a conversation goes; not
                  technical stuff, things, and other types of stuff, you know? This last
                  reason is why so many great findings in academic journals go hidden for
                  years – because the general public can’t be bothered reading about it.</p>
              <p>On that last point of being too technical for people, something that
                  may interest you is how some people write emails to me. Yeah I teach
                  communication, but that doesn’t mean being technical, using complex
                  vocabulary, and trying to be intelligent helps in building rapport. You
                  can tell the difference. One example of such a “technical” email is:
                  “Dear Joshua. Allow me to extend my formal gratitude in your beautiful
                  array of teachings…” The intent behind such emails is great. It’s just
                  that the person you are talking or writing to when you trying to be
                  intelligent doesn’t experience a “connection” with you. Lots of
                  organisations are hopeless in this when handling complaints.</p>
              <p>Let’s compare that previous example of an email with this other
                  example: “Hey Joshua. Thanks heaps for the articles. I’ve learned that…
                  You’ve helped me improve my relationship with my partner.” Can you
                  sense the difference? The last example is more friendly, but not overly
                  casual. The person in the first example who appears intelligent doesn’t
                  “connect” because they are too technical. Even if you are intelligent
                  and have a complex vocabulary, you need to use terminology that the
                  other person uses if you are interested in building rapport. Don’t try
                  and prove your intelligence. We are interested in improving your
                  communication skills and not boosting your ego.</p>

              <p class="subheading">Logic</p>
              <p>Intelligent people solve problems with their superior logic. They
              are presented with many problems which they solve using rational
              thinking. A dilemma arises when they attempt to solve emotional
              problems with their logic.</p>
              <p>The logic dilemma is partly given birth from intelligent people
              loving information. Finding information makes their lives a lot easier.
              With the Internet being a superhighway of information, intelligent
              people are inclined to read, learn, and continue to analyse their
              issues.</p>
              <p>However, communication skills are <em>skills</em>. Communication
              skills are not information. Any skill is developed through practice. If
              you’re an intelligent person, I still want you to learn about
              communication skills, but know that acting on your knowledge is more
              likely to be a bottleneck in your personal development; rather than
              more information.</p>
              <p>Back to the logic dilemma, people are an illogical formula. For the
              smart people who don’t understand that, I’ll put in a way that you can
              understand. If people were a formula, they would be defined by 1 + 1 =
              3. Logic and intelligence cannot explain the complexities of human
              emotion. Dale Carnegie, author of <em><a href="http://www.earthlingcommunication.com/blog/review-of-how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-by-dale-carnegie.php">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a></em>,
              emphasizes the importance of emotion in human relations and not
              focusing on logic. He says, “When dealing with people, remember you are
              not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion.”</p>
              <p>In my <a href="http://www.earthlingcommunication.com/secrets">communication secrets of making people like you program</a>,
              I define two distinguishing behaviors of those who fall into the
              logical trap. Firstly is a common mistake we all make – we point out
              the obvious. Stating the obvious is frustrating and emotionally
              ignorant. Some examples include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>“Breaking up with someone is tough. Don’t worry, there’s the right
              person for you out there some where.” – We all know there is someone
              out there for us. The trouble is in finding them.</li>
              <li>“I can’t believe you burnt my toast. That’s stupid.” – Do you really think they burnt the toast on purpose?</li>
              <li>“Wow. I’m so sorry to hear about the burglar breaking into your
              car. You really should have locked your doors.” – Thanks for the
              advice. Idiot!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The second common logical mistake is making factual statements.
              People make the factual statement mistake when they talk about an
              emotional issue with logic and rational. An indicator of this type of
              mistake is when someone says, “You don’t get it” or “You’re missing the
              point.”</p>
              <p>As an example of the factual statement mistake, Jill is talking to
              Michael about her recent break-up. Michael is an intelligent guy. They
              two have been good friends for sometime, so Jill begins to “open
              herself up” and discuss her broken relationship. The emotions she is
              communicating are discomforting to Michael. As is common with smart
              people, Michael perceives Jill’s affliction and his own discomfort in
              clear terms. He doesn’t see muddled-up emotions. He sees pain; not
              resentment and anguish; or hatred; not partial likeness and hatred.</p>
              <p>Michael wants to resolve the hurt Jill is experiencing. In his black
              and white world, Michael sees clear emotions, problems, and provides a
              solution. He may use his intelligence to give advice, provide
              reassurance, or create some other <a href="http://www.earthlingcommunication.com/secrets">type of communication barrier</a>.
              Intelligent people are used to seeing problems, knowing what is going
              on, and providing a solution. The logically driven communication
              Michael gives Jill is frustrating to her. Jill probably just wants
              someone to empathize with her, but Michael is blinded from his
              intelligence and thinking too much. He is too intent on resolving
              problems and providing advice.</p>

              <p class="subheading">They Don’t Seek Help</p>
              <p>What happens to intelligent people who are struggling in their
              social life? They keep quite. Intelligent people are so use to solving
              problems, being an expert, and logically working things out themselves
              that they refuse to ask others for help. They would rather freeze
              themselves with fear and uncertainty then ask someone about social
              skills. There are several very interesting reasons for this.</p>
              <p>Not in all cases, but smart people will look down on those who are
              less intelligent. These people who are less intelligent may possess
              better social skills than the intelligent people, but there is “no way”
              an intelligent person can ask someone less intelligent for help. It is
              lowering, demeaning, and a sign of weakness to them if they were to ask
              for help - especially from someone who is less intelligent than them.</p>
              <p>When helping an intelligent person improve their communication, it’s
              good to point out that their expertise will improve when working on
              their communication skills. Dale Carnegie talks about appealing to
              those characteristics you want in others to create those
              characteristics. Intelligent people know they are smart. One such
              statement in appealing to those good characteristics for changing the
              intelligent person’s behavior would go along the lines of, “You and I
              know you’re an intelligent person and improving your communication is
              another way of showing people your intelligence, expertise, and good
              skill-set.”</p>
              <p>Another explanation for describing why smart people don’t get help,
              and a reason that I used to avoid having to ask others for help in
              developing my people skills, is that social skills are assumed to be
              natural. People skills can be a laughable skill to develop. If you need
              to develop your people skills, then you may get considered as a
              “loser.” Intelligent people can’t risk getting humiliated when asking
              for help, because it’s a sign that they “suck.” They need to maintain
              their feelings of importance and not feel inferior that is brought by
              seeking help.</p>
              <p>It’s easy to talk about the importance of seeking help, but being
              able to do it is different. No one person on their own can gather the
              necessary life skills to overcome personal problems and succeed. We all
              have different natural abilities and experiences, and hence we require
              varying degrees of help. There is no shame in seeking help; only shame
              in not seeking help.</p>
              <p>Someone who is of less intelligence than you doesn’t mean you can’t
              learn something from them. The areas of life that I consider myself
              very knowledgeable and an expert in, I find it very difficult to
              consider that someone with less intelligence, or even less skill than
              me in that area, can teach me something. I need to constantly remind
              myself that there is no shame in asking others for help and that I can
              learn something from everybody.</p>
              <p>Once I remove my ego and pride, I actually find myself happier and
              more knowledgeable than I was before. People will be attracted to you
              when you’re not obsessed with always being right. Besides, asking them
              for their advice is sure to make them feel important and increase your
              personal magnetism. You don’t need to play dumb, but not showing off
              your intelligence to show superiority will win you friends because we
              hate feeling inferior to people.</p>
              <p>“It is a real recommendation to be stupid,” says Arthur
              Schopenhauer. “For just as warmth is agreeable to the body, so it does
              the mind good to feel its superiority; and a man will seek company
              likely to give him this feeling, as instinctively as he will approach
              the fireplace or walk in the sun if he wants to get warm. But this
              means that he will be disliked on account of his superiority; and if a
              man is to be liked, he must really be inferior in point of intellect.”</p>
              <p>There a millions of lessons waiting out there for you to take. You
              just need to drop your ego in order to see them. Don’t let your ego
              blind you from the many lessons humanity has out there for you. Doing
              so will prove your expertise more so than stubbornness.</p>
              <p>I hope the article has provided you with some deep insight – whether
              you are an intelligent person or know of someone who is intelligent
              that lacks good communication skills. While intelligence is certainly
              very beneficial for succeeding in today’s society, effective
              communication skills will have you better relating to your fellow human
              beings. Intelligence is something you can do without, but you can’t
              avoid people.</p>
