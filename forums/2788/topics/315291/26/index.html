              <p>frankly speaking females are usually bad drivers, myself
              included. so no choice. the car forum here reminds me of clubsnap.
              where people often debate over techniques and equipment
              performance. flame threads make the place more interesting. it's
              always nice seeing hell break loose and people disagreeing.</p>

              <p>i thought i was being sexist, but finally a lady has agreed with me on this..its not that ladies have poor driving skills, but they seem to be lacking confidence and loses control easily when something goes wrong..like for eg screaming when a near accident happens instead of jamming the brakes or swerving into an empty lane if possible..the way they drive is usually very uptight too, theydon't seem to be able to relax..you'll do just fine if you can remain calm and confident..thats all there is to driving. the primary stuff that is, not talking bout drifitng and those stunts..</p>

              <p>he took control of the steering wheel and managed to e brake in time, blasted her and never taught her again..</p>

              <p>which
              is why i prefer younger driving instructors. the ones i met at cdc give
              nuts about markings on your windscreen. most of the time they work on
              your level of confidence (by dozing off in the middle of the lesson and urging you to go faster). Warped theory I know but it worked for me.</p>
              <p>Being sure of yourself is important yeah and so is toning down on that level of ego behind the wheel.</p>

              <p>wow why so competitive?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>which is why i prefer younger driving instructors. the ones i
              met at cdc give nuts about markings on your windscreen. most of the
              time they work on your level of confidence (by dozing off in the
              middle of the lesson and urging you to go faster). Warped theory I
              know but it worked for me.</p>
              <p>Being sure of yourself is important yeah and so is toning down
              on that level of ego behind the wheel.</p>

              <p>he just hates us 3 for some reason.. i've no idea why..and i realize that he really is a sexist.. during one of my lessons, he called up his female student to congratulate her on passing her tp, asked how she went home and what she's gonna do in future etc..</p>
              <p>me? he happily went on cruise during my tp, so he got his friend to drive me to take my tp, and he didnt even bother to msg me or call me to asked whether i passed..wtf man..</p>
              <p>and all 3 of us got beating on our arms too for being stiff, not turning properly etc during our training..blardy asshole..</p>
              <p>i don't like instructors who give markings on the car to help students to turn, those are the more likely ones to scratch others car when they pass their tp if not supervised properly..</p>
