              <br>Got some words on cardboard
              <br>Got your picture in my hand
              <br>Saying "if you see this girl can you tell her where I am"
              <br>Some try to hand me money

              <br>I know it makes no sense
              <br>What else can I do?
              <br>How can I move on

              <br>this is the first place she will go
