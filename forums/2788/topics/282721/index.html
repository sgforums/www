She said of course. So I replied how about character? She replied, which u want, looks or character? I said character, coz I believe its not who u are but wat u do thatÂ’s important.<br><br>She replied by saying I am stupid, everyone wants to look good, so wat if looks fade? After 30 years fade then fade loh.<br><br>After that I just ignored her, too materialistic for my liking.
