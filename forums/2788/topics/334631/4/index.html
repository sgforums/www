              <p>it's optimistic to say tt personality is more impt. but is it
              really what guys want? i tink there must be some degree of
              attraction... as a girl, i feel tt guys shld tink abt what they
              really wan in a girl before they commit... e.g. if they like a girl
              wif big boobs, go out wif a girl wif big boobs...</p>
              <p>cos fr experience, two pple who like each other's
              appearance will have higher chance of staying together... and tt's
              what most singles want right? </p>
              <p>early this yr, i got out out a two-yr relationship.. after some
              time of dating, my ex started passing comments on my appearance...
              among other things, he told me he likes girls with slim legs and
              told me to go for slimming... (btw i am five feet tall and 39kg,
              almost underweight liao, just tt my legs are not the slim kind tt
              he likes). towards the end.. we both became v unhappy...
              i din like his comments and felt insecure... he was angry tt i
              din accept his suggestions submissively (i actually did go for the
              slimming, but it didn't work)</p>
              <p>it's true tt beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder... but pls
              make sure u like the guy or girl's looks before u commit...
              otherwise, it's bad for ur partner's self esteem... i tink
              in love, we gotta take it tt what we see is what we get...
              it's not fair to ask someone to change their appearance after both
              of u make a commitment to be tog... :/</p>

              <p>Ur ex is just being an arsehole. Does he have 6 pacs? Is he even half as good-looking as <cite>Takeshi Kaneshiro?</cite></p>
              <p>Ger, he wasn't even serious in the first place. It's not abt looks. Guys if they're into you and is serious abt being your bf, will grow to love you slim legs or not.</p>

              <p>i guess it depends on which type of beauty the person sees in another person.</p>
              <p>beauty as in appearance?</p>
              <p>beauty as in what is within? the character of a person?</p>
              <p>just thought of this movie i seen quite some time back "Shallow Hal" i thought that movie really potrays on how some people look very glamorous and pretty on the outside do not neccessarily mean that they are pretty on the inside as well. and also how the male lead eventually chooses to be with the female lead even though he sees the reality of the appearance of the female lead has.</p>
              <p>beauty on the outside last for a very short time only. but what is within last for an eternity because no one can take away.</p>
              <p>cathykitty i'm glad it's over between you and that guy because that guy did not love you for the right reasons, did not love you for who you and not what you have or do not have.</p>
              <p>so yeah, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholer. because to some people, what is inside in a person shines through the on the outside.</p>

              <p>Hmm... I was reading an article quite awhile back on survey of
              almost the same qns as urs, lol. The result was like they wan girls
              to act differently at different times for eg: submissive when with
