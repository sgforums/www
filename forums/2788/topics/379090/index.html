              <p>Hi everybody,</p>
              <p>I need advice about what am I supposed to do about this guy. So to the guys, please give me some insight to what men is thinking because I seriously don't know.</p>
              <p>We have known each other for 5 months. The thing is his behavior is confusing. So I will write some things he said and did and you guys tell me whether I am thinking too much or what? And what should I do from now onwards!</p>
              <p>The more distinctive things</p>
              <p>1. Was coming for my lecture timing and not his normal timing. The thing was he only bought one chocolate and it was for me, not for himself. And he sat at the place where I sit for lectures and he skipped lunch just to come to lecture.</p>
              <p>2. For my birthday. He gave me a pen and he sewn my name onto it. Can you guys tell me whether this behavior is normal?</p>
              <p>3. He calls me by my nickname, and very few people does that.</p>
              <p>4. Came to look for me during lecture. The thing was he had nothing important to say to me he just wanted to chat with me. He was just really awkward and shy which was very funny.</p>
              <p>5. I was at our CCA commitee meeting kind of. He was in the commitee but I wasn't. But I stayed to wait for him to go home together. But we did some sorting together. The rest of the commitee were doing sorting at other places but left both of us alone.</p>
              <p>Smses</p>
              <p>1. He tells me he is secretly waiting for my sms when I sms him</p>
              <p>2. He tells me he is smiling at my sms.</p>
              <p>The thing is he is very very shy. Of course alot of other details that I dont want to bore you guys with. But these are the more distinctive ones.</p>
              <p>Especially shy guys out there, pls give me advice. Does he like me anot and what am I supposed to do when it comes to shy guys? Give him some hints that I am interested in him?</p>
              <p>The thing is why is it that he gets my number and my msn but he doesn't take initiative over all these channels? Is it because he is shy?</p>

              <p>if you do, let him do the work since he seems to be doing fine from where i see it. you can however, fasten the reaction by asking him out once in awhile.</p>

              <p>Are you dumb? he's being damn obvious already lah. he likes you. why would someone who does not like you purposely come and look for you in a lecture, when he could be somewhere else, doing whatever he wants to do.</p>
              <p>and unless he's a psycho, no guy will be 'secretly waiting' for a girl's sms.</p>
              <p>he's probably waiting for you to show him signs, that you like him too.And so dun be a bitch by remaining ambiguous. a guy has only got a certain amount of confidence when trying to court a girl. dun wait till his courage runs out, with him thinking that you rejected him.</p>
              <p>and not all guys like to call. for instance, i am a SMS person, and i seldom make phonecalls. you can take the initiative in these matters.</p>
              <p>I suggest you show him more obvious signs, like holding his hands when you 2 are alone together. or ask him out for meals, dinner etc. that should be quite an obvious proof of acceptance. if he doesn't get that and pop the question "I like you, do you like me too?", he must be blind.</p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              <p>Don't worry as long as I am sure he feels the same way as I feel for him, I will make it more obvious. I am not a BITCH lol.Thank you everybody!</p>

Take some initiative to ask him out occasionally (it's not a job strictly for the males in this era), it'll encourage him to be more open about his feelings. No sane guy would sew or do handicraft unless it's for a girl he likes. GOOD LUCK! =D</p></div>

              <p>Hi Jgosselin,</p>
              <p>Maybe you will like to get one of your friends to ask him about his feelings for you. Sometimes it is easier to have someone in the middle to help pull two people together.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
