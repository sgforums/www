              <p>We are lucky that Protectors make up as much as ten percent the population, because their primary interest is in the safety and security of those they care about - their family, their circle of friends, their students, their patients, their boss, their fellow-workers, or their employees. Protectors have an extraordinary sense of loyalty and responsibility in their makeup, and seem fulfilled in the degree they can shield others from the dirt and dangers of the world. Speculating and experimenting do not intrigue Protectors, who prefer to make do with time-honored and time-tested products and procedures rather than change to new. At work Protectors are seldom happy in situations where the rules are constantly changing, or where long-established ways of doing things are not respected. For their part, Protectors value tradition, both in the culture and in their family. Protectors believe deeply in the stability of social ranking conferred by birth, titles, offices, and credentials. And they cherish family history and enjoy caring for family property, from houses to heirlooms.
                  
                  Wanting to be of service to others, Protectors find great satisfaction in assisting the downtrodden, and can deal with disability and neediness in others better than any other type. They are not as outgoing and talkative as the Provider Guardians [ESFJs], and their shyness is often misjudged as stiffness, even coldness, when in truth Protectors are warm-hearted and sympathetic, giving happily of themselves to those in need.
                  
                  Their reserve ought really to be seen as an expression of their sincerity and seriousness of purpose. The most diligent of all the types, Protectors are willing to work long, hard hours quietly doing all the thankless jobs that others manage to avoid. Protectors are quite happy working alone; in fact, in positions of authority they may try to do everything themselves rather than direct others to get the job done. Thoroughness and frugality are also virtues for them. When Protectors undertake a task, they will complete it if humanly possible. They also know better than any other type the value of a dollar, and they abhor the squandering or misuse of money. To save, to put something aside against an unpredictable future, to prepare for emergencies-these are actions near and dear to the Protector's heart. For all these reasons, Protectors are frequently overworked, just as they are frequently misunderstood and undervalued. Their contributions, and also their economies, are often taken for granted, and they rarely get the gratitude they deserve.</p>

              <p>Profile:  ISFJ<br> Revision:  3.1<br> Date of Revision:  20 Aug 2007</p>
              <hr>
              <p>ISFJs are characterized above all by their <span style="color: #0000ff;">desire to serve others,
                  their "need to be needed."</span> In extreme cases, this need is so strong
                  that standard give-and-take relationships are deeply unsatisfying to
                  them; however, most ISFJs find more than enough with which to occupy
                  themselves within the framework of a normal life. (<span style="color: #0000ff;">Since ISFJs, like
                  all SJs, are very much bound by the prevailing social conventions,
                  their form of "service" is likely to exclude any elements of moral or
                  political controversy; they specialize in the local, the personal, and
                  the practical.</span>)</p>
              <p>ISFJs are <span style="color: #0000ff;">often unappreciated, at work, home, and play</span>. Ironically,
                  because they prove over and over that they can be relied on for their
                  loyalty and unstinting, high-quality work, those around them often take
                  them for granted--even take advantage of them. Admittedly, the problem
                  is sometimes aggravated by the ISFJs themselves; for instance, they are
                  notoriously bad at delegating ("If you want it done right, do it
                  yourself"). And although they're hurt by being treated like doormats,
                  they are often unwilling to toot their own horns about their
                  accomplishments because they feel that although they deserve more
                  credit than they're getting, it's somehow wrong to <strong>want</strong> any sort of reward for doing work (which is supposed to be a virtue in
                  itself). (And as low-profile Is, their actions don't call attention to
                  themselves as with charismatic Es.) Because of all of this, <span style="color: #0000ff;">ISFJs are
                  often overworked, and as a result may suffer from psychosomatic
                  illnesses. </span></p>
              <p>In the workplace, ISFJs are methodical and accurate workers, often
                  with very good memories and unexpected analytic abilities;<span style="color: #0000ff;"> they are
                  also good with people in small-group or one-on-one situations because
                  of their patient and genuinely sympathetic approach to dealing with
                  others</span>. ISFJs make <span style="color: #0000ff;">pleasant and reliable co-workers and exemplary
                  employees</span>, but tend to be harried and uncomfortable in supervisory
                  roles. They are <span style="color: #0000ff;">capable of forming strong loyalties</span>, but these are <strong>personal</strong> rather than <strong>institutional</strong> loyalties; if someone they've bonded with in this way leaves the
                  company, the ISFJ will leave with them, if given the option.
                  Traditional careers for an ISFJ include: teaching, social work, most
                  religious work, nursing, medicine (general practice only), clerical and
                  and secretarial work of any kind, and some kinds of administrative
                  careers.</p>
              <p>While their work ethic is high on the ISFJ priority list, their
                  families are the centers of their lives. ISFJs are extremely <span style="color: #0000ff;">warm and
                  demonstrative</span> within the family circle--and often possessive of their
                  loved ones, as well. When these include Es who want to socialize with
                  the rest of the world, or self-contained ITs, the ISFJ must learn to
                  adjust to these behaviors and not interpret them as rejection. Being
                  SJs, they place a strong emphasis on conventional behavior (although,
                  unlike STJs, they are usually as concerned with being "nice" as with
                  strict propriety); if any of their nearest and dearest depart from the
                  straight-and-narrow, it causes the ISFJ major embarrassment: the closer
                  the relationship and the more public the act, the more intense the
                  embarrassment (a fact which many of their teenage children take gleeful
                  advantage of). Over time, however, ISFJs usually mellow, and learn to
                  regard the culprits as harmless eccentrics :-). Needless to say, ISFJs
                  take infinite trouble over meals, gifts, celebrations, etc., for their
                  loved ones--although strong Js may tend to focus more on what the
                  recipient <strong>should</strong> want rather than what they <strong>do</strong> want.</p>
              <p>Like most Is, ISFJs have a few, close friends. They are extremely loyal
                  to these, and are ready to provide emotional and practical support at a
                  moment's notice. (However, like most Fs they hate confrontation; if you
                  get into a fight, don't expect them to jump in after you. You can count
                  on them, however, run and get the nearest authority figure.) Unlike
                  with EPs, the older the friendship is, the more an ISFJ will value it.
                  One ISFJ trait that is easily misunderstood by those who <strong>haven't</strong> known them long is that they are often
                  unable to either hide or articulate any distress they may be feeling.
                  For instance, an ISFJ child may be reproved for "sulking," the actual
                  cause of which is a combination of physical illness plus misguided
                  "good manners." An adult ISFJ may drive a (later ashamed) friend or SO
                  into a fit of temper over the ISFJ's unexplained moodiness, only
                  afterwards to explain about a death in the family they "didn't want to
                  burden anyone with." Those close to ISFJs should learn to watch for the
                  warning signs in these situations and take the initiative themselves to
                  uncover the problem.</p>

              Profile:  INFJ<br> Revision:  3.01<br> Date of Revision:  6 Mar 2005</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Beneath the quiet exterior, INFJs hold deep convictions about the
              weightier matters of life. Those who are activists -- INFJs gravitate
              toward such a role -- are there for the cause, not for personal glory
              or political power.</p>
              <p>INFJs are champions of the oppressed and downtrodden. They often are
              found in the wake of an emergency, rescuing those who are in acute
              distress. INFJs may fantasize about getting revenge on those who
              victimize the defenseless. The concept of 'poetic justice' is appealing
              to the INFJ.</p>
              <p>"There's something rotten in Denmark." Accurately suspicious about
              others' motives, INFJs are not easily led. These are the people that
              you can rarely fool any of the time. Though affable and sympathetic to
              most, INFJs are selective about their friends. Such a friendship is a
              symbiotic bond that transcends mere words.</p>
              <p>INFJs have a knack for fluency in language and facility in
              communication. In addition, nonverbal sensitivity enables the INFJ to
              know and be known by others intimately.</p>
              <p>Writing, counseling, public service and even politics are areas where INFJs frequently find their niche.</p>
              <p><a style="font-size: 21px; color: #666677;" href="http://www.typelogic.com/fa.html">Functional Analysis:</a></p>
              <h4>Introverted iNtuition</h4>
              <p>Introverted intuitives, INFJs enjoy a greater clarity of perception of
              inner, unconscious processes than all but their INTJ cousins.  Just as
              SP types commune with the object and "live in the here and now" of the
              physical world, INFJs readily grasp the hidden psychological stimuli
              behind the more observable dynamics of behavior and affect.  Their
              amazing ability to deduce the inner workings of the mind, will and
              emotions of others gives INFJs their reputation as prophets and seers.
              Unlike the confining, routinizing nature of introverted sensing,
              introverted intuition frees this type to act insightfully and
              spontaneously as unique solutions arise on an event by event basis.</p>
              <h4>Extraverted Feeling</h4>
              <p>Extraverted feeling, the auxiliary deciding function, expresses a
              range of emotion and opinions of, for and about people.  INFJs, like
              many other FJ types, find themselves caught between the desire to
              express their wealth of feelings and moral conclusions about the
              actions and attitudes of others, and the awareness of the consequences
              of unbridled candor.  Some vent the attending emotions in private, to
              trusted allies.  Such confidants are chosen with care, for INFJs are
              well aware of the treachery that can reside in the hearts of mortals.
              This particular combination of introverted intuition and extraverted
              feeling provides INFJs with the raw material from which perceptive
              counselors are shaped.</p>
              <h4>Introverted Thinking</h4>
              <p>The INFJ's thinking is introverted, turned toward the subject.
              Perhaps it is when the INFJ's thinking function is operative that he
              is most aloof.  A comrade might surmise that such detachment signals a
              disillusionment, that she has also been found lacking by the sardonic
              eye of this one who plumbs the depths of the human spirit.  Experience
              suggests that such distancing is merely an indication that the seer
              is hard at work and focusing energy into this less efficient tertiary
              function.</p>
              <h4>Extraverted Sensing</h4>
              <p>INFJs are twice blessed with clarity of vision, both internal and
              external.  Just as they possess inner vision which is drawn to the forms
              of the unconscious, they also have external sensing perception which
              readily takes hold of worldly objects.  Sensing, however, is the
              weakest of the INFJ's arsenal and the most vulnerable.  INFJs, like
              their fellow intuitives, may be so absorbed in intuitive perceiving
              that they become oblivious to physical reality.  The INFJ under
              stress may fall prey to various forms of immediate gratification.
              Awareness of extraverted sensing is probably the source of the "SP
              wannabe" side of INFJs.  Many yearn to live spontaneously; it's not
              uncommon for INFJ actors to take on an SP (often ESTP) role.</p>

              <p> You are:</p>

              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To outsiders, INTJs may appear to project an aura of "definiteness",
              of self-confidence. This self-confidence, sometimes mistaken for simple
              arrogance by the less decisive, is actually of a very specific rather
              than a general nature; its source lies in the specialized knowledge
              systems that most INTJs start building at an early age. When it comes
              to their own areas of expertise -- and INTJs can have several -- they
              will be able to tell you almost immediately whether or not they can
              help you, and if so, how. INTJs know what they know, and perhaps still
              more importantly, they know what they <strong>don't</strong> know.</p>
              <p>INTJs are perfectionists, with a seemingly endless capacity for
              improving upon anything that takes their interest. What prevents them
              from becoming chronically bogged down in this pursuit of perfection is
              the pragmatism so characteristic of the type: INTJs apply (often
              ruthlessly) the criterion "Does it <strong>work</strong>?"
              to everything from their own research efforts to the prevailing social
              norms. This in turn produces an unusual independence of mind, freeing
              the INTJ from the constraints of authority, convention, or sentiment
              for its own sake.</p>
              <p>INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in
              part because they possess the unusual trait combination of imagination
              and reliability. Whatever system an INTJ happens to be working on is
              for them the equivalent of a moral cause to an INFJ; both perfectionism
              and disregard for authority may come
              into play, as INTJs can be unsparing of both themselves and the others
              on the project. Anyone considered to be "slacking," including
              superiors, will lose their respect -- and will generally be made aware
              of this; INTJs have also been known to take it upon themselves to
              implement critical decisions without
              consulting their supervisors or co-workers. On the other hand, they do
              tend to be scrupulous and even-handed about recognizing the individual
              contributions that have gone into a project, and have a gift for
              seizing opportunities which others might not even notice.</p>
              <p>In the broadest terms, what INTJs "do" tends to be what they "know".
              Typical INTJ career choices are in the sciences and engineering, but
              they can be found wherever a combination of intellect and incisiveness
              are required (e.g., law, some areas of academia). INTJs can rise to
              management positions when they are willing to invest time in <strong>marketing</strong> their abilities as well as enhancing them, and (whether for the sake of
              ambition or the desire for privacy) many also find it useful to learn
              to simulate some degree of surface conformism in order to mask their
              inherent unconventionality.</p>
              <p>Personal relationships, particularly romantic ones, can be the
              INTJ's Achilles heel. While they are capable of caring deeply for
              others (usually a select few), and are willing to spend a great deal of
              time and effort on a relationship, the knowledge and self-confidence
              that make them so successful in other areas can suddenly abandon or
              mislead them in interpersonal situations.</p>
              <p>This happens in part because many INTJs do not readily grasp the
              social rituals; for instance, they tend to have little patience and
              less understanding of such things as small talk and flirtation (which
              most types consider half the fun of a
              relationship). To complicate matters, INTJs are usually extremely
              private people, and can often be naturally impassive as well, which
              makes them easy to misread and misunderstand. Perhaps the most
              fundamental problem, however, is that INTJs really want people to make <strong>sense</strong>.
              :-) This sometimes results
              in a peculiar naivete', paralleling that of many Fs -- only instead of
              expecting inexhaustible affection and empathy from a romantic
              relationship, the INTJ will expect inexhaustible reasonability and
              directness.</p>
              <p>Probably the strongest INTJ assets in the interpersonal area are
              their intuitive abilities and their willingness to "work at" a
              relationship. Although as Ts they do not always have the kind of
              natural empathy that many Fs do, the Intuitive function can often act
              as a good substitute by synthesizing the probable meanings behind such
              things as tone of voice, turn of phrase, and facial expression. This
              ability can then be honed and directed by consistent, repeated efforts
              to understand and support those they care about, and those
              relationships which ultimately do become established with an INTJ tend
              to be characterized by their robustness, stability, and good
              communications.</p>

              <span style="color: #0f5fa4;"><strong>Rational Portrait of the Mastermind (INTJ)</strong></span>
              <p>All Rationals are good at planning operations, but <span style="color: #0f5fa4;"><strong>Masterminds</strong></span> are head and shoulders above all the rest in contingency planning. Complex operations involve many steps or stages, one following another in a necessary progression, and Masterminds are naturally able to grasp how each one leads to the next, and to prepare alternatives for difficulties that are likely to arise any step of the way. Trying to anticipate every contingency, Masterminds never set off on their current project without a Plan A firmly in mind, but they are always prepared to switch to Plan B or C or D if need be.</p>
              <p>Masterminds are rare, comprising no more than, say, one percent of the population, and they are rarely encountered outside their office, factory, school, or laboratory. Although they are highly capable leaders, Masterminds are not at all eager to take command, preferring to stay in the background until others demonstrate their inability to lead. Once they take charge, however, they are thoroughgoing pragmatists. Masterminds are certain that efficiency is indispensable in a well-run organization, and if they encounter inefficiency-any waste of human and material resources-they are quick to realign operations and reassign personnel. Masterminds do not feel bound by established rules and procedures, and traditional authority does not impress them, nor do slogans or catchwords. Only ideas that make sense to them are adopted; those that don't, aren't, no matter who thought of them. Remember, their aim is always maximum efficiency.</p>
              <p>In their careers, Masterminds usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees. Problem-solving is highly stimulating to Masterminds, who love responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out. Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past.</p>
              <p>Masterminds tend to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals, having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research. Masterminds are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked against reality.</p>
