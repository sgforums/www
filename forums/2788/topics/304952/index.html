            <div class='col-md body'>Let's say you are in school. You meet this cute girl and you talk to her. At first, she seems so friendly and she's laughing at almost every single thing you say, whether it's funny or not. You are just being yourself.<br><br>Then you think to yourself: oh is this girl attracted to me ? Then you ask her out for a date. She says ok. This happens for a few times. Then one day, you notice her interest dropped. She became very cold all of a sudden. She no longer finds you funny. You notice that the chemistry between the two of you is dropping. She begins to turn down your invitations.<br><br>So: what the freak happened ?<br><br>My thoughts: The first time you talked to her, you created a deep impression on her because you are being your relaxed self. You hold no attachment to her. You don't feel pressured to impress her. Ironically, because you have no pressure to impress, you actually attract her.<br><br>Then during the course of the interaction of next few meetings, maybe you realised that she is attracted to you. Because you know she's attracted to you, you are also attracted to her. Suddenly for some reason, she pulls back, you realise you are losing something. You start to do all sorts of funny things like keep calling her, keep msgin her as if you have no other things to do. You find you are not being yourself most of the time.<br><br>THEN, she avoids you at all cost.<br><br>so, any comments ? girls especially ?<br><br>doko</div>

Since she is starting to pull back, hammering/pressuring her with phone calls will just make it worse.<br><br>A date who avoids you and pulls a disappearing act can only mean low interest level (be it male or female). Why try to keep somebody who doesn't want your company? If she is avoiding you, then back off. Delete her number since you have poor self control.<br><br>*pats*<br><br>You'll be fine.
