              <p>Hello there,</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As what the title describes, I am looking for a lady between 19 - 21 whom would might want to consider having a serious relationship with me, which hopefully leads to marriage.</span></p>
              <p> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The initial critirea (out of 1000s) that I am looking for in that special lady:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Does not go to clubs</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Virgin</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Chinese. I am open to Malay too.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Acceptable looks to me. Good looking is a bonus of course!</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Preferbly a JC/Poly/Uni student or a working adults perhaps?</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Alright, some background about me:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Age: 22</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Race: Malay</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Smoke: No</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Drink: No</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sports: Table Tennis, Futsal, Running, Swimming, Rock Climbing</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Education: I was offered a place in both local Unis</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know the background above is very brief. The rest of my background like occupation, education, is for you to find out. Its pretty complicated. I thought I should not spill the beans too soon? :)</p>
              <p><strong>Why am I looking for that special lady now?</strong></p>
              <p>Good question. Scroll up and read the requirements above. I was told by my friends who frequent clubs that at least 70% of girls goes to clubs. Additionally, few years ago, there was an article that I read which states that at the age of 16, about 40% of girls lost virginity at the age of 16. How true is that? I don't know. What I know is, as we grow up, the percentage of those who meet my criteria will diminish over time.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I am 22. I think its time for me to scout for a spouse potential. Its good if I can find one at this age.</p>
              <p>Well, that is some of the reasons kay? :)</p>
              <p> <strong>W<span style="line-height: 1.231;">hy did I post it here?</span></strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I thought of posting it in facebook. But then I think that was not a good idea. LOL.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am not the kind of guy who will approach any girl and talk.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I don't want to use any dating agency. Its expensive, and I think their database contains mature girls like 25 and above.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>A colleague of mine has been telling me that he wants to recommend a few girls. But then, I am not so sure whether is he serios or not. I don't want to pester him either.</p>
              <p><strong>You interested?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>PM</strong> me your facebook URL. I'll check it out. Eventually, if I felt calm looking at your profile picture for example, I'll get in touch with you. Perhaps from there we can shoot questions at each other?</p>
              <p>If I did not get in touch with you, I apologize in advance. Perhaps you did not fulfil my intial criteria. No hurt feelings ya? :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hmm i don't think this is demanding at all. but usually alot of people go to clubs to find girls. else you have to do it the hard way like me. get to know more friends. the bigger your circle of friends the better. i also dislike girls who club often. maybe went once or twice before is still ok. since you are malay, i cannot advice you to go church to know more people. cause that is one fast way to expand your social circle.</p></div>
