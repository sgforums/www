            <div class='col-md body'>
              <div>Once upon a time... <span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div>There was a rich King who had 4 wives. He loved the
              4th wife the most and adorned her with rich robes and treated her to
              the finest of delicacies. He gave her nothing but the best. He also
              loved the 3rd wife very much and was always showing her off to
              neighboring kingdoms. However, he feared that one day she would leave
              him for another. He also loved his 2nd wife. She was his confidante and
              was always kind, considerate and patient with him. Whenever the King
              faced a problem, he could confide in her to help him get through the
              difficult times. <span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The King's 1st wife was a very loyal partner and had
              made great contributions in maintaining his wealth and kingdom.
              However, he did not love the first wife and although she loved him
              deeply, he hardly took notice of her. One day, the King fell ill and he
              knew his time was short. He thought of his luxurious life and pondered,
              "I now have 4 wives with me, but when I die, I'll be all alone. <span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Thus, he asked the 4th wife, "I have loved you the
              most, endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over
              you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?" "No
              way!" replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another word.
              Her answer cut like a sharp knife right into his heart. <span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The sad King then asked the 3rd wife, "I have loved
              you all my life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me
              company?" "No!" replied the 3rd wife.. "Life is too good! When you die,
              I'm going to remarry!" His heart sank and turned cold.<span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He then asked the 2nd wife, "I have always turned to
              you for help and you've always been there for me. When I die, will you
              follow me and keep me company?""I'm sorry, I can't help you out this
              time!" replied the 2nd wife. "At the very most, I can only send you to
              your grave."Her answer came like a bolt of thunder and the King was
              devastated.<span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Then a voice called out: "I'll leave with you and
              follow you no matter where you go." The King looked up and there was
              his first wife. She was so skinny, she suffered from malnutrition.
              Greatly grieved, the King said, "I should have taken much better care
              of you when I had the chance!"<span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In Truth, we all have 4 wives in our lives ... <span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div>Our 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good, it'll leave us when we die. <span class="EC_EC_215484507-19032008"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>

              <div>Once upon a time... <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div>There was a rich King who had 4 wives. He loved the 4th wife
              the most and adorned her with rich robes and treated her to the
              finest of delicacies. He gave her nothing but the best. He also
              loved the 3rd wife very much and was always showing her off to
              neighboring kingdoms. However, he feared that one day she would
              leave him for another. He also loved his 2nd wife. She was his
              confidante and was always kind, considerate and patient with him.
              Whenever the King faced a problem, he could confide in her to help
              him get through the difficult times. <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The King's 1st wife was a very loyal partner and had made
              great contributions in maintaining his wealth and kingdom. However,
              he did not love the first wife and although she loved him deeply,
              he hardly took notice of her. One day, the King fell ill and he
              knew his time was short. He thought of his luxurious life and
              pondered, "I now have 4 wives with me, but when I die, I'll be all
              alone. <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Thus, he asked the 4th wife, "I have loved you the most,
              endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over
              you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?"
              "No way!" replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another
              word. Her answer cut like a sharp knife right into his
              heart. <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The sad King then asked the 3rd wife, "I have loved you all my
              life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?"
              "No!" replied the 3rd wife.. "Life is too good! When you die, I'm
              going to remarry!" His heart sank and turned cold.<span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He then asked the 2nd wife, "I have always turned to you for
              help and you've always been there for me. When I die, will you
              follow me and keep me company?""I'm sorry, I can't help you out
              this time!" replied the 2nd wife. "At the very most, I can only
              send you to your grave."Her answer came like a bolt of thunder and
              the King was devastated.<span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Then a voice called out: "I'll leave with you and follow you
              no matter where you go." The King looked up and there was his first
              wife. She was so skinny, she suffered from malnutrition. Greatly
              grieved, the King said, "I should have taken much better care of
              you when I had the chance!"<span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In Truth, we all have 4 wives in our lives
              ... <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>

              die. <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
              <div>Our 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we
              die, it will all go to others. <span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff;"> </span></span></div>
