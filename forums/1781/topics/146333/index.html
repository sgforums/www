            <div class='col-md body'>and I am UP! not that i choose to, but I am being forced to. the CC opposite my house is celebrating National Day and the volume is fucking LOUD. imagine i slept at 3am earlier, and the music can wake me up at 745am.<br><br>i immediately called the CC and asked to speak to the person in charge. turned out to be someone whom i wasted my breath on.<br><br>I: Hi, I live in Blk *** Level ***, right oppossite the CC. This is the 2nd sunday i am encountering a noise pollution problem. the activities the CC have are waking me up early in the morning when I want to sleep in. it is so loud that i can hear everything the MC is speaking!<br><br>He: Yeah, we're having a national day celebration and if the music is not loud enough, there is no atmosphere!<br><br>I: (stunned that he could spout those words)<br>He: And all of us are Singaporeans, celebrating National Day, all of us should be more tolerant and not complain abt it<br><br>I: (to stunned to continue keeping quiet) I am sure there is half the neighbourhood sleeping in. It is a SUNDAY. and U start the activity so early! Is it legal to make noise so early?<br><br>He: If u want i can call the Environment people to go your place check on the noise volume. That's not a problem, but it has to fall on another activity day where the noise volume is comparable to right now. You can call the police if u want, it's ok with me. I can see them.<br><br>I: (utterly disappointed) take down my details. and give me a call when u have an appointment with the "Environment people"...<br><br>...<br><br>Imagine a CC representative speaking in that manner!<br><br>well anyway i have sent a long email to www.pa.gov.sg. they better reply me or something. if not i will flood their blardy inbox.</div>
