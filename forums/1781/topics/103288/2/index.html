Anyway I have sent them an email and I still have the email in my sent box so they can't say they didn't recieve my email. Honestly I feel that sometimes cases like these are not escalated and brought to their attention mainly also becoz Singapore has made complaining such a chore. Even with CASE, you need to register as a member and pay a certain fee before they will accept your complain. Sigh......can I complain about CASE?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I believe you are refering to a unisex toilet, because what's the difference if the girl before never lift it up after using? As for a guy, then the question is should it be the responsiblity for the guy using it before to lift it up or the one that is using it subsequently. This would be a more valid arguement should this be a case of a unisex toilet which I have encountered personally. Let's not even get complicated with whether u r doing big business or small business. The girls in my ex-company always complain that the guys never lift up the cover after urinating and hence having stains on the cover. My answer was, we (the guys) never put them down in the first place. It was the girls that was using it previously so why should we lift it up when it was already down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Got it?</div>
