            <div class='col-md body'>a private school named....A****.<br><br>for security's sake, i shall not mention the name here. This school is situated somewhere in Dhoby Ghaut and i am a victim.<br><br>for those of u who have actually read the new paper today, it features an article which speaks of CASE complaints, mainly on private schools.<br><br>i have no encounters with informatics or auston, so i shan't comment. but this school has gotten on my nerves so much that i quit the school and lost nearly 3k.<br><br>i signed up for a degree. i was so excited that i was finally going to be an undergrad.<br><br>for the first two months, it was pretty alright. then things got a bit farny and two incidents happened within a week.<br><br>i had a sociology exam. as i could not make it on e actual day (sat), i requested to have it a day before (fri). they agreed. i had to take unpaid leave on that fri as i had a physics class going on at 7pm. means i gotta be there in the afternoon at 4pm-6pm to take the sociology exam.  then go for the physics class (another module which i was taking in the same sch)<br><br>on friday, i was in gym after lunch at 1 plus. i receieved an SMS. it was from the consultant from the sch. it read 'as the class requested, physics class is cancelled tonight'. i was puzzled. i called up the school. and the consultant merrily said,' oh F**** (my classmate) called and told us that he represents the whole class to cancel the plysics class cos they need to study for tomorrow's sociology exam. he said he has called every classmate. so we agreed'<br><br>i was stumped. i said flatly 'he didnt call me'. now the consultant was stumped. she said 'oh he didnt?' a very typical bimbotic answer when a bimbo is stumped.<br><br>i was really pissed cos i took a day off for the blardy exam! and i wasn't paid for it!<br><br>i relented and let go of this matter. i LL went to take the exam at 4pm then went home at 6pm!<br><br>in the following class on thursday, i got to know from my classmate that on sat, the actual day of the exam, there was no invigilator! and my classmates ended up passing answers ard!<br><br>i was infuriated this time round. i met the consultant and then asked, "why isnt there any invigilator during the exam? and did u know that the classmates passed answers ard?' she said coolly,"oh yes we know. we have hired a fulltime invigilator (pointing to some uncle) after the incident."<br><br>i asked "so are u going to let us retake again?"<br>she replied "no, cos it was our fault and we shan't waste our students' time"<br><br>i asked "so is this the way u run the sch? u let students decide when they have their classes and when they do not?"<br>she replied "oh yes we value students' feedback and now that we know that we shouldnt jus take students' request at face value, we will change accordingly"<br><br>I quit without saying another word.<br><br>WTF!</div>
