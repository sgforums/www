WAY too protective.<br><br>question 3:<br>does BGR realli affects teenagers in their studies?<br>Yes, definitely. Very few of them can juggle between the two.<br></div>

Well, the initial shock is over. It's like being surprised that kids as young as 7 have a handphone, but that shock is no longer there.<br><br>Not so surprising anymore when newspapers keep reporting about it.</div>

For age 17 - 18, yea you can be involve in relationship if you want but I suggest don't be too serious about it, personally I don't think it will work out or last. I suggest study is more important. The most important of all is have some self-control if you are getting into one and you know what I mean by self-control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Question 2: Are Singapore's parents open to the idea of early BGR among teenagers this days?<br>A: Nope, parents nowadays still have those old day kind of thinking. Most parents believe any age below 20 is considered too early.<br><br>Question 3: does BGR realli affects teenagers in their studies?<br>A: Personally, I believe yes. Seen it happens and heard it happens.<br><br>Question 4: What is the age u started ur 1st relationship?<br>A: I'm not a parent and Nope, no started at all. Don't intent to until maybe after NS or when I start working. Why? Don't need unnecessary stress, like money problem and stuffs.<br><br>Conclusion: Are teenagers suitable for an early relationship?<br>A: Based on my answers for the questions above, my answer is an obvious 'No'. Reason being it is too much for them to handle.</div>
