            <div class='col-md body'><p>mm.. since your cocker is already three years old, it would be pretty difficult to train it already. Dogs are best trained from young. For the excretion part, it's natural for every dog to do that. If you want him to stop barking, (which isn't advisable as he could deter some would-be burglars) just smack him lightly whenever he barks at people, and reward him with a treat whenever he does not bark. At least, it works most of the time for my own cocker spaniel.</p></div>

              <p>   Well i really wonder if you r the one who bought it or your family ? First of all , its natural for dogs to want to pee abit here n there cos its their basic instanct to " mark " their territory , to bark whenever they hear any sounds although the quantity of barking may differ between different breeds of dogs . My pekinese last time doesn't anyhow bark . But once he really did bark continuously and very fiercely and that time i could hear some noises of someone trying to break into my house cos usually theres no one ard but i was off that day so i notice it . After that the burglars left after hearing my dogs constant barking . Maybe your dog looks like hes smiling at you but actually they r just panting . Whenever dogs open their mouth to pant ( that is very crucial to them as they can't sweat like us through our skin ) they looks like smiling . The pooing part is also very natural since they like to run ard their territory to pee . But last time my dog although have been through some obedience training , he still prefer to poo n pee outside although if we are really bousy , we have been told to lay some newspaper at the kitchen for it to poo n pee one shot . But our dog only accept that when he is really urgent no one is free to bring him out .</p>
              <p>    If you are the very impatient and aggresive type , you are not suitable to own a dog . If a dog is able to behave just as what you say pee n poo one time and bark only when pple enter your house without any training , I think what you need is just a mutant/monster ( a cross breed between a human n a dog . ) And that human have to be you so that that thing knows exactly what you want it to do .</p>
              <p>   By the way , Badzmaro , its not advisable to do that to your dogs , it will make them timid . I ever saw a bunch of puppies born by a wild dog in my camp being locked inside a electrical rm for dunno how long , when we open it , they really looked severly under-norished ( of cos yours wun have this sympton since you fed it ) and their tails were like permanently lying down into their ass instead of upright wagging . If you trained like that , more likely your dog fears you instead of treating you as their master . And if you really mean to say they pissed n wag their tail when they see you , i think theres already some mental damage done to them .  Your dogs wag their tail when they see you  because they recognise you as their ( source of food ) . They piss because maybe they are also scared of you . Extremely scared that you may lock them up again for another year .</p>
              <p>   Please don't buy any pet that you are not familiar of its behaivour . If you want any pets , at least please do read up abt it . And don't treat them like marchandise whereby you just sell them off to someone else when you dun have the time for it or grown tired of it .</p>

              their tail when they see you , i think theres already some mental
              damage done to them .  Your dogs wag their tail when they see
              you  because they recognise you as their ( source of food ) .
              They piss because maybe they are also scared of you . Extremely
              scared that you may lock them up again for another year .</p>
              <p>   Please don't buy any pet that you are not familiar
              of its behaivour . If you want any pets , at least please do read
              up abt it . And don't treat them like marchandise whereby you just
              sell them off to someone else when you dun have the time for it or
              grown tired of it .</p>

But the thing is they bite anyone that it doesnt know. Even my friends. lol..  n once i remember i was talking to my friend n we were dissing each other n i got loud n my dog started to snarl at him n almost bit him. lol.</p>
