              <p>Handsome Milo<br>Our Noose Dog, our Mascot.<br>Much as we want to keep him with us forever<br>Home for him should not be in a Shelter,<br>Milo deserves a good home and a family he can protect and call his own<br>Male, around 1+ years - A leader, classy dog, Quiet and well behaved.<br>Very friendly with children and people. Will make an excellent family guard dog.<br><br>Below is Milo's sad past<br><br>September 16, 2008<br>That fateful morning, the scene was strange. The usual chirping of birds and peaceful surrounding seemed tense and deadly silent. The black female is missing and the lone brown male lumbered awkwardly towards us. With much difficulty, Brownie made his way to us and there was a strange object sticking from his neck. He sat in front of us that appeared to say, "Help me". The strange object was discovered to be a thick wire, very tightly around his neck, cutting into his skin. He could only pant for breath but he did slowly drink the water we offered and greedily ate the food – such was his hunger. When he apeared more settled and a full tummy, we approached and the wire was even tighter than we thought. It just wouldn't budge. It was cutting deep and Brownie let out a low growl, perhaps in pain but he didn't move from us, as if he knew he needed help and he could trust the Human who was feeding him all this time. <br><br>He followed the Human to the car and later to the office, docilely unlike his usual confident self, as if he knows it is safer to be with Human. He seemed exhausted and looked confused though, and lost and sniffed around seemingly like "where is Blackie" as he stared around very forlornly. He seemed to realise he is just lucky to be alive. The wire noose was finally removed with much difficulty, to everybody's relief. It remains at Pet Villas’ ALL's (Animal Lovers League) office that such cruelty to animals exist even in seemingly cultured Singapore. <br><br>We think that whoever tried to catch him had the wire noose around his neck and successfully did capture Brownie but he must have somehow broken free and ran away. His lower jaw was bloodied and bruised, and we suspect he must have bitten of whatever he could to get free. It could be official or 'unofficial' capture. Now, we have very strong reason to believe that is the ‘unofficial’ and more dangerous – he was meant as food. <br><br>Brownie (now renamed as Milo) has seen a vet for a full check up and has the necessary shots – antibiotics, vaccines and vitamins. He is being treated for heartworms and cannot be sterilised till his heartworm is cleared. We dare not let him go back to the wild where he has grown up and familiar with as it is no longer safe. Milo is now safe in the ALL’s boarding home - an exception they made for us as they are overfull. We will continue to pay for his stay there for as long as he lives if we can't find him a good home. That's the least we can do for him, since he fought so hard to live, we got to give him a chance. He is extremely lovable, very sweet natured, excellent with kids.<br><br>His eyes lights up in delight when he spots Human from afar. It is such a wonder to see that that kind of joy Milo gives to Human, such devotion only found in dogs.</p>
