After a day my dog went for cesarean<span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px; white-space: pre;  "><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; white-space: normal;   line-height: 19px;"> for 500dollars at pet clinic at Toa Payoh Lor 8, the stitches on its womb somehow came off. Its internal organs like intestine and liver came out. And when i when back to the pet clinic, the vet claims that my dog had bitten it off by itself. So i was charged for another 300dollars. Luckily, my dog survived. Till now i'm puzzled how the stitch came off... What i saw was that the stitches weren't even damaged. The vet sewed the womb at 3 different positions along the cut. If my dog had bitten the stitches, for sure, the stitches on the outside will come out first. But instead, the organs came out in between the gaps of the stiches. Of course, i went to consult another vet surgeon, he laughed away that, there's no way the stitches will be bitten off so easily. Also i went back to the clinic, and the helper admitted that the surgeon did not did the job properly, the helper was the one who stitched up the cut. But i made a call to the surgeon and he denied everything and dared me. So i would like to seek advice and help out here. Thanks!( If you want to see the photo, please email me at ck-1993@hotmail.com)(Btw, the stitches had different layers, and around looks like this --l---l---l--) |  (-) = the cut  (l) the stitch. Sorry for bad illustrations! Really hope for some advice from u folks!<br></span></span></p></div>

              <p>Oh My God! it sounds very terrible, i feel sorry that your dog had to go through the unnecessary suffering that was caused by the incompetent and irresponsible vet surgeon. Such practices should be reported.I have a labrador that I love very dearly and can't imagine such a thing happening to him.</p>
              <p>If it's financially feasible, your parents or you, I don't know how old you are, may want to file a civil suit against this vet or you may want to tell this story with pictures of what happened to your dog to the press so that the public will know about this lousy and incompetent and irresponsible vet and will not patronise the place. Don't think you can report him to the cops as this is not a criminal case.</p>
