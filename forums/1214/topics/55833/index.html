Elango, human resources chief at MsourcE, a 3,000-strong Indian back-office services firm.<br><br>Youngsters at call centres are routinely taught to assume British or American names and get weeks of classroom training in foreign accents and communication skills. Understanding a client's business is also key: Companies train employees on insurance and tax regulations for overseas customers.<br><br>At stake is a fast-growing business: Around 3.3 million US jobs in the services sector and US$136 billion in wages are expected to move to offshore countries such as India, Russia, China and the Philippines by 2015, according to Forrester Research.<br><br>Entry-level graduates in India are paid between 8,000 rupees and 10,000 rupees (S$320 and S$400) a month, about a tenth of what their US counterparts earn.<br><br>In the Philippines, entry-level call centre employees earn about US$200 to US$275 a month.<br><br>In India alone, about 100,000 jobs have sprung up in the past two years, doubling the industry's total workforce to about 170,000.<br><br>About 60,000 people are employed in the call centre industry in the Philippines and this number is expected to rise to about 300,000 by 2008.<br><br>To cash in on the growing demand for specialised training, companies offering basic communication skills, accent training and social skills have sprung up across India.<br><br>The country's exports from back-office services are expected to surge 54 per cent this year from US$2.3 billion reported in the past year ended March 31.<br><br>The industry, which has emerged as a boon for the hundreds of thousands of job-hunting Indian youth, aims to hit the US$25-billion export mark by 2008 and employ one million people.<br><br>Revenue from Philippine call centres is likely to more than double to around US$370 million this year from US$173 million in 2002, according to local industry estimates. -- Reuters<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
