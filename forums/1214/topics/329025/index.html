              <p><br>I'd rather work in my own business for $X than work in someone else's business for $10X; money is really not my primary objective. I can possibly earn more doing what my degree dictates I should be good at doing instead of owning a small unprofitable business. That being said, I'm also an amateur investor (to date I've invested my entire life savings, seriously).</p>

              <p>nowadays so many businesses around... like tuition centres that have been suggested, etc etc...</p>
              <p>So many pple want to do, so much competition</p>
              <p>The best way, in my opinion, is to come up with some plan to play as a supporting role to such an industry that have low barriers to entry and widely popular. Sort of like... no matter how much they compete out there, they will still need or use your services...</p>
