NO KID!!! This stall at the older ABC market behind BLK 1 Jalan Bukit Merah serves delicious and large serves of tasty "harm" laden laksa at only $1.50 per bowl. Also, the Wanton mee comes with generous serves of wanton. SEDAP!!!!!!! Stall is at the middle row. Try it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> - Bernard Yang<br>Note: The wanton mee &amp; laksa in ABC market, i think the stall name is Swee Kee anyway is the one with ST adv. paste on its stall front is cheap &amp; delicious especially in such recession times.Sadly, only available in morning &amp; afternoon. Â¡V BS		***<br>Â„X	You can have the best Wanton Mee in town. Not forgetting the Fried Kway Tiao and the Porridge stall that sells exotic varieties of porridge, ranging from fish, pork to pigs' organs. Hawker centre is busy at night. Most stalls open till late in the night. However, you can have the Wanton Mee in the afternoon also. - Khoon Lim		***<br>Â„X	Alexandra Village Hawker Centre<br>Â„X	Mutton only!<br>Here to recommend a good stall that sells only mutton! It's at Alexandra Village Hawker Centre. Can't miss it, it's the only store that sells mutton there!<br>Go try the:<br>a) Mutton with Dang-Gui soup ($4)		***<br>b) Stew Chunks of Goat's Leg with Carrots &amp; Potatoes ($3.5)<br>c) Curry Mutton with Potatoes ($3)		**<br>Slurp-delicious! All are served hot, so you don't have to worry about cold food. It's a fantastic meal if you take these dishes with rice. They have mutton spaghetti soup too! - XUESS!<br>Â„X	STEW GOOSE RICE!		***<br>Served with cucumber and stew sauce, the goose meat were evenly cut (each packet comes with at least 7-8 thick slices of goose meat!), neither fatty or fibrous as imagined! The meat is very tender and literally melts in your mouth. A plate will cost you $4, which is well worth it considering that this is a dish you don't see everywhere else!<br>The stall sells the traditional chicken and duck rice too, with small dishes like stew eggs, tofu and preserved vegetables. Pity the chilli sauce is too sourish to go with the food. - XUESS! 	**<br>Â„X	Tanjong Pagar Hawker Centre (Above the wet market) has 2 outstanding stalls:<br>Â„X	1. Ice-kacang: For $0.70, you get a full bowl ice topped with Carnation milk and Red Bean cooked so that it doesn't taste powdery and ground roasted peanuts. There are goodies under the ice too. Make sure you get the right stall, which is nearer the bridge leading to Tanjong Pagar Shopping Complex. 		**<br>Â„X	2. Fried Carrot Cake: If you like your carrot cake a little soft, this is the place to find it. For $2, you get a filling plate of soft cha tao kway. None of that stuff that they push out elsewhere with plenty of egg and not enough carrot cake. - Chris Tan 		***<br>Â„X	Teck Hin Eating House (Directly besides Clementi Bus Interchange)<br><br>Â„X	MUST TRY. Food there is great. Espically the TIONG BAHRU PORRIDGE, beside the Roast Duck stall. ItÂ¡Â¦s a Franchise from the originator at TIONG BAHRU MARKET. They serve great Cantonese-styled, restaurant-like quality porridge with a wide assortment of ingredients in a most valued way, having won numerous accolades with CityBeat, Makansutra, Yummy King, etc. With 46 years of tradition, the recipe was refined continuously to suit the tastes of different times.<br><br>Â„X	The porridge is prepared by boiling the soup base for 4 hours and then uses it to boil rice for another 4 hours to create a thick white broth. Â¡VChristelle Tan	****<br><br>Â„X	Porridge preparation is a skill that demands perfect timing. Eating good porridge is also a lost art. Some characteristics of good porridge is well-blended broth, strong fragrance, long cooking hours and natural ingredients used. It also has a number of health benefits, particularly for people with high cholesterol and it may reduce the risk of heart disease as part of a low fat diet.Â¡XVictor Lee<br><br>There is a great variety of porridge to choose from. The mixture of pig organs is my favourite. You can always aim for fish, cuttlefish, century egg, and chicken, not to mention the great YUSHENG side dish. Â¡VJoseph Kok<br><br>Â„X	The Nasi Lemak stall selling fried beenhoon and chicken wings taste great. They have a long queue during suppertime especially when people from NUS and night owls who sleep late come down for a supper bite. The Chwee Kuay is also best in town, smooth and not so oily Â¡VAngela Ng										***<br>Â„X	Tiong Bahru market hawker centre ****<br>Â„X	Food there is great. The fried carrot cake, near to the fried oyster there. BBQ chicken wings taste great. Porridge is nice if you are not hungry. Pau is well-known. - Angeline Ng<br>I like to go to Tiong Bahru market hawker centre. Why?<br>You can get:<br>1. Pau - char siew pau, meat pau, red bean... very good pau!:-) (5 pm to 9 pm)<br>2. Teowchew crystal pau.....this stall is the best! (Tue to Sat 5.30 pm to 9 pm, close on Sun and Mon)<br>3. TIONG BAHRU PORRIDGEÂ¡KÂ¡K.Cantonese fish porridge/pig organ ,etc ......yummy yummy! Simply cannot resist<br>4. Loh Mee (2 stalls inside the market, the one w/long queue) (Lunch time)<br>4. BBQ chicken wings......<br>5. Oyster omelette...<br>Â„X	Alexandra IKEA 	****<br>Â„X	The food mall serves a lot of nice food depending on the daily menu. The America chessecake is also nice. Coffee and tea is free-flow - Angela Ng<br>Â„X	Alexandra Road	***<br>Â„X	There's a new Food Centre in Alexandra Road (former Gillman Camp) spanking new,clean environment and very good ambience Opening hours are from 0700hrs to 2400hrs Have a Beer Garden as well The NASI PADANG STALL is superb which cook authentic dishes only found in Indonesia itself cause the Chef is from there, try the Curry Fish Head for only $10.00. They also sell MEE REBUS (delicious with thick peanut gravy) MEE GORENG (Indonesian style, marvellous with lots of vegetables) SATAY (Good but price a little stiff with 40 cents a stick but real thick and long) Try for yourself, worth visiting - mdhaniff<br><br>Â„X	Amoy Street Market Food Centre<br>Â„X	Those working Tg Pagar/Shenton wouldn't miss the famous fish/mixed soup stall at the ground floor (previously from China Square) - long queue during lunch time. - Agnes<br>Â„X	1. Loh Mee, 2nd Floor, stall you see when you climb up the stairs next to the POSB ATM. 		**<br>2. Nasi Padang, cheap and good. Behind Loh Mee row of stalls. In fact, there are 2 along this row of stalls selling Nasi Padang. The good one is the 2nd stall from the right, and not the corner stall next to it. This stall was previously from the Tian Fu Kong Temple around Boon Tat Street (that's the name of the street, I believe) 		***<br>3. Shenton Laksa, previously from Old Market Transit market, is at the corner of the row of stalls facing the Nasi Padang above. - Kathy **<br>Â„X	Lau Pa Sat<br>Â„X	I'm an American in Okinawa, currently on holiday in Singapore. My friend brought me to this Laksa Stall in Lau Pa Sat where he says the food's great - IT IS ! ! ! 		***<br>We had Nonya Popiah, Laksa and Curry Chicken - all fine stuff, rather spicy though. Would be great if you check it out! - T. Pallotta 	**<br>Â„X	Lavender Food Court ***<br>Â„X	I have found the hawker who used to sell zi cha dishes at the old Lau Pat Sat hawker centre! He and his team are now at a rather quiet hawker centre next to Immigration Building next to Lavendar MRT. I dunno about you but I will not forget his prawn paste ngo hiang which is just yummy to the max! The prices for other dishes like kailan and fish slices and chilli crayfish are also cheap. A dinner for three big eaters can come up to $30, still cheap judging the quality of food here. The satay at the hawker centre is also good. The stick portion is a bit small but the satay will keep hunger pangs at bay while your main entrees (zi cha dishes) take time to cook. Also there is the wan tan mee stall which only opens at 7 pm nightly. The auntie and uncle who prepare the noodles, well, let's just say you'd better not be very hungry or you may 'peng san' (faint) before you get to taste it. Not cheap, starts from $3 but do try it, it is likely to be worth the wait. Eat the satay first, that might help! - VY<br>Â„X	Lenkong Tiga<br>Â„X	Chinese food court under Lenkong tiga blk 110, Kembangan MRT stn. Their Sweet and Sour pork is the best I have tried so far in Singapore. Their Chicken Fried rice is excellent as well. - Fred 		**<br>Â„X	Marina Fiesta Foodcourt (5 Jan 1999)<br>Â„X	just trying to tell all nice food eater that there is a stall selling very tasty satay and rojak at marina south (marina mall) (adjacent to the superbowl). i think the place is call marina fiesta foodcourt. though, the price is abit X but come to compare to those malay's satay that we get outside($0.30-$0.40), it is bigger by at least 2 times. And the gravy is not the watery one that you've get, it is those creamy and rich groundnut sauce that i think had long being in the book of history. in addition, they also offer very nice rojak which they take great pride to prepare. their $3 serving is equvalent to those $4 one that we can find in our neighberhood hawker centre. with all these plus point that they prosess, i can't see why they won't be the next destination for people who enjoy good satay and rojak after the famous satay club. 5 stars for the food. - Sherman 		***<br><br>Â„X	Armenian Street Old Coffeeshop **<br>Â„X	Sited next to the old US Embassy and opposite to the Asian Civilisation Musuem I (a few steps away from MPH Stamford), the coffeeshop houses a "char-kway-teow" store, a "wan-tan mee" store and a "wu-xiang" store. Tucked away at an unnoticed corner, it stands out from all the high class eatiung places and food courts around the area. Food is relatively cheap too, though not as cheap as I would want it to be! The char kway teow is good, simple and nice. Not laced with shrimps, fish cakes etc, it's cooked plain with chinese sausages and cockles. Literally "melt" in your mouth. Long queue during peak hours so one has to be patient! Certainly tasted better than a lot of those you would find in the food courts these days! Priced at $2 and $3. - XUESS!<br>Â„X	Bedok Bus Interchange hawker centre (Bedok MRT station)<br>Â„X	My fav stores here are the Char Kway Tiao and the nearby corner char siew, xio bak and roast duck rice store. Facing the main car park, you can't miss it! At 1 corner of the hawker centre is the goreng pisang and the dessert stores - excellent! There are 2 dessert stores - aim for the one with the long queue. Food prices are very reasonable. - phoinix ***<br>Â„X	Bedok North Road Hawker Centre ****<br>Â„X	There is a hawker center along Bedok Nth Rd which operates 24hrs, EVERY DAY! To get here,take the Townlink 222 at Bedok Interchange, get off at the 4th stop,(Interchange not counted). Anyway, you will be able to notice it.The best times to eat there is at the evening and at night. In the evening, the Economical rice stall's is cheap and good. Chicken rice is avaliable if you get there quick. Hokkien mee and Fried Kway Teow can also be found, but lots of MSG. At night, at stores near busstop and NTUC, there are two stores selling good satay. The cream of the crop is found at two stores selling ONLY minced meat mee. Both are equally good, but the stall which dosen't have a Mickey Mouse picture on its signboard(look up)is better but has a longer queue. Avoid going there on Mondays as many stalls are closed.For more info,email me at x25cc@mbox2.singnet.com.sg - Chia 2 Jun 97 	***<br>Â„X	Bedok North Steet 1 Blk 216 Hawker Centre **<br>Â„X	Make on the spot big pau .Very tasty &amp; fresh. Better than Tiong Bahru one ... also at this Hawker Centre There is stall ( beside Soyo bean drink stall) selling very delicious Wanton Mee. - Tony Lau<br>Â„X	Bencoolen Street<br>Â„X	There is also good Murtabak just below WHY NOT HOMESTAY at Bencoolen Street. And you can also get good Teh Halia (Ginger tea) just next door. - Swee Bee. 		***<br>Â„X	Bendemeer Road<br>Â„X	Guan Hin Teochew Restaurant at Blk 34 Bendemeer Road (turn off at Exit 14A along the PIE). Great tasting Teochew food - oyster omelette, crab rolls, sharks fin, crayfish, Teochew 'siew mai', 'aw ni' and lots more. Not very cheap though. - Jarrod Ng	**<br>Â„X	Bras Basah Complex<br>Â„X	Anyone tried the food court called 'Xiang Man Lou Food Court' at Bras Basah Complex (ground floor), facing Allson Hotel? This is the same premises where the Chinese restaurant of the same name used to be. Stalls featured there include:<br>Â„X	1. Yong-tau hoo - so, so. 		*<br>Â„X	2. North Indian food viz. tandoori chicken, naans, rice and curry - good value for money, food quite good. 	**<br>Â„X	3. Chicken rice - average quality. 		*<br>Â„X	4. Wanton noodles, char-siew rice - average quality, slightly pricey. 		**<br>Â„X	6. Bak chor mee - the most popular stall there (another long queue). Good value for money. For $3 you get slices of pork, meat balls, mushrooms and a piece of fried scallop. This stall also sells the usual fishball noodles and prawn noodles (hey-mee).	**<br>Â„X	7. Japanese food featuring sushi, shashimi, tempura udon, katsudon,etc. Quite good quality food for a fraction of the price you pay at a restaurant. 		**<br>Â„X	8. Fish head/fish slice bee-hoon and, fish soup with rice. Above average, tasty. 		**<br>Â„X	Changi Airport<br>Â„X	The stall at Changi Airport T1 has good vegetarian food and it's halal, also. Must try the Fried HongKong noodles. - FLY 		**<br>Â„X	Ghim Moh Hawker Centre<br>Â„X	The reason why I want to highlight this place is that I have been having my stomach filled there since my junior college days.<br>Â„X	Peng Kee Chicken Rice - very smooth white chicken with very fragrant rice, better than Swee Kee! 		***<br>Â„X	Char Kuay Teow - don't know the name but it's next to the chicken rice and you can't miss it coz' it's the only one and there's always a queue 	**<br>Â„X	Cocktail Jelly - ask any RJC student and he/she will tell you all about their staple diet! (there's only one there and it's self service with a long queue too!) 		***<br>Â„X	Duck Noodles - also the only one stall that sell duck noodles, very shiok noodles; try the laksa too! 		***<br>Â„X	Fish Head Mee Hoon - it's at a corner stall near the carpark, very good deep fried fish head! ( the stall also sell congee but forget that!) 		***<br>There's a lot more there, you just have to go there for your breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper for a month to find out (which I have been doing for 8 years now!) - LOU<br>Â„X	Adding on to LOU's comments, the Chwee Kuay, Pau Store and Soya Bean Store are also very good. 		***<br>Â„X	The Chwee Kuay looks very "professional" which sells only Chwee Kuay but nothing else. The equipment and cooking utensils are well designed and effective. By looking at the quantity they are churning and the crowd you would know it's good staff. Ask for more " Chai Po ", it's tasty ! The stall is located at the centre row.<br>Â„X	Try the Pau Store too, it's located in the outer row, corner store facing some provision shops, the Char Siew Pau and Siew Mai are good.<br>Â„X	Don't forget to visit the Soya Bean Store. It's located on the other side of the hawker centre, next to the FisH Head Mee Hoon Store, facing the coffee shop. The Bean Curd is good and comparable to the one at Middle Road - but priced only at sixty cents.	***<br>It seems like this hawker centre has many good food, I would need more visits to explore further. - Wong Weng Thong<br>Â„X	Forget the Soya Bean Store facing the coffee shop! The beancurd is not bad but compared to "Super A1" (#01-72 - opposite 2 medical halls) at the same hawker centre, it still has some way to go. "Super A1" makes soya beancurd and drink on the spot. Very smooth and shiok! And healthy too since there are no preservatives added. You can also add abt 7 types of toppings including longans, fruit cocktail etc. Very cheap too. - Tan Seng Huat<br>Â„X	Fresh made soya bean drink and soya bean gurd with many types of toppings etc. longan or lychees with bean gurd, peach with bean gurd, genko and lotus seed with bean gurd. Beside there are many others variable dessert which can try out and the price is resonable. Blk 20 Unit 01-72. Must try the special bean gurd topping which is made of good quality soya bean and it is good for health. - Spencer Maggie<br>Â„X	Golden Mile Coffeeshop (opposite Hawker Centre)<br>Â„X	Long Live Laska! The 'most happening' laksa I have tasted must surely be the one at the coffeeshop opposite the Golden Mile Hawker Centre. When I go with my friends, we eat two bowls each. Very shiok! The gravy is lemak and rich and the serving is just nice. Going for $2 and $3. You must try to believe it. The prawn mee, I have heard, is also quite good too. But it is $3 per bowl. - VY 		***<br><br>Â„X	China Square Food Court<br>Â„X	#01-22 The stall is selling combo set meal. It have fish set, chicken set, pork set and beef set. The set include 1 bowl of rice, fish,chicken,pork or beef, daily change vegetable and fruits and a cup of drinks. The price is very very cheap range from S$4.80 to S$5.80. It is more worth than eating McDonald. I have try the food and is very nice and filling. - botek 	**<br>Â„X	Recently, I found a stall at China Square Food Center which serve great Nonya Mee Siam and Laksa. This stall is located on the 2nd floor unit no. #03. Their nonya mee siam is a typical and traditional type which I have never tried one before in Spore. People who love nonya food should give their mee siam a try. They also serve great laksa and prawn mee. Don't forget to try out their home-made sambal chilli. They really go well with the food. - SNI 		***<br>Â„X	A Great discovery is the fried fish soup store(Level one). They deep fry pieces of fish meat with egg. It is then served in a big bowl filled with piping hot fish broth. It is enough to make you go for 2-3 bowls of rice. Another recommendation is the fried sambal fish head. - Bernard Yang **<br>Â„X	I was at the newly opened China Square Food Court at Telok Ayer Street today and I found a REAL traditional nonya type Mee Siam and thick gravy traditional Laksa. If you like Laksa with a thick lemak type gravy, don't give this one a miss. Also, their mee siam is really delicious. They are located on the second floor next to a dessert shop. I highly recommend their mee siam. - LKC 	***<br>Â„X	There is a good vegetarian food stall at B1-31, restaurant standard but at food court price. I would recommend their rojak, hor fun &amp; mee goreng. They also serve Tahu Goreng, thick sauce with plenty of cucumber &amp; bean sprouts and of course with lots of peanuts on top. FYI; they are from the Lau Pa Sat - transit market quite popular with the Chai Piah (vegetable cracker) &amp; Spring Roll. - Harry 	**<br>Â„X	Chinatown<br>Â„X	Near Chinatown point is a famous chinese style coffeshop. Name is Tiong Seng or as the cantonese-folk in the area call it, Cheong Sing. Great porridge. Q is long and wait may be long. Quite expensive and great taste. Done to the traditional cantonese style by cooking the rice in pork broth and not water with seasonings. Fish porridge done in the same way. Hot and not air-con'd. The raw fish with chilli and seseme oil is done the right proportions.<br>This place is known by the older generation taxi drivers too. Just tell them "To Cheong Sing!" Sadly this may not work as the younger generation of taxi drivers seem to know only tourists eating places. ***<br>Â„X	Yes! at Temple Street there is a 24 hr Taiwanese Steam Boat Restaurant. Quite pricey but if you want a hot meal in the middle of the night and it had to be chinese, this is the place. Uses chicken broth for the soup and not water. Pot is not your regular steam boat pot but a bronze kwali-like basin. ***<br><br>Many kinds of people drop in from construction workers to other denizens of the night. They have a small TV there and many are seen glued to the food and set. - Chia Jin Ngee **<br>Â„X	Great curry! Did you ever know that there was a restaurant in OG building on Upper Cross St?? It's the building opposite Chinatown point and hidden on the 3rd/4th floor is a cafe-type restaurant. They serve great homestyle food, and their curry is the best! Maybe not for die-hard curry fans, but the gravy is thick with coconut, and the chicken is plump and tender... mmm.. Definitely for those people who get overwhelmed by too much spices cos it's pretty mild. I would recommend their poh-piah, fried-rice, fried noodles and fried tung-hoon too! Don't get turned off by their set-lunches which are served in army-type trays. It may be strange but it's pretty damn good! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~ - Nina Tay 		****<br>Â„X	Chinatown Complex Hawker Centre ***<br>Â„X	I have made another great food find available in the morning for a healthy breakfast. CHINATOWN COMPLEX FOOD CENTRE in the heart of Chinatown alongside Smith Street . For an extremely healthy nourishing breakfast you will find it at a Niang Tou Fu Stall tuck away In the corner of Chinatown 2nd Storey # 02-99 namely Xiu Ji Cooked Food OR Ikan Billis Niang Tou Fu .

Mixed seafood soup at 2nd floor is also very good (fresh fish/seafood and fish ball). - Agnes 		***<br>Â„X	Nasi lemak at golden shoe hawker centre... but there's so many there you might be lost. So must make sure you go the the one that says green rice and it's located between a fish soup stall &amp; a chin chow drink stall.

It also sells delicious food. - Keith Loke<br>Â„X	Hill Street Hawker Centre (opp. Funan Center) **<br>Â„X	My hubby and I just love the cha keow teow at the Hill Street Hawker Centre. I am referring the second storey stall which is easily accessed by the covered bridge linking Funan Centre and the hawker centre. The uncle hawker is a quiet unassuming chap who will customise your plate of keow teow, like more bean sprouts, no cockles, etc. He also puts in very little or no pork lard as compared to the other competitor at the ground floor whose portions are also less for $2 or $3. The wan tan mee at the ground floor is also very good, especially the soup version. The cha siew is quite good. Also going for $2 a bowl. - VY<br>Â„X	Duck Rice - $3 will fetch you a plate of gravy-soaked rice and 7 or so slices of duck..the set is completed with a bowl of herbal soup (i think..it certainly tasted like herbs to me!!) - James Hetfield **<br>Â„X	Holland Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue (going towards Clementi).<br>Â„X	Coffee shop at the corner.

The prawn noodle (basement) is very nice. The wanton noodle (Eng's) used to operate a stall at Onan Road. People driving Mercedes Benz would queue up to buy his noodle. Another good wanton noodle is Ah Seng's Wanton noodle. The soon-kueh on the basement and durian chee cheong fun/porridge on the first floor is very good. Of course, the best rojak in Singapore is also here (it is the only stall selling rojak). This rojak stall allows you to call to order your food. Take a name card from the owner. - Oh CW Roger (jun 99)<br>Â„X	Ellenborough Food Centre 	***<br>Â„X	A rare and disappearing food "sharks meat" jelly still found here, is a favourite among the old Teochews. Other good stuffs here include fresh hand-made "pau" and "a-bo-ling" (Teochew glutinous rice balls).

Must try! Second: Least oily and most fresh fried oyster, the Bah Kut Teh and Pig's liver Mee Sual also not bad. - Serene 	***<br>Â„X	Coffee Shop along Geylang Lor. 24A - There's a store that serves great 'Hae Mee' - Both the soup and dry version. They open at around 7am and sell out before noon. However, do not despair, in the same coffee shop, there's also an irresistable wan-ton noodle store.

No longer there, it is taken over by a Chicken Rice stall that co-incidently also sells very delicious chicken rice and oyster sauce veggies. Try It!! - Diana Chew - B Batok 	***<br>Â„X	Addition to the stalls that Jorge had mentioned, we must try the Cha Kway Teow stall which is located just a few stalls away from the fish head noodle stall. Can't remember the name but just look for a "bui soh" and that's the stall. - Mabel Ong 		***<br>Â„X	The left side of the fish ball noodle stall you mentioned at jurong west st 52 hawker centre.It's a Hong Kong noodle stall,it has great shrimp dumplings and wanton mee.The stall that has a "A-Soh"who wears a cheong sam kind of dress.That's the one. - Kelvyn Ho 	****<br>Â„X	Kallang food center<br>Â„X	Nobody has said anything abt this place ... for lunch dinner and late supper??<br>Â„X	the pork rib mee swa/meatball/fishball noodle soup is really great. Only starts to sell at abt 8pm till 11pm, or till they run out, which ever happens first. Damm tasty! Good favourite. n Located at the front row, next to the 2 fruit stalls and the 'chinese medicine drink stall', facing the main road. 	**<br>Â„X	western food - at the back row (to the left if you walk in past the prok rib noodle stall described above.) Next to some drink stall/chicken wing stall, kinda opposite a fruit juice stall. This western food stall sells the usual western food but the really nice thing is their garlic sauce!!!!! Fantastic. Some of the western fare comes with it, some do not. The recommendation is the chicken cutlet (or chop - the one without bones) and ask for extra garlic sauce!! Yum yum .. but watch out .. the garlic taste will stay with you (on your breath and tastebuds even the next day) for abt 24 hours ... expecially when you visit the loo thereafter.( sorry for being disgusting.) 	***<br>Â„X	there are 3 char kway teow stalls there. I hear the better one is the one behind the mobil station - only ate once during the day and I think they close at nite. Not bad. The other two are in the middle section and they do open at nites. Both pack the kway teow in the traditional 'white' leaf wrappers. ... both also taste not bad. - Jeremy Chan 	***<br>Â„X	Kopitiam, Meridien Orchard 	***<br>Â„X	The Kopitiam is quite good.

Made of egg &amp; flour with red bean paste filling, to dip into icing sugar before eating. The thought if it make me hungry! - Clariel 	***<br>Â„X	You get the usual plastic mass-produced food at this typical foodcourt, but there are treasures to be found here, if we know where to look... Here are some of my faves at this foodcourt :<br>1. Poh piah stall, somewhere in the middle of the foodcourt, which sells poh piah in three varieties: normal / super(with some crispy stuff) / special(with crabmeat)... or was it normal/special/super(???), and choice of normal or hand-made skins... The more expensive the better, of course, but I usually order the second-best one (super?) with hand-made skin and it's deeelicious !! 	***<br><br>Â„X	2. Tar Mee-pok (dry type) with soup served in a small boiler. Really tasty soup cos they add lots of meat, minced and sliced, and fresh scallops. Those with more to spend can order the ones with abalones. 	**<br><br>3. Breakfast deal : at the coffee counter nearer to the Istana side. When wasThey serve a set for $2.00 (!!!) which comes with coffee, roti-kaya and two soft-boiled runny-yummy eggs.. - hweeb 	***<br>Â„X	You got to try the westen food at meridein Kopitiam, their food is nice exspecial their Chicken Cutlet, Fish &amp; Chip, Lemon Chicken Rice, Lamb chop and their Fried Chicken, it very Crispy n Juicy I think the stall name Taxen Fried Chicken Stall 36 and they got a prmontion card which u buy 5 set of meal and get one free.....try it yourself and you will know- Jason **<br>Â„X	Check out this new joint at the basement level of Hotel Meridian. Great place, but beware, your wallets may not be too happy about the outflow of cash. Some stalls not that cheap lah!!! For those Ban Mian (home made noodles) lovers, there is this unique and great BEEF STEW BAN MIAN. Chunky pieces of beef that you can really bite into with great home made noodles. Slurp! The other item that is worth checking out is the TERIYAKI CHICKEN with RICE for those Japanese food lovers. Very tasty, but a small portion too. Just right for small eaters you know. And then there is the all time favourite there among my friends...the HERBAL SPRING CHICKEN with NOODLES. The chicken comes nicely wrapped in aluminium foil to preserve all that juicy goodness for your taste buds!!! These three dishes have been keeping me satisfied for the past three months of regular visits!!! - Yu Khing 	****<br>Â„X	Marine Parade Hawker Centre<br>Â„X	i think you have left out Marine Parade hawker center. There are lots of great food available there .For eg , there is this Apollo char kway tiao which have delicious satay sauce on it ( but self-service ) and also at one end corner there this Katong Chicken Curry Puff ( behind the stall selling soya bean and ching qao drink ) their curry puff is very fresh as they make , fried and sell it on the spot . especially the curry puff skin which is so crispy and hmmm.. it smell nice too ! They also sell curry powder at $2 per packet and each packet is 100 g. As for the price $0.80 each,very cheap leh , got chicken ,got curry , got potatoes . Not like those Japanese Pancakes inside only have cheese or peanut and somemore it cost $1.03 !!!! - Lydia Koh 	***<br>Â„X	Maxwell Market (and around)<br>Â„X	Black pepper pork mee<br>the mee is bouncy but not tough, the pork is tasty but not over-sweet, perfectly seasoned with generous amount of black pepper, it makes a hearty dinner with the stall's other goodie, "swey gao". Only available at Maxwell market. The stall faces the carpark. - seong sin chen (February 99) ***<br>Â„X	is a treasure throve of great eats. Here, you would also find 2 wonderful chicken rice stall near the pig trotter stall(see our hall of fame page). They both offer terrific Hainanese Chicken but if I was forced at gunpoint to chose, I would say Tien-tien is the marginally superior one.<br>Another find is the porridge stall immediately on the left when one enters Maxwell Market from the carpark. Just look around at the people waiting patiently around the stall and the number of bowls queusing on the counter to know that fellow Singaporeans are on to something good here. MUST try the pork porridge and the raw fish. Expect to wait for about half an hour at least. The man up front is a small-sized chap who can be found darting around with great energy. This man has an incredible memory!<br>Do note that they open mornings only! - Hwang Yu-Ning ****<br>Â„X	For those of you who crave for a piece of your childhood, there is a store which sells Tang Kee (I call them UFOs). This is a dying art and I swear that no one makes them as well as the lady here. For the uninitiated, Tang Kee are UFO-shaped deep-fried doughy things stuffed with fillings of minced meat, chye and oysters. They cost $1.20 for the smaller ones and $1.50 for the slightly larger ones. If you're afraid of oil and cholesterol - forget it! These must be eaten piping fresh from the boiling oil. I always have at least 2 at one go! Hang the diet! - Remember the famous deep-fried sweet potato balls filled with meshed red beans, or chopped peanuts, or pandan coconuts, or crunchy veges ?? Well, for those 'anything deep-fried' die-hard fans like me, this is another item to look out for!<br>opens till 7pm everyday, closed on Sunday. - phoinix ***<br>Â„X	Middle Road Hawker Centre<br>Â„X	Middle Road Hawker Centre (opposite Bugis Junction) I have found another unassuming hawker who takes his cooking very seriously. His carrot cake is fabulous if you like it crispy like a pancake! The portions are big for $2 and $3. But be prepared to wait cos he is very meticulous! Another great stall is the Prawn Fritter and Ngoh Hiang stall manned by a middle-aged couple who speak very good English and are very polite! The prices are reasonable. You must try the Chinese sausage, ngo hiang and prawn fritters.... they even have pig's ears and tongues, if you are interested! The couple also does not stinge on the chili and sweet sauces to accompany takeaway food. - VY 	***<br>Â„X	Newton Food Centre<br>Â„X	the food over at newton is great like cockles, satay, stingray, kangkong....and many many more it's located beside newton MRT. go try it out. u won't regret. - Hakka 	****<br>Â„X	Northpoint Food Court<br>Â„X	Should try the mouth-watering Beryani Chicken(spicy)with Tiger prawns.The long queue is worth the wait and it only cost $4-5.50.Kavin is the name of the Stall. - Kovalan s/o L T Ramani 	***<br>Â„X	Pasir Panjang Rd Food Centre (near PSA Wharf Gate 5)<br>Â„X	chut-chut and cockles<br>Sambal chilli chut-chut highly recommended.

If you are around at PP Village, make it a point to go the SBV Centre - there is a cafe called Coffee Hub when they serve great fish and chips and grilled salmon. They also serve a wide range of coffee and wine. Don't miss it. - Amanda (February 99) 		***<br>Â„X	I am not sure if you are aware of a chain of restaurants at the corner between South Buona Vista Road and old Pasir Panjang Road, next to South Buona Vista shopping centre, called Pasir Panjang Village. The shops serve a variety of cuisines, including Indonesian in Sari Mas, Swiss in Restaurant Lucerne, Fusion food in China Blue, French Vietnamese in Qhue, Spanish food (there is a tapas bar there) and mediterranean seafood. There are also 2 dedicated (local) seafood restaurants there (Ubin seafood and wharf seafood) So the choice is quite wide. There is a covered mall at the back which is open and breezy, in which you can eat,and there is a very good ambience, facilitating a very pleasant meal. Food quality is quite good. After the meal, there is always Mata Hari, if you are thirsty. We Pasir Panjang residents find it closer to us than Holland Village, and go there for a good night out. We want to share it with the rest of Singapore - Jenny Soon 	***<br>Â„X	Prinsep Street 	***<br>Â„X	Hyde Park Cafe at prinsep street. reggie and bee serve a mean dish of curry fish head. reeeally appetising. but try also their fried long beans, omelette, stir-fried everything. you musn't leave without tasting the coffee. with a bit of nudging they also serve, not on the menu, superb pancakes with ice-cream. bee must be cursing me for divulging this. - seong sin chen (February 99)<br>Â„X	Queensway hawker centre 	**<br>Â„X	There's a good cantonese restaurant serving very tasty hor fun fried with fish meat and spring sprout. This is their specialty. There's other nice dishes as well ... like the steam fish head in hot chilly bean paste. - Philip Chen<br>Â„X	The BBQ stingray, for both stalls.

All the good taste of local hawker food with the ambience of a restaurant. Laksa, Nasi Goreng, chicken rice and rojak all at reasonable prices. Open from 12 noon for lunch till 10.30pm at night. No reservatinos needed although preferred. - Francis Goh<br>Â„X	Redhill market/hawker centre<br>Â„X	This place has a very good variety of food - carrot cakes, pau, Hokkien mee, deserts, prawn noodles, curry rice, wantan mee, kueh kueh and many more. Some stores sell the same variety ie. carrot cakes but they are fried in different styles. The prices are also cheap - 1980's price and this place has a long history. It is better than the ABC market. - Bobby Teh 	***<br>Â„X	Don't forget the delicious Satay Mee Hoon. The stall has been there since day one! So is this stall selling only Fried Tao Kuah (beancurd), a very unique stall and very cheap but only open during the day. This stall was passed down from father to daughter-in-law. I heard they made their own beancurd ! Should also try the oyster omelette  and chicken rice which is at the end of a centre row (nearest the wet market) - Hwee Wah	***<br>Â„X	River Valley Road<br>Â„X	Yes!

(in a restaurant atmosphere), a pizza house (only take-aways) and last but not least (I may have missed out any) a seafood restaurant which was just recently started by serangoon garden country club. this restaurant, called jumbo restaurant, boosts karoake facilities while u're eating, a hugh screen for those who cannot afford the room charges. the food there is not bad, and I love the buns that u eat with the chilli crabs' sauce!!! - Carole  ***<br>Â„X	Short Street<br>Â„X	Just thought people would like to know the two famous eateries at Short Street, just diagonally opposite Paradiz Centre, next to the night club. The famous Rochore Rd tau huay (soybean curd and milk) is now just next to the Mama store. Their old location, next to the bakery, is now taken over by the landlord who set up his own tau huay store. It's not that good, so go back to the other famous one. The new store (next to the Mama store) is called the Rochore Restaurant. Yummy. The other humble eatery worth mentioning is the Fishball Noodles at the corner coffeeshop right at the end of SHort Street. The ingredients are very fresh, the fishballs are hand made and very fresh. Double yummy! But long wait, lemme warn you! - Corinne  	***<br>Â„X	Simpang Bedok - (opposite the army camp):<br>Â„X	All the food there are very nice especially the rojak and the cheng tng.The price are reasonable and the place is always crowded.

This guy used to be at the old cornershophouse at Bukit timah Rd and Cluny Rd junction where chaeuffers from huge cars use to queue. The pratas are fantastic. And what's more, you pay 50 cents for a much bigger piece than the shrinking Jln Kayu pratas. Also, must try the chicken curry - tastes heavenly. - Dennis Ng 	****<br>Â„X	Singapore General Hospital<br>Â„X	The sandwiches at the bakery-like cafe at blk 4 near the taxi-stop is nice. The crossiant is the best and the coffee is quite cheap and taste nice compared to the coffee in the food court at blk 5 thought xtra 10cents. The buleberry pie and sultana taste good if you like sweetless cup cakes. - Angela Ng 	**<br><br>Â„X	Off Sixth Ave along Bukit Timah<br>Â„X	Not a reccomendation, but a commendation! - Tried the restaurant "FULL HOUSE", it was a most wonderful makan experience! I was out of new places to go to eat, so I tried looking for a reccomended restaurant near my area and Whallah!

Competition ensures quality and quantity with low prices. If you like your kway teow similiar to the one at Newton (wet and messhy), then this is the place. Actually, the two hawkers look quite alike. wonder if they are brothers. 	***<br>Â„X	Flour noodles (with the ikan bilis and egg in the soup)- this stall serves good flour noodles. A must try if you're in the vicinity. 	***<br>Â„X	Kway chap - very good kway chap. Intestines are very well cleaned. Gravy is sweet (not MSG spiked!) and clear. Portions are generous. ***<br>Â„X	Fish ball noodles - No need to say anything here. Just ask the people around the neighbourhood. One of the best in Singapore. Although I'm not a fish ball noodles fan, my friends swear by this stall. - Dennis Ng 	**<br>Â„X	just to add to Dennis Ng's recommendations at the Toa Payoh lor 5 hawker centre. There's a fried hokkien mee that's ooh so delicious. Certainly one of the best I've tasted. Its a treat to watch the cooking skills of the Ah Pek as he goes thru the motions. Alongside this stall is one that sells BBQ chicken wings which go along with the fried hokkien mee. - Denis Chua. **<br>Â„X	West Mall Food Court<br>Â„X	black pepper udon noodles - Running of black pepper, but their soup udon noodles are great too! Another recommendation - first stall selling Dim Sum especially their Chee Cheong Fun. They come with crab meat, pork or prawns (best). Their sauce taste right for the food. - TSY 	***<br><br></div>
