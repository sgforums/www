More than 1.3 million people work for it, more than half of Singapore's total workforce. Its sales are estimated to count for more than 2 per cent of America's gross domestic product (GDP), similar to the role Singapore Airlines plays in the Singapore economy, said Dr Tan.<br><br>Its turnover last year of US$244 billion (S$427 billion) was larger than Singapore's GDP and the company's profits in the last financial year, at more than US$8 billion, would be more than enough to cover Singapore's budget deficit.<br><br>To further fortify his argument, Dr Tan commented that executives at the Top 50 Most Admired Companies said 'the success of their enterprises, made possible by the loyalty and commitment of their employees, is achieved only by constant attention to the needs of their customers and employees'.<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings. All rights reserved.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Employee loyalty. Obviously, some companies don't care about how their employees feel.<br><br>Of course, I'm not saying that all workers should be paid high wages. But at least they should be paid reasonable wages. Even simple gestures such as appreciating the employees' contribution helps motivate them.<br><br>In Singapore's working culture, maybe people are already too busy to care for one another.</div>
