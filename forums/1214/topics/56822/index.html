            <div class='col-md body'>COMPANY has been awarded $41.60 - after seeking damages of more than $1.2 million from a 21-year-old woman who allegedly breached her employment contract.<br><br>TWO SIDES<br>The firm's version - ISO Promotions considered Miss Sherry Ng 'uniquely suited' for the job.<br><br>It claimed that the search for the woman's replacement took up a lot of the company's time.<br><br>The defendant's version - Miss Sherry Ng said that she was just a fresh graduate with no sales and marketing experience. She added that it was amazing that, in the current economic climate, the company could not find a replacement in more than five months.<br><br>The amount is what it paid to place a job advertisement to fill her post, in the classified section of The Straits Times.<br><br>Last October, the company, ISO Promotions, a publicity consultancy, offered Miss Sherry Ng a job as a sales and marketing executive.<br><br>Miss Ng, who had graduated six months earlier with a diploma, was to start work on Oct 21 and was to be paid a basic salary of $1,800.<br><br>But she did not turn up.<br><br>In December, the company's lawyers sent her a letter asking her to pay $5,400, which was supposed to be three months' salary in lieu of notice.<br><br>She did not pay.<br><br>In January this year, the company took her to court, claiming she had breached her employment contract and asked for $5,400, which it said it was entitled to under Clause 7 of the agreement.<br><br>But Miss Ng's lawyer, Mr Andrew Hanam, argued that she had not started work and was never an employee of the company. So, the clause did not apply.<br><br>In any case, he added, the clause was ambiguous.<br><br>The company applied for summary judgment, which is a decision made by a judge based on the affidavits submitted by both parties.<br><br>A district judge ruled in April that Miss Ng should pay damages, and said these would be assessed at a later date.<br><br>However, he also ruled that the clause in question - which states that Miss Ng has to pay the company three months' salary if her contract is terminated - did not apply, as she had never started work.<br><br>The company later asked for damages of $1.2 million - for wasting its time looking for Miss Ng's replacement, for placing a job ad in May for someone to fill the post and for the projected loss of revenue that Miss Ng would have generated.<br><br>Its publicity consultant, Ms Loych Lee, said in her affidavit that she considered Miss Ng 'uniquely suited' for the job.<br><br>She claimed that the search for the woman's replacement was a lengthy process, which involved considerable time and effort.<br><br>Six interviews were held and no suitable candidate for the job was found, she said.<br><br>Miss Ng said in her affidavit that while she was flattered the company considered her to be exceptional, she did not see herself in the same light.<br><br>She had just graduated with an advanced diploma in mass communications and had no sales and marketing experience.<br><br>The company must have interviewed other people last October, she added, and could have called one of them to fill the position.<br><br>She said it was amazing that, in the current economic climate, the company could not find another person in more than five months to fill a position paying $1,800 a month to a diploma holder.<br><br>She asked the court to award zero damages to the company.<br><br>Last week, the court threw out the company's claim for $1.2 million and ordered Miss Ng to pay ISO Promotions $41.60 for the job advertisement.<br></div>
