This scheme has been included under the new one.<br><br>The new scheme allows home owners to establish small-scale businesses in both HDB flats and private properties.<br><br>The more common types of businesses that applicants said they are offering include Web design and publishing services, IT consultancies, and real estate and legal services.<br><br>Those who use their home as an office can employ a maximum of two people not living in their home. The services they offer must not disturb the peace and quiet of the neighbourhood.<br><br>Laying out the advantages of the scheme at a home business seminar at Singapore Polytechnic, Dr Balakrishnan said that besides allowing home owners the flexibility to work from their home, it also reduces startup costs in terms of rent and transport, and allows them to spend more time with their families.<br><br>'The interest shown in the Home Office Scheme indicates that people are willing and prepared to try new initiatives and to take some risks,' he said.<br><br>'This augurs well for Singapore and our efforts to nurture a creative and entrepreneurial nation.'<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
