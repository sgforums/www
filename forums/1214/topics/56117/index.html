One seminar cost 4888 dollars!!!<br><br>Turtle trading. Haha. Sounds comical.<br><br><span style="color: red;">extracted from the straits times.</span><br><br>SEPT 1, 2003<br>Psst...25 investors now know 'turtle trading' secrets<br><br>They fork out nearly $5,000 each to attend seminar on lucrative tradingstrategies in global financial markets<br><br>By Azhar Khalid<br>MARKETS CORRESPONDENT<br><br>TO SOME it may sound like a dubious get-rich-quick scheme, but for others, the cloak of mystery that has surrounded an investing technique called 'turtle trading' for the past 20 years is quite enticing.<br><br>Talk of multi-million-dollar profits is a key factor, too.<br><br>So much so that over the weekend, 25 Singaporeans paid $4,888 per person to attend a seminar that allowed them to be inducted into the reportedly lucrative secrets of turtle trading.<br><br>When the system was first devised in the United States in 1983, a group of 14 'turtles' was sworn to secrecy for 10 years. Many were said to have become millionaires. Now the so-called secrets are more widely available - at a price.<br><br>And although its founder US futures trader Richard Dennis is from the US, he is said to have coined the term 'turtle trading' right here in Singapore.<br><br>That is according to one of Mr Dennis' acolytes, Mr Russell Sands, one of the original 'turtles', who conducted the Singapore seminar at the Inter-Continental Hotel.<br><br>Mr Dennis apparently got the inspiration from a visit he made to a turtle farm in Singapore in the early 1980s.<br><br>'At the turtle farm, he saw how some of the baby turtles were crushed at the bottom of the pond by the stronger ones,' Mr Sands said.<br><br>'So when he got back to Chicago, he told his partner that he wanted to grow traders in Chicago like they grow turtles in Singapore, and teach them to become strong traders and survive,' he added.<br><br>Mr Sands claimed that the turtle traders chalked up combined profits of US$180 million (S$318 million) last year alone from dabbling in the futures, bonds and stock markets globally, although the figure cannot be verified.<br><br>Quite clearly, Mr Sands was not about to disclose the 'secrets' of turtle trading to The Straits Times, but he offered a broad-brush description of the technique.<br><br>He said turtle trading is a strategy used to invest in financial markets including futures, equities, bonds and currency markets.<br><br>It uses a combination of technical analysis which looks at trends in price charts, a money management component as well as selective courses in psychology.<br><br>Mr Dennis developed that strategy because he believed that good trading skills could be taught and it was neither some intuitive exercise nor was it a 'gifted' skill endowed to a select few.<br><br>The money management part of the strategy helps traders know how much to buy and sell when they can identify an emerging trend, how big a position to take, when to get into a trade and when to cut losses and square off their positions.<br><br>Trading discipline is a key factor to ensure success using the turtle strategy, he said.<br><br>Another key part of turtle trading is psychology. 'Some people are afraid to take a loss because of ego', he said, and the strategy helps overcome these kinds of human foibles.<br><br>'Some people have studied the market a lot and they think they are smarter than the markets so they get emotional,' he said.<br><br>Despite its mysteries, turtle trading is somewhat modest in its claimed success rate.<br><br>'With turtle trading we don't tell investors that they will win all the time but we tell them they can win 30 per cent of the time and make a lot of money, and when they lose 70 per cent of the time they will lose little,' he said.<br><br>'What it teaches you is to follow the market along and not try to predict it or try to outguess it,' he said.<br><br>'I don't think I am smart enough to know where the market is heading but what we tell the turtles is to follow the market along,' said Mr Sands, who holds an MBA from New York University.<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
