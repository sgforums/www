In the works is a one-stop shop that meets all your licensing needs.<br><br>The project, called the Startup eAdvisor, is the brainchild of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Ministry of Finance, and has about 30 government agencies on board.<br><br>This shop has no physical address. Instead, it is found on the MTI's website.<br><br>Say, you want to set up a cafe. By clicking on that particular business, a list of licences will pop up.<br><br>There is also information on registering your business, incorporating a company and 'cess registration'.<br><br>Other than the compulsory licences you will need, the checklist also prompts you to check if you have to approve your building for fire safety works, get a licence to sell tobacco products or get a permit to operate a kitchen for food preparation, for example.<br><br>This project is just one of several initiatives started by the Government in a bid to promote enterprise.<br><br>News of the website's development emerged at a press conference held yesterday by the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE).<br><br>The site - believed to be the first of its kind in the world - will not only enable businessmen to check what licences they need, but will also allow them to apply and pay for the licences online.<br><br>However, it is still in its early stages. Currently, businessmen can apply for only four licences, such as the CPF's Employer Registration licence, online.<br><br>But come July next year, about 40 licences are expected to be available online. And there are plans for a seamless hook-up with the Registry of Companies and even the Ministry of Manpower - to facilitate businessmen's hiring of foreign workers, for example.<br><br>As well, according to information provided by the MTI, '154 licences identified to be relevant to start-ups have been reviewed to date'.<br><br>The thinking behind this is that the need for various licences is evaluated first, rather than automatically including them.<br><br>This is to minimise the number of licences required, thus increasing efficiency.<br><br>And the plan is that there will be only a one-time payment for multiple licensing fees.<br><br>But for those impatient entrepreneurs out there, take heart - application times are being cut, too.<br><br>The MTI said that the 'average processing time of the licences reviewed has been reduced from three weeks to two weeks. Of the 154 licences, 43 will now be processed in less than three days, and another 42 in under one week'.<br><br>Another improvement also involves reducing the number of supporting documents that applicants need to submit.<br><br>British Chamber of Commerce president Shanker Iyer says: 'At the moment, many businesses have no clue where to look. The idea of coordinating it all in one place will be very welcome.'<br><br>But he adds: 'It would be good if the initiative goes one step further and government grants which are more generic and available to more businesses could also be included.'<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
