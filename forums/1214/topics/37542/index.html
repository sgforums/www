            <div class='col-md body'>There was this girl standing beside me on the same shelf browsing at the CDs that looked awfully familiar.<br><br>I was thinking, Â“No. How could it be?Â”<br><br>Â“Do you also like The Cranberries?Â” That question she asked took me by surprise.<br><br>I looked at the CD in my hand and then back to her and smiled, Â“They are my favourite.Â”<br><br><strong>Six months earlierÂ…</strong><br><br>Â“Santos, arenÂ’t you going to get yourself a girlfriend yet? For heavenÂ’s sake, youÂ’re already 26 and youÂ’re still single!Â”<br><br>I hear that every once time after Â‘The bachelorÂ’. My grandma loves all these kind of shows. In fact, any shows that feature couples, she would watch. And every time after the shows, she would ask me the same question.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m only 26, grandma. Not 62.Â”<br><br>That was my usual reply. IÂ’m only 26. ThereÂ’s still a lot of time to go.<br><br>Â“I sorry, grandma, but IÂ’m very busy these few days. I donÂ’t think I can bring you to the diabetes centre for checkup next week. But I promise IÂ’ll get someone to bring you there.Â”<br><br>Â“Not to worry, the centre has assigned a volunteer to get me there. SheÂ’s the one who brought me home the last time. What a nice girl.Â”<br><br>I can already guess whatÂ’s sheÂ’s going to say next.<br><br>Â“You can bring her out for some dinner sometime you know. And yes, sheÂ’s single also, just like you.Â”<br><br>Â“I will. I will have to thank her myself. SheÂ’s really a great help. WhatÂ’s her name?Â”<br><br>Â“Lisa.Â”<br><br><strong>One week laterÂ…</strong><br><br>Â“Thanks for bringing me home again, Lisa. You want to come in for some tea? I can make some really good tea. My grandson taught me.Â”<br><br>Â“Well, okay.Â” Lisa politely obliged.<br><br>Â“You just sit here and wait for a while.Â”<br><br>With that, grandma went into the kitchen to prepare some tea.<br><br>Â“That pig is still probably sleeping.Â”<br><br>Â“Pig?Â”<br><br>Â“Santos. He works late into the night everyday and sleeps like a dead log into the afternoon. IÂ’ll get him out to thank you. He always said he wanted to thank you himself.Â”<br><br>Grandma just walked into my room and shrugged me awake.<br><br>Â“Hey, LisaÂ’s here. DonÂ’t you want to see her?Â”<br><br>Â“Lisa? SheÂ’s the Â…Â…Â”<br><br>Â“SheÂ’s the volunteer I told you about, pea brain. Now go out.Â”<br><br>My hair was in disarray, but who cares? I dragged myself out of the bed and out into the living room.<br><br>Â“Hello. IÂ’m sorry, I just woke up. IÂ’m Santos. You must be Lisa, right? GrandmaÂ’s been talking a lot about you.Â”<br><br>Strange. She was giggling. Why was she giggling?<br><br>Â“Oh. I bought those underpants for him. ArenÂ’t they cute?Â”<br><br>Good heavens! Now I know why.<br><br>And thatÂ’s how I first got to know Lisa. I was wearing underpants featuring comical red roses in front of her.<br><br>Can things actually get any worst?<br><br>Â“They are very nice, very cute.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">to be continued.......</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Grandma passed the phone over to me.<br><br>Â“For me?Â”<br><br>I took over the phone. It was still ringing. This is bad. This is very bad.<br><br>Â“Who did you call, grandma!?Â” I nearly choked on my coffee. No. I did choke on my coffee.<br><br>Â“Lisa. And now youÂ’re going to ask her out.Â”<br><br>Oh my god! SheÂ’s always doing these things for me. The last time it was Grace. Now whoÂ’s Grace? I found out that she was actually my friend on ICQ when I met up with her. I wondered how grandma found out that I had ICQ or what ICQ even was actually. Now IÂ’m a bit afraid of what grandma can actually do.<br><br>Â“ButÂ…butÂ…Â” Before I could even rebut, I heard her on the line.<br><br>Â“Hello. WhoÂ’s there?Â”<br><br>Â“Hi. This is Santos. Remember me? The guy with the red roses underpants.Â”<br><br>I absolutely had no idea why that came out of my mouth. Well, how else could she have remembered me? I know IÂ’m going to kill myself later.<br><br>I could hear the giggling from her again. Â“Of course I remember you. Haha.Â”<br><br>Â“You know, actually I didnÂ’t really call you.Â” Grandma was staring at me hard.<br><br>Â“DidnÂ’t really call you up to say these things.Â” Things are not going my way.<br><br>Grandma looked at me and whispered, Â“Ask her out.Â”<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>Â“Ask her out or IÂ’ll tell her that you collect Barbie dolls and beanie babies.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s killing me softly with her words.<br><br>That was blackmail. She doesnÂ’t really think about what she says but she always means and carries out her words with action. When she says Barbie dolls, she really means sheÂ’s going to buy them for me. In fact, I have a few baby shirts in my room because the last time she told Grace that I like kids. Good grief.<br><br>IÂ’m like a constant joke. Every girl that she hooks me up with will definitely get entertained by the imaginary life grandma cooked up for me.<br><br>I donÂ’t intend to get myself the dolls, I gave in to the threat.<br><br>Â“Are you free tomorrow? How about you and me go out and catch a movie?Â” I asked.<br><br>Â“Well, okay. IÂ’ll be free in the evening. What are we going to watch? I donÂ’t remember any good movies showing in the cinemas lately.Â”<br><br>Â“How about Red Dragon?Â” Hahaa. No girls would ever want to watch that kind of show. Anthony Hopkins the meat eating doctor. Heheh. Then IÂ’ll just tell grandma that sheÂ’s not free and all those stuff. IÂ’m a genius.<br><br>But it didnÂ’t work this time. Grandma pushed two movie tickets into my coffee stained hand. I stared in horror at the tickets.<br><br>They read Â‘AmelieÂ’ 1145pm.<br><br>My eye twitched. Grandma was a better genius.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">to be continued </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Installment 3</span><br><br>IÂ’m 26 years old. And IÂ’m never short of dates. Blind dates that is. All thanks to my grandma. Sometimes it makes me wonder why grandma doesnÂ’t apply for SDU as a chief executive officer.<br><br>Seriously, I have never been in love all these years. I havenÂ’t really met anyone that is able to ring the bell in my head yet. I wanted to find someone to love of course. I want to get married, of course, but not in this way. I want to do it on my own.<br><br>ItÂ’s 10.20pm. IÂ’m 10 minutes early.<br><br>I love this cafÃ©. They make the best cappuccino in the world. Much better that some other cafÃ©s by the name of starbarks and coughing beans.<br><br>I got myself a large cup of hot cappuccino and sat down on the couch. I like to sniff at the cappuccino. It smells so nice. MmmmÂ…Â…<br><br>Â“Is that guy in orgasm?Â” Two lians walked passed me saying that.<br><br>Â“Buzz off, kidos. CanÂ’t you just let a guy enjoy his cappuccino?Â” I barked back, giving them an additional stare.<br><br>Of course, they walked off. But that was after I brandished my Mohican tattoo on my arm. Pea brains. What do they know about the joy of cappuccino?<br><br>Â“Hi!Â” There was a tap on my shoulder. Oh great! Now all my Â‘qiÂ’ is gone. I read in a particular forum about tapping shoulders. It would make a personÂ’s Â‘qiÂ’ dissipate and the poor dude would be having bad luck for a period of time. Well. Haiz. It has to be me.<br><br>Â“Hello. Have a seat.Â” I replied.<br><br>It was Lisa, of course.<br><br>She was stunning. I think it must be her first time using a lipstick. I think the lipstick smeared a little bit to the right. But other than that, sheÂ’s stunning.<br><br>Â“Sorry I was late. I was caught up with too much work.Â” She apologized.<br><br>Â“YouÂ’re not that late, I was early.Â” My watch read 11.40pm. She was late for 1 hour.<br>Time flies when you are enjoying a good cup of cappuccino.<br><br>Â“Do you want to go in now?Â” I asked her.<br><br>Â“Okay. IÂ’m really sorry.Â” She apologized again.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s okay. Let me get another cup of cappuccino. You want a cup?Â” I knew I needed 2 cups of coffee to keep me awake through this movie.<br><br>Â“Erm. No thanks.Â” She replied. She That girl has no idea what sheÂ’s missing out in this world.<br><br>After I got my second cup, we went up to the cinema.<br>]<br>Â“Popcorns?Â” I asked when I saw people queuing for them.<br><br>She just smiled and shook her head, Â“ I just had my dinner.Â”<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not good to have dinners so late. ItÂ’ll spoil your stomach.Â” I gave her some good advice.<br><br>Â“Sometimes I just canÂ’t help it.Â”<br><br>Â“Well, me too. Haha.Â” I had a spoilt stomach. That was good evidence.<br><br>I took out the movie tickets from my wallet and handed it over to the ticket attendant. I actually almost fainted when I saw the ticket guy.<br><br>Â“Eh. Santos, itÂ’s you again. Everytime come here always bring different girl leh. You power leh. Can teach me how to tackle girls or not? How come you can get so chio one every time.Â” The ticket attendant is DerrickÂ’s younger brother, Mike. Derrick always told me that he sneaks in for free movies when his brother is working. Cheap skate.<br><br>Â“You say enough already or not?Â” I moved my arm over to make my Mohican tattoo obvious to him.<br><br>It didnÂ’t have an effect on him, Â“ Aiyoh. So shy for what? Teach leh? Or introduce me some leh?Â” I canÂ’t seem to shut him up. Looking back at Lisa, I saw that she was laughing. Alright, IÂ’m the joke here. IÂ’m the entertainer again.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ll tell you when IÂ’m free another time.Â” I brushed him aside and left quickly for my cinema hall. I noticed that behind me was a queue IÂ’ve formed, laughing also, at me. Who else can it be?<br><br>We entered the cinema hall quietly as we were late, found our seat and sat down.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s my friendÂ’s younger brother, Mike. DonÂ’t bother too much about him. He likes to talk and joke.Â”<br><br>Â“ OEI. HELLO! WANT TO TALK COCK SING SONG GO OUTSIDE THE CINEMA HOR. LIM BEH TRYING TO WATCH A MOVIE HERE LEH.Â” Someone in front shouted.<br><br>An Ah beng here to watch Â‘AmelieÂ’, a romantic French comedy?<br><br>Sheesh.<br><br>It must be the tap on the shoulder.<br><br><span style="color: red;">to be continued </span></div>
