Many are taking the advice seriously.<br><br>Instead of just going the tried-and-tested way - working in fast-food restaurants and giving tuition - to earn pocket money, some are juggling grades with a business.<br><br>Mr Laurence Kim, 21, for instance, was featured in The Straits Times on Wednesday. He started a printing company before even entering the Singapore Polytechnic three years ago to study banking and financial services. He is now registering an annual turnover of $250,000.<br><br>Student businesses range from exotic gifts to comic shops, and bring in from $300 to $3,000 a month. Money does not seem to be the ultimate goal as starting a business is more about putting what they have learnt in school to practical use.<br><br>Mr Geoffrey Dasilva, course manager for marketing at the polytechnic, says about 20 per cent of its students are venturing into business. 'We encourage this because entrepreneurship is a life-long skill and it's better to learn it early,' he adds.<br><br>On this page and next, Life! profiles four businesses.<br><br>Comic relief, at last<br><br>When Mr Bernard Ang, 25, started G&amp;B Comics four years ago in Bras Basah Road, he had just enrolled at the Nanyang Technological University to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering.<br><br>He had been interested in comics ever since he was a child, and he decided to make money from it.<br><br>With advice on running a business from relatives and friends, he has since embarked on his own trial-and-error journey.<br><br>He opened his shop with blessings and monetary support from his parents. 'I had to borrow more than $5,000 from them,' he says.<br><br>'My grades fell in the first year of school but I learnt to manage my time by the second year,' says Mr Ang, who did not think of giving up the business, even when things were tough in the first year.<br><br>'School was still the priority. I spent less time in the shop if I had big projects and exams,' says Mr Ang, who graduated in July.<br><br>'But I thought if I could do something that would be profitable in the long run, I might as well sacrifice my leisure time now.'<br><br>Opening hours in the first year were flexible as he was the only staff member. Operating hours would change every six months to suit his new school schedule.<br><br>Business picked up steadily and he now has two employees who keep the shop in Bras Basah Complex open every day.<br><br>With the recent popularity of comic-book stories being made into movies (Spider-Man, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen), Mr Ang says business has picked up 'considerably'.<br><br>Declining to reveal figures, he adds: 'I'm making a steady profit. If it goes on like this over the next three to four years, I should be completely stable.'<br><br>He has no plans yet to join the workforce on the strength of his degree qualifications, but wants to see where the market in comics will take him.<br><br>G&amp;B Comics carries American titles such as Marvel, and has 1,000 regular customers.<br><br>Candle in the wind<br><br>Ngee Ann Polytechnic student Yachicko Masda, 22, also runs Gift Licious, a six-month-old online business selling ethnic gifts ( www.giftlicious.com ).<br><br>Concentrating on candle-holders and gift boxes from South-east Asia, she says she set up the company to earn pocket money. It reaps a turnover of $2,000 to $3,000 every three months.<br><br>'I saved $1,000 to start it,' says the business and marketing student. 'My mother lent me about $2,000.'<br><br>She does her buying when she travels every few months to Thailand and Indonesia, her home country. She sources for other products through her friends.<br><br>Her grades are unaffected since she takes care of business only in her leisure time. 'I'd encourage others to start their own businesses while they're young. Every businessman fails once or twice, and it's easier to recover from failure when you're young.'<br><br>She plans to start a wedding planner firm when she graduates with a diploma next year.<br><br>logos in stitches<br><br>Samuel Lim, 22, Don Lui, 24, and Desmond See, 23, are the partners in Porcupine Design, a T-shirt printing and embroidery business.<br><br>The company, which has its office in Beach Road, was set up at a cost of $50,000 last year. They borrowed from their parents and relatives.<br><br>Mr Lui was studying shipbuilding at Ngee Ann Polytechnic then and now mans the shop full-time.<br><br>Mr Lim and Mr See are pursuing their degrees in arts and social sciences at the National University of Singapore. They expect to graduate in 2005.<br><br>Mr Lui was already in the embroidery and printing business for five months when the other two asked him to become partners and expand.<br><br>They bought a new embroidery machine and Porcupine Design was born. The 10-month-old business focuses on T-shirt design and printing. Their work involves logo-printing on T-shirts.<br><br>'Even motorcycle groups have ordered from us,' says Mr Lim.<br><br>Working hours are not fixed. 'Don opens the shop,' says Mr Lim. 'And when our classes are over, Desmond and I rush down to help, and Don can leave if he wants to.'<br><br>They each take home about $1,000 per month after accounting for expenses, including $2,400 in rent.<br><br>Mr Lim says: 'Studies to us is not everything. There are things we learnt in this business that books could never teach.'<br><br>They get about 20 orders per month, which works out to selling about 800 T-shirts per month.<br><br>t for three<br><br>One-year-old streetwear company 065 Clothing takes its name from Singapore's telephone country code and is run by three students.<br><br>Lucius Young, 19, and brother Daniel, 17, study interactive media design and media production at Temasek Polytechnic while their pal Linus Koh, 17, is completing his N levels at Chai Chee Secondary School.<br><br>The three in-line skaters met through their sport and have a 'crew' of 11 friends.<br><br>'We initially wanted to do T-shirts just for our crew,' says Lucius. 'But we found that it was expensive, so we thought setting up a company would make the expense worthwhile.'<br><br>The three friends pooled together $1,800 to start the venture without any help from their parents.<br><br>'Our parents are supportive but we wanted the company to be completely our own,' says Lucius.<br><br>School and business seem to go hand in hand for the three. They are largely self-taught in fashion design but Lucius' training in media production at Temasek Polytechnic has come in handy to finetune their creations.<br><br>'Our grades don't slip because there are three of us,' says Lucius.<br><br>Koh adds: 'If one of us has exams, the others will pick up the slack.'<br><br>The 065 range is sold at Fresh, a shop in Queensway Shopping Centre which caters to the skater community, and their website.<br><br>The company takes in between $300 and $400 a month, which they pump back into the business.<br><br>Last month, they supplied 30 T-shirts to Fresh, and 20 have been sold so far.<br><br>To build goodwill, 065 Clothing sponsored four of their T-shirts as prizes for an in-line skating competition this year.<br><br>Asked if they want to expand their business overseas, Lucius says: 'The smart thing to do right now is to concentrate on Singapore and build on the market here.'<br><br>They plan to branch out into caps and accessories.<br><br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.
