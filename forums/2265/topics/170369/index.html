            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chengdu</strong><br><br>Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province and a sub-provincial city, located in southwest China, and bordering Tibet. Its exact location is between 102Â°54' - 104Â°53' east longitude and 30Â°5' - 31Â°26' north latitude.<br><br>Chengdu has an area of 12 300 kmÂ². The GDP per capita was Â¥20625 (ca. US$2503) in 2004, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.<br><br>The city is a political and economic center of southwest China. It is famous for its numerous hot pot restaurants and teahouses, which can be found on many street corners.<br><br><strong>Population</strong><br><br>Throughout Chinese history, Chengdu has been a city with a large number of people for hundreds of years. By 2004, as the statistical data show, the population has reached as large as 10 596 900, which made it to be the city with the fourth largest population in China, just following Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing. By the end of 2004, there were 5 381 700 males, and 5 215 200 females.<br><br>There were close to 200 long-term foreign residents (not including Chinese from Hong Kong or Taiwan) living in the city in late 2004 according to unofficial US Consultate estimates.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>More than four thousand years ago, the prehistorical Bronze Age culture of San Xing Dui (4800–3100 BP) established itself in this region. Zizhu city (Zi Zhu Cheng) was one of the early settlements. Some believe that this culture is related to the BA culture of West Asia.<br><br>In the early 4th century BC, the king of the ancient Shu moved his capital to the city's current location. He was inspired by the ancient story of King Tai of Zhou, Grandfather of King Wu of Zhou, moving his capital. History recorded King Tai of Zhou's move as "it took a year to become a town; it took 2 years to become a capital". Following this, king of Shu named the new city as "Cheng Du", which means "become a capital" (In Chinese, word "cheng" means "become", "du" means "capital").<br><br>After the conquest of Shu by the State of Qin in 316 BC, a new city was founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi, which marked the beginning of contemporary Chengdu. It was renamed Yi Zhou during the Han Dynasty.<br><br>Liu Bei founded the kingdom of Shuhan (220-263) in this city.<br><br>During the Tang Dynasty, both the "Poet-God" Li Bai and the "Poet-Sage" Du Fu spent some part of their lives in Chengdu. Du Fu constructed the celebrated "Cao Tang" (or grass-hut) in the second year of his four year stay (759-762). But today's Cao Tang, a rather sumptuous house in the traditional style, was initially constructed in 1078 in memory of Du Fu. Chengdu was the birthplace of the first widely used paper money in the world (Northern Song Dynasty, around A.D. 960).<br><br>Two more rebel leaders, one around the end of Song Dynasty, the other near the end of Ming Dynasty, set up the capitals of their short-lived kingdoms here, called Da Shu and Da Xi, respectively.<br><br>In more recent times, Chengdu was the last city in mainland China to be held by the Kuomintang. Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defence of the city at Chengdu Central Military Academy, until December 10, 1949 when the People's Liberation Army took the city and the Nationalist Chinese government fled to Taiwan.<br><br><strong>Alias</strong><br><br>The Brocade City (Jin Cheng)<br>In the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC - 23 AD), brocade produced in Chengdu enjoyed great popularity among the royal and elite class in China. Emperor installed Jin-Guan (an official in charge of brocade production) to oversee brocade production in Chengdu. Since then, Chengdu has been called "Jin-Guan Cheng" (Brocade Official's City), or in its short form, "Jin Cheng" (Brocade city).<br><br>and<br><br>The City of Hibiscus (Rong Cheng)<br>In the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907-960), Mengchang, the king of the Later Shu Kingdom, ordered the planting of hibiscus on the fortress wall surrounding the city. After this, Chengdu started being referred as the City of Hibiscus. Nowadays, the hibiscus is still the city flower of Chengdu.<br><br><strong>Colleges and universities</strong><br><br>Sichuan University (Founded in 1896)<br>Southwest Jiaotong University (Founded in 1896)<br>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China<br>Southwestern University of Finance and Economics<br>Southwest University for Nationalities<br>Sichuan Normal University<br>Chengdu University of Technology<br>Chengdu University of TCM<br>Sichuan Conservatory of Music<br>Chengdu University of Information Technology<br>Chengdu Sports University<br>Xihua University<br>Chengdu University<br>Chengdu Medical College<br><br>Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed<br><br><strong>Du Jiang Yan Irrigation System located near chengdu,China,became one of the World Cultural Heritage sites together with Mount Qingcheng in 2000.</strong><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Dujiangyan.jpg"><br><br><strong>Jingjiang River and Anshun Peaceful and Fluent Bridge in Chengdu,China</strong><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Jingjiang.JPEG"><br><br><strong>Jinli Street in Chengdu,China whitch is near Wu Hou Ci.</strong><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Jingli.jpeg"><br><br><strong>Location of Chengdu</strong><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/Chengdu_dot.png/800px-Chengdu_dot.png"><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Chengdu.png"></div>
