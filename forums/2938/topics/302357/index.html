            <div class='col-md body'>Hello guys and girls, although this topic had been quite cold and quiet already. But due to our project, we must talk about it.<br><br>I am Chee Seng from UIR class P06<br><br>The impacts of the integrated resort (IR) on Singapore's tourism sectors definitely is in term of the<br><br>1) Increase in revenue earned as foreign tourists come to Singapore and spend their money in our country due to the more attraction of the IR. As for my resource, the government predicted that an increase of around 2-3 million of visitors.<br><br>2) Help in the unemployment rate as the IR will need alot of people , and it predicted around 35,000 jobs will be created. Like the contruction sector, hotel management staffs and etc.<br><br>3) More business opporuntities in either the tourism sectors and other industires, as the tourism sector will need an increase demand for the services and facilities, from places of interest to hospitlity service like hotels, F&amp;B outlets and gift shops. So there will be more business opporuntities created and can being explore by our industry to earn profit from it</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I am Rachel and I am from UIR class PO1 and this is part of my assignment.<br><br>I believe the IRs will cause an impact in Singapore's tourism sector but I believe it will not be a very significant impact. One professor mentioned that according to the 'tourism area life-cycle hypothesis', Singapore's tourism industry has reached a 'matured' stage and hence, there will be little change unless a large scale rejuvenation is carried out.<br>Yes, the IR will cause an increase in the number of tourists arrivals and their spending, however, the increase will not be significant.<br><br>Furthermore, the competition is intense. With Hong Kong's Disneyland due to be up soon as well as competition from Genting, Malaysia, Singapore may have to find a way to strategize and hopefully by then, the concept of the IR will still be feasible. However, based on the evidence of economic impact studies conducted in other countries such as the United States suggests that tourist numbers and spending do increase with the developement of casino resort.<br><br>Another professor was asked for his comments on the issue and he stated that the conferences and conventions held at the IR would be the main draw rather than the casino and I agree with him. Singapore is a business hub and therefore, many foreign delegates come and have meetings here, therefore, I believe that it will be the main draw compared to the casino where there is intense competition.</div>

It will definitely help to boost Singapore economy and tourists will be flocking in to visit this new attraction. The IRs will also improve employment rate.<br><br>However, there's some downsides like an increase in problem gambling and broken families. These concern has been address as governments will take steps to mitigate the this problem.<br><br>IRs will definitely boost tourism growth, help in creating more jobs and teaching Singaporeans about the risks and folly of gambling.<br><br>huijoo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

This shows how big an impact is has on the tourism industry.<br><br>Could the tourism industry also be referring to the travel agencies and airline companies? If that is the case, then everyone could be making a profit out of the presence of the IR.</div>

              <p>Hi, Im noor hakim from UIR class P09</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What ive found out about the integrated resorts in Singapore is that by the year 2015, Singapore is targeting to attract 17 million visitors and generate S$30 billion in tourism receipts. This is definitely good news fr the tourism sector and economy as a whole.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More hotel rooms will be needed to accomodate the tourist coming to Singapore. In terms of air capacity, the opening of Terminal 3 at Changi Airport willl boost our annual passenger handling capacity to 64 million, almost double the passengers handled by the airport last year..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of manpower, the two IRs combined are expected to create some 50 000 to 60 000 jobs when the two IRs are fully functional.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To summarise, our tourism sector is set to enjoy a period of strong growth and set to become even more vibrant. Furthermore, more jobs will be created to solve the unemployment rate in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Hello, I'm Mindy from UIR P03</p>
              <p>I have a question regarding the integrated resorts in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As we all know that there is 1 project singapore is working on recently which has a casino. It is understandable that singapore wants to earn or money and this casino is said to be able to increase the number of tourists and increase the annual GDP and will also help in employment. But casino is a place where people gamble and this will attract many gamblers to come to singapore. <strong>What will happen then? </strong>There are many positive impact but there is this <strong>1 problematic negative impact that may cause trouble in Singapore</strong>. This will cause social impact on the community.</p>
              <p>I know that people will have to pay $100 membership fee before they can enter the casino, but that amount isn't much. Gamblers can borrow that amount of money easily from their friends or relatives. So how effective is that. And if the government increase the cost of the membership fee, who will want to come to Singapore just to gamble? they can go to other countries like malaysia or indonesia which is also very close to Singapore. So, is that $100 membership fee really that effective?</p>

              <p>what i have found is that Religious groups and social workers voiced their disapproval at the negative social impact of gambling.</p>
              <p>The Government however, promised to have a proper and strict safeguard to limit the social impact of gambling, among others exorbitant entrance fee and the casinos would not extend credit to local population.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think that despite the government taking such measures, there would still be some people who will find loopholes within these measures and gamble their life away. Like what Mindy said in an earlier post regarding the $100 membership fee to enter the casino; how effective is imposing that membership fee going to be? $100 is a small amount to desperate gamblers who are willing to do anything to gamble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not implying that everybody would end up this way with the completion of the integrated resort. The IR has it's plus points as well. Gambling is something that people in the masses do, and this would be something that can attract tourists into the country, thus improving the economy greatly. Despite the many objections raised by religious groups and social workers, I think that the IR would be a success. I'm sure the Singapore government would not do anything that would affect the economy and growth of Singapore negatively.</p>

              <p>Our tourism 
                      industry has managed pretty well without a casino so far. So, just a few questions that I need your opinions on..</p>

                      presence of a casino lead to an increase in law and order problems?</p>
              <p>Is this a good gamble for our society? Regarding any negative social impacts on our society, that is.</p>
