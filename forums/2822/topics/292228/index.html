            <div class='col-md body'>One fine day, an old couple around the age of 70, walks into a lawyer's office.<br>Apparently, they are there to file a divorce.<br><br>Lawyer was very puzzled, after having a chat with them, he got their story....<br>This couple had been quarreling all their 40 over yrs of marriage nothing ever seems to go right.<br><br>They hang on because of their children, afraid that it might affect their up-bringing. Now, all their children have already grown up, have their own family, there's nothing else the old couple have to worry about, all they wanted is to lead their own life free from all these years of unhappiness from their marriage, so both agree on a divorce....<br><br>Lawyer was having a hard time trying to get the papers done, because he felt that after 40 yrs of marriage at the age of 70, he couldnt understand why the old couple would still want a divorce..<br><br>While they were signing the papers, the wife told the husband..<br>"I really love u, but i really cant carry on anymore, I'm sorry.."<br>"Its o.k, i understand.." said the husband. Lookin at this, the lawyer suggested a dinner together, just 3 of them,wife thought, why not, since they are still gonna be friends..<br><br>At the dining table, there was a silence of awkardness.<br>The first dish was roasted chicken, immediately, the old man took the drumstick for the old lady.."take this, its your favourite.."<br><br>Looking at this, the lawyer thought maybe theres still a chance, but the wife was frowning when she answer.."<br>This is always the problem, you always think so highly of yourself, never thought about how I feel, dont you know that i hate drumsticks?"<br><br>Little did she know that, over the years, the husband have been trying all ways to please her, little did she know that drumsticks was the husband's favourite. Little did he know that she never thought he understand her at all, little did he know that she hates drummsticks even though all he wants is the best for her.<br><br>That night, both of them couldnt sleep, toss and turn, toss and turn...after hours, the old man couldnt take it anymore, he knows that he still loves her, and he cant carry on life without her, he wants her back, he wants to tell her, he is sorry, he wanted to tell her "i love you"...<br><br>He picks up the phone, starting dialing her number....ringing never stops..he never stop dialing....<br><br>On the other side, she was sad, she couldnÂ’t understand how come after all these years, he still doesnt understand her at all, she loves him a lot, but she just cant take it anymore....phone's ringing, she refuses to answer knowing that its him..."whats the point of talking now that its over...i have ask for it and now i wanna keep it this way, if not i will lose face.."she thought...still ringing...she have decided to pull out the cord...<br><br>Little did she remember, he have heart problems...<br><br>The next day, she received news that he had passed away...she rushed down to his apartment, saw his body, lying on the couch still holding on to the phone...he had a heart attack when he was still trying to get through her phone line....<br><br>As sad as she could be...she will have to clear his belongings...when she was looking thru the drawers, she saw this insurance policy, dated from the day they got married, with the beneficiary being her... And together in those file, there was this note...<br>"To my dearest wife, by the time you're reading this, I'm sure I'm no longer around, I bought this policy for you, though the amount is only $100k, I hope it will be able to help me continue my promise that i have made when we got married, I might not be around anymore, I want this amount of money to continue taking care of you, just like the way I will if I could have live longer. I want you to know Iwill always be around, by your side... I love you"<br><br>Tears flowed like river......<br><br>"When you love someone, let them know... You never know what will happen the next minute.... Learn to build a life together.. Learn to love each other. For who they are.. not what they are..."<br><br></div>
