She supports the distressed and hungry, rescues the unfortunate from peril, and gives comfort and aid wherever it is needed. GUAN-YIN's work would put many a charity to shame Â— and she doesn't ask for donations.<br><br>Otherwise known as AVALOKITESVARA in India, she had finally attained Enlightenment after much non-struggling with non-things. She was just about to enter Heaven to join the other BUDDHAS when she heard the cries of the poor unsaved souls back on Earth.<br><br>Her heart touched by pity, she vowed never to rest until every single soul was brought to Buddhahood. The magnitude of contemplating this task made her head explode into a thousand pieces, but she was perfectly fine after BUDDHA gave her a few Aspirin Sutras.<br><br>Turning aside from Heaven, GUAN-YIN went to the sacred island of Potuoshan and embarked on her new career. This selfless sacrifice brought her much credit, and reverence which persists to this day.<br><br>As a deity often called upon to appear in the most unusual and difficult situations, GUAN-YIN has the ability to transform into any living thing. In fact she's better known in India as a male. But she often appears in female form to avoid gossip Â— and because she likes it. Like her Japanese equivalent KANNON, GUAN-YIN is known as a female deity, and has taken on a modest amount of fertility work. Childless women pray to her for offspring. In this respect she is also a Goddess of Rice, filling it with her own milk to give nourishing tit-bits.<br><br>The Bodhisattva who saves us from the Three Calamities and the Eight Disasters, GUAN-YIN is always on call, and has appeared in many a Chinese tale to help the likes of MONKEY out of tricky situations. His Â— or her Â— peaceful benevolence has soothed many a worried brow. We are full of admiration.<br><br>VITAL STATISTIX<br>Area or people: n/a<br>Location : China<br>Gender : Female<br>Category : Deity<br>Pronunciation : Goo-arn Yeen<br>Alternative names : CHUAN-YIN, KUAN-YIN, KWAN-YIN<br>Attributes : Coming soon<br>Mystic number : 2909 (a)<br></div>
