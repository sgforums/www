            <div class='col-md body'>Our worldly priorities can be ironic. We place first what we think we want most; then we discover that our wanting is insatiable.<br>Paying of the house, writing the book, making the business successful, setting up the retirement, taking the big trip - things that<br>are temporarily on top of our list of priorities completely consume our time and energy. And then at the end of life, we look back and<br>wonder what all those things meant.<br><br>It is like someone who travels in a foreign country and pays his way in that country's currency. Then he gets to the border and is surprised to learn that the country's currency can't be exchanged or carried across. Like that, our worldly possessions and achievements cannot be carried through the portal of death. If we rely on them, we will find ourselves suddenly impoverished and bereft. The only currency that has any value when we travel across the threshold of death is our spiritual attainment.<br><br>Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, Life In Relation To Death</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The principles of Buddhism allow us to have an accurate, deep, and realistic response to uneasy situations. The word "buddha" literally means awakened one. It's about arriving at the furthest shore, and we talk about it in many poetic ways. We talk about our life being like a journey across the great ocean. There's a funny story about that, by the way. Here we know what an ocean is; in Tibet, they don't. One of the greatest teachers in Tibet is His Holiness Jigme Puntsok Rinpoche, who in fact visited Nova Scotia back in the early nineties. The first place he arrived in the West was Hawaii, which seemed appropriate--how many times has he used the example of an ocean in his teachings? Many, many times--I'll answer that one for you. Anyway, here's this incredibly great meditation teacher straight out of Tibet, and he got off the plane, and he hadn't even bathed, and people felt like they should take him right to the ocean. They get him to the beach, along with his entourage of many monks, and then they start walking on the sand towards the ocean. Everybody's still wearing their heavy wool robes, walking. Jigme Puntsok stops and looks, and everybody's just waiting to hear what profound thing is he going to say when he finally sees the ocean for the first time, and he says, "It's so big!" After all those metaphors it was interesting for him to experience directly what the ocean is. Within the Buddhist tradition, we call that direct experience. We talk about things, we practice, and we try to contemplate and understand, yet the direct experience has to come, even for a great teacher. We have to see the ocean ourselves. When that happens, it's intimate, it's nonfabricated, and it's direct.<br><br>What does it mean to be fully awakened, what does it mean to be truly liberated? What does it mean to be a Buddha? On the one hand, Buddha was this historical person who went on a profound journey that inspires us to do this same. In him we have a historical reference point. On the other hand, buddha is a reference point within all of us; everybody fundamentally is buddha--awake. There is no higher being as such. The word "buddha" literally refers to our awakened state of mind, our true mind, our mind of enlightenment. This mind of enlightenment has many aspects--profundity, wisdom, compassion, awareness, mindfulness. We train and work with all these aspects, and as we go along, we eventually encounter our experience directly, like Jigme Puntsok Rinpoche seeing the ocean for the first time. Through meditation and contemplation we come to various levels of understanding and sooner or later we're able to say, "Oh, I heard someone talk about it, I read it in a book, I contemplated it, and now it's real." The meaning of reality begins to influence our conduct, our action. We begin to approach our life in a different way. This is the Buddhist path--hearing, understanding, and experiencing what is real.<br><br>His Excellency Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche<br>extracted from his teaching at<br>Turning our mind towards the Buddha section<br>at http://www.mipham.com<br><br></div>
