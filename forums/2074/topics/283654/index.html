Of course, ultimate all dharmas point only to the Mind, one who seeks dharma outside Mind is an externalist. But when condition arises for a particular lineage or dharma to be spread, it happens... and that is the skillful means that the patriarches made for sentient beings.<br><br>Wld also look forward to reading others' views.<br><br>Update: btw, the number of monks in Singapore are very very few. Monks are actually very rare in Singapore. How can you even compare to places like Thailand where a large portion of their population are monks? If more and more Singaporeans enter monkhood to help the lays and Buddhism, that wld even be better. Or like Myanmar in the recent case we've see, half a million of their population are monks.</div>
