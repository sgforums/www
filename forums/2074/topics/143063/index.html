            <div class='col-md body'>what is the meaning of bodhisattva ,according to ven shengyen ,<br>they are being who vowed to help beings without concern for their personal benefit.<br><br>you see in everyday life , in our working life , we meet different kinds of people<br>and different kinds of people show different needs and want.<br><br>As a Buddhist ,the difficulty lies in how to help other ,but not overdoing it<br><br>this takes time and practice ,and sometimes we are not appreciated in our effort at all<br><br>clearly ,as a clever Buddhist ,one should keep a low profile ,and never to loudly proclaim that we are Buddhist.There are people who just like to judge people based on level of conduct to their conviction(religion),but they are just not seeing themselves as turpidities.<br><br>the real practice all begins in our heart,if we willing to take each day as a practice and getting corrupted by those insiduous people , we will see one day those that work with us ,mellow down and turned humble.<br><br>our existence in this world is temporary ,and why we are in this certain company working is also due to our previous karma .with this in mind ,always have a forgiving mind to other who may comes to hurt us verbally and in action<br><br>dealing with difficult people<br>alot of people do encounter people who just want to try to be difficult with us<br>we need to analyse the difficulties he/she impose was it to the personal or for<br>work matter .Sometimes it proves too much a challenge to sell ones idea ,but we just have to try.Our working relationship with other is but impermanence,<br>if we just cannot tackle them in our lives , we should gracefully avoid conflict or even leave the department or company<br><br>using 5 precepts as a guide , we must know never to break of violate the precepts as it will bring harm to sentient beings and even to ourselves<br><br>Using Diamond sutra analogy "all pheonomenon ,are like dream , illusion ,bubbles and shadow, like dews ,and lightning , thus one should reflect upon ."<br><br></div>
