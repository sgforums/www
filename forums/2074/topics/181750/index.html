His Holiness was the Supreme Head of the Nyingma Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, which traces back to Padmasambhava. As the founder of numerous Yeshe Nyingpo meditation centers, his activities were extensive, bridging cultures and embodying centuries of wisdom. His Holiness was a prolific scholar and a Terton, or spiritual treasure revealer, responsible for bringing forth many prayers, unique for their potency and beauty, and particularly beneficial for our time. His reincarnation, born in 1991, has been formally recognized by the H. H. the Dalai Lama. The power of his aspiration is such that his emanations benefit beings whenever circumstances are right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The next one - The Sakya Lineage Master<br><br>Sakya Trizin Rinpoche<br><br><img src="http://www.kalachakranet.org/images/sakyatrizin.jpg"><br><br>The KhÃ¶n family lineage, to which His Holiness Sakya Trizin belongs, has a long history extending back to pre-Buddhist Tibet, when they were instrumental in the dissemination of BÃ¶n. This great lineage traces its descent back to the earliest times when three "Gods of the Realm of Clear Light" (brothers) descended from the heavens to the land which was later to be known as Tibet. The five generations from Yuring, the second of these brothers, to Yapang Kye are referred to as The Divine Line of Clear Light. After engaging in a war with the Rakshas, Yapang Kye married a Raksha princess Yadruk Silima who bore him a son named Khon Bar Kye, meaning "he who is born amid strife". For reason of this ancestral history their descendants came variously to be known as "Lharig", meaning "The Celestial Race"; or as "Khon gyi dung", meaning "The Family of Conquerors". And for reason that they were, in a later epoch, instrumental in establishing the Sakya Order (of Tibetan Buddhism), they are also known as the Sakyapa Lineage.<br><br>The son of KhÃ¶n Bar Kye, named KhÃ¶n Palpoche, was an influential minister of the Tibetan King Tri-song De-tsen in the eighth century. Another KhÃ¶n, Luyi Wangpo, was one of the first seven Tibetans to receive ordination from the abbot Shantarakshita, a vinaya lineage which has survived within the Nyingma tradition until now. KhÃ¶n Luyi Wangpo, together with Dorje Rinchen (a grandson of KhÃ¶n Palpoche) were both disciples of the great master Padmasambhava, and for this reason the lineage of the meditational deity Vajrakilaya continues within the Sakya tradition to the present time.<br><br>Following the persecution of Buddhism by the Tibetan King Langdarma, Atisha, a Pandita from Bengal, travelled to Tibet by invitation in the year 1042 after having consulted the goddess Tara. While on his journey he stopped in an empty valley and prostrated many times, experiencing a vision of the syllable Hri, seven Dhi Syllables, and the syllable Hum on the side of the mountain. He prophesied the future existence of Sakya Monastery at this place, and that it would witness one incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, seven of Manjushri, and one of Vajrapani. It was another member of the KhÃ¶n lineage, KÃ¶nchog Gyalpo who in the year 1073 founded the Sakya Monastery here in Upper Tibet (known in Tibetan as "Toe"). The monastery was so named on account of the pale tawny colour of the upper landscape at that particular spot. KÃ¶nchog Gyalpo was thus the first "Sakya Trizin" (Throne-holder of Sakya).<br><br>It was the latter's illustrious son Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1102-115<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> who inherited the precious Lam Dre (Path and Fruit) teachings from the siddha Zhangton Chobar, since when this core system of sutric and tantric instruction has been handed down through successive generations of gurus within the Sakya Order to modern times. A number of important Masters in the Lam Dre lineage have also been members of the KhÃ¶n family.<br><br><a href="http://www.eclipse.co.uk/~rs1042/biog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclipse.co.uk/~rs1042/biog.htm</a><br><br></div>
