            <div class='col-md body'>So guys, it has been a long time ever since i've posted on this forum. Maybe i post something out here for us to discuss or argue or debate, which ever word is best suited here pls quote the word and your views. Open to all...<br><br>Basically my views on this is that nowadays humans and other realms in this saha world do have one common action. Is that, if we dun see, we dun hear or we dun feel with our mind aka heart for chinese, will be consider fake and will beginning to think of all pessimistic things. Now this is consider something call creating bad karma. Creating bad karma got many factors. Examples like our past enemies that we've made from previous life where they come finding us now for revenge. Another could be now, present state, they come fighting u for all sorts of "nonsense" which could be from health to work or even studies.<br><br>Yup, all these could be either our negligence or becuz of those enemies aka yuan qing zhai zu in chinese. So many factors around us, so in order not to allow them disturb us from our normal routine. We need to merge our 3 main senses out of the 6 organs. mouth, mind and body as well as what we hear also. This needs further clarification before u act. U see, u hear all rubbish, our hearts remains calm, nothing will happen on us. Ppl normal are so busybody, anything also wanna care, what if they care or dun care, no diff. What is the diff? It could cut down the rate of creating bad karma.<br><br>Above is my pt of views, what are yours?? Care and share to make a better world...</div>
