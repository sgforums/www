May every link in Amida Buddha's golden chain of love be bright and strong and may we all attain perfect peace<br><br>"Shinran Shonin, our master in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, lived in Japan from 1173 to 1263. Like ourselves, he lived in a time of war, anxiety and great human suffering. In order to bring the freedom and emotional release of the Buddhist message to the ordinary lay people of his day, he greatly simplified the Buddhist teaching.<br>Following the lead of his honourable teacher, Honen Shonin, Shinran taught that Buddhist 'Enlightenment' could be attained through the 'Easy Path' of reciting the Name of Buddha, 'Namo Amida Butsu', with a sincere mind aspiring for birth. The birth he spoke of was 'Birth in the Pure Land of Amida Buddha' at the time of our human death.<br><br>Shinran taught that conditions in the human world had become so corrupt that it was no longer possible for ordinary people to achieve Enlightenment through their own efforts. Monks and holy sages might be able to carry out sufficient religious practice in the dark Age of Mappo (the age of decline); but most of us, including Shinran himself, could not. We must rely on the Transferred Merit coming to us across aeons of time from the Great Practice of Amida Buddha.<br><br>Thus, the religious stories of Shin Buddhism all emphasize that there is no 'self effort' practice necessary for us to be born into the Pure Land at our human death, or to experience the 'Pure Land Mind' during our human life. All that is required is the recitation of 'Namo Amida Butsu' entrusting oneself to the power of the Primal Vow."<br><br>NAMANDABU</div>
