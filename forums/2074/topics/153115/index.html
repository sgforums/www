            <div class='col-md body'>Verses on the Faith Mind<br>Hsin Hsin Ming by Seng-T'san<br>The Third Patriarch of Zen<br><br>The Great Way is not difficult<br><br>for those who have no preferences.<br><br>When love and hate are both absent<br><br>everything becomes clear and undisguised.<br><br>Make the smallest distinction, however,<br><br>and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.<br><br>If you wish to see the truth<br><br>then hold no opinions for or against anything.<br><br>To set up what you like against what you dislike<br><br>is the disease of the mind.<br><br>When the deep meaning of things is not understood,<br><br>the mindÂ’s essential peace is disturbed to no avail.<br><br>The Way is perfect like vast space<br><br>where nothing is lacking and nothing in excess.<br><br>Indeed, it is due to our choosing to accept or reject<br><br>that we do not see the true nature of things.<br><br>Live neither in the entanglements of outer things,<br><br>nor in inner feelings of emptiness.<br><br>Be serene in the oneness of things and such<br><br>erroneous views will disappear by themselves.<br><br>When you try to stop activity by passivity<br><br>your very effort fills you with activity.<br><br>As long as you remain in one extreme or the other<br><br>you will never know Oneness.<br><br>Those who do not live in the single Way<br><br>fail in both activity and passivity,<br><br>assertion and denial.<br><br>To deny the reality of things<br><br>is to miss their reality;<br><br>To assert the emptiness of things<br><br>is to miss their reality.<br><br>The more you talk and think about it,<br><br>the further astray you wander from the truth.<br><br>Stop talking and thinking,<br><br>and there is nothing you will not be able to know.<br><br>To return to the root is to find meaning,<br><br>but to pursue appearances is to miss the source.<br><br>At the moment of inner enlightenment<br><br>there is a going beyond appearance and emptiness.<br><br>The changes that appear to occur in the empty world<br><br>we call real only because of our ignorance.<br><br>Do not search for the truth;<br><br>only cease to cherish opinions.<br><br>do not remain in the dualistic state.<br><br>Avoid such pursuits carefully.<br><br>If there is even a trace of this and that,<br><br>of right and wrong,<br><br>the mind-essence ewill be lost in confusion.<br><br>Although all dualities come from the One,<br><br>do not be attached even to this One.<br><br>When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,<br><br>nothing in the world can offend.<br><br>And when a thing can no longer offend,<br><br>it ceases to exist in the old way.<br><br>When no discriminating thoughts arise,<br><br>the old mind ceases to exist.<br><br>When thought objects vanish,<br><br>the thinking-subject vanishes:<br><br>As when the mind vanishes, objects vanish.<br><br>Things are objects because of the subject (mind):<br><br>the mind (subject) is such because of things (object).<br><br>Understand the relativity of these two<br><br>and the basic reality: the unity of emptiness.<br><br>In this Emptiness the two are indistinguishable<br><br>and each contains in itself the whole world.<br><br>If you do not discriminate between coarse and fine<br><br>you will not be tempted to prejudice and opinion.<br><br>To live in the Great Way is neither easy nor<br>difficult.<br><br>But those with limited views are fearful and<br>irresolute:<br><br>the faster they hurry, the slower they go.<br><br>And clinging (attachment) cannot be limited:<br><br>Even to be attached to the idea of enlightenment<br><br>is to go astray.<br><br>Just let things be in their own way<br><br>and there will be neither coming not going.<br><br>Obey the nature of things (your own nature)<br><br>and you will walk freely and undisturbed.<br><br>When the thought is in bondage the truth is hidden<br><br>for everything is murky and unclear.<br><br>And the burdensome practice of judging<br><br>brings annoyance and weariness.<br><br>What benefit can be derived<br><br>from distinctions and separations?<br><br>If you wish to move in the One Way<br><br>do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas.<br><br>Indeed, to accept them fully<br><br>is identical with enlightenment.<br><br>The wise man strives to no goals<br><br>but the foolish man fetters himself.<br><br>There is one Dharma, not many.<br><br>Distinctions arise<br><br>from the clinging needs of the ignorant.<br><br>To seek Mind with the (discriminating) mind<br><br>is the greatest of all mistakes.<br><br>Rest and unrest derive from illusion;<br><br>with enlightenment<br><br>there is no liking and disliking.<br><br>All dualities come from ignorant inference.<br><br>They are like dreams or flowers in air -<br><br>foolish to try to grasp them.<br><br>Gain and loss, right and wrong,<br><br>such thoughts must<br><br>finally be abolished at once.<br><br>If the eye never sleeps,<br><br>all dreams will naturally cease.<br><br>If the mind makes no discriminations,<br><br>the ten thousand things are as they are,<br><br>of single essence.<br><br>To understand the mystery of this One-essence<br><br>is to be released from all entanglements.<br><br>When all things are seen equally<br><br>the timeless Self-essence is reached,<br><br>No comparisons or analogies are possible<br><br>in this causeless, relationless state.<br><br>Consider movement stationary<br><br>and the stationary in motion,<br><br>both movement and rest disappear.<br><br>When such dualities cease to exist<br><br>Oneness itself cannot exist.<br><br>To this ultimate finality<br><br>no law or description applies.<br><br>For the unified mind in accord with the way<br><br>all self-centered striving ceases.<br><br>Doubts and irresolutions vanish<br><br>and life in true faith is possible.<br><br>With a single stroke we are freed from bondage:<br><br>Nothing clings to us and we hold to nothing.<br><br>All is empty, clear, self-illuminating,<br><br>with no exertion of the mindÂ’s power.<br><br>Here thought, feeling,<br><br>knowledge and imagination are of no value.<br><br>In this world of suchness<br><br>there is neither self nor other-than-self.<br><br>To come directly into harmony with this reality<br><br>just say when doubt rises "not two".<br><br>In this "not two" nothing is separate,<br><br>nothing is excluded.<br><br>No matter when or where,<br><br>enlightenment means entering this truth.<br><br>And this truth is beyond extension<br><br>or diminution in time and space:<br><br>In it a single thought is ten thousand years.<br><br>Emptiness here, emptiness there,<br><br>but the infinite universe<br><br>stands always before your eyes.<br><br>Infinitely large and infinitely small;<br><br>no difference, for definitions have vanished<br><br>and no boundaries are seen.<br><br>So too with Being and non-Being.<br><br>DonÂ’t waste time in doubts and arguments<br><br>That have nothing to do with this.<br><br>One thing, all things,<br><br>move among and intermingle without distinction.<br><br>To live in this realization<br><br>is to be without anxiety about non-perfection.<br><br>To live in this faith is the road to non-duality,<br><br>because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind.<br><br>Words!<br><br>The Way is beyond language,<br><br>for in it there is<br><br>no yesterday<br><br>no tomorrow<br><br>no today.<br><br>Translated from the Chinese by Richard B. Clarke<br></div>
