            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Diamonds Grading</strong><br><br>It is only possible to accurately color grade a diamond if it is unmounted, placed on a white background and compared with a set of standard graded diamonds. A mounted diamond picks up the color the metal and always looks better set in white gold or platinum. Even then, one can only approximate the color of a mounted diamond within a range of a few grades.<br><br>The diamond color grades are as follows:<br>D, E, F: Colorless. Loose diamonds appear colorless.<br>G, H, I, J: Near Colorless. When mounted in a setting may appear colorless to the untrained eye.<br>K, L, M: Faint Yellowish Tint. Smaller diamonds look colorless when mounted. Diamonds of 1/2 carat or more show traces of color.<br>N - R: Very Light Yellowish Tint and<br>S - Z: Tinted Light Yellow. These diamonds show increasingly yellow or brownish tints and appear very "off-white".<br><br>Diamonds with distinct natural body colors other than brown or black are considered "fancy diamonds" and some bring higher prices than the finest colorless diamonds. A bright red diamond of less than a carat brought almost a million dollars at auction in 1987.<br><br>Discerning the difference in color from D down to H in a mounted stone without direct comparison is very difficult. Yet a large D stone may cost three times an H stone of the same weight.<br><br>Because of other factors that contribute to the beauty of a diamond, there are many beautiful stones below an M color such as a very light yellow called "champagne" and a darker yellow/brown called "cognac".<br><br>In diamonds over one carat, the color effects the value more than in smaller stones as it is more apparent. But choosing a lower color grade will reduce the price, and there will be little, if any, visible difference when the stone is mounted.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Diamond Clarity Grading</strong><br><br>A diamond's clarity grade is actually a flaw-grade and refers to the tiny imperfections present when the stone was originally formed by nature. If no flaws can be seen under 10X magnification, such as with a diamond loupe, it is considered "flawless".<br><br>There are 13 classes of flaws internal (inclusions) and external (blemishes), but the most common are dark spots of foreign material, tiny internal cracks called "feathers", and external nicks or chips.<br><br>The diamond clarity grades are as follows:<br>FL: Flawless. Cannot be seen with a 10X diamond loupe.<br>IF: Internally Flawless. Has tiny nicks or scratches that can be polished out.<br>VVS1, VVS2: Very, Very Slightly Included. Very, very difficult for a qualified observer to see under 10X magnification.<br>VS1, VS2: Very Slightly Included. Very small inclusions, very difficult to see by a qualified observer.<br>SI1, SI2: Slightly Included. Can be seen fairly easily by a qualified observer with a 10X loupe, and in some cases without magnification.<br>I1, I2, I3: Imperfect. Inclusions can be seen with the naked eye, but can be desirable stones at a much lower cost if they are brilliant and lively. Because I3 is the lowest grade used, be on the lookout for industrial grade diamonds not suitable for jewelry that have been classified I3.<br><br>FL and IF diamonds are extremely scarce and expensive, so are rarely used in jewelry. VVS stones are rare and priced at a premium, but VS diamonds are more readily available in good color and cut. With SI and I1 stones you find your bargains in good looking diamonds, and I2 should be the bargain hunter's choice for earrings that cannot be viewed up close.<br><br>Clarity grades dramatically affect the value of a diamond, but down to I1 have little effect on its beauty.<br><br>Clarity enhancement techniques are being used today and should be disclosed by reputable jewelers. The most common are lasering to remove black inclusions, fracture filling to hide cracks and heat or radiation treatment to lighted or change the color.<br><br>The final test is whether or not you get a good looking stone at a fair price. We give a money back guarantee with every diamond we sell.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Diamond Cut Grading</strong><br><br>A rough diamond looks like any other rock until it is "cut" into many facets at optimum angles to produce maximum brilliance (sparkle) and fire (reflected colors). The quality of the cut is known as the "make".<br><br>In 1919 Marcel Tolkowsky developed the formula for the round brilliant cut which has become the standard or "ideal" cut for diamonds. Since then there have been various modifications and disagreement over what constitutes the true "ideal" cut. However, the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has developed guidelines for grading the make of round brilliant cut diamonds only.<br><br>The first two factors are the most important, and only round brilliant cut diamonds can be rated as Class 1. The term, "ideal cut", is no longer used by the GIA, but is still used by most of the diamond industry.<br><br><img src="http://www.diamonds-diamond.net/diamondparts1.gif"><img src="http://www.diamonds-diamond.net/diamondparts2.gif"></div>
