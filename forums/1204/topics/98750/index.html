There are also many others forum mates or webby supporters of this forums, whom we have met or yet to meet them and we would like to thank them all for their vital long-term support of this Outing Forum.<br><br>I see that we have made great progress: advancements in assistive participantion; socialable outing is much more accessible; the general level of awareness is substantially better; and opportunities for those new forum mates to join or organize an outing are beginning to improve. It will also take the same kind of determination modeled by www; who have drive and inital numerous outing to bring people together.<br><br>Drawing from my own recent experience at the last few organise outing, I look with great promise on our forum outing, one which I hope will soon be a national initiative, where our participants are getting the opportunity to get to widen their circle of friends and share valuable experience, and in some cases, enjoy each other's company; which new found friendships are born thru these outings. These kinds of initiatives give me hope -  A joint where you can make new friends inside and outside the forum truly said it all!<br><br>As SomeOne Once Quoted: Â“Those who stand and wait also serve."
