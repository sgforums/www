            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;In this time and age, it pays to be careful. Please take time to read<br>&gt;thru'.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;**************************<br>&gt;<br>&gt;A group of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what<br>&gt;they looked for in a potential victim and here are some interesting<br>&gt;facts:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(A) WHO<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(1) The first thing the men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.<br>&gt;They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or<br>&gt;other hairstyle that can be easily grabbed. They are also likely to go<br>&gt;after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common<br>&gt;targets.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(2) The second thing the men look for is clothing. They will look for<br>&gt;women who's clothing is easy to remove. Many of them carry scissors<br>&gt;around to cut clothing.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(3) They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through<br>&gt;their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off<br>&gt;guard and can be easily overpowered.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(B) WHERE<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(1) The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in<br>&gt;the early morning, between 5:00a.m. and 8:30a.m.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(2) The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is the<br>&gt;grocery store.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(3) Number two is office parking lots/garages.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(4) Number three is public restrooms/toilets.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and<br>&gt;quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry<br>&gt;about getting caught.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year<br>&gt;sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because<br>&gt;it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you<br>&gt;isn't worth it because it will be time-consuming.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other<br>&gt;similar objects that can be used from a distance, in their hands. Keys<br>&gt;are not a deter rent because you have to get really close to the<br>&gt;attacker to use them as a weapon.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(C) HOW<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Several defense mechanisms he taught us are:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(1) If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or<br>&gt;with you in an elevator or staircase, look them in the face and ask them<br>&gt;questions like " what time is it? My friends are supposed to be here 10<br>&gt;minutes ago." etc.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This is to show that your friends are on the way, so it's not worthwhile<br>&gt;for him to take the risk.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Secondly, it shows that you're a CONFIDENT person and you're not the<br>&gt;type that look timid and can be easily taken over.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Thirdly, now you've seen their face and could identify them in a line-up<br>&gt;if they are caught. So, with this you lose appeal as a target to these<br>&gt;rapists.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(2) If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you<br>&gt;and yell "Stop or Stay back!". Most of the rapists this man talked to<br>&gt;said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would<br>&gt;not be afraid to fight back.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Again, they are looking for an EASY target.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(3) If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it<br>&gt;and he also carries pepper spray with him wherever he goes,) yell to the<br>&gt;rapist: "I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY!!" and holding it out will be a deterrent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(4) If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can<br>&gt;outsmart them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker<br>&gt;either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner<br>&gt;thigh - HARD.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This instructor was told by a woman in his class of defence, that she<br>&gt;used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to da te-rape her and<br>&gt;he was so upset as she broke through the skin and tore out muscle<br>&gt;strands!! - the guy needed stitches.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it; it<br>&gt;hurts.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(5) If you slap a guy's parts it is extremely painful. You might think<br>&gt;that you'll anger the guy and make him want to hurt you more, but the<br>&gt;thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who<br>&gt;will not cause a lot of trouble.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;(6) When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers<br>&gt;and bend them back with as much pressure as possible.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The instructor did this to me without using much pressure, and I ended<br>&gt;up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;IN ALL CASES, DO NOT PANIC!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;By the way, it is also worth it to leave scratch marks on the rapist on<br>&gt;any part of his body for easy identifcation if he is caught. Of course<br>&gt;the things we always hear still apply: Always be aware of your<br>&gt;surroundings, take someone with you, eg to the toilet, to the car park,<br>&gt;if possible and if you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with<br>&gt;your instincts. You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel<br>&gt;much worse if the guy really was a trouble.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO ANY WOMAN YOU KNOW<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
