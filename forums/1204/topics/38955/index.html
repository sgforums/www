You broke up with him previously because of his bad temper and his unreasonable demands - I suppose this was quite a major problem and he still didn't want to improve, leaving you with no choice but to break up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You have a soft spot for him even when time passed - he knows it. He sent you gifts and card - you were moved, but your rational mind scream warning of the dreaded past - you remain firm with decision.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then he have to go US for work purpose and somehow you 'feel' and 'think' that he went there because of you - obviously this is an assumption. Based on this assumption, you decide to go out with him again because subconsciously, you feel that he have changed/sacrifice for you. Definitely he will treat you better than before because for a past lover to gain your trust - he has to work twice as hard - well, he gradually did.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All good things must come to an end - truth will be revealed someday. You realise this bf of yours ain't what he seemed to be; he may treat you better, but nevertheless one thing remain the same - he has never really learn to treasure and appreciate you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Those 2 girls came into his life when you broke him? Wow, think about this man - if you never uncover this little secret of his - do you think he would ever tell you? No...<br><br>They came into his life when you broke him previously - then how come he is still lingering with these past ladies? Oh, so he said he wasn't true to them - how sure do you think that you will be exception?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So you accepted him again. You have given him first chance already I suppose and he blew away the second one too. Now its time to ponder, understand and learn why are you sticking with a man you can't fully trust and why is he sticking with you. He said those girls are in the past - HEY, 'dear, can i hug u tml?... love you, dear'... it takes TWO to clap. Come on lor, I bet with 98% confidence he would be saying some sweet little stuff to her as well, thus she is just reciprocating him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Are you sure you really love him because he is someone you can trust and he would appreciate you OR do you simply miss the days when you both are in honeymoon stage and the fact that his seemingly changed character is able to bring back such good memories - triggering your subconscious desire and craving?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
