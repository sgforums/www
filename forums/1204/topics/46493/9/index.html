            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>As we look around us today, we see many people living life on what might be called the Â‘deferred payment plan.Â’<br>Children commonly say, Â‘Just wait until I grow up.Â’ Students can't wait until they finish school and leave home so they can begin to live as they like. When young people date, they look forward to the time when they will be married. Then theyÂ’ll be happy. When married they look ahead to owning their own home. Then theyÂ’ll be happy. When day comes, time pass, they can move to oversea. If they have children they say, Â‘When the kids grow up and leave home, then we'll be able to do what we want.Â’ Of course there's still the job. So they look to retirement as the time to live.<br><br>We can live now, every day. We should find our meaning and joy at this time, not some other. Don't wait for happiness. Create it. For the irony is, when retirement comes, people tend to look back and wonder what became of the Â‘good times.Â’ The remedy, then, is to always remember that today is the day you will be nostalgic about tomorrow. THESE ARE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.Â”<br><br>Wil  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
