Just open your mouth and tell him you want to go out with him!<br><br><strong>3. Can I...urm... do you... er... would you... like to...</strong><br>There are many ways of asking that special person out for a date. The most fool-proof way is to go the no-frills, no round-a-bout way. Juz ask him or her straight out: "yould you like to go out with me on Valentine's say?" When that person says "yes", then rack your brains for fancy words, sentences and wadsoever when V-Day comes.<br><br><strong>4. I have too many date offers!</strong><br>In other words, you are Mr or Miss Popular! There are two choices: you can either turn all of them down, or pick one. If there isnt a particular person that you fancy, you could say "no" to everyone to be fair. Then, gather a few good friends and go out together. But if there is one particular person that you like, then the solution is obvious!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>5. I dont know which girl/guy to ask</strong><br>In this situation, there can be two scenarios. One: you are a hunk or babe and you know at least one of the girls/guys that you are going to ask will say "yes". Two: you are a loser and you are just spreading your bait to see which fish would bite. Good luck to you!<br><br><strong>6.What to eat?</strong><br>Cant decide where to bring your date? If it is ur first, and you are not sure what she likes, its safe to stick to juz dinner. Always ask if she has any food or restaurant preference when you pop the question. If she says "no", the guy should make reservations at a restaurant first. When he meets her on the day itself, he can ask her again if she has any craving for any particular type of food. If she says she feel like having Thai, then forgo the reservation and bring her to a Thai Restaurant.<br>If she still has no idea what she wants to eat on that day, he can suggest the restaurant that he made reservations with and bring her there. Most restaurants would be fully booked, so the Thai restaurant might not have places. IN this case, the couple can still go back to the first restaurant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> 7. Should I hold his/her hand?</strong><br>When a girl agrees to go out with you, it doesnt mean that she has the hots for u. Yes, she might have good feelings about you, and maybe, just maybe, might like u, too. But you cannot be sure about that.<br>Likewise for girls. Take signs from him and see if he returns your hints. For example, leave your hand dangling near his, and see if he leaves his dangling near yours too. If he leaves his hand dangling near yours, Juz go ahead and grab it!<br>Not so easy for the guys though, becoz girls are a much more complicated species. You have to try, fail and then try again. But dont worry, unless the girls turns around and slaps you, most girls just pull their hands away to play hard to get.<br><br><strong>8. No Money, no talk</strong><br>You definitely have to eat and you have to feed your date, so the most economical way is to eat in. Cook your own dinner. Juz make your way down to the nearest library and borrow a simple cookbook to guide you along.<br>Do something simple like back fish fillet in aluminum foil (a slick of butter, some salt and mixed herb, and you are done!), which does not need much cleaning up, and has less chances of screwing up if you are inexperienced in the kitchen.<br>If your family isnt willing to vacate the house for the evening, you could pack a picnic basket and head down to the beach. Try packing pasta (easy to cook) or sand wiches, some fruits and a bottle of wine or sparkling juice (dont forget your wine opener).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>9. What to Wear?</strong><br>Juz wear wad u feel comfortable with..<br><br><strong>10. What to give?</strong><br>Roses are so cliche but give anyway, otherwise your date might think you are a cheapskate! Chocolates and teddies are the most nertral giftsfor the first few dates which self-made gifts are the best. They are economical and sincere. You could bake some brownies, sew his name on a pair of socks, or make her a photo frame.<br><br><strong>11. We're Already a couple</strong><br>How about a romantic, self-prepared picnic (include both of your fave foods) by the beach in the evening to enjoy the sunset? Surprise him or her with a romantic getaway. Take up tango. Learn French - the language of love. Create a photo album and record the places of where you first met.<br><br><strong>12. Arrrgh! I've got a hugr zit!</strong><br>This is an emergency. Soak a cotton wool pad in aloe vera lotion and apply it onto the pimple to sooth the redness and disinfect the surrounding area.<br>For girls, when putting on your makeup for the date, spread oil-free moisturiser all over your face, and a little more on the zit, giving it a second to adsorb. Use a finger or thin brush to cover the zit with foundation. Do not over rub or blend as it will thin out your coverage. Then, set with yellow tone powder on a cotton powder puff. Wipe off excess with brush.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>13. My parents think im too young to date</strong><br>You cant defy your parents and go on a date without them knowing, or woese, with them knowing. To prove your maturity, talk to ur parents and convince them that you are level-headed enough to date. If they still refuse to budge, arrange for a double date instead and tell them you're out with friends.<br><br><strong>14. I've got a major test the next day!</strong><br>Study in advance, go for ur date, and make sure you come back early to get enough rest. And make sure you ace it, or your parents might not let you out no V-day next year!</div>
