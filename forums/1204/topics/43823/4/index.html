            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest Diary,<br><br>I just came back from a ex-colleague's wedding at Orchard. Was heartening to know my dear Liverpool FC lose to Manchester City 2 to 1. Really hope Liverpool can beat the crap outta Chelsea in the final game of the season and clinch the Uefa spot. Mun Yoo has more or less has the League Championship under their nose but to be fair I think they deserved it. Was happy that West Ham has won their game against Chelsea cos they deserved not to go down. Thanks for listening to me. Need to go pangsai liao. Be back again.
