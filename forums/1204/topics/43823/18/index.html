            <div class='col-md body'>Dear diary,<br><br>I was on the phone with an ex of mine just now. Talked about the recent happenings in my life and I asked her what's wrong with me. In summary she told me 3 main things,<br><br>1) I have too many close female friends in my life, by this fact alone, she felt insecure when she is with me, though she knows I dun have special feelings for them, she feels that it is very difficult to feel special in my life.<br><br>2) I'm too unpossessive, she dun feel needed. She confessed that there were times when she purposely go out with other guys when we are together and purposely let me know about it, just to make me jealous. But the problem is, it never worked on me. She felt like I does not matter to me even if she runs away with another guy.<br><br>3) I'm too concern about her. (Personally, I think it's contradicting with point 2 above.) She is too overwhelmed by the attention. Initially it felt nice and loved, but as time passes by she began to feel pressured. There isn't much she can do to match the care I'm giving her, since there dun seem to be much that I need from her. Soon, rather than loving me, she felt obligated to love me.<br><br>I still have not really come to a conculsion as to whether these are true or not. But I think in order to find out, I may have to talk to more of my exs and see if they feel the same. If it is really so, I beg for a solution to my problem, because somehow, they dun seem like a problem to me.</div>
