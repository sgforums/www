            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Callan<br><br>You may just blew your problems, your troubles and your life away; maybe your imagination is too great for your ambition and everything came crashing down thus not working the path which you foresee. The truth hurts, but life still have to go on.<br><br>I myself had my life turn nightmare in just overnight in a place where my closes person is no one but myself, and I can tell you is far more worst of what you're expirencing right now. Nevertheless I'm glad I survive the challenge and maybe in life going beyond something you can't reach or seem, is pushing your challenge to it's limit and you will never know when is the end.<br><br>Learn to stand up to your problems, don't go look for problems; look for roots of solutions. Everyone's path is laid well before himself, is you who make the choices to walk.<br><br>Regards<br>~Whale~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>Last night I reaffirmed a believe in my life. It's about pride. I have always believe that pride is only useful in your life when you really need it. Pride by far has never been much use except towards one's ego. In one's life, one should never take pride too highly, cause the price to pay for such pirority is normally too much. A long time ago, I met a few like that, and they lost a lot of chances in life because of such pride. One was my counselle, I'm glad I managed to make her realise that with a simple sentence.<br><br>"If you are unable to let your own pride down to love someone, you will never love that someone enough. Because in the end, it only shows how much more you love yourself than you will ever love him."<br><br>Though she realise it, it was too late for her. This is one part of her life that she has to live with regret. She even once told me that if ever given the chance again, she would choose to put down her pride and embrace him into her life.<br><br>Hindsight is the irony that we always have in our life, and last night I once again realise that it is always happening around me. A major contradiction in life, that we grab on to things that are worth nothing at all in our life only to regret later. With this, I vow never to make this misunderstanding on pride ever in my life, it might be the thing that cause my downfall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear diary,<br><br>Well, did not get drunk last night at illusion. Fulfilled my promise to my friend. Has been wasting alcohol for the past month, and I drink like a cow(at least to myself I do). Thus it makes me wonder if I really am drunk when I'm drunk or do I just want to be drunk myself. The months have not been good, but I'm slowly gathering strenght to move on. At least I dare say I tried to enjoy myself last night. It is quite a herculean task really, looking at the amount of problems at the back of my mind. I only reached home at 5:00a.m. Not that I stayed at illusion that late but because I have to make sure everyone in my cab gets home safely after supper. Was very tired after that. I met a old friend last night at illusion after not seeing him for like a year. He has changed quite a bit. When he used to be the nicest guy around(not that he is not now), at that time, all the girls will be around him and he is every gals dream best guy friend. Now he has kinda change to have given up hope on nice guys winning in life. When I told him about the recent happenings in my life, he said he saw his shadow in me. And that the root to all my problems is basically being too nice, and having too much morals. I was quite astounded by what he said. He even told me that he came to realise that a gal's best guy friend is actually just like a boyfriend to her minus the sex. He shared that he used to spent time, money, effort and everything on these gals, but because he was nice, he got nothing in return, and would normally be cast aside when a boyfriend comes into the picture. He dun deny that he did like some of these gals that he was nice to, but the problem here is that since he is so nice, they dun even feel the need to recipocrate anything. Thinking about what he said, I do realise that my situation is very like what his was, but the big question hanging on my head is if I would soon give up like he did and be as disappointed with the woman around me like he is now or I will just continue to be what I am now for the rest of my life. I seriously do wonder on this point.<br></div>
