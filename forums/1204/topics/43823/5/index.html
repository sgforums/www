            <div class='col-md body'>dear diary,<br><br>had a great day today (yesterday, rather).<br><br>as you know, saturday was sentosa day and it was pouring in the morning. sms's were coming in asking if the sentosa was still on <strong>when</strong> i was already on my way to tiong bahru.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>devil and highflyer were there on time. coz the rain was hindering most of the guys to make their way to the defined venue, we spent more than 2 hours sitting in macdonalds and talk cok.<br><br>kopi was exceptionally talkative then, maybe because of he upcoming match.<br><br>finally, the folks arrived and there was still quite a bit of drizzling. that was a point of time when we almost ventured elsewhere, but eventually took the risk and headed for sentosa.<br><br>glad that we made the right choice. the weather was kind to us as soon as we reached sunset bay. though we spent another half an hour constructing another sians' canal, just to stop the water from flowing into the court.<br><br>we made our first challenge of the day on a group of guys whom we encountered last week, and we lost. nevertheless, we shook their hands as a gesture of sportmanship.<br><br>subsequently, it was volleyball and volleyball until someone(s) suggested bicycle and kayaking, and off we went.<br><br>surprised to see stefan, someone whom doesnt swim very much, could kayak pretty well.<br><br>and the guys went second round of kayaking because cheryl (another dry duck) needed some stand-in lifeguards, which explains my fatigue afterwards.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>it was one of the latest nights we spent at sentosa as we proceeded to tiong bahru foodcourt to satisfy all our starved stomachs.<br><br>Qoo joined in during dinner.<br><br>the entire group was split into two for aftermath. my side went over to chinatown to catch liverpool live on tv, ended up watching them lose. anyway, they deserved it, having to take chances for granted after they took the lead.<br><br>as soon as the match was over, kopi and silver came to join us for like half an hour. silver looked extremely tired, though she didnt join us for sentosa. i believe kopi can take good care of that.<br><br>the night ended right after we had frog legs for supper.<br><br>feeling kinda warm on my way back home and i sure hope i aint in for fever. i dont wanna miss soccer later, and surely, i dont wanna miss work on monday.<br><br>good night.<br><br>www</div>
