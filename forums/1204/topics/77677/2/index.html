Desperate to be taken seriously, Fogg makes an outlandish bet with Lord Kelvin (JIM BROADBENT), the head of the Royal Academy of Science: to circumnavigate the globe in no more than 80 days! With his two sidekicks Â– Passepartout (JACKIE CHAN) and femme fatale Monique (CECILE DE FRANCE) Â– Fogg is headed on a frantic, heart-pounding round-the-world race that takes our heroes to the worldÂ’s most exotic places by land, sea, and air.<br><br>Along the way, our heroes face many adventures and obstacles from an all-star cast including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kathy Bates, Owen and Luke Wilson, and Rob Schneider. Frank Coraci (Â“The Wedding Singer,Â” Â“The WaterboyÂ”) directs. Screenplay by Michael Weiss and David Benullo &amp; David Goldstein.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://202.172.226.84/Booking/movies/images/detail_secretwindow.jpg"><br>Based on a Stephen King novella, the psychological thriller SECRET WINDOW is reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock film. Eccentric author Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) finds his life spiraling out of control. With a drinking problem and a cigarette habit he can't shake, Mort can barely function when his wife (Maria Bello) leaves him and he abandons his work. In the midst of his anguish, a deranged man, John Shooter, (John Turturro) appears at Mort's New York cabin, claiming that Mort has plagiarized one of his stories. As his wife pushes Mort to finalize their divorce and Shooter systematically destroys his life, he struggles to restore order to an increasingly insane situation.<br><br>Playing off of Turturro who is superb as the crazed, Gothic Shooter, Johnny Depp shines in his role with a quirky, brilliant performance. The mannerisms he brings to Mort, such as a problem with a clenched jaw, makes the author's descent into madness compelling and believable. With an emphasis on character study over special effects, the chills provided by this film rely on skilled acting and evoke thrillers of earlier generations like PSYCHO and STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, including a shocking twist of an ending.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://202.172.226.84/Booking/movies/images/detail_thepunisher.jpg"><br>Frank Castle (Tom Jane) is a man who has seen too much death in his life, first as a Delta Force Op and later as an FBI special agent. He has managed to beat considerable odds, and is finally moving out of the field and into a normal life with his wife, Maria (Samantha Mathis), and young son, Will (Marcus Johns). On his final assignment, Castle plays his undercover role perfectly, but the operation spins out of control and a young man, Bobby Saint (James Carpinello), is inadvertently killed. This places the FBI on the wrong side of Tampa businessman Howard Saint (John Travolta) and his glamorous wife, Livia (Laura Harring). Notwithstanding their glossy social profile, the Saints are no genteel Florida couple; behind their copious wealth are violent beginnings, underworld ties Â– and a chilling capacity for brutality. Inflamed by the death of their son, the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance. Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true, as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion.<br><br>But Castle, to his everlasting torment, survives. Until this moment, he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law. However, experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalize the people who murdered his family. Drawing upon all he has learned in 20 years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers. He takes up residence in a dilapidated tenement building in Tampa's industrial district, where his fellow tenants include Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), a waitress at a nearby diner who is trying to put her life back on track; Dave (Ben Foster), a gangly twenty-something with a face full of piercings; and Mr. Bumpo (John Pinette), a rotund gourmand who rarely leaves his home.<br><br>In preparing his revenge, Castle thoroughly familiarizes himself with the habits and routines of the Saint family. He traces the movements not only of Howard and Livia, but also their surviving son, John (James Carpinello), and Howard's second-in-command, lawyer Quentin Glass (Will Patton). Armed with this essential knowledge, Castle launches his first salvo against Saint's business interests. Stunned that Castle is not only alive but causing him harm, Howard Saint marshals his forces in an attempt to shut Castle down. He soon turns to the underworld's network of hired assassins, recruiting the laconic Memphis legend Harry Heck (Mark Collie) as well as the blonde behemoth known only as the Russian (Kevin Nash).<br><br>Castle's plan is proceeding apace, but his mission has the unintended effect of placing his fellow tenement dwellers in danger. Yet Joan, Dave and Mr. Bumpo rally for their neighbor, even at great personal risk. This makeshift family Â– forgotten men and women with no one to protect them Â– brings Castle the one thing he least expects: redemption. His personal goal achieved, Castle realizes that his life's work has just begun. As The Punisher, he will provide justice for ordinary people and exact retribution from society's villains.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://202.172.226.84/Booking/movies/images/detail_eternalsunshine.jpg"><br>ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is an unconventional romantic tale told in the abstract, inventive, and comedic storytelling style of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. Like his scripts for ADAPTATION and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, this plot works off of a relatively complex idea that is easier explained through language of film than through words.<br><br>In its most basic description, Joel (Jim Carrey) is undergoing a medical procedure to erase the memory of his ex-girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). However, while he is unconscious and the procedure is underway, he takes a journey through his mind, reliving moments with Clementine for fear of losing her forever. Using disjointed sound and action, foggy periods indicating Joel's confusion, and flashbacks to childhood where objects appear much bigger than they are to adult eyes, the cinematography communicates Joel's dilemma with visual hilarity.<br><br>Only occasionally is the film laugh-out-loud funny; instead it is much more deeply and darkly amusing as the absurdity of the situation grows. ETERNAL SUNSHINE is nothing short of brilliant--a credit to director Michel Gondry (who has a top-notch reputation for his aesthetic music videos by artists such as Bjork). Carrey is wonderfully understated in the role of a simple-minded nice guy, and his signature goofiness is used only a handful of times. Winslet lights up the screen with her blue hair and orange sweatshirt, playing a lively free spirit and loose cannon.<br><br>There are also strong supporting performances by Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo, along with an excellent score by Jon Brion and a peppy soundtrack including songs by E.L.O. and The Polyphonic Spree. The film's conclusion promises to satisfy viewers; it offers a beautiful metaphor for the end of a love affair that brings perfect closure to this excellent film.</div>

Seldom is heard a discouraging word except perhaps from Jeb, a cantankerous old goat who thinks every tin can belongs to him. In her unofficial role as barnyard boss is Mrs. Caloway, a fastidious British cow with an air of authority and a stylish straw hat. Grace, the younger cow, is wide-eyed, a bit naÃ¯ve, and has a penchant for new age thinking.The farm's other inhabitants include a colorful assortment of pigs, chicks, and ducks.<br><br>This idyllic life is shaken to its core by two major events. A sassy show cow named Maggie (three time winner of the Golden Udder Award and the original Happy Heifer) comes to live at the farm when her owner's land is foreclosed and she finds herself in need of a new home. Shortly afterwards, Sheriff Brown, on his hotshot horse Buck, arrives to tell Pearl that "Patch of Heaven" is set to go on the auction block in three days unless she comes up with a payment of $750. Maggie proposes that the animals could win some Blue Ribbon prize money at the upcoming county fair, and suggests the three cows mosey into town to convince Buck to help them get more time. Mrs. Caloway sees Maggie as an outsider and is reluctant to leave Pearl, but ultimately agrees to go along with the plan.<br><br>In town, Maggie, Mrs. Caloway and Grace learn about a $750 reward being offered for a notorious cattle rustler named Alameda Slim. They decide to pursue the desperado themselves and collect the reward money in order to save the farm. Buck refuses to help the girls, and sets his sights instead on assisting his hero, a mysterious champion bounty hunter named Rico. When Rico chooses Buck to be his horse, the ambitious horse champs at the bit to ride into action.<br><br>Meanwhile, the three cows attempt to find Slim by hitching up to a chuck wagon that is headed to a cattle drive. Their plan pays off, but the wily cattle rustler sends all of the cattle into a hypnotic trance with his trademark yodel before Maggie and the gang can stop him. Luckily, a tone-deaf Grace is unaffected and manages to save her two traveling companions while Slim makes off with the rest of the herd. Rico arrives too late to catch the slippery varmint, and ends up dumping Buck in favor of a more reliable horse.<br><br>The cow trio can't seem to catch a break, and getting caught in a turbulent flash flood leaves them wondering, "will the sun ever shine again?" Their luck changes with the arrival of Lucky Jack, a onefooted rabbit who turns out to be a Jack-of-all-trades. When he reveals that his home at Echo Mine has been taken over by a yodeling cattle rustler, the girls set out with a new sense of purpose.<br><br>At the mine, Slim outlines his master plan to his knuckle-headed nephews, the Willies, and prepares to sell off his hijacked cows to a shifty cattle broker named Wesley. Maggie, Grace and Mrs. Caloway arrive on the scene and set into motion a daring plan to de-rail Slim. Things seem to be going their way until Rico makes an appearance and reveals a few surprises of his own.<br><br>Slim escapes and heads for the "Patch of Heaven" auction. It is the last parcel of land he needs to complete his real estate kingdom and exact his revenge on the homesteaders who failed to appreciate his genius for yodeling. Buck finally sees Rico's true colors and joins the girls as they make a last ditch effort to save the farm. With the odds firmly against them and time rapidly running out, the stage is set for a final confrontation with Alameda Slim.</div>

"The Young Black Stallion," a prequel to the 1979 classic, presents the horse's adventures with a young girl named Neera, who has been separated from her father in Arabia by WWII.<br><br>Left alone in the desert, she befriends the wild colt, whom she names Shetan. Once reunited with her father, however, Neera remains haunted by images of the "lost horse of the desert" -- one of a few stallions of legend, rumored to be "born of the sands, sired by the night sky, drinkers of the wind." The original writer and producer of "The Black Stallion" have returned for this production, which will bring giant screen audiences the wonder, excitement, and magic of Walter Farley's equine hero as they have never seen it before.</div>

Arthur the blessed<br>Led his assault from the Great Wall...'<br>by the 6th century Welsh poet, Taliesin<br><br>For centuries most historians believed that King Arthur was only a legend, but that legend was based on a real hero whose actions changed the face of Britain and the world forever.<br><br>Clive Owen, is 'Artorius' or Arthur, the hero of Roman and British parentage eulogized in the ancient Celtic poem. Like his loyal Knights, he sees only chaos and devastation will follow Rome's final pullout of Britain. Although, as a dedicated Christian he is desperate to return to Rome to influence the budding religion, his first loyalty is to his pagan Knights. Arthur sees his duty is to free them from their servitude to Rome so they may return to their ancestral homeland in Sarmatia.<br><br>However, before he can, he must lead his Knights of the Round Table on one last mission, deep into enemy territory on a quest of adventure and profound enlightenment. Here, Arthur, Lancelot, Galahad, Bors, Tristan, Dagonet and Gawain are forced to confront their traditional enemy: Merlin and his indigenous guerilla armies. Disdainfully called 'Woads' by the Knights for the Woad plant they use to dye their bodies, Arthur and his Knights will see these guerillas are the soul of Britain, devastated by generations of Roman rule. Now, with Rome gone, and without the help of Arthur and his knights, the invading Saxons will roll over the people like an avalanche.<br><br>Under the guidance of the shaman, Merlin and the beautiful, courageous Guinevere (Keira Knightley), Arthur will struggle to find the strength to fors ke his dreams of Rome to 'become a leader in this land,' and to change the face of history.<br><br>Thrilling adventure, edge-of-your-seat action and historical grandeur come together in this unique look at the origins of one of the greatest legends ever told.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://202.172.226.84/Booking/movies/images/detail_godsend.jpg"><br><br>If someone you loved were taken from you, how far would you go to bring him or her back? This is the impossible question confronting grief-stricken Paul and Jessie Duncan (Greg Kinnear, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) in the very graveyard where they are to bury their beloved eight year-old son, Adam (Cameron Bright). Into that moment of absolute despair steps Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) with a calm, reasoned, and utterly incredible offer. He can bring their son back, alive.<br><br>He explains that Adam is dead but his cells live on. Wells would clone the boy and Jessie could give birth to him once more, allowing Adam a second chance at life, and the family another chance at happiness. The cells however, will not be viable for long Wells tells Paul and Jessie and the couple has only a day to decide if they can accept this achingly tempting offer. Facing this immediate yet agonizing decision, the couple tries to consider the moral, ethical and legal repercussions of this action. Their love for their son triumphs over all arguments and Paul and Jessie agree to give their boy the chance to live beyond his eighth birthday.<br><br>With echoes of a Faustian bargain, Dr. Wells' offer comes with conditions: The process is illegal, so secrecy must be absolute. The new Adam will never see another doctor and the Duncan's will sever ties with friends and family so that no curious eyes will ever see their little boy growing up again. To ensure the secret is kept, the family resettles in the idyllic town of Riverton, close to Dr. Wells' impressive Godsend Fertility Clinic.<br><br>At Godsend, Jessie undergoes a relatively simple procedure - just like any woman undergoing in vitro fertilization. The expectant couple is made comfortable with a beautiful, well-appointed, and extremely large home. Paul returns to work with a plum job teaching biology at the local high school. The Duncan's settle in, make friends and eagerly await the birth of their son.<br><br>Soon Jessie gives birth at Wells' Godsend Fertility Clinic. The new Adam appears to be a perfect replica in every way, down to very the last cell. His life follows a comfortingly similar pattern until he passes his eighth birthday - and Adam, unaware that he has reached a milestone, literally begins living on borrowed time.<br><br>The Duncan's placid life is shattered at first by Adam's screams in the night. The boy, unconscious, is raced to the clinic where Wells diagnoses night terrors, a disturbing but benign sleep disorder that is not uncommon in children. Adam wakes the following morning, apparently fine, but with vague memories of what he describes as weird dreams.<br><br>Already gravely concerned for their son, it becomes obvious to Paul and Jessie that something is wrong. His dreams become visions that disturb him as much as his parents. Adam is seized by sporadic mood and personality changes that are shockingly different from the sweet and loving boy they knew through both of his lives.<br><br>Paul starts to reconsider his pact with Wells and thinks that maybe it is time to take Adam to an actual pediatrician rather than Wells who, while admittedly brilliant and responsible for Adam's very life, is a geneticist, not a pediatrician. Paul also starts to question Wells' motives, wondering if there could be a deeper or darker truth.<br><br>Adam spirals into the world of his visions, seemingly catching glimpses of another place and perhaps even another time. A palpable sense of menace seems to hang about the boy. As he lashes out at home and at school, this beautiful boy begins to seem dangerous. When a schoolmate drowns, Paul forces himself to consider the implication of what they have done and asks himself: how far did Wells really go? Were there darker forces at work as he "played God" with their son?<br><br>Paul uncovers the secrets of Dr. Well's past. In a violent and dramatic confrontation, the full, sickening truth comes out.<br><br>From this moment on, the Duncan's will have to come to terms with what they have done and what has been done to them.<br><br></div>

Ominously 37% of American children and adolescents are carrying too much fat and two out of every three adults are overweight or obese. Is it our fault for lacking self-control, or are the fast-food corporations to blame?<br><br>Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock hit the road and interviewed experts in 20 U.S. cities, including Houston, the Â“Fattest CityÂ” in America. From Surgeon Generals to gym teachers, cooks to kids, lawmakers to legislators, these authorities shared their research, opinions and Â‘gut feelingsÂ’ on our ever-expanding girth.<br><br>During the journey, Spurlock also puts his own body on the line, living on nothing but McDonaldÂ’s for an entire month with three simple rules:<br>1) No options; he could only eat what was available over the counter (water included!)<br>2) No supersizing unless offered<br>3) No excuses: he had to eat everything on the menu at least once<br><br>It all adds up to a fat food bill, harrowing visits to the doctor, and compelling viewing for anyone whoÂ’s ever wondered if man could live on fast food alone. The film explores the horror of school lunch programs, declining health and physical education classes, food additions and the extreme measures people take to lose weight and regain their health.<br><br>SUPER SIZE ME is a satirical jab in the stomach, overstuffed with fat and facts about the billion-dollar industry besieged by doctors, lawyers and nutritionists alike.
