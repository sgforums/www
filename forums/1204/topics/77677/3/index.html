            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">In Spanish dialogue with English subtitle.<br>Rated R(A) for sexuality, nudity and language.<br>1 hour 50 minutes<br>Off Screen<br></span><br><br><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00018D3UK.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>Racy romantic farce meets pop musical in Spain's box-office smash The Other Side of the Bed (El otro lado de la cama), an effervescent comedy set in modern Madrid. The film follows the intertwining and increasingly complicated love lives of two couples, who give voice to their roiling emotions in spontaneous bursts of song and dance. Award-winning filmmaker Emilio MartÃ­nez-LÃ¡zaro (What Max Said, His Master's Voice) directs a delicious cast of acclaimed young performers, including Paz Vega (Talk To Her, Sex and Lucia), Natalia Verbeke (Jump Tomorrow, dot the i), Ernesto Alterio (Deseo aka Beyond Desire) and Guillermo Toledo (Intacto), Alberto San Juan (Insomnio) and MarÃ­a Esteve (Nada en la nevera aka Nothing in the Fridge).<br><br>The Other Side of the Bed was one of Spain's top-grossing movies of 2002 and a great critical success. It received six 2002 Goya Award nominations (the Spanish equivalent of the Academy AwardÂ®), including Film and Best Director, as well as acting nods for Toledo, San Juan and Esteve. The film also won three awards at the Festival de Malaga Cine EspaÃ±ol, including Best Picture, Best Director and Audience Favorite.<br><br>In a small Madrid cafÃ©, Pedro (Guillermo Toledo) tries to convince his girlfriend Paula (Natalia) that her desire to leave him is just a phase. Paula is apologetic, but there is no going back: she has fallen in love with someone else. Stunned and despondent, Pedro seeks comfort from his friends, Javier (Ernesto Alterio) and his girlfriend Sonia (Paz Vega).<br><br>What Pedro doesn't know is that Paula's new man is none other than Javier, his best buddy and tennis partner. Javier promises Paula that he will soon tell Sonia the truth, but his resolve quickly crumbles. Torn between two beautiful, vibrant women and his oldest friend, Javier scrambles to maintain the status quo through an escalating series of lies and ruses.<br><br>Days pass, and Pedro's heart is far from healed. His buddies, including Javier and the skirt-chasing Rafa (Alberto San Juan) counsel him to forget Paula, but to no avail. Determined to learn the identity of his rival, Pedro enlists the professional services of Sagaz (RamÃ³n Barea) a crackpot private eye who nurtures some of the strangest conspiracy theories east of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Javier tries to distract Pedro by fixing him up with Pilar (MarÃ­a Esteve), a nonstop talker and obsessive romantic. While Javier sneaks off with Paula for a romantic weekend, Pedro enlists Sonia's help in eluding the smitten Pilar. As Sonia reassures the depressed Pedro about his desirability, her sympathy evolves into attraction. The game of musical beds is about to get even more complicatedÂ…<br></span></div>

Matthew, an American exchange student, pursuing his education abroad in Paris, becomes friends with a French brother and sister duo, named Theo and Isabelle, who share a common love of the cinema. While the May 1968 Paris student riots--which eventually shut down most of the French government--are happening around them, the three friends develop a relationship unlike anything Matthew has ever experienced, or will ever encounter again.<br></div>

But Viktor has long worn out his welcome with airport official Frank Dixon, who considers him a bureaucratic glitch, a problem he cannot control but wants desperately to erase.<br><br>"The Terminal" also stars Emmy winner Stanley Tucci (TVÂ’s "Winchell," "Road to Perdition") as Frank Dixon.

In the quaint suburban town of Stepford, Connecticut, the women have been transformed by their husbands into a totally submissive, near-robotic state where they are overly happy and totally compliant. When a new couple arrives (Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick) they must figure out where they fall in this web of weirdness. A remake of the 1975 adaption, Frank Oz presents a dramatic reworking of this horror classic.<br></div>

Director Keenen Ivory Wayans (SCARY MOVIE) manipulates his characters' flimsy attempts to pass themselves off as white women to provide plenty of gross-out, body-related humor, but also wraps the film up with a few salient lessons in life for the bumbling detectives.</div>
