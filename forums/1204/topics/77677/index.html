But even a small-town girl can have big dreams, and RosaleeÂ’s is to somedayÂ…somehowÂ… meet her big-screen idol Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel). The "somehow" arrives in the form of a contestÂ—the grand prize: a date with Tad HamiltonÂ—and the "someday" is now. Rosalee wins, much to the chagrin of her best friend and co-worker Pete (Topher Grace), who is deeply, hopelesslyÂ—and secretlyÂ—in love with Rosalee.<br><br>The "Win a Date" contest was cooked up by TadÂ’s agent, Richard Levy (Nathan Lane), and his manager, also named Richard Levy (Sean Hayes), to clean up TadÂ’s bad-boy image. Someone should have told them to be careful what you wish for. When Tad meets Rosalee and gets a taste of what heÂ’s been missing in the "real world," he decides he wants seconds and moves to West Virginia, turning RosaleeÂ’s dream come true into a nightmare for Richard Levy, Richard Levy and, most of all, Pete</div>

Shot in 9 provinces across Thailand and in Tokyo, the film also features a series of explosive matches where Nong Toom knocks out most of his opponents in Thailand and Japan.<br><br>Directed and produced by Ekachai Uekrongtham, the film stars Asanee Suwan, a real-life kickboxing champ as Nong Toom. The role earned him the 2004 Supannahongsa Award (ThailandÂ’s equivalent to the Oscar) for Best Actor. Beautiful Boxer also features compelling performances by ThailandÂ’s award-winning actor Sorapong Chatree in the role of Nong ToomÂ’s coach and former Ms Thailand Orn-Anong Panyawong as Nong ToomÂ’s mother.<br><br>Kyoko Inoue, one of JapanÂ’s top female wrestlers plays herself in the film. She has fought with Nong Toom in real life back in 1998. That historical match was reenacted for the film in a dramatic sequence shot at Tokyo Dome. Nearly all of Nong ToomÂ’s opponents in the film are professional kickboxers in real life.</div>

While Smith's pert one-liners and wryly ironic sense of humor are clearly present in the script, his casting choices (Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck) and glossy aesthetic identify the film as a mainstream Hollywood crowd-pleaser.<br><br>Affleck stars as Ollie, a powerful entertainment executive with a perfect wife (Lopez) and a beautiful Manhattan apartment. But when his wife dies in childbirth and his career fizzles to a halt, he humbly gives up his fast-paced Manhattan lifestyle for the benefit of his daughter Gurtie (Raquel Castro), who is 7 years old for the majority of the film. He moves to New Jersey to live with his father (George Carlin), finds a new romantic interest (Liv Tyler), and learns some lessons about what's important in life. A subplot about Will Smith keeps a string of Hollywood insider jokes and quick cameos (Matt Damon) running throughout the film, while a school play modeled after "Sweeney Todd" lends itself to some funny theatrical moments.<br><br>An emotive pop soundtrack features music by Aimee Mann in addition to a handful of well-timed entries that help move the plot along ("Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" plays as Ollie sheepishly drives his U-Haul across the river from Manhattan to Jersey), rounding out JERSEY GIRL as a likeable comedy.</div>

Maniacally devoted to his job, when he's on duty no crime goes unpunished - and he's always on duty. And that's a good thing, because he has some metaphorically big shoes to fill: his mother was a legend on the force, one of the best cops in the history of Bay City. But while his mom stuck with the same partner throughout her entire career, due to his extremely zealous brand of police work, Starsky burns through partners faster than his beloved Gran Torino goes through spark plugs.<br><br>Detective Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (OWEN WILSON) is having career issues of his own - he's a good cop, but his hazardously laidback personality and desire for a quick buck don't always get the job done. He has excellent instincts, he just needs a little bit of focus to keep him on the admittedly less profitable side of the law. Exasperated Bay City Police Captain Dobey (FRED WILLIAMSON) has found the perfect solution for two of his biggest problems: pair up Starsky and Hutch and put them out on the streets.<br><br>As soon as the two mismatched crime fighters unhappily begin their first day on the beat as a team, a "floater" turns up on the Bay City coastline. With the help of Hutch's dynamite, street-savvy informant Huggy Bear (SNOOP DOGG), the two begin to unravel the mysterious murder case. Investigating their first clue, the boys meet Staci (CARMEN ELECTRA) and Holly (AMY SMART), Bay City Cheerleaders who are more than eager to help - in any way they can.<br><br>All signs seem to point at wealthy businessman Reese Feldman (VINCE VAUGHN), but Starsky and Hutch just can't seem to make a case against him. Unbeknownst to them, Feldman has cooked up a plan to foil the DEA and is plotting the biggest and most lucrative drug deal of his career.<br><br>The unlikely duo will use their canniest undercover skills, hardcore street smarts and striking good looks to solve the crime and make sure the criminal does the time. Because, as David Starsky says, "In Bay City, when you cross the line, your n*ts are mine."</div>

The police had yet to find a way to track down the perpetrator. Their only lead, the lone eyewitness at the scene, was bridesmaid Chi Ching (played by Lee Sinje).<br><br>Chi Ching recognized the suspect--Suen Ling (played by Karena Lam)--the moment she was shown a close circuit camera footage at the police station. At the identification parade, she not only identified Suen but also discovered the affair between this stranger and her lover. All of a sudden the emotional turmoil surrounding her chronic illness, which had for years been plaguing her and her lover, resurfaced and quickly grew beyond control.<br><br>Ching's curious connection with the suspect left the police with no choice but to turn elsewhere for clues. Meanwhile Ching became the target of a vicious assault, and it was Suen who came to her rescue. Grateful, Ching learned to embrace the presence of the person to whom she had once lost her lover and, now, owed her life.<br><br>Ching's life, afflicted with illness and a lack of confidence, had been almost parallel to that of Suen, a lonely girl who grew up in a poor family. The two lives had never intersected until a twist of fate brought them together. But as they became more and more attached to each other, they also brought themselves closer and closer to unspeakable danger.<br><br>The police made an arrest. Everyone felt relieved. The main culprit watched all this with a sly grin from a distance. A true friend and an imaginary lover; a faded old photo and some anecdotes from the past--these are the clues to the crime. Facts began to emerge, the truth became clearer and clearer, but few were prepared for what they were about to discover.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://202.172.226.84/Booking/movies/images/detail_vanhelsing.jpg"><br>Deep in the mountains of Carpathia lies the mysterious and mythic land of Transylvania Â– a world where evil is ever-present, where danger rises as the sun sets, and where the monsters that inhabit manÂ’s deepest nightmares take form. Innovative filmmaker Stephen Sommers Â– who so imaginatively re-envisioned UniversalÂ’s classic Mummy character in the worldwide blockbusters The Mummy and The Mummy Returns Â– now widens his cinematic scope and multiplies his creative inspiration by breathing new life into the most time-honored pantheon of classic Universal monsters and setting them in a stunning new world of fantastical reality. SommersÂ’ all-encompassing vision for a world as tangible, real and visceral as any caught in the stranglehold of inescapable evil blends the recognizable and the unimaginable into a vivid, epic backdrop for his tale of ultimate evil against a lone force of good: Van Helsing.<br><br>Audiences will be drawn into a visionary, supernatural but seemingly all-too-real world of SommersÂ’ singular creation Â– set in 19th Century London, Rome, Paris and Transylvania Â– where mankind is in constant danger from incarnate evil in a multitude of forms: monsters that outlive generations, defying repeated attacks from the doomed brave souls that challenge them in their never-ending war upon the human race. In SommersÂ’ hands, Dracula, FrankensteinÂ’s Monster, the Wolf Man and others are effectively reborn as dynamic heirs to the tradition handed down by the filmmakers of the classic Universal monster pictures. Honoring their legacy while propelling them into the next generation of cinema, Sommers turns what was once classic into cutting edge.<br><br>Into this world, brought to life and played out on massive sets and sweeping locations, Sommers brings Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), the legendary monster hunter born in the pages of Bram StokerÂ’s Dracula. In his ongoing battle to rid the world of its fiendish creatures, Van Helsing, on the order of a secret society, travels to Transylvania to bring down the lethally seductive, enigmatically powerful Count Dracula (Richard Roxbough) and joins forces with the fearless Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), out to rid her family of a generations-old curse by defeating the vampire. Also populating SommersÂ’ dense canvas are: Tony Award winner Shuler Hensley as Dr. FrankensteinÂ’s misunderstood monster; former Matthew Bourne company leading dancer Will Kemp as Velkan, AnnaÂ’s stalwart brother who transforms under the full moon into the Wolf Man; Kevin J. OÂ’Connor as Dr. FrankensteinÂ’s loyal yet treacherous assistant, Igor; David Wenham as Carl, a friar entrusted with ensuring Van HelsingÂ’s safe return; and Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran as DraculaÂ’s three bloodthirsty brides who will stop at nothing to help their master in his plan to subvert human civilization and rule over a world of havoc, fear and darkness.</div>
