            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Why Do Some Men Pay For Sex <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Until I began researching this article, I was of the opinion that any man who paid for sex was either a pervert or so homely looking that he couldn't get a piece of the proverbial pie for free. But then I thought, do guys ever really get sex for free? The simple answer is "no"; there's always some price to pay, no matter how big or small.<br><br>But I digress. My inspiration for this article was a particular male friend of mine, Dave, who, as good-looking as he is, insists on seeing a particular escort every couple of weeks rather than finding himself a girlfriend to settle down and enjoy life with.<br>"Why Dave," I asked, "why do you insist on paying a woman who cares nothing for you to keep you company and get your rocks off?"<br>"Because," he replied, "she brings no emotional baggage to the table, or bed as the case may be; I don't have to listen to her problems, she listens to mine; and best of all, she can give most porn stars a run for their money in the sack. And all I have to do is give up a few hundred bucks. Not a bad investment, right?"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> IT'S COST EFFECTIVE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>So, I gathered, sometimes women simply aren't worth the headache. And considering some of the women I know, some guys would probably pay them just to go away.<br><br>Then again, isn't comfortable familiarity worth a fight or two? "But<br>I have familiarity; I see the same woman all the time." Hmm, Dave is making me feel somewhat obsolete as a girlfriend at this point.<br>Isn't there any advantages to having a steady girlfriend, or wife for that matter? Of course there is, but that's not what I'm here for today. I want to know why men would opt to pay a woman for a business transaction in which sex is the barter.<br><br>So I hit the streets, bars and lounges in my area of the world and although some guys made it clear that they would never pay a woman for straight out sex, others freely admitted that among other reasons, paying for it is far easier than having to play the meet and greet, with only the slight possibility of conclusively greeting a woman's meat.<br><br>So without further ado, here's what some guys had to say about hooking up with women in the world's oldest profession:<br><br>"Considering I just escaped from a five-year marriage that ended with me paying her to sit on her fat ass and enjoy the fruits of my labor, the last thing I want is a commitment with another gold digger. What I prefer is paying a hot woman to give me exactly what I want without complaining or insulting me. At least that way I know what her intentions are right from the start and I can't fault her for it. To these women, I am the greatest lover, I have the greatest penis and I can do no wrong. And that's the way, un-huh, un-huh, I like it."<br>-Jake, 34<br><br>"Well, I'm originally from Holland, and prostitution is not only legal there, it's much cheaper than it is here. The thing is, there are brothels there and you know that the women in them are disease-free -- unlike the heroin hookers you may find in the streets. Although I sometimes pay for sex here, it's only because I can have dirtier sex with such women; my girlfriend refuses to go down on me, and escorts -- I don't trust street walkers -- are willing to fulfill my every desire. For the right price, that is."<br>-Hans, 46<br><br>"I simply don't have time to go on four dates with a woman before she even lets me kiss her. So why would I bother spending hundreds, if not thousands, on a woman who may or may not sleep with me, when I can hook up with an incredibly hot chick who fits my physical criteria and will get on her knees upon command? Maybe if I met a woman who really blew me away -- no, not that way -- I would let go of the prostitute thing and go the way of a serious relationship, but for now, I'm quite comfortable living it up on the single side of the spectrum."<br>-Michael, 39<br><br>"To be quite frank (laughs), my wife really let herself go and managed to gain 70 pounds in the last year. I really do love her and she's great with our kids, but man, I can't stand seeing her naked. I can hardly bring myself to touch her. I began going to strip joints to get back that look I used to have at home, but I simply needed to get my rocks off at a certain point and masturbating wasn't cutting it. Of course, it's not the same considering I put on two condoms and engage in straight sex -- no kissing or foreplay, unless she wants to go down on me, but even then it's with a condom because of herpes and all -- and head home right afterwards. I told my wife and of course, she cries about it. What I really want her to do is cry off about 70 pounds, however. Only then will either of us be happy again. I mean come on; I married a mermaid, not a whale."<br>-Franco, 28<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Of course, I wouldn't be the happiest camper if I found out that my man was paying for sex. First, it would shatter my ego because I'll think that I suck, or perhaps don't, in bed. Then I would get angry because he's cheating -- and yes, it is cheating.<br><br>Of course, sex with prostitutes, escorts, hookers, or whatever fancy name you'd like to attach to them, can make a man feel lonely after a while, as many of the men I spoke with admitted.<br><br>Being loved by another human being just for being you can't compare to getting your rocks off for a price. And although some guys may beg to differ, I think that, in the end, there is a reason why people pair off and commit to each other.<br><br>And no, it's not because women make you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, what's good for the gander is also good for the goose...<br><br>there are many stories about women going to male "escorts"...<br><br>so, as always.. don't tar all with the same brush....<br><br>note what was said inside the article... "emotional baggage"...<br><br>some women want men to carry the stuff they bring into the relationship, but are derisive of men who have their own...<br><br>sometimes i think that's what drives some men into professional sex... but not all...<br><br>who knows?  each have their own story..<br><br>just like each woman who pays for professional sex have their own story...</div>
