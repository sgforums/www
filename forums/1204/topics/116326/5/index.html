            <div class='col-md body'>I got an email reply <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thank you for your interest in our activity. This is a totally new concept in Singapore which originated from Australia. It's Laser Skirmish!!!<br><br>Laser Skirmish was brought into Singapore by Battle Games Singapore Pte Ltd. We are the 1st and the pioneer for such activity held in Singapore. It is a fun team building sport and we cater for corporate, schools and the general public. Basically the concept of it is by using combat style games to promote cohesion, leadership skills, communication and team work.<br><br>If you had played paintball before, this is something similiar but there are no projectiles shooting out from the simulation guns therefore participants need not suffer the bruises from the impact of the paintball pallets. We use infrared rays, just like your TV remote. Because of this, Laser Skirmish had been every popular among ladies in the western countries.<br><br>As of now, we have 6 different types of guns to choose from and we can support up to 114 participants playing at one time. We have games running on every weekend at Loewen Rd (old Tanglin Camp) from now till mid April. You can choose to have your company event at our site or even at any parks or buildings, as long as the necessary authorities give their clearance. We welcome you to drop by our site on weekends to take a look or even a trial on how the game is played. You have to experience it to know how fun it can be. You may want to go into our website www.laserskirmish.com for more information about the game.<br><br>We are currently in our pre-launch period and you are one of the few privileged ones to hear about this. Our charges now are rock bottom  and when we offically launch this in April, the fees will go back to its original price.<br><br>Frequently asked question :<br><br>1. How many people are required for a group booking?<br><br><strong>Minimum number for a group booking is 30 people....but as they say, the more the merrier! The greater the number, the more challenging the missions will be.</strong><br><br>2. How much is the cost?<br><br><strong>The cost of play is $25/pax for bookings and $30 for walk-ins. That is a flat rate for rental of equipment, venue etc - SIMPLE ! This is a promotional rate and as of  1/4/05, the rate will go back to its original price.</strong><br>3. Game duration?<br><br>The game time is 1 hour 15 minutes, consisting of  15 minutes briefing (on use of weapons and missions), 2 missions of 25 minutes each with a 10 mins break in between the missions.<br><br>4. Dates Available<br><br><strong>We try and accomodate you as best we can but as we only operate on the weekends, the slots are filling up very fast. Depending on your numbers, we have these time slots available at the moment.<br><br>Sat 26/2 = 1pm, 2pm,3pm                     Sun 27/2 = 1pm, 3pm.<br><br>Sat 5/3 = 1pm,2pm, 3pm, 4pm              Sun 6/3 = 11am, 1 pm,2pm<br><br>Sat 12/3 = 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm          Sun 13/3 = 12pm, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm<br><br>Sat  19/3 = 11am, 1pm, 2pm,3pm, 4pm  Sun 20/3 =  11am, 1pm, 2pm,3pm, 4pm<br><br>Sat  26/3 = 11am, 1pm, 2pm,3pm, 4pm  Sun 27/3 =  11am, 1pm, 2pm,3pm, 4pm<br><br>Please let me know your numbers and which time slot you would prefer so we can block it out for your team. </strong><br><br>5. Available scenarios.<br><br><strong>There is an endless list of scenarios, too many for me to mention here...and too much theory, the best way to find out is to come along and play!</strong><br><br>6. Other information.<br><br><strong>As mentioned, you would need to book ahead, all I will need from you is a list of names of the players (names as it appears on their NRIC) and their NRIC number. The payment can be made on site on the day (cash only). Your team will need to come 30 minutes prior to the time of the game, so we can process the registration and kit you up. They will also need to come in long pants and protective shoes. Water can be purchased on site. And finally, there is no age (we have players from 4 years old to 80 years old playing!!) nor gender restrictions  to this game, so all are welcomed!</strong><br><br>I hope that answers some of your questions, should you have any further questions, please feel free to email us anytime!<br><br>See you on the battle field!!!</div>
