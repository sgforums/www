So are quite a large number of fresh graduates. I am one of them.<br><br>I have been unemployed for six months despite applying for jobs in marketing and customer service and even for the post of admin assistant. I have also lowered my pay expectations, all to no avail, foiled by two words: 'relevant experience'.<br><br>I have none. That automatically disqualifies me from 95 per cent of vacancies. Even the remaining 5 per cent of vacancies open to fresh graduates usually go to those with relevant experience.<br><br>I even tried for jobs that required 'minimum one-year relevant experience', hoping against hope that I would at least get an interview. With 200 applicants for each vacancy, I stood no chance.<br><br>For those who are retrenched and forced to look to entirely different jobs, it will be hard because they do not have the relevant skills and experience. Retrain, says the Government. They heed the call, acquire new skills and get new qualifications but, most probably, they will lose out to the frivolous job-hopper with 'relevant experience'.<br><br>The Government says their jobs are lost and will not return. They must adapt and find new jobs, but most companies will not hire someone without relevant experience, even if he has the qualification.<br><br>During my job search, I see lots of ads on the Internet and in newspapers. These jobs, though many, cater mainly to the job-hopper.<br><br>Fresh graduate? 'We wish you all the best in your future endeavours.' Retrenched, retrained but new to the industry? 'Sorry, you have no relevant experience.' Worked for a competitor? 'When can you start?' For six months, I felt anger, frustration and a sense of uselessness. These feelings become stronger with each passing day.<br><br>I worked for my qualification. Now, it seems that the paper is useless.<br><br>Many of us graduate with dreams. Then, we were told to be realistic and not be choosy. Does that mean giving up our dreams?<br><br>Like many others, I am confused.<br><br>TAN KOK HIAN<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> will this deters you from getting a higher qualification?</span></div>
