These protruding bones are generally long and sharp. She is proficient at throwing these blades and using them in combat.<br><br>Brief Bio: Marrow grew up in the sewers below New York with a community of mutants known as the Morlocks. These mutants hid under the streets because of their hideous mutations and ugly appearances.<br><br>When the villain Sinister ordered the Morlock massacre, Marrow was just a little girl. She was saved by Gambit [who had, in fact, led Sinister's Marauders to the Morlocks]. She went with the remaining Morlocks in an attempt to find safety elsewhere.

She can also intensely focus her psionic powers into her 'psychic knife', with which she can stun or kill an adversary.<br><br>Psylocke is also a highly skilled martial artist.<br><br>Brief Bio: Originally just a telepath, Betsy first worked as a model until she was recruited by the British SAS [bet that happens often]. After joining the x-men, Betsy was forced by Lord Nyoirin, an Asian crimelord, to reassemble the mind of his assassin Kwannon. But due to some foul play she ended up in Kwannon's body with full use of her martial arts skills. Kwannon, ended up in Betsy's body, which eventually died after contracting the legacy virus.<br><br>Betsy fell in love with Angel but they soon broke it off after she started flirting with the new guy, Thunderbird. Betsy has also been known to flirt with Cyclops, much to Jean's chagrin. Not long after her and Thunderbird became an item though, she was stabbed through the chest and died.<br><br>Wacky Plot line: Betsy was once blinded by the villain Slaymaster, but had her vision restored by the interdimensional TV mogul Mojo. Unbeknownst to her, the cybernetic eyes were being used by Mojo to spy on the X-MEN!</div>

A thief and a ladies man, Gambit joined the X-MEN after rescuing Storm from the Shadow King.<br><br>Gambit and Rogue have always had an on/off relationship, because of the barrier of her powers. They did manage to get it on once though, when a villain removed their powers temporarily whilst holding them prisoner below Antarctica.<br><br>Wacky Plot line: Unbeknownst to the X-MEN for some time, Gambit once worked for their enemy Sinister. He used his skills as a master thief to infiltrate a group of ugly mutants known as the Morlocks who were living in the sewers under New York. When Sinister sent his Marauders to slaughter the group Gambit tried to stop the killings but was injured by Sabretooth. He managed to save one little girl, who grew up to become Marrow.<br><br>He kept this secret from the X-MEN for some time, until Magneto forced him to confess to his teammates for the injustices he had perpetrated on his fellow Homosuperior.

Logan also has three claws protruding from each hand, these claws are part of his skeletal strucure and were coated with Adamantium during his abduction by the Weapon X Project. Wolverine also has enhanced senses of smell and hearing.<br><br>Breif Bio: Logan's past is twisted and detailed. He has been an operative for the CIA, a samurai in Japan and fought in many wars. Sometime before he joined the X-MEN he was abducted into the Weapon X Project, a secretive branch of the Canadian Government that experimented on mutants with the aim of producing super soldiers. They laced Logan's bones [including his claws] with an alloy known as Adamantium, the strongest metal known to man.<br><br>Since joining the X-MEN, Logan has ruffled the feathers of many of his teammates, most noteably Cyclops and Angel. Wolverine and Jean Grey [Cyclops' wife] have some kind of unspoken love thing going on, which causes further tension between Logan and Cyclops.<br><br>Wacky Plotline: Wolverine once had his adamantium ripped out by the villain Magneto, he barely survived and started reverting to a more beastial state. Then along came Genesis [that's Cable's evil son, not the band] who tried to give Wolverine back his metal so he could serve as a horseman to Genesis' master Apocalypse. Unfortunately, the process was interupted and instead of having his Adamantium returned Wolverine turned into a beastlike creature with no nose and shitloads of hair.<br><br>Wolverine slowly reverted back to his human form over a couple of months, after which Apocalypse kidnapped him, returned his adamantium, brainwashed him and sent him to fight the X-MEN as his horseman of death, of course with the help of his teammates he broke free of Apocalypse' brainwashing.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">hey! i asked for telekinesis! why am i suitable to be wolverine?!</span></div>

She is also telekinetic, allowing her to levitate herself and other objects around her. She has used this power in the past to drop cars on bad guys.<br><br>Brief Bio: Jean was one of the original five X-MEN and is the lynchpin of the team, tempering massive power with warmth and compassion. She is married to Cyclops but sexual tension still exists between her and Wolverine.<br><br>Wacky Plot line: On a return trip from space, an interstellar entity known as the Phoenix substituted itself with Jean and placed her in suspended animation. Unbeknownst to the other X-MEN it lived with them for some time, until it committed suicide on the moon. Scott Summers [Cyclops] thought he had lost Jean forever and fell into a deep depression.<br><br>Then a clone of Jean turned up, which had been created by Sinister and was calling herself Madyline Pryor. Scott and the clone became an item and even had a son. When the real Jean returned from her suspended animation, Scott left Madyline which drove her insane. She developed godlike powers and tried to take over the world. It ended with Jean killing Madyline [in a nice hero kind of way though]. Jean then rejoined the X-MEN and ended up marrying Scott.</div>

Heat waves will emanate from Havok's body in all directions unless purposefully channeled, usually along the length of his arms. When one of these waves strikes an object, the sudden jump in temperature may cause it to shatter, explode or simply disintegrate.<br><br>Brief Bio: The brother of X-MEN leader Cyclops, Havok has always lived under his brother's shadow. He has led X-Factor, a group of mutant criminals known as the brotherhood and a version of the X-MEN from an alternate dimension known as the six.<br><br>Havok is as powerful as his brother, but lacks leadership skills and is more hot headed.

Heat waves will emanate from Havok's body in all directions unless purposefully channeled, usually along the length of his arms. When one of these waves strikes an object, the sudden jump in temperature may cause it to shatter, explode or simply disintegrate.<br><br>Brief Bio: The brother of X-MEN leader Cyclops, Havok has always lived under his brother's shadow. He has led X-Factor, a group of mutant criminals known as the brotherhood and a version of the X-MEN from an alternate dimension known as the six.<br><br>Havok is as powerful as his brother, but lacks leadership skills and is more hot headed. Scott and Alex are invulnerable to each other's powers.<br><br>Wacky Plot line: After detonating a bomb/plane/time machine to save a city, Havok was transported to another dimension where he led a group of alternate X-MEN known as the six. In this reality, Beast was dumb, Angel was evil and breathed fire and Storm was a vampire!<br><br>The book was called Mutant X [a title which was stolen for a crappy, rip off tv show]. Recently the book was cancelled and Havok was returned to his original dimension albeit in a coma.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>same as you leh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
