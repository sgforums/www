In cohabitation, to me, like what u say, not happy, pack up and leave, that to me, is pure non-committal and an excuse, does it mean u get along well in cohabitation is a  guarentee to a good marriage life? Will cohabitation enable u to experience taking care of your kids? Will cohabitation enable you to stand by ur spouse in times of trouble for better or worse? Will cohabitation last?  I do not  want to sound like a marriage guru, no marriages are guarenteed to last, but cohabitation definitely will not make things better.</div>

In cohabitation, to me, like what u say, not happy, pack up and leave, that to me, is pure non-committal and an excuse, does it mean u get along well in cohabitation is a  guarentee to a good marriage life? Will cohabitation enable u to experience taking care of your kids? Will cohabitation enable you to stand by ur spouse in times of trouble for better or worse? Will cohabitation last?  I do not  want to sound like a marriage guru, no marriages are guarenteed to last, but cohabitation definitely will not make things better.</div></blockquote>er.. ok.<br><br>i reply later. too busy now for long, hard-thinking posts.... ahhaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jOhO:</div><div class="quote_body">Another point is that, why should a piece of paper with some ink on it make a couple more committed to each other? I would hate to be a person that has to think, "Gee I'm getting married to her, so I have to be more committed from now on." I would rather have myself think, "I'm committed to her, and therefore I will marry her." Commitment comes first my friends, not marriage!<br></div></blockquote>WOOHOO! /me whistle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I love the way you say, I am committed to her and therefore I will marry her and not because I am getting married to her, so I have to be more committed from now on.<br><br>But the thing is that - when it comes to the woman you like, seriously, I don't want to take risk. Stastically, cohabitation significiantly reduce the likelihood of a coming lasting marriage - figures can't lie don't they? Such results have a reason of why the outcome is like that and the reasons I have already mentioned above.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The thing about what I want to bring out is that I am NOT saying that cohabitation is bad - people can cohabit for infinite number of reasons, *but* HOWEVER, when it comes to a woman you *truely* love - do you want to <strong>*take*</strong>the risk?<br><br>The way the mind works is strange, but when similar situations happens, it often gives you a similar result. Cohabitation that leads to unpre-planned (before cohabitation) marriage, needs not just one, but TWO of you have to have the same frenquency on this view. But then again, chances are quite slim? (I said <strong>same</strong>, I din say similiar)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>A simple analogy for this case is like when a relationship went through a single break-patch period in the relation's lifeline. When you patch - you are going with the same person, but somehow, the feel is different. After cohabitation to marriage, its roughly about the same thing (apart from financial, kids, etc), but with a totally different feel.<br><br>Food for thought: So... you know of friends who patch back don't you? In the end, did they last? Rarely. So you know of friends that patched once and went all the way till marriage? Even rarer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's acceptable if both parties are responsible &amp; mature enough to handle it, that is to say both have thought about the consequences etc, and not just jump into it coz can hump anytime anywhere. It gives the couple a chance to get to know each other better and to find out, if they really can stand each other as much as they thought. Hehehe. I think even as a parent, at some point, you will have to trust that your kid can lead his/her own life. You also cannot be around forever to watch over him/her.</div>
