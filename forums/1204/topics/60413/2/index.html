            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qoo`~`:</div><div class="quote_body">sorry another question.. y do ppl commit suicide then ? </div></blockquote>Personally.<br><br>I think it's a 'stand' between 'reality' and the 'next world'.<br><br>When you feel all stressed and depressed. Feel like JUST GIVING UP. You make that 'jump'. 'Reality' into the 'next world'. 'Next world' don't necessarily have to apply only to people who believes in it, though it could be more easily applied to people who believes in it. For people who don't believe in a 'next world', the 'next world' often just pops up being subsituted by 'escape'. 'Escape' is a very vague term, hence the LETHAL part of it. Very easily imaginable by someone who's on the thought of suicide, ESPECIALLY someone who's already mentally distorted by 'emotions', 'stress', 'despressions' and the likes.<br><br>When you feel that you've been PUSHED TOO FAR. Reality has no room for you. You choose 'ESCAPE'.<br><br>When you feel that you're not getting any deserved attention at all and having the hallucination and thoughts about 'if you actually exist' and doubt your own EXISTENCE... 'Death' in an 'attention-seeking' way is there. Usually not an 'attention-seeking', but a TEST. Yes. In a MOST ATTENTION SEEKING manner. Do know if you really EXIST and would people react to your 'existence'(?)<br><br>When you've lost important meanings (in rare cases, they don't even have to be important ones) to live in this 'reality'. You might choose to seek 'meaning' elsewhere ('next world').<br><br>When you're looking forward to the 'next world'? And STRONGLY believes in it. It could be a temptation enough for you to give up on whatever you've got in this world and seek the 'next'.<br><br>When you've lost your mind and is just idling between the thoughts of 'next world' &amp; 'reality'. Chances are, you'll be on your 'one way ticket' to take a peep into the 'next world' one fine day?<br><br>I don't know if I've left out more examples but I think I certainly did... But the idea's kinda there I guess?<br></div>

Can't really remember the details but just remember that I was very sad. Think I was WRONGED or something? My thoughts then were it's USELESS to live in this world as whatever you do won't be justified. A bit of a Newtonian's thinking? Whatever you do, FATE just lies awaits you... It's not living at all... Just like ACTING... Your 'director' gives you a CLOWN's role, you PLAY it....<br><br>Why did I stopped? At before I really passed out. I thought if I just ends my life like that, I would never really know if this world is really like what I think it is... What if it ISN'T?</div>
