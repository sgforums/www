            <div class='col-md body'>You keep saying I bhb claiming I good looking. As far as I know, when people say I good looking, my reply are always "mai siao lah", bu yao hai wo, in forum I always reply "I am not nice looking". You may say I hypocrite to give such replies, why not you teach me how to reply? If I want to announce to the whole forum, I can always start many topic on "today got girls looking at me", just now someone say I got good feature".<br><br>You keep claiming me zi zuo duo qing say Ah Ma likes me because she had lunch with me. I really like FnU to clarified on this matter. FnU, aren't you the one who keep saying "if she not interested in you, would she have lunch with you"? FnU, I now asking you again, are you the one who keep putting me with Ah Ma together or I am the one who tell you that?<br><br>FnU, you keep claiming that I say mapplezz looks at me, now I like to ask FnU again, FnU, aren't you the one who tell me to look at mapplezz when I was playing with your palm top? Aren't you the one who kep saying she look at me for few minutes? Aren't you the one who say "if she not interested in you, why would she stare at you"? So why you go against me and accuse me of the one saying that now?<br><br>FnU,You keep asking me any girls went to the HOFS outing, you keep asking me got any girls look at me or not. I reply you saying "lilo got disturb me say I sing Zai Zai's song", this is also posted in HOFS topic, since than aren't you the one who keep putting me together with her? Why now become another things?<br><br>FnU, you had put me together with many many many forum girls, you had keep asking me "don't you sense anything from this girl that girl" again and again and again. Aren't you the one who keep trying to put me with girls? Why not you don't as well put in all the names? Why only quote this few? Since you want to say I bhb, might as well put in all, make it I super bhb.<br><br>You all started all those topics all over the forum is perfectly fine, when I started the satay man topic, you all created a big fuss, accuse me of blowing up the matter. Who is blowing up the matter in the first place? So don't try to find excuses for yourself to accuse me of starting everything.<br><br>You all keep saying I call FnU. Since last time even way during his ex days, we were already on the phone when either of us have trouble. FnU, you claimed I keep calling you during your meeting and you had so many missed call, I really like to ask you again, are you very very very sure? I remember very clearly I don't have the habit of calling people non stop unless there are something very important, I will just call once and if you don't reply, that's it. I remember usually you will call back, if you think I am bothering you, why bother to call back? When you had problem with your gf, I stayed up at night and talk to you until 3am when you keep telling me you can't sleep. Wonder who is bothing who.</div>
