            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>I am having work stress. The obasan at my working place... I can't stand them. They act that they are hardworking when boss is around but when boss is not around, they became lazy and all kind of mean words are filling up the air. Although it's none of my business, I tried to ignore them when they are gossiping. But I can't stand them kissing the boss's butt. They are so phoney. One of them have the worst attitude. When I ask her (in a nice way) to do something, she (crazy) shouted loudly and said, "No need to say 1 mah!" but when my boss is around, her attitude changed totally and she speak to me softly. My mom told me not to get angry at such low class people because in the end, the one who get angry should be that person. She will be the one who spolit her health by getting angry so many times. She will get what she deserve.</div>

I hate 8-5...<br><br>anyway the only interesting thing that happened was that i went to Blu Bar. Had a drink, sat there looking out and listening to jazz... I was thinking "I need a holiday!", now that I've got money to use on myself, where should I go?<br><br>To Europe when the football season starts next year? To a resort in Penang this year end? (Highly unlikely... hard to take leave) or head to Hat Yai and live like a rich person in January/February. I need my holiday, haven't been on one since 2000.<br><br>I've reached a stage where I am enjoying being single again~ back to my old self... doing whatever I want without consideration of another person, saving money, mind on football... Man, it feels good to be back!<br><br>Have a nice day diary...<br><br>I'll be lounging around my room.<br><br>Bye bye~</div>

Thoughts about new ideas, concept in particular. Random ideas, jumping here and there, like a ping-pong match inside my mind. I'll think of it, answer it, work my way around it, trying it out; if all fails then I will argue against myself. No, I'm not insane. Just trying to sort out certain isusse in my head.<br><br>But when separate ideas suddenly click, it's like getting hit by lightning. Like a jolt; a sudden burst of inspiration. And then I just have to go with it. Once in a while, the inspiration will result in a new ideas for product development. In some cases, even a successful concept. Work...work...work...nothing else matters!<br><br>I think is the time of the year which I really need a good rest and stay away from my work for awhile. Relax &amp; enjoy a few weeks of peace and stress-free environment, but for now~is back to work.<br><br>cwill</div>
