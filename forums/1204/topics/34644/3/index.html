You mum have no choice, bought it for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You are happy finally you owned the toy, but as time pass, you feel that you don't think about the toy or even play with it anymore - or even look at it. You probably give it away or pack it deep inside boxes that you don't even remember where you keep it now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It would be very much different if you were to save your every cent just to buy that Lego castle or something. You forgo recesses just to save 2 dollars each day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Finally when you have to money to purchase it, your happiness is genuine and you really loved it. Till now, you probably placed nicely in your shelves, still remembering the time how hard is it for you to save just to get this Lego Castle.<br><br>So what the hell am I talking about? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you (Women) are easily won over and as easily into the bed with another guy - NOBODY WILL *EVER* - I swear with utmost truth of this statement - treasure you for the way you really are and you will *NEVER* -  I double swear for this - find true love, unless you are enlightened and vow to change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Every guy have their sexual needs to be satisfied - but find a guy who respect you or take responsiblity in what he does (protection, never force it upon you, etc) - in that case, self discipline is the hard work that is placed upon the relation.<br><br>Eventually if marriage take place - the both of you will deeply treasure and appreciate this union - just like the way you remember the times when you forgo your recesses to buy the Lego Castle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
