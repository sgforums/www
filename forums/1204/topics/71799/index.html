            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boat users and fitness enthusiasts excited about PUB plan, but others fear loss of area's peace and quiet<br><br>By Maria Almenoar </strong><br><br>THE Singapore Amateur Rowing Association has been eyeing Bedok Reservoir as a good place to organise lessons.<br><br>It has already applied twice and been turned down.<br><br>But the association might just get lucky the third time: The Public Utilities Board wants to open up the reservoir for water sports such as canoeing and kayaking by the end of the year.<br><br>The PUB told The Straits Times it is now seeking partnerships with agencies to start these activities.<br><br>And rowing association president Nicholas Ee, 56, says he is going to try his luck again.<br><br>'Bedok Reservoir is a great location because it is near schools and homes,' he said. 'It would be a great way to promote water sports.'<br><br>To control pollution, the PUB says it will allow only non-motorised boating activities - canoeing, sailing, kayaking, rowing and dragon boating.<br><br>Currently, people can take part in water sports at the Pandan, Lower Seletar and MacRitchie reservoirs.<br><br>The Singapore Canoe Federation, which trains the national squad at MacRitchie Reservoir, said it is also interested in Bedok Reservoir and even wants to hold international races there.<br><br>Its secretary-general, Mr Henry Sim, 49, said: 'It is a sheltered reservoir, where the water level is low and the water is protected from the wind. There is also a slope that allows spectators a good view of the whole reservoir.'<br><br>But while water sports groups are excited about the development, regular park users The Straits Times spoke to are worried about the noise the sports will generate.<br><br>Ms Jancy Wong, 32, a secretary who lives in Tampines, takes walks at the reservoir with her husband twice a week.<br><br>She said: 'There are already other places where people can do water sports, but there are very few quiet areas in Singapore. This is one of them.'<br><br>Ms Alice Wong, 51, a cashier who exercises at the park at least five times a week, added: 'I come here because it's nice and quiet. The water sports will spoil that and disturb the peace.'<br><br>But the PUB said that since only non-motorised water sports are allowed, 'it is unlikely much noise will be generated'.<br><br>And there are regular park users who are already planning to add it to their exercise routines.<br><br>Mr Dean Osman, 27, an engineer who exercises at the park five times a week, said he would love to add water sports to his daily exercise routine.<br><br>'It would be great! It will liven up the park and give people like me a chance to try a new sport.'<br></div>
