However, I still have some concerns abt it.<br><br>Gers, will you get attached for the sake of it? eg: if you are very lonely and friends ard you r all attached, u suddenly feel like having a companion n somehow there's one "available" for you. U might have feelings for this guy if you further develop with him as friends..Will you want to be in a relationship coz you haven been loved n doted for awhile? Each time you see couples u start to envy them and think that if u had a bf, will u guys be like that? n start to imagine many many stuff....<br><br>Guys, how abt you?<br><br>It is really very hard to stay single, while majority of the friends ard you are attached? </div></blockquote>Sometimes, i do envy others especially when you offically have a girlfriend but at the same time its like you don't have a girlfriend.</div>
