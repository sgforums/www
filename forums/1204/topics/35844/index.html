            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Extracted from Strait Times Forum</span><br><br>IT PAINS me to read about the dishonesty of our university students ('NTU hostel fined for rigging inter-hall games'; ST, Feb 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br><br>An event that was meant to promote sportsmanship and camaraderie was turned into a mockery of all that it aimed to be. This does not bode well for Singapore.<br><br>I am not making a moun-tain out of a molehill. If the students could do what they did for a trophy, just imagine what they would do if the stakes were much higher.<br><br>All that mattered to the students involved was winning - at all cost and by all means; even if the trophy in this case was just the title of champion.<br><br>I hate to ponder what the students would do where it really counts, that is, in their exams.<br><br>I shudder at the thought of these students graduating and joining the workforce or becoming businessmen or, worse, politicians.<br><br>Singapore is known for its above-board, clear-cut and honest dealings in all matters, business and politics, so much so that sometimes we are taken advantage of.<br><br>However, must we sacrifice the values of honesty and integrity for the sake of winning? Must we lie and cheat to gain an advantage? The answer is no.<br><br>At no time should our integrity and honesty be undermined. Just one instance of dishonesty is enough to shake people's confidence in us, and enough incidences will sink our credibility completely.<br><br>What will these students do when they graduate? They have shown themselves to be dishonest and conniving in small things like the inter-hall games; will they not be dishonest too in bigger things like their exams and, in the future, in business and politics?<br><br>Mr Adrian Yeo admits that it was a small mistake. I disagree with him that it was small, or that it was a mistake.<br><br>It is by no means a small thing to cheat, and it is by no means a mistake; it was a deliberate act.<br><br>I would think twice about hiring such people for my organisation, and thrice when deciding if I should assign them greater responsibility.<br><br>They would have to show that they have repented and changed, not just outwardly but right to the core, before I would trust them with bigger things.<br><br>If one cannot be trusted in small things, how can one be trusted in greater things?<br><br><strong>LEOW SHIN HWAH</strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> do you think these people deserve trust or be given a second chance?</span></div>
