            <div class='col-md body'>Let's discuss this issue again....I thought it would be interesting to see the views of you guys...<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I know my ass will be flamed by hordes of people, my life will be on the line, my reputation at stake, my ego busted and woman will want to hold me by my balls and squeeze...<br><br>Ok basically, you people out there will either love me or hate me for saying these.<br><br>Before any rocket launchers come pointing my way...just hear me on what I have to say...<br><br>I am 23yrs old, not old....still pretty young in fact...but my experience with woman...you can say is sufficient. I have many woman friends. I have had girlfriends. Not many really....but enough to know about woman. I often have conversations over some Earl Grey with these woman friends of mine, and sometimes the topic will revolve around the differences of the sexes. I have always respected woman, believing them to be an equal of a man, only that we behave and react differently to different situations. In fact I have some woman friends who packs quite a powerhouse background. Some are their own boss, some are hold in high regard due to their work ability, some are potential directors for MNCs...yes...they are good and capable people. So why am I saying that woman are contradiction? This has nothing to do with their work ability, nor capability. It is the thought process itself that I am pointing to here.<br><br>I have asked them sometimes...what do you ask in a man?<br><br>I get varied answers....but I sum these up as the most common answers.<br><br><blockquote>I want a man who is not very handsome, but must be lookable.<br><br>I want a man who is chivalrous (or gentlemanly) but chauvinistic enough at the same time.<br><br>I want a man who is not very successful in his career, but must have amass enough success in his work to maintain his position.<br><br>I want a man who is not rich, but financially stable enough to maintain my lifestyle. </blockquote>Well, looking at it this way....are the woman telling me that they are all looking for a Mr. Average? Look at the woman on the streets and most of them are with the best guy around. Else it must be some rich fat ugly man with the babes on his side. Hmmm...it must be really hard to be a Mr. Average then, why else are so many Mr. average (me included) not attached? Something is wrong with the fate machine. They forget to program it to detect the Mr. Average around. The one which so many woman wants.<br><br>Of course you are going to say that what you ask for is not necessary what you get...well...here are some of the contradicting conditions you all ask for in a man.<br><br><blockquote><br>I want a man who has time for me but successful in his career.<br><br>I want a man who is good in bed but not have sex very often.<br><br>I want a man who knows how to treat a woman good but knows how to tease her to love him at the same time.<br><br>I want a man who loves his parents...but must love me just as much.<br><br>I want a man who is athletic, has a great body...but not crazy about sports.<br><br>I want a man who takes good care of me and gives me the sense of security, but must give me space to lead a independent life.<br><br></blockquote>The list goes on and on...and I did not make them up...they are all from...you guessed correctly...woman.<br><br>Now let's see....what do we have? A man who is successful in his career most probably dun have a lot of time for his girlfriend or wife...I am a business person...and I have seen many successful guys who dun have time for the family. And basically a man who is good in bed is most of the time a man who gets a lot of practice...in this case...how can he not have sex very often? And of course a man who treats a woman good would not want to play mind games with her. As for the parents part....for those out there who are married ?I am sure you all know how it works...most of the time it is either mum and pa or just wife and the children....it always have to be a choice between them. Basically if a man has a great body...he works out a lot. And if a woman is independent...she would not need a man to take care of her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So how are these contradictions summing up?<br><br>Well...another contradiction of woman which I am sure a lot of you guys here have seen before....the way they rejects us. Here are a couple of examples...<br><br><blockquote><br>Callan, it is not you it is me...you are too good for me.<br><br>The problem does not lie with you, the problem lies with me. You are a perfect guy, but I am not a perfect girl.<br><br>I treat my friends better than my lover, and I think you deserve good treatment from me, so let's just be friends.<br><br>You are my greatest friend, and I treat my friends better than my lovers.<br><br>I am not your type, so it would not be possible.<br><br>I am not for you, you would not like me.<br><br></blockquote>Well...looking at these rejection lines...I just sense each and everyone as a contradiction. Well...if I am good...perfect....why would you not want me? It just does not make sense...well....as for the friends part...I once got so piss at the answer that I cursed under my breath.."yah you screw your lover but you would not screw me, is that it?". Didn't woman always wanted a man who can be a lover and friend at the same time? Well....if you are not my type I would not have asked you in the same place...you can say that I am not your type...but you can't tell me that I am not your type simple because you are not me.<br><br>Well...another thing about woman....have you people not notice a rather strange trend nowadays? I give you people a real life experience I have...<br><br>I like this gal very much....I am the very nice guy who would always be there for her...take care of her when she is sick...lend her my shoulders to cry on....give her a hug to assure her that I am there for her...well basically...I am the nicest guy she has ever met.(She told me that, I am not blowing my own trumpet) Well....there is a problem...she had a boyfriend...a total jerk...he would humiliate her in public...treat her like a property...take her as his free maid...and of course the object to vent his sexual frustrations on. Well...she refuses to leave him because she says she loves him too much to give up. (what is there to love in him anyway?!?) Of course she got dump in the end after he found his next fresh free maid. She came crying to me...blah blah blah...and then say that I am the best thing that happen to her...blah blah blah...of course I comforted her and she felt better after a couple of months...then I decided maybe it is time I pop the question...and guess what? She rejected me, saying she found someone better...and runs off with the next best jerk that comes along....ok I told myself that I am not for her...and of course history repeats itself....she got dump by another jerk...and I again becomes her fairy god mother who mend her heart...and of course again she runs off...now she is with the 4th best jerk...and I can only say good luck to her...and give up on her...I dun wanna be a dunlopillo Mattress cushioning her every time she falls...and then be alone again till she decides fall again.<br><br>So the moral of the story is? Well...How can woman be so contradictory? Well..the perfectly nice young man is right in front of her begging and waiting for her to nod her head, off she runs off begging the jerks to take her in. and no she is not the only woman whom I have met in life who falls into this cycle...there are a whole lot of them out there....is it not contradicting?<br><br>Of course...these contradictions does not only stops in R/S problems...The modern woman too often cries out loud for equality of the sexes....and than they will claim that man are not gentlemanly to them...that we do not carry their shopping bags for them...that we do not open the doors for them...hmmm...I am wondering if they want equality....or the perks of equality with the original benefits of being a woman kept intact....what do they want at all?!?!?<br><br>Ain't women supposedly to be better at managing emotions than men? If so....why are they causing so much trouble for themselves then? It is one big contradiction all together.<br><br>BUT...one thing I still believe in...it is that...the very reason woman are so intriguing...and interesting...is simply because of such contradictions...and man can be quite a contradiction to like them for it themselves.</div>

Infact it's true...and in that case. When we men too are attracted to women who will in one way or other contradict themselves. Then we men too, are also contridicting ourselves by being attracted to them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
