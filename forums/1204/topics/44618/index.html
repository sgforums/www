            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Army!!!!</strong><br>I slacked my 4 months away... and finally 26th April 2001, i was enlisted!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>I went into Jaguar Company, School 1, BMTC. I loved life there, carefree, relaxing... training was fun... i know most will say obese training is easier... well think of it this way, say you're...1.78m tall, and 75kg... now, add more weight till u weigh 96kg, and go jog for me... get my drift? so basically BMT has adjusted its training regime for the fat dudes!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Anyway... before BMT, i started to think what i could do AFTER army... i tot, well i could upgrade myself, but in my heart i just didn't want to suck money off my parents anymore...<br>So i considered signing on, stable job, stable income, can give $$$ to parents, got time can go upgrade! cool right? so i sent my application and i got rejected... oh well, i can try again in BMT...<br>So i applied again in BMT... rejected...<br>I tot, okay still have almost 2 yrs to try... hahha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>So after BMT, i was sent for driver training course, after which i got posted to my unit at PLAB... i spent my life as a NSF there, i met lots of good people... they are now my friends, i still contact them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  but while i was in there, my application was approved and i went for my interview! haha, sooo happy!<br>i didn't get any rejection letters at all thru the whole process, so i signed on as a regular, but i would have to go to my course the week after my ORD... so i ORD on friday, then monday i was back as a regular... i left my unit with too many happy memories... and i nearly cried on my last day... okay, i did cry...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>I missed the guys, and i missed going to work there...<br><br><strong>Deaths</strong><br>Okay... so basically my mindset changed quite abit, coz of this word 'death', not because i fear death but, more like, what will happen? not in a spiritual way, but what will i do here?<br>okay, there's this guy i know in sec sch... he lost his parents... he's my age, and in NS now... he was a younger sis and bro... and i stop to think, what will happen if it was me??... and my classmate died while riding a motorcycle, i'm not saying i will be accident proof, but i try to ride safely when i'm on a bike... i dun chiong around, speed for no reason, or challenge ppl at red lights... coz instead of a racing bike, i got a little chopper, hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Well since we're on the topic of deaths... one of my friend's father passed away 2 yrs ago, but the same thoughts came to my mind... what if it was me??? did i have the money to support myself if my parents were to leave me? and if i leave my parents, will have money to leave them?...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Recently due to SARS, my colleague lost his parents... yes parents... both of them... so all these things make me the boring person i am, trying to plan for the future...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
