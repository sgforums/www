            <div class='col-md body'>Basically I would like to point out the FACT remain that when a relationship turns sour is that whos is to blame? U, me, him, her, whoever?<br><br>The thing is that time to move on. Guess most of you received the sms regarding this puppy asking his mom what is happiness and what his mom reply was its at the tip of ur tail. So the puppy went around chasing its tail hoping to catch/get happiness. But after several attempts he still could not get hold of his tail/happiness. So he went to ask his mom, how come he cannot catch/get his tail. Then mom replies, walk on and the tail/happiness will follow you.<br><br>The above simply shows what is best when a relationship turns sour.<br><br>There is a reason behind each and every action/reaction. Fact is what goes round comes round which is why this world we live in is round. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Disclaimer : This post is not directed to anyone, its just my 2 cents worth of thoughts.
