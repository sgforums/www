Its short and simple, I will not claim it to be the absolute truth.<br><br>The main source of contention comes in Genesis 4 when Cain laid with his WIFE. Up till now in the bible, the only four humans mentioned in the bible is Adam, Eve, Abel and Cain. So how on earth did the WIFE appeared? So, many gathered that it could be a sister of Cain, thats why the issue of incest. Why i wouldnt think its incest, 2 points.<br><br>Firstly, Cain was driven out of Eden, a mark was put on him so that whoever finds him will not kill him.  Firstly, if the wife is a sister, wouldnt she be in Eden too? why is she outside? Secondly, if the people outside of Eden are also desendants of Adam And Eve, then they would recognise its Cain and wouldnt kill him, would God need to put a  mark on Cain so that no one will kill him?<br><br>SEcondly, then the question, where did all these people suddenly come out from? The logical answer i can come up with us this, from the point when God made Adam and Eve till when Cain laid with his wife, it has been many many years. The bible has never stated where these "EXTRA" people come from, but that does not give it a strong basis to say that those are sisters of Cain. WHat I want to say is that if God can make Adam and also Eve, He can make another human for Cain too. Adam and Eve are the first humans God made, but never was it mentioned the ONLY humans God made.<br><br>I dun claim  those to be the right answers, God forbids, if you believe, I hope it brings you closer to God, if you dun believe, I hope you will understand it just another human trying to understand an Almighty God.  In the end, what i want to say, is that even in my attempt to answer the questions, the only thing I am interested to bring across is that God is a mystery sometimes, we are not God, we do not understand how God works sometimes, just as He said in the bible, My ways are higher than your ways, My thoughts higher than your thoughts, my advice to people who asked questions like these, is that, be prepare for answers which will not be adequately backed up cos certain things we humans just cant answer.<br><br></div>

Now she has to take pills to stop these hallucination.<br><br>My advice here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Dun attempt to think abt incest too much. Incest is not something fun or new experience like ONS, flings or visiting prostitutes. Incest is a moral issue &amp; anyone in their RIGHT mind will know that it's wrong &amp; I'm not referring to pple who pray to Sex God who wants sex &amp; nothing else. Dun imagine too much or bother to try, coz it's not gonna help you guyz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
