            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_pirates.jpg"><br>Loosely inspired by the time-honored Disney theme-park ride, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is a swashbuckling high-seas tale directed by Gore Verbinski. When Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), an eccentric rogue, arrives at Port Royal, he barely avoids going down with his ship. Soon enough, he's in the market for a new one, but not before he saves the life of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the beautiful daughter of the governor (Jonathan Pryce). This act of bravery sets into motion a sweeping adventure involving Elizabeth's childhood friend, blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom); a mysterious medallion; and a legendary pirate ship, the Black Pearl. The Pearl's mottled Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wants Elizabeth's doubloon necklace, and when she's kidnapped by the ol' salty dog and his crew, Sparrow and young Will must rescue her and find out the truth behind the ship's curse.<br><br>Verbinski's PIRATES is a welcome throwback to Hollywood offerings of yesteryear, filled with rope-swinging heroes, crusty villains, treasure hoards, swift swordplay, and even wittier wordplay. Screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott have crafted one of the most clever action-movie scripts in many moons, and this gives the filmmakers and cast plenty of room to cut loose. Although the skeletal pirates may be a bit frightening for small children, there's lots of humor to temper the scary moments, making PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL a nearly flawless fun film.</div>

Framed for stealing one of the worldÂ’s most priceless and powerful treasuresÂ—the Book of PeaceÂ—Sinbad has one chance to find and return the precious book or his best friend Proteus (Joseph Fiennes) will die. Sinbad decides not to take that chance and instead sets a course for the fun and sun of the Fiji Islands.<br>Not so fast.<br><br>ProteusÂ’ beautiful betrothed, Marina (Catherine Zeta-Jones), has stowed away, determined to make sure that Sinbad fulfills his mission. Now the man who put the "bad" in Sinbad is about to find out how bad bad can be. ItÂ’s never a good thing when Eris, the goddess of chaos (Michelle Pfeiffer), has it out for you, and Eris lives up to her nameÂ—dispatching both monstrous creatures and the elements to do battle with Sinbad along the way. There is even mutiny afootÂ—times fourÂ—when SinbadÂ’s loyal dog Spike switches allegiances. But those challenges donÂ’t compare to one small but formidable woman named Marina.<br><br>"Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas" is directed by Tim Johnson and Patrick Gilmore and produced by Mireille Soria ("Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron") and Jeffrey Katzenberg ("Shrek"), from a screenplay by John Logan ("Gladiator").</div>

Having conquered Harvard, Elle is now a rising young lawyer at a great firm, balancing her demanding career with preparations for her wedding to the man of her dreams. But when she finds out her beloved dog Bruiser's family members are being used as cosmetic test subjects by one of her firm's own clients, she stands up for their rights - and is promptly fired. She's devastated, but you can't keep an optimist down. Ms. Woods goes to Washington to take matters into her own French-manicured hands.<br><br>Trying to learn the political ropes and win over politicians, Elle faces a formidable challenge - and in a sea of grey, black, and navy, she sticks out like a pink thumb.

But with her clever and sassy signature blend of intelligence and determination, she bucks the system the Elle Woods way. Speaking up for Bruiser and his family and rallying blondes across the country, Elle eventually inspires those around her to find voices of their own.</div>

The movie marks the first-ever collaboration between Leon Lai and Ekin Cheng.<br><br>Kin (Ekin Cheng) is the most elite member of the Hong Kong Police Force but his relationship with girlfriend Brenda (Karena Lam) is suffering due to his egocentric personality. A million-dollar theft by an unlikely suspect at the opening of International Diamond Expo sees Kin teaming up with ex-police hypnotherapist Ching (Leon Lai) in order to solve the crime. But are they the heroic duo or has Kin fallen into Ching's trap?<br></div></blockquote>one down...<br><br>many to go..</div>
