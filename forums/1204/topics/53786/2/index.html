            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_mytutorfriend.jpg"><br>Su-wan (played by KIM Ha-nuel) is a sophomore in college, and she works part-time as a tutor to cover her tuition since her father lost his job and started a small chicken eatery. Tutoring is a tough job, especially since basket cases are more curious about what's underneath her skirt (The mirror is the most commonly employed device in satisfying this curiosity.) than what's in the books. Again for the zillionth time, she couldn't hack it. It's been only 7 days since she started teaching her new student, and already she's been sacked. "No tutoring, no tuition," declares her mother to make sure she understands she has no choice. So Su-wan is back on the market, and meets her next challenge -- the impossible, the unconquerable and the unreformable Ji-hoon (played by KWON Sang-woo).<br><br>He's the eldest son of a wealthy upstart. At school, he's a well-known fighter and the king of troublemakers. And what's more, he's repeating his senior year for the third time. Ji-hoon, who boasts such an impressive school record, becomes a very unwilling student of Su-wan, who's the same age but in college. She is flabbergasted by his careless manners and speech, and his incessant smoking during the lesson. Extremely tempted to quit, Su-wan is determined not to lose this job since she doesn't want to disappoint her Mom. Yes, she'll bring him down on his knees and under her control, so as it may seem as she tries to convince herself, but Ji-hoon tramples on her courage with his bluntness:<br><br>"Hey babe, just sit over there for two hours and then leave. I'll make sure you get paid." "OhÂ… sure, why notÂ…"<br><br>That's how their lessons began. And from then on, things started happening one after another.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Si Bey Funny, Must Watch~~~</strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Following a chance encounter at a park, events, meddling acquaintances and pure bad luck conspire to keep the would-be lovers apart as each makes plans to change their life and leave the past behind.<br><br>Warner Bros. Pictures is producing Turn left turn right in association with Raintree Pictures, Media Corporation Singapore and with To's production company, Milkyway Image (H.K.) Co., Ltd. Warner Bros. Pictures will distribute the film worldwide.<br></div>

But with no dreams and goals in his life, Joong-pil is simply a smart-alecky poor student wherever he goes. Whether he steals money from the neighbourhood kids or sells erotic comic books to earn his allowance, this is how he spends all of his tedious time.<br><br>But one day, Cupid's arrow unexpectedly pierces into Joong-pil's chest. The one who stole his heart is well-behaved student named Min-hee, who's also the prettiest girl from a nearby high school for girls.<br><br>But a transfer student named Sang-man suddenly appeared like a gushing storm and wants to take over the school. Strangely enough, Joong-pil seems to avoid getting into a fight with Sang-man, but two kings can't exist one land, and the showdown draws closer.<br></div>
