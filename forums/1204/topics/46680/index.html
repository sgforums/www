Fortunately for them, espandale wasnÂ’t too far from where they were.<br><br>Not bad for kopi to take an evening stroll for a change, given that he is someone who loves chasing the ball. That should relax him down a little.<br><br>During then, kopi was mentioning the names inzaghi, beckham, owen and shearer, while CL constantly brought him back to track, asking him more about BGR.<br><br>10pm. Most of the guys were there except www, as he is still on his way from his night classes. Everyone made an informal introduction of themselves to CL and in no time, she is able to mix with the group pretty well.<br><br>After two hours of chit-chatting, singing, drinking and play pool, the guys decided to call it a night. Not wanting to be a lamp post, the gang automatically left both of them at the pub.<br><br>CL: Â“I like your friends. They sure are friendly. How long have you been knowing them?Â”<br><br>K: Â“for quite a few months. All of them are from the forum.Â”<br><br>CL: Â“you serious? They donÂ’t look like a group of people who surf net that often. Anyway, I think we should do this more often. I like mixing with all classes of friends.Â”<br><br>K: Â“why not? Say, donÂ’t you need to go back early tonight? You did say that you have interview going on tomorrow.Â”<br><br>CL: Â“not until afternoon. Hey, thatÂ’s pretty observant of you. I donÂ’t remember seeing you act this way back in school. Seems like you do change a bit. Â“<br><br>Kopi chuckled. The atmosphere changed a little and their minds start running around.<br><br>CL: Â“err..colin. thereÂ’s something which I have wanted to ask you all these yearsÂ…Â”<br><br>K: Â“huh?Â”<br><br>Though he can be a pretty insensitive person, but he does sense that something big is coming his way with that statement.<br><br>CL: Â“Â… I always wanted to ask you if you ever liked me?Â”<br><br>Ops. The million dollars question.<br><br>K: Â“Â…Â…Â”<br><br>CL: Â“I know itÂ’s a tough question. You can choose not to answer it if you donÂ’t want to.Â”<br><br>Kopi has never been more lost in his entire life. He was giving off a blank look for a straight 5 minutes. Suddenly, he recalls something which cwill told him before he left the joint.<br><br>Â“When in doubt, apply NikeÂ’s slogan.Â”<br><br>Mustering all his courage, he said, Â“err.. yeah. I guess so..Â”<br><br>CL: Â“you guess so?Â”<br><br>K: Â“I think so..Â”<br><br>CL: Â“you guess so and you think so? Which is which?Â”<br><br>K: Â“aint they the same?!?!Â”<br><br>CL giggles, Â“hehe. In fact, thatÂ’s what I wanted to hear.Â”<br><br>CL: Â“colin, what say we ditch the car tonight to drink to our heart content?Â”<br><br>Overwhelmed with how things progressed, kopi wasnÂ’t in the mood to consider. After all, he can always call in for urgent leave the following day.<br><br>K: Â“sure. Why not?Â”<br><br>And off they went. 2 jugs of bourbon and 3 jugs of beer. Not knowing that they are way off their limit, they ordered dozen of tequila shots. It was uncharacteristic of kopi to spend money this way but he has just gotten his regular pay a few weeks ago, so he didnÂ’t really mind.<br><br>It was 2am in the morning and the pub is empty except the two of them.<br><br>K: Â“*burp*. Hehe.. IÂ’ll be back. Washroom.Â”<br><br>CL was motionless. Guess she really drank too much.<br><br>Finally found his way to the toilet, kopi unzip his pant and began a long pee as he smiled to himself, thinking how smooth everything is working out.<br><br>As soon as kopi was thinking where should he bring her on the subsequent date, someone barged in.<br><br>It was CL.<br><br>K: Â“hey! CL! The ladies is over the other side!Â”, and kopi was unsure if he should zip up as he was halfway through the pee.<br><br>CL was least affected by his yelling and stood right next to him. She turned around and lifted up her skirt and let off a great sigh of relief as she began.<br><br>If you think goldfish has big eyes, you ought to see kopiÂ’s ones.<br><br>She was peeing all right, except that she did it standing up.<br><br>Not wanting to believe what he has just saw, kopi tilted his head to take a closer look at the entire process.<br><br>YES. She has one, something all guys have. Worst still, kopi made a visual comparison and realized his is not even half the size of Â“hersÂ”!<br><br>Flabbergasted and dumbfounded. Kopi was left standing there until CL is done with what she came in for. On her way out, she gave kopi a buddy pat on his shoulder, signaling that she will be outside waiting for him.<br><br>Ok. That does it. Kopi dashed out of the backdoor and practically stood in the way of a taxi and hop onto it.<br><br><strong>--- end of part 2 -----</strong>[/b]</blockquote><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=46667" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=46667</a><br><br>continue from above.....</div>

CL already sobering from her(his wadeva) drunkeness, found the car keys and let go a little smirk.<br><br>Next Morning...<br><br>CL calls Kopi<br><br>CL: Hello...<br><br>Kopi: (still thinking of what had happened last nite) Yes?<br><br>CL: You left your car keys...<br><br>Kopi: (Immediately realises that it is CL and sits up) Oh! My car keys... yes... errr... yes...<br><br>CL: Uh huh... don't you want them back?<br><br>Kopi: Yes... er... of course... (at this point coming up with 101 ways to get his car keys back without meeting CL)<br><br>CL: How about meeting me this later for dinner? I'll pick you up... in your car?<br><br>Kopi: OH! No! Its OK! I...errr... riding!<br><br>CL: Oh... that's fine by me... same place as last night?<br><br>Kopi: Errrr....<br><br>CL: What's wrong? Is 8pm alrite with you?<br><br>Kopi: Errrrr... okokok!
