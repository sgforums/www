            <div class='col-md body'>sighz~<br><br>During the 3 mths when I was transferred to sales dept, I got to know this aunty J. Through out these 3 mths, got to know her better.. quite friendly. She will always buy stuffs for me, like pendant, tibits, necklace, etc.. (not expensive stuffs)<br><br>seems like a nice lady, married with a daughter (lower sec)<br>always ask for my help regarding internet or computer stuffs... i'm ok with it. then whenever you icq/email, she will suddenly pop behind you trying to see who you are chatting with. (minor issue - i will just tell her its personal, don't be kpo lah!)<br><br>then when i got transferred back to cust svc, my lunch changed to 1-2pm whereas her's is 12-1pm. sometimes she will da bao my lunch back for me.<br><br>when i finally realised something is wrong with her.. its last friday!<br>i just finished my lunch and walked over to a/c dept for a chat, aunty J came over and asked what am i doing over here. (why can't i be here? do i have to report to you?) I just tell her, i'm chatting with them, what's wrong? And I asked her, how come you so free? your lunch time was over long ago... but she ignored and stayed to chit chat. (she kept trying to make me leave a/c dept, to go back to her desk)<br><br>1st attempt: she said something is wrong with her hp, call waiting seems to be disabled. she asked me to go to her desk to take a look. I told her, if you want me to help you.. bring your hp to me, don't expect me to go over. she went to take and... problem solved.<br><br>2nd attempt: after which she said her hubby wanna buy a new nokia hp. need my help to search the webby to see what's the feature of the hp. I told her its not as if you don't know how to search, why must you always ask me to do it? lost for words... she went back to her desk...<br><br>then my lunch is nearly over, i went to her desk to take my hp and there she asked me, you very close with the a/c colleagues eh? (close or not, do i have to report to you? its none of your business!) i just said "cannot is it?" then went down to my office. (their office is on the 2nd level, mine is 1st level)<br><br>then when i went home.. i started to feel her behaviour is kinda weird. making me uneasy.. as Monday i was on MC, i only asked two of my colleagues who have been working in my company for a long time already and we are on friendly terms.<br><br>i told them separately about the friday incident, both of them told me didn't you know that aunty J is like that (possessive)!<br>I said i have absolutely no idea, if i knew about it.. i would have kept a distance from her.<br><br>they said before me, there were a few "victims" also. she will be on very good terms with them, treat them real nice... and expect them to follow whatever she likes, hate whoever she hates.<br><br>once there was this victim A, who had been giving in to her all along.. until one day she cant take it, she told her off! aunty J cried, saying why you treating me this way..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>and she remain mentally disturbed for quite a few months till victim A resigned.<br><br>then victim B, aunty J went home to tell her husband and daughter.. she can live without them but she can't live without victim B!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>(siao bo! i nearly freaked out)<br><br>because my lunch time and hers are diff, they told me she don't even wanna take her lunch because of me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>and sales team will be shifting down to 1st level in 2 weeks time.<br>aunty J told one of the salesperson, she wanna swap the lunch time so she can lunch with me after they moved down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  ( i never said i wanna eat with you.. why she so thick-skinned!!!)<br><br>then i told my two colleagues help me think of some ideas..<br>maybe can ask the salesperson to alternate the lunch time instead of swapping then during aunty J's turn to eat 1-2pm.. i will tell her i don't feel like eating  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>these couple of days i have been avoiding her like a plague  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>it was so obvious that she asked the a/c colleague, why is it lately when i talk to me, i don't seem to respond and like i'm avoiding her. whenever i see her, i will quickly hide under the desk  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>my colleague tried to cover up for me.. saying oh, this morning she bend down because she dropped something.. not hiding lah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>piangz! how long can i endure...<br>i really wanna talk to her face - face... to leave me alone!<br>but was advised not to.. as we are still colleagues and aunty J is a very sensitive person.. later she cries..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  (she cries then what.. i'm the one suffering...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> )</div>
