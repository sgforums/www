            <div class='col-md body'>Chicago folks heard this on the WBAM FM morning show recently.<br>The DJ's play a game where they award winners great prizes. The game is called "Mate Match". The DJ's call someone at work and ask if they are married or seriously involved with someone. If the contestant answers "yes", he or she is then asked 3 random yet highly personal questions. The person is also asked to divulge the name of their partner (with phone number) for Verification. If their partner answers those same three questions correctly, they both win the prize.<br><br>One particular game, however, several months ago made the City of Big Shoulders drop to its knees with laughter and is possibly the unniest thing I have heard yet. Anyway, here's how it all went down:<br><br>DJ:"Hey! This is Edgar on WBAM. Have you heard of Mate Match?"<br>Contestant: (laughing) "Yes, I have."<br>DJ:"Great! Then you know were giving away a trip to Orlando, Florida if you win. What is your name? First only please.<br>Contestant:"Brian."<br>DJ:"Brian, are you married or what?<br>Brian:"Yes."<br>DJ:"Yes? Does that mean that you're married or you're what?"<br>Brian: (laughing nervously "Yes I am married."<br>DJ:"Thank you. Now, what is your wife's name? First only please."<br>Brian:"Sara"<br>DJ:"Is Sara at work, Brian?"<br>rian:"She's gonna kill me."<br>DJ:"Stay with me here Brian! Is she at work"<br>Brian: (laughing) "Yes, she's at work."<br>J:"Okay, first question - when was the last time you had sex?"<br>Brian:"She is gonna kill me."<br>DJ:"Stay with me here Brian! "<br>Brian:"About 8 o'clock this morning."<br>DJ:"Atta boy, Brian."<br>Brian: (laughing sheepishly) "Well..."<br>DJ:"Question #2 - How long did it last?"<br>Brian:"About 10 minutes."<br>DJ:"Wow! You really want that trip, huh? No one would ever have said that if a trip wasn't at stake."<br>Brian:"Yeah, a trip would be nice."<br>DJ:"Okay. Final question. Where did you have sex at 8 o'clock this<br>morning?"<br><br>Brian:Laughing Hard " I ummm, I, well..."<br>DJ:"This sounds good, Brian. Where was it at?"<br>Brian:"Not that it was all that great, but her mom is staying with us<br>for a couple of weeks..."<br>DJ:"Uh Huh..."<br>Brian:"...and the Mother In Law was in the shower at the time."<br>DJ:"Atta boy, Brian."<br>Brian:"On the kitchen table."<br>DJ:"Not that great?? That is more adventure than the previous hundred times I have done it. Okay folks, I will put Brian on hold, get his wife's work number and call her up. You listen to this."<br>Three Minutes of Commercials Follow<br>DJ:OK audience, let's call Sarah, shall we?<br>(touch tones...ringing..)<br>Clerk:"Kinkos."<br>DJ:"Hey, is Sara around there somewhere?"<br>Clerk:"This is she."<br>DJ:"Sara, this is Edgar from WBAM, we are live on the air and I have been speaking with Brian for a couple hours now."<br>Sara: (laughing) "A couple of hours?"<br>DJ:"Well, a while now. He is on the line with us. Brian knows not to<br>give any answers away or you'll lose. Sooooo do you know the rules of Mate Match'?"<br>Sara:"No"<br>DJ:"Good"<br>Brian: (laughing)<br>Sara: (laughing)"Brian, what the hell are you up to?"<br>Brian: (laughing) "Just answer the questions honestly, okay? Be<br>completely honest."<br>DJ:"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Now, I will ask you 3 questions, Sarah. If your answers match Brian's answers, then both of you are off to Orlando, Florida for 5 days on us. Disney World, Sea World, Tickets to the Magics game.The whole deal. Get it Sara?"<br>Sara: (laughing) "Yes."<br>DJ:"Alright, when did you last have sex, Sara?"<br>Sara:"Oh God, Brian...uh, this morning before Brian went to work."<br>DJ:"What time?"<br>Sara:"Around 8 this morning."<br>DJ:"Very good. Next question. How long did it last?"<br>Sara:"12, 15 minutes maybe."<br>DJ:"Hmmmm. That's good enough. I am sure she is trying to protect his manhood. We've got one last question, Sara. You are one last question away from a trip to Florida. Are you ready?"<br>Sara: (laughing) "Yes."<br>DJ:" Where did you have it?"<br>Sara:"OH MY GOD, BRIAN!! You didn't tell them that, did you?"<br>Brian:"Just tell him, honey."<br>DJ:"What is bothering you so much, Sara?"<br>Sara:"Well..."<br>DJ:"Come on Sara.....where did you have it?"<br>Sara:"In the ass...."<br>After a long pause, the DJ said, "Folks, we need to take a station break"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A first grade teacher was having trouble with one of her students. The teacher asks, "Johnnie! What is your problem?!"<br><br>Johnnie says, "I'm too smart for the first grade. My sister is in the third grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third grade!"<br><br>The teacher had had enough. As a result, she took Johnnie to the principal's office and explained Johnnie's request. While Johnnie waited in the outer office, the teacher explained the situation to the principal. The principal told Johnnie's teacher that he would give the boy a test and if Johnnie failed to answer any of the special questions, he was to go back to the first grade and behave. The teacher agreed. Johnnie was brought into the room. The principal told Johnnie his terms and Johnnie agreed.<br><br>Principal: "What is 3 x 3?"<br>Johnnie: "9"<br><br>Principal: "What is 6 x 6?"<br>Johnnie: "36"<br><br>Principal: "What is 9 x9?"<br>Johnnie: "81"<br><br>And so it went with every question the principal thought a third grader should know. Johnnie appeared to have a strong case. The principal looked at the teacher and told her, "I think Johnnie can go to the third grade."<br><br>The teacher, knowing Little Johnnie's tendency toward sexual wisecracks, said to the principal, "Let 'me' ask him some questions before we make that decision?" The principal and Johnnie both agreed, and Johnnie had a very sly look on his face.<br><br>The teacher began by asking, "What does a cow have 4 of that I have only 2 of?"<br>Johnnie: "Legs."<br><br>Teacher: "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?"<br><br>The principal eyes flew wide open. Before he could stop Johnnie's expected answer, Johnnie said, "Pockets."<br><br>The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, "I think we should put Johnnie in the fifth grade. I MISSED THE LAST TWO QUESTIONS MYSELF!"<br><br>=====================================================<br><br>Send someone over quickly! The old woman  screamed into the phone. "Two naked bikers are climbing up toward my bedroom window!"<br><br>"This is the Fire Department, lady," the voice replied. "I'll have to transfer you to the Police Department."<br><br>"No, it's YOU I want!" she yelled. "They need a longer ladder!"<br><br>=====================================================<br><br>One day a little girl came running into her house yelling, "Mommy, I got five dollars!"<br><br>The mother was curious, so she asked her child where she got the five dollars from.<br><br>The little girl replied, "Tommy down the street gave me five dollars for doing a cartwheel while he sat in the tree."<br><br>The mother told her daughter, "Don't you know that Tommy is just trying to see your panties?!"<br><br>"OOOOhhhh," said the little girl.<br><br>The next day the little girl came running into the house yelling, "Mommy, I got ten dollars."<br><br>The mother asked, "Where did you get the ten dollars from?"<br><br>The little girl replied, "Tommy down the street gave me ten dollars for doing a cartwheel while he sat up in the tree and laughed."<br><br>The mother replied, "Didn't I tell you that he is..."<br><br>Before the mother could finish, the little girl said, "Wait Mommy. I tricked him, I didn't wear any panties today."<br><br>=====================================================<br><br>Laff it up peepz!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

It was terrible."<br><br>"What was terrible?" said the doctor, "was the sex not good?"<br><br>"Oh no doctor, the sex was the best I've had in 25 years, but I'll never be able to show my face in McDonald's again."<br></div>
