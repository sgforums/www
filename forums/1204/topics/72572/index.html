            <div class='col-md body'>Most Embarrassing Feminine Moments<br>A contest was organized by "New Woman Magazine" on<br>"Most Embarrassing moments" topic. The following are few good<br>embarrassing moments that magazine received from several women.<br><br>----------------- Curl Up and Die ------------------<br><br>I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three<br>kids in tow and asked<br>loudly, "How much do you charge for a shampoo and a<br>blow job?"<br><br>Melinda Lowe, 39,<br>Seguin, TX<br><br>----------------------- Pad, please! ---------------<br><br>An insurance man visited me at home to talk about our<br>mortgage insurance. He<br>was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I<br>wanted to follow as<br>best I could, so I told my 6-year-old son to run and<br>get me a pad.<br><br>He came back and handed me a Kotex right in front of<br>our guest.<br><br>Kathy Newman, 46,<br>Winston-Salem, NC<br><br>----------------------- Ho, Ho, Ho ----------------<br><br>I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came into<br>the bathroom and<br>wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a<br>mess, he looked<br>adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots.<br>They came out so well<br>that I had copies made and included one with each of<br>our Christmas cards.<br><br>Days later, a relative called about the picture,<br>laughing hysterically, and<br>suggesting I take a closer look.<br><br>Puzzled, I stared at the photo and was shocked to<br>discover that in addition<br>to my son, I had captured my reflection in the mirror<br>wearing nothing but a<br>camera!<br><br>----------------------- Lady Golfer------------------<br><br>I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of<br>golf balls. I was<br>unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After<br>browsing for several<br>minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking<br>gentlemen who works at<br>the store.<br><br>He asked if he could help me. Without thinking, I<br>looked at him and said, "I<br>think I like playing with men's balls."<br><br>Colleen Collins,<br>31, Ferndale, MI<br><br>--------------------- Nuts about You----------------<br><br>My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store<br>that sold a variety<br>of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the<br>boy behind the counter<br>asked if we needed any help.<br><br>I replied, "No, I'm just looking at your nuts." My<br>sister started to laugh<br>hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red<br>and walked away.<br><br>To this day, my sister has never let me forget.<br><br>Faye Emerick, 34,<br>Ellerslie, MD<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>-<br><br>The following are the top four winners of a Most<br>Embarrassing Moments<br>Contest in the "New Woman Magazine":<br><br>----------------- Na-na na-na na-nah! ------------<br><br>While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler<br>decided to release some<br>pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to<br>grab hold of her after<br>receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other<br>patrons. I told her that<br>if she did not start behaving "right now" she would be punished.<br><br>To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a<br>voice just as<br>threatening, "If you don't let me go right now, I will<br>tell Grandma that I<br>saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!"<br><br>The silence was deafening after this enlightening<br>exchange. Even the tellers<br>stopped what they were doing. I mustered up the last<br>of my dignity and<br>walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow.<br><br>The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me<br>were screams of<br>laughter.<br><br>Amy Richardson;<br>Stafford, Virginia<br><br>------------------- Surprise! ----------------------<br><br>It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was<br>living at home, but my<br>parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over<br>for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making<br>love, we heard the<br>telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to my<br>girlfriend that I give her a<br>nude piggyback ride to the phone. Since we didn't want<br>to miss the call, we<br>didn't have time to get dressed.<br><br>When we got to the bottom of the stairs, the lights<br>suddenly came on and a<br>whole crowd of people yelled, "SURPRISE!"<br><br>My entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins<br>and all my friends<br>were standing there. My girlfriend and I were frozen<br>in a state of shock and<br>embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity.<br><br>Since then, no one in my family has planned a surprise<br>party again.<br><br>Tim Cahill,<br>Poughkeepsie, New York<br><br>------------------ Priceless ----------------------<br><br>One of the funniest "most-embarrassing-moments stories<br>I've come upon in a<br>long time was about a lady who picked up several items<br>at a discount store.<br><br>When she finally got up to the checker, she learned<br>that one of her items<br>had no price tag.<br><br>Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the<br>intercom and boomed<br>out for all the store to hear, "PRICE CHECK ON LANE<br>THIRTEEN, TAMPAX, SUPER<br>SIZE."<br><br>That was bad enough, but somebody at the rear of the<br>store apparently<br>misunderstood the word "Tampax" for THUMBTACKS."<br><br>In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the intercom. "DO YOU<br><br>WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU<br>POUND IN WITH A<br>HAMMER?"<br><br>----------------- Mom's Advice-----------------------<br><br>A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the<br>class was squirming<br>around, scratching his crotch and not paying<br>attention.<br><br>She went back to find out what was going on. He was<br>quite embarrassed and<br>whispered that he had just recently been circumcised<br>and he was quite itchy.<br><br>The teacher told him to go down to the principal's<br>office. He was to phone<br>his mother and ask her what he should do about it. He<br>did it and returned to<br>his class.<br><br>Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the<br>room. She went back to<br>investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with<br>his penis hanging out.<br><br>"I thought I told you to call your mom." she screamed.<br><br>"I did," he said, "And she told me that if I could<br>stick it out till noon,<br>she'd come and pick me up from school."<br><br>So are you happy and de-stressed now????</div>

On their wedding night, she told her new husband, "Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin."<br>"What?" said the puzzled groom. "How can that be if you've been married ten times?"<img src="http://media.euniverse.com/funpages/cms_content/1850/lawyer.gif"><br>"Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative; he kept telling me how great it was going to be.<br><br>Husband #2 was in software services; he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.<br><br>Husband #3 was from field services; he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.<br><br>Husband #4 was in telemarketing; even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.<br><br>Husband #5 was an engineer; he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.<img src="http://media.euniverse.com/funpages/cms_content/1850/engineer.gif"><br><br>Husband #6 was from finance and administration; he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.<br><br>Husband #7 was in marketing; although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.<br><br>Husband #8 was a psychologist; all he ever did was talk about it.<br><br>Husband #9 was a gynecologist; all he did was look at it.<br><br>Husband #10 was a stamp collector; all he ever did was... God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!"<br><br>"Good," said the new husband, "but, why?"<br><br>"You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed<br></div>
