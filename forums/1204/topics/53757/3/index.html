What we made of it was what we would get. He said "No one owes us a living!" We had to be a rugged society, ever ready to roll up our sleeves to get the work done.

But it is hard to believe that I am still seeing such phenomenon happening in the adults' world, given that I am teaming with people with working experiences.<br><br>How the hell will I have thought that the team members even have problem like putting data correctly on a winword document?!<br><br>one of them even had the cheek to ask to look at my project diary for reference. how on hell can u find a person who doesnt know how to write a proper diary?!<br><br>and i havent even ask them to touch on the programming part of it.<br><br>I have no qualm if the result turns out to be poor due to my own neglience and inabilities, but I cant say the same if it is caused by the lack of committment from the others.<br><br>anyway, i can only pray that the marks are not <strong>evenly</strong> distributed among the group members. i might sound a little selfish over here, but i rather be standing high and dry on the ground than to be drown together with people who cant even bother to save themselves.<br><br>www</div>
