When he cried out, the Lord appeared and asked,<br><br>"Why are you crying?"

The woodcutter replied, "No."<br><br>The Lord again went down and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked. Again, the woodcutter replied, "No." The Lord went down again and came up with an iron axe. "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked. The woodcutter replied, "Yes."<br><br>The Lord was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all three axes to keep, and the woodcutter went home happily.<br><br>One day while he was walking with his wife along the riverbank, the woodcutter's wife fell into the river. When he cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?" "Oh Lord, my wife has fallen into the water!" The Lord went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez. "Is this your wife?" the Lord asked. "Yes," cried the woodcutter.<br><br>The Lord was furious. "You cheat! That is an untruth!" The woodcutter replied, "Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding. You see, if I said 'no' to Jennifer Lopez, You will come up with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then if I also say 'no' to her, you will thirdly come up with my wife, and<br>I will say 'yes,' and then all three will be given to me.<br><br>But Lord, I am a poor man and I will not be able to take care of all three wives, so that's why I said yes this time."<br><br>The moral of the story is whenever a man lies it is for an honorable and useful reason.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For all of us who feel only the deepest love and affection for the way<br>&gt;computers have enhanced our lives, read on.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the<br>&gt; computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up<br>&gt;with<br>&gt; technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving<br>&gt;$25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon".<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release<br>&gt;stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be<br>&gt;driving cars with the following characteristics:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to<br>&gt;buy a new car.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You<br>&gt;would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows,<br>&gt;shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could<br>&gt;continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause<br>&gt;your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have<br>&gt;to reinstall the engine.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,<br>&gt;five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five<br>&gt;percent of the roads.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all<br>&gt;be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation"<br>&gt;warning light.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 7. The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out<br>&gt;and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,<br>&gt;turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn<br>&gt;how to<br>&gt; drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the<br>&gt;same manner as the old car.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 10.You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The National Poetry Contest had come down to two, a Yale graduate and a redneck from Texas. They were given a word, then allowed two minutes to study the word and come up with a poem that contained the word. The word they were given was "Timbuktu."<br><br>First to recite his poem was the Yale graduate. He stepped to the microphone and said:<br><br>Slowly across the desert sand Trekked a lonely caravan; Men on camels, two by two Destination Timbuktu.<br><br>The crowd went crazy! No way could the redneck top that, they thought. The redneck calmly made his way to the microphone and recited:<br><br>Me and Tim a huntin' went. Met three whores in a pop up tent. They was three, and we was two, So I bucked one, and Timbuktu.<br><br>The redneck won hands down!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A highly timid little man, ventured into a biker bar in the Bronx and clearing his throat asked, "Um, err, which of you gentlemen owns the Doberman tied outside to the parking meter?" A giant of a man, wearing biker leathers, his body hair growing out through the seams, turned slowly on his stool, looked down at the quivering little man and said, "It's my dog. Why?"<br><br>"Well," squeaked the little man, obviously very nervous, "I believe my dog just killed it, sir." "What?" roared the big man in disbelief. "What in the hell kind of dog do you have?" "Sir," answered the little man, "it's a little four week old female puppy." "Bull!" roared the biker, "how could your puppy kill my Doberman?" "It appears that your dog choked on her, sir."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A group of girlfriends are on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads: "For Women Only". Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. "We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside." So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads: "All the men on this floor are short and plain." The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads: "All the men here are short and handsome." Still, this isn't good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads: "All the men here are tall and plain." They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect: "All the men here are tall and handsome." The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads: "There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman."<br></div>
