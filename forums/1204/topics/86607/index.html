On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr.Smith kissed his wife and said, "I'm off. The man should be here soon.<br><br>Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.<br><br>"Good morning madam. I've come to......"<br><br>"Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you," Mrs. Smith cut in.<br><br>"Really?" the photographer asked. "Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies."<br><br>"That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat.<br><br>After a moment she asked, blushing, "Well, where do we start?"<br><br>"Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too....you can really spread out!"<br><br>"Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and I."<br><br>"Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results."<br><br>"My, my, that's a lot of ....!!" gasped Mrs. Smith.<br><br>"Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure."<br><br>"Don't I know it," Mrs. Smith muttered.<br><br>The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. "This was done on the top of a bus."<br><br>"Oh my gawd!!" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.<br><br>"And these twins turned out exceptionally well, when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with."<br><br>"She was difficult?" asked Mrs. Smith.<br><br>"Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a good look."<br><br>"Four and five deep?" asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement.<br><br>"Yes," the photographer said. "And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling, I could hardly concentrate! Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in."<br><br>Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "You mean they actually chewed on your um...equipment ?"<br><br>"That's right. Well, madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work."<br><br>"Tripod??"<br><br>"Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to hold for very long. Madam? Madam? ...Good Lord, she's fainted!!"<br></div>
