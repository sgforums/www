It's that thing they do where everything is hunky dorey and suddenly, out of left field, they come up with some confrontational conversation that starts off with words like; "Honey, why don't you ever...?" or "You always..." or "Why can't you...?"<br><br>Is there something built into the female psyche that compels women to push, test and challenge their men? Why do women unnecessarily and irrationally create conflict, even when they're in happy, otherwise successful relationships?<br><br><strong>Just a view, no conflict...kindly do not flame me</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

A man, by nature, tends to look for comfort and consistency in his relationship.<br><br>A woman, on the other hand, tends to turn her primary relationship into a "Perpetual-Improvement Project." So, if there's nothing to work on or process, she's compelled to create something in order to continue work on her Project. As my uncle Jethro Love would say, "They've always gotta mess with things when things don't need fixin'."<br><br>You've probably heard the old familiar saying: A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change, and she does.<br><br>The interesting thing about familiar sayings is that a lot of them are based on real wisdom. In relationships, a man avoids change while a woman thrives on it -- if things seem a bit placid and static, it's time for her to stir things up!<br><br>they have to do it<br><br></div>

Why, exactly, must they do it? Ask 50 shrinks and you'll get 50 different answers. But I say that one of the main reasons they push is to see if there's anything there to push up against.<br><br>They need to know that you have a backbone, that you'll set limits, that you'll stand up for yourself. It makes them feel safe when you won't take any crap. It somehow provides them with reassurance that you are strong enough and confident enough to fight back when you're provoked and that you're capable of protecting them from danger.<br><br>Trying to check a man's protective capabilities by starting arguments is not totally logical, but it is bio-logical. It's a drive that goes back to the days when the womenfolk huddled in the cave while the men fought off a pack of ravenous saber-toothed tigers.<br><br>A woman's actual physical survival was dependent on having a strong, brave male at her side who could hunt and kill dangerous animals, and protect her from hostile tribes. That survival-based drive for a provider/protector still motivates the modern female.<br><br>it'll always be this way<br><br>So, even if a woman has super high Interest Level in you and she is also a sweet, loving and giving person, it's not uncommon for her to continually 'test your metal' somehow. She'll always feel the need to dig and question, pry and push in subtle or overt ways. Why?

It makes them feel safe when you won't take any crap. It somehow provides them with reassurance that you are strong enough and confident enough to fight back when you're provoked and that you're capable of protecting them from danger.<br><br>Thats why man are born to protect, woman are born to be care and pamper for... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Is man subject to similar malconformations, the result of arrested development, of reduplication of parts, and does he display in any of his anomalies reversion to some former and ancient type of structure? It might also naturally be enquired whether man, like so many other animals, has given rise to varieties and sub-races, differing but slightly from each other, or to races differing so much that they must be classed as doubtful species? How are such races distributed over the world; and how, when crossed, do they react on each other in the first and succeeding generations? And so with many other points.<br><br>The list of judgement goes on my friend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
