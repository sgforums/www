            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Episode 2</strong><br><br>It was a tough and slow-moving Monday, as kopi simply couldnÂ’t concentrate in working. It was one of the days when he has forgotten how to smile, while he spent the entire office day thinking how should behave and react during the date.<br><br>I mean, after all these years, everyone get excited to meet their old flame right?<br><br>But deep down inside, kopi was smiling big time. It was a childhood scar which he thought he would have to bring it to his grave. Never will he imagine that this wound of his now stand an opportunity to recover.<br><br>He promised himself, Â“I definitely have to thank the sians people for all the encouragement they gave. IÂ’m going to give them one hella dinner treat that they will never forget. I just got my first regular pay and money is surely not an issue.Â”<br><br>Finally, evening has arrived. As far as kopi can remember, it was the longest amount of time he spent on his hair. It was a brand new can of gel and he actually used all of it.<br><br>10 more minutes to the exact time of meet-up and kopi is already getting impatient. He never like waiting, yet he wished he has more time to be prepared, be it mentally or physically. now then he realized that having such short hair is a bad idea.<br><br>K: "i should have heed www's advice to grow longer hair.."<br><br>CL: "why are you talking to yourself?"<br><br>There she was. It has been quite a while but didnÂ’t change a bit. Look matured as before as she appeared with a red spaghetti and a levis skirt. Look girlish and the way kopi likes it.<br><br>Kopi was completely caught off-guard by her sudden appearance. He was facing the escalator all these while, thinking that she would emerge from the mrt station. Never did he expect that she would arrive from the other side. Suddenly, his lower torso felt funny.<br><br>K: "erm.. paiseh. i need to go to the washroom fast. be right back."<br><br>CL: "errr... oooook. thats a romantic line to use on a long lost friend. ok ok. seeya in a while. dont take too long."<br><br>She let of a chattering laughter as kopi made carl lewis looks like a secondary school boy.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Episode 3</strong><br><br>Twenty minutes has passed with silence as neither of them knows how to start a conversation. Having nothing better to do, kopi was observing the ice mocha from all angles, thinking Â“how is this different from those coffee I drank from the coffeeshop?Â”<br><br>CL: "is something wrong with the cup?"<br><br>K: Â“huh? Oh oh. Nothing. I was trying to figure out what does the number beneath the cup represents.Â”<br><br>Whoops. It was a lame reply and he knows it. The more he is in sought of a good topic to calm the situation down, the more confused he is. He was this close to asking Â“do you think figo is more effective playing left or right flank?Â”<br><br>CL: "so colin... what are you currently working as?"<br><br>K: "oh. i just signed on with the air-force, working as a...erm..."<br><br>CL: "yeah?"<br><br>K: "..erm.. i'm not sure yet. i'm still on course. hq havent assign me with anything yet. i am practically.. err.. studying everyday."<br><br>CL: "ah... i see. so is the course fun?"<br><br>K: "kinda.. its a long course. gotta sit for a test every friday."<br><br>CL: "gosh. must be tough on you, having to study everyday ah?"<br><br>K: "you bet", and kopi was trying so hard to contain his laughter. "so how about you? thought you are looking for a temp job?"<br><br>CL: "yeah. will be going for a couple of interview tomorrow as a promoters at suntec. hopefully i land the job as my pocket money is running dry soon."<br><br>K: "i'm sure you can do it."<br><br>CL: "thanks man."<br><br>the moment of silence re-emerged. both of them were looking at one another awkwardly, not knowing what to say.<br><br>CL: "say colin, does it bother your girlfriend that you are meeting one of your former female classmate here?"<br><br>K: "err.. i dont have one. hehe"<br><br>CL: "you cant be serious."<br><br>K: "yeah i am! in fact, i havent had a girlfriend before."<br><br>CL: "how can that be?! it's not like you attended a boy school. dont you hang around with girls?"<br><br>K: "not exactly.... but i do mix around with some girls lately, thru the internet.."<br><br>CL: "what?! you mean you buaya girls outta the internet?!"<br><br>K: "no lar! they come out as a group and i gotta know a few of them. we go karaoke, bowling, sentosa and etc. apart from this group, i normally mix around with my soccer kakis."<br><br>CL: "oh i see.. so what's with this no girlfriend thing? YouÂ’re a gay? hehe"<br><br>K: "nah.. i err.. just.. erm. never mind. let's skip this topic. So, had your dinner?"<br><br>CL: "yup. I was afraid that you had yours as well. donÂ’t wanna leave you sitting there while I eat."<br><br>K: "yub. i had mine too. so have you thought of going anywhere else after this?"<br><br>CL: "nope.. where do you suggest?"<br><br>K: "i have no idea as well. just feel like having a drink. let see..."<br><br>Kopi just recalled receiving an sms from dotsg, saying that the guys will be at the dungeon pub. He has initially turned down the invitation because of this date. On second thought, maybe it not such a bad idea. After all, he can behave more comfortable as a group.<br><br>K: "say, you wouldnt mind joining my friends and i at a karaoke pub for a drink, would you?"<br><br>CL: "would i? you gotta be kidding!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Episode 4</strong><br><br>The guys aint meeting until 10pm and that means both of them have a couple of hours to spare. Fortunately for them, espandale wasnÂ’t too far from where they were.<br><br>Not bad for kopi to take an evening stroll for a change, given that he is someone who loves chasing the ball. That should relax him down a little.<br><br>During then, kopi was mentioning the names inzaghi, beckham, owen and shearer, while CL constantly brought him back to track, asking him more about BGR.<br><br>10pm. Most of the guys were there except www, as he is still on his way from his night classes. Everyone made an informal introduction of themselves to CL and in no time, she is able to mix with the group pretty well.<br><br>After two hours of chit-chatting, singing, drinking and play pool, the guys decided to call it a night. Not wanting to be a lamp post, the gang automatically left both of them at the pub.<br><br>CL: Â“I like your friends. They sure are friendly. How long have you been knowing them?Â”<br><br>K: Â“for quite a few months. All of them are from the forum.Â”<br><br>CL: Â“you serious? They donÂ’t look like a group of people who surf net that often. Anyway, I think we should do this more often. I like mixing with all classes of friends.Â”<br><br>K: Â“why not? Say, donÂ’t you need to go back early tonight? You did say that you have interview going on tomorrow.Â”<br><br>CL: Â“not until afternoon. Hey, thatÂ’s pretty observant of you. I donÂ’t remember seeing you act this way back in school. Seems like you do change a bit. Â“<br><br>Kopi chuckled. The atmosphere changed a little and their minds start running around.<br><br>CL: Â“err..colin. thereÂ’s something which I have wanted to ask you all these yearsÂ…Â”<br><br>K: Â“huh?Â”<br><br>Though he can be a pretty insensitive person, but he does sense that something big is coming his way with that statement.<br><br>CL: Â“Â… I always wanted to ask you if you ever liked me?Â”<br><br>Ops. The million dollars question.<br><br>K: Â“Â…Â…Â”<br><br>CL: Â“I know itÂ’s a tough question. You can choose not to answer it if you donÂ’t want to.Â”<br><br>Kopi has never been more lost in his entire life. He was giving off a blank look for a straight 5 minutes. Suddenly, he recalls something which cwill told him before he left the joint.<br><br>Â“When in doubt, apply NikeÂ’s slogan.Â”<br><br>Mustering all his courage, he said, Â“err.. yeah. I guess so..Â”<br><br>CL: Â“you guess so?Â”<br><br>K: Â“I think so..Â”<br><br>CL: Â“you guess so and you think so? Which is which?Â”<br><br>K: Â“aint they the same?!?!Â”<br><br>CL giggles, Â“hehe. In fact, thatÂ’s what I wanted to hear.Â”<br><br>CL: Â“colin, what say we ditch the car tonight to drink to our heart content?Â”<br><br>Overwhelmed with how things progressed, kopi wasnÂ’t in the mood to consider. After all, he can always call in for urgent leave the following day.<br><br>K: Â“sure. Why not?Â”<br><br>And off they went. 2 jugs of bourbon and 3 jugs of beer. Not knowing that they are way off their limit, they ordered dozen of tequila shots. It was uncharacteristic of kopi to spend money this way but he has just gotten his regular pay a few weeks ago, so he didnÂ’t really mind.<br><br>It was 2am in the morning and the pub is empty except the two of them.<br><br>K: Â“*burp*. Hehe.. IÂ’ll be back. Washroom.Â”<br><br>CL was motionless. Guess she really drank too much.<br><br>Finally found his way to the toilet, kopi unzip his pant and began a long pee as he smiled to himself, thinking how smooth everything is working out.<br><br>As soon as kopi was thinking where should he bring her on the subsequent date, someone barged in.<br><br>It was CL.<br><br>K: Â“hey! CL! The ladies is over the other side!Â”, and kopi was unsure if he should zip up as he was halfway through the pee.<br><br>CL was least affected by his yelling and stood right next to him. She turned around and lifted up her skirt and let off a great sigh of relief as she began.<br><br>If you think goldfish has big eyes, you ought to see kopiÂ’s ones.<br><br>She was peeing all right, except that she did it standing up.<br><br>Not wanting to believe what he has just saw, kopi tilted his head to take a closer look at the entire process.<br><br>YES. She has one, something all guys have. Worst still, kopi made a visual comparison and realized his is not even half the size of Â“hersÂ”!<br><br>Flabbergasted and dumbfounded. Kopi was left standing there until CL is done with what she came in for. On her way out, she gave kopi a buddy pat on his shoulder, signaling that she will be outside waiting for him.<br><br>Ok. That does it. Kopi dashed out of the backdoor and practically stood in the way of a taxi and hop onto it.<br><br><strong>--- end of part 2 -----</strong></div>
