            <div class='col-md body'>The story about the tiny frogsÂ….<br><br>LifeÂ’s lesson<br><br>No. 1<br><br>There once was a bunch of tiny frogs,..Â… who arranged a running competition.<br><br>The goal was to reach the top of a very high tower.<br><br>A big crowd had gathered around the tower to see the race and cheer on the contestants...<br><br>The race began...<br><br>Honestly:<br><br>No one in the crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower.<br><br>You heard statements such as:<br><br>"Oh, WAY too difficult!!<br><br>They will NEVER make it to the top."<br><br>or:<br><br>"Not a chance that they will succeed. The tower is too high!"<br><br>The tiny frogs began collapsing. One by one...<br><br>... Except for those who in a fresh tempo were climbing higher and higher...<br><br>The crowd continued to yell<br><br>"It is too difficult!!! No one will make it!"<br><br>More tiny frogs got tired and gave up...<br><br>...But ONE continued higher and higher and higher...<br><br>This one wouldnÂ’t give up!<br><br>At the end everyone else had given up climbing the tower. Except for the one tiny frog who after a big effort was the only one who reached the top!<br><br>THEN all of the other tiny frogs naturally wanted to know how this one frog managed to do it?<br><br>A contestant asked the tiny frog how the one who succeeded had found the strength to reach the goal?<br><br>It turned out...<br><br>That the winner was DEAF!!!!<br><br>The wisdom of this story is:<br><br>Never listen to other peopleÂ’s tendencies to be negative or pessimistic...<br><br>Â…cause they take your most wonderful dreams and wishes away from you. The ones you have in your heart!<br><br>Always think of the power words have.<br><br>Because everything you hear and read will affect your actions!<br><br>Therefore:<br><br>ALWAYS beÂ…<br><br>POSITIVE!<br><br>And above all<br><br>Be DEAF when people tell YOU that YOU can not fulfil YOUR dreams!<br><br>Always think: <strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">I can do this!</span></span></strong></div>
