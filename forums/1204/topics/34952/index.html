After he has made the rounds the Commander looks at the Captain and says, "Wait a minute. You haven't shown me that small one over there. What's that used for?" The Captain says, "Well sir, you see that there are no women around. Whenever the men feel the need of a woman, they go there and use the camel.Â” Enough!" says the Commander in disgust. Well, two weeks later, the Commander himself starts to feel in need of a woman. He goes to the Captain and say's, "Tell me something, Captain." Lowering his voice and glancing around, he asks, "Is the camel free anytime soon?" The Captain says, "Well, let me see." He opens up his book. "Why, yes, sir, the camel is free tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock." The Commanders says, "Put me down for two o'clock then." So the next day at two o'clock the commander goes to the little blue building and opens the door. There inside he finds the cutest camel he's ever seen. Right next to the camel is a little step stool, so he closes the door behind him and puts the step stool directly behind the camel. He stands on the stool, drops his pants, and begins to have sex with the camel. A minute later the Captain walks in. "Ahem, begging your pardon, sir," says the Captain, "but wouldn't it be wiser to ride the camel into town and find a woman like all the other men?<br><br></div>
