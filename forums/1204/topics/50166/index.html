The higher the heels, the greater the weight on the ball of the foot.<br>There is also greater pressure on the knee-caps as they are in a constantly bent position.<br>Some studies show that a three-inch heel puts twice the amount of pressure on the ball of the foot. That means a woman who weighs 47 kg exerts a weight of 94 kg on her feet 10,000 times every day.<br>Pointy-toed shoes, which were all the rage last year, can end up squeezing toes together. This, in turn, can compress the nerves running through the toes, and can leave the foot with a tingling sensation.<br>It is also easy to develop corns and calluses since the toes are rubbing together.<br>And with all the toes squashed together, it is hard to grip the ground for the right amount of stability.<br>While some women cannot live without their heels, Ms Foster encourages them to think of the long-term effects they can have on one's health.<br>'Painful feet affect whole body functions and subsequently your quality of life,' she says.<br>She suggests saving high heels for special occasions, and for those where you will spend more time sitting down, rather than forcing your feet to buckle under double your normal weight.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bag envy<br>SOME handbags can damage not just your bank accounts but your shoulders, too.<br>A bag stuffed with your 170-g PDA, 215-g mobile phone, 500-g wallet, makeup pouch, vitamin box and numerous keys, can add up to a great burden on your shoulder muscles and arms.<br><br>IT HURTS: A heavy bag can cause chronic stress and tightness in the neck and shoulder muscles if it is carried on the same shoulder daily.<br><br>It is even more dangerous if your bag comes with a hard and chunky handle.<br>Dr Chang Haw Chong, associate consultant at the department of orthopaedic surgery at Changi General Hospital, says that chronic stress, and tightness in the neck and shoulder muscles can result if shoulder bags are carried on the same shoulder every day.<br>One can also get a stiff neck and numbness in the arms as the handbag sits on the levator scapulae - the muscle that helps to lift the shoulder blade.<br>This, in turn, pulls on the cervical and upper thoracic vertebra, which is the upper half of the spine bones behind the chest.<br>Dr Toh Choon Lai, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, says heavy shoulder bags can also precipitate or aggravate a condition known as thoracic outlet syndrome.<br>The common underlying cause of the syndrome is compression of the nerves and arteries in the thoracic outlet. This is the channel through which the nerves and blood vessels stretch from your neck to your arm.<br>This compression can be caused by an extra first rib, an old collar bone fracture, abnormal muscles or muscle hypertrophy, where muscles increase in size in response to increased work.<br>The pressure of a heavy bag will cause the nerve to be further compressed, leading to pain and numbness.<br>Both doctors advise women not to overload their handbags. Carry only the essentials.<br>But if the essentials end up weighing a tonne, avoid carrying the bag on one shoulder. Alternate the bag between both shoulders, or use both arms to support the bag.<br>Alternatively, use a backpack-style bag so that the weight is more evenly distributed between both shoulders.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beware fallout from rebonding<br>IMAGINE running your fingers through silky straight hair, only to have it come off in clumps.<br>That is what happened to Danielle Lugue, 14, after she rebonded her hair a year ago.<br><br>GOING STRAIGHT: Chemically-treated hair shafts are weaker and fracture more easily. This can lead to hair loss.<br><br>Her mother, sales and marketing director Fay Lugue, says her daughter's hair started breaking about two months after she had it rebonded.<br>Mrs Lugue, 39, says: 'It was scary. You'd see all her hair falling off in the shower. And it would be in big clumps, too.<br>'She's never going for rebonding again. It's just too unhealthy for the hair.'<br>Doctors and even some hairstylists agree that rebonding is one of the most damaging things you can do to your hair.<br>During rebonding, perming lotion is added to soften the hair and break down its bonds.<br>After this is washed off, hair is placed between two metal plates of an electric styling device, which uses heat to pull the hair rod-straight. A neutraliser is applied to reset the bonds and stabilise the hair.<br>Dr Eileen Tan, associate consultant dermatologist at Changi General Hospital and its resident hair expert, says: 'Hair is irreversibly altered after the perming process. Chemically-treated hair shafts are weaker and fracture more easily. This can lead to hair loss.'<br>If you must have absolutely straight hair, Dr Tan's advice is to go to an experienced and professional hairstylist who uses the right technique and equipment.<br>She says the rods of newer electric styling devices are now coated with non-stick materials so that hair does not get stuck. This reduces the risk of hair breakage.<br>She says: 'Hair is often damaged by careless treatment. The best approach is to treat your hair kindly.<br>'Avoid harsh shampoos, regular perms and chemical processes to your hair if you can help it.'<br><br></div>

This is the part of the nail below the nail fold and which is responsible for growth.<br>This can result in depressed lines running across the nail.<br>Viral warts or fungal infections can develop because it is easier for such micro-organisms to penetrate the nail.<br>Certain nail products can also damage the nails.<br>Nail hardeners, which are used to strengthen nails, often contain formaldehyde. This can give rise to allergic contact dermatitis, or skin irritation.<br>It can also cause onycholysis where the nail is lifted off the nail bed. This can cause much discomfort, like getting your nail caught on clothing, for example.<br>Prolonged use of formaldehyde can cause the nail to split and become brittle.<br>Dr Tan has also seen problems arise from nail sculpturing.<br>This involves attaching a plastic nail tip onto your natural nails. The entire nail is then covered with a layer of acrylic which comes in a powdered form.<br>Sometimes, fungus can form in the space between the natural and acrylic nails if the latter is not adhered properly.<br>Side effects to acrylic can occur, such as skin inflammation around the nails.<br>Inflammation can also spread to areas that come in contact with the nails, like the eyelids.<br>Dr Tan says: 'In the long term, the patient may not be able to give up regular nail sculpturing to cover the permanent damage, like uneven or discoloured nails.'

This, in turn, can compress the nerves running through the toes, and can leave the foot with a tingling sensation.<br>It is also easy to develop corns and calluses since the toes are rubbing together.<br>And with all the toes squashed together, it is hard to grip the ground for the right amount of stability.<br>While some women cannot live without their heels, Ms Foster encourages them to think of the long-term effects they can have on one's health.<br>'Painful feet affect whole body functions and subsequently your quality of life,' she says.<br>She suggests saving high heels for special occasions, and for those where you will spend more time sitting down, rather than forcing your feet to buckle under double your normal weight.<br><br>Bag envy<br>SOME handbags can damage not just your bank accounts but your shoulders, too.<br>A bag stuffed with your 170-g PDA, 215-g mobile phone, 500-g wallet, makeup pouch, vitamin box and numerous keys, can add up to a great burden on your shoulder muscles and arms.<br><br>IT HURTS: A heavy bag can cause chronic stress and tightness in the neck and shoulder muscles if it is carried on the same shoulder daily.<br><br>It is even more dangerous if your bag comes with a hard and chunky handle.<br>Dr Chang Haw Chong, associate consultant at the department of orthopaedic surgery at Changi General Hospital, says that chronic stress, and tightness in the neck and shoulder muscles can result if shoulder bags are carried on the same shoulder every day.<br>One can also get a stiff neck and numbness in the arms as the handbag sits on the levator scapulae - the muscle that helps to lift the shoulder blade.<br>This, in turn, pulls on the cervical and upper thoracic vertebra, which is the upper half of the spine bones behind the chest.<br>Dr Toh Choon Lai, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, says heavy shoulder bags can also precipitate or aggravate a condition known as thoracic outlet syndrome.<br>The common underlying cause of the syndrome is compression of the nerves and arteries in the thoracic outlet. This is the channel through which the nerves and blood vessels stretch from your neck to your arm.<br>This compression can be caused by an extra first rib, an old collar bone fracture, abnormal muscles or muscle hypertrophy, where muscles increase in size in response to increased work.<br>The pressure of a heavy bag will cause the nerve to be further compressed, leading to pain and numbness.<br>Both doctors advise women not to overload their handbags. Carry only the essentials.<br>But if the essentials end up weighing a tonne, avoid carrying the bag on one shoulder. Alternate the bag between both shoulders, or use both arms to support the bag.<br>Alternatively, use a backpack-style bag so that the weight is more evenly distributed between both shoulders.<br><br>Beware fallout from rebonding<br>IMAGINE running your fingers through silky straight hair, only to have it come off in clumps.<br>That is what happened to Danielle Lugue, 14, after she rebonded her hair a year ago.<br><br>GOING STRAIGHT: Chemically-treated hair shafts are weaker and fracture more easily. This can lead to hair loss.<br><br>Her mother, sales and marketing director Fay Lugue, says her daughter's hair started breaking about two months after she had it rebonded.<br>Mrs Lugue, 39, says: 'It was scary. You'd see all her hair falling off in the shower. And it would be in big clumps, too.<br>'She's never going for rebonding again. It's just too unhealthy for the hair.'<br>Doctors and even some hairstylists agree that rebonding is one of the most damaging things you can do to your hair.<br>During rebonding, perming lotion is added to soften the hair and break down its bonds.<br>After this is washed off, hair is placed between two metal plates of an electric styling device, which uses heat to pull the hair rod-straight. A neutraliser is applied to reset the bonds and stabilise the hair.<br>Dr Eileen Tan, associate consultant dermatologist at Changi General Hospital and its resident hair expert, says: 'Hair is irreversibly altered after the perming process. Chemically-treated hair shafts are weaker and fracture more easily. This can lead to hair loss.'<br>If you must have absolutely straight hair, Dr Tan's advice is to go to an experienced and professional hairstylist who uses the right technique and equipment.<br>She says the rods of newer electric styling devices are now coated with non-stick materials so that hair does not get stuck. This reduces the risk of hair breakage.<br>She says: 'Hair is often damaged by careless treatment. The best approach is to treat your hair kindly.<br>'Avoid harsh shampoos, regular perms and chemical processes to your hair if you can help it.'<br><br>Waxing lyrical<br>THE thought of a Brazilian wax can make one's hair stand on end.<br>It involves stripping off all the hair in the pubic region with hot wax.<br><br>IT BURNS, IT BURNS: Using hot wax to remove body hair can end up burning the skin and causing blisters if the wax is not cooled to a safe temperature.<br><br>While it can be as painful as it sounds, Dr Goh Chee Leok, medical director of the National Skin Centre, says it is a relatively safe procedure.<br>'Pubic hair doesn't have any protective function, so it's up to individual preference whether one wants it or not.'<br>As with waxing on any other part of the body or face, complications can arise if the wax is too hot.<br>Hot wax, if not cooled to a safe temperature, can burn the skin, and cause redness and blisters. It can take up to a week to heal with steroid cream and antihistamine medicine.<br>It is possible to develop a secondary infection if waxing is done extensively at one go. The skin can get a bit raw, and this can result in the skin follicles being infected.<br>Dr Goh says the skin must be cleaned before and after waxing with an antiseptic or soap and water to prevent such an infection.<br>He says it is not possible to spread bacteria or an infection through waxing, as the germs will be killed by the heat.<br></div>
