They poke gentle fun at a number of targets, mostly along gender and race lines, but also at spoiled teenage girls, and botox-riddled fashionistas.<br><br>Scenarios are engineered to heighten the awkwardness of the disguises, including a dance competition, shopping sprees, and a fashion show. Director Keenen Ivory Wayans (SCARY MOVIE) manipulates his characters' flimsy attempts to pass themselves off as white women to provide plenty of gross-out, body-related humor, but also wraps the film up with a few salient lessons in life for the bumbling detectives.</div>

Now that the Princess has completed college in America, she is returning to her country, Genovia. Since Mia is turning 21, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews) plans to step down and give her granddaughter the throne. But evil Viscount Mabrey (Jonathan Rhys-Davies) believes his nephew is the rightful heir, and Parliament decides that Mia will have to abide by an age-old Genovian law: no Queen shall rule without a husband. Mia has just thirty days to marry if she is to retain the throne that her family has held for over 500 years. The kindhearted but clumsy princess also has to win over the Genovian people and survive the constant paparazzi. Although a charming Englishman (Callum Blue) seems to fit the arranged marriage bill, Mia also finds herself drawn to the very man that is vying for the throne, the dashing Nicholas (Chris Pine). But can she trust her foe's intentions? Will Mia follow her heart, or sacrifice love for her country? Gary Marshall directs this fun romp-with-royalty that also features Heather Matarazzo and Hector Elizondo.</div>

As Anna, Kidman achieves a breathtaking emotional transparency to portray an intelligent woman who discovers another side of herself in the face of a bizarre, yet tantalizing possibility. The actress is beautifully paired with Canadian child actor Cameron Bright, who portrays the boy interloper with a haunting stillness and conviction.<br><br>Bringing an assured sense of style and form to a decidedly unconventional narrative, Glazer creates a world that is at once strange and familiar, like a fairy tale. Like many fairy tales, Birth is part romance, part mystery, and part family drama - woven into a magical whole about love, mortality and the unknown.</div>

Meanwhile, fine arts teacher Eunju also transferred schools, and is endowed with a special ability to see the ghost of Insuk, a dead female student. Eunju moreover finds that the death of Insuk is by no means irrelevant to her own life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_wimbledon.jpg"><br>opened on 7th Oct.<br><br>Britain's Peter Colt (PAUL BETTANY) has never quite lived up to his dreams of tennis stardom. Once ranked as high as number 11 in the world, the journeyman veteran has watched his number slip to 119 as his confidence on the court slowly ebbs away. Now, on the eve of his leaving the world of professional tennis, he's granted a wild card, allowing him to play his final Wimbledon tournamentÂ…make that his final tournament ever. At one time having faced some of the best players in the world, Peter Colt is now about to face voluntary retirement, a job at a club and a bevy of aging women awaiting tennis instruction in between facials and afternoon drinks.<br><br>American Lizzie Bradbury (KIRSTEN DUNST), the rising star/bad girl of the international tennis set, is the promising new hotshot playing at her first Wimbledon. Focused, driven and pushed to a level of superlative playing by her equally driven, overprotective coach and father, Dennis (SAM NEILL), Lizzie lets nothing get in her way of the winÂ—not a bad call, not an unexpected return and certainly not a short-lived romance with fellow rising American champ Jake Hammond (AUSTIN NICHOLS). Lizzie's career trajectory is set to be the best female tennis player in the world, a Grand Slam champ. No other dream will doÂ…and the Wimbledon trophy would be a great place to start.<br><br>Peter's plans of quiet retirement are put on hold after he arrives at the hallowed courts of The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club's Wimbledon Championships. There, after a chance meeting with Lizzie that sparks into an affair, he achieves the unthinkable and wins his first match. Fueled by a mixture of his newfound luck, love and on-court prowess, Peter continues his winning streak, gradually working his way up the ranks while the sport and its fans re-embrace this faded and now refurbished star.<br><br>The not-so-young Brit finds that the world indeed loves a winnerÂ—and none more so than his usually absent agent, Ron Roth (JON FAVREAU)Â—and he begins to appreciate the long-forgotten taste of victory. For herself, Lizzie soon finds that her penchant for tournament flings may be at an end when she does the unthinkable and begins to fall for this British used-to-be loser with the heart of a winner.<br><br>Now if Peter's (and Lizzie's) luck can just hold outÂ…</div>
