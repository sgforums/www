            <div class='col-md body'>I recently met up with the lady who gave her views on this issue after not having met her for awhile(she is from this forum too...and it brought back old memories about her views on this...I thought it is interesting to share with all people here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>Her thoughts....<br><br>You dun need to have sex with someone to show you are in love with him. Your bf will also be jealous of guys you've never slept with before just as long as he thinks you've loved them.<br><br>FYI, I would prefer my boyfriend not to be a virgin. I want him to have a broader experience of life before he settles down with me, so he won't hanker after something he's never had and leave me for it. Also, he'll be more experienced in bed- a definite plus<br><br>But I won't want to know who he's done it with or how many. If it's only been one other woman, I'll wonder if she means more than I do. If it's with two or more women, I'll wonder if sex means nothing to him. You don't win, my dears. So no point knowing.<br><br>And there is no point letting this knowledge haunt you. What is most important now is that your partner loves you most. Look at it from the other way- no point having her body but not her heart.<br><br>If my partner condemns me as cheap, I will leave him RIGHT AWAY. In a relationship, you have to respect each other or there is no basis for it to go on.<br><br>I'm also looking for somebody with a similar mind, somebody who's not conservative or close minded. If he is, I wouldn't have been attracted to him in the first place. And if I were stupid to fall in love with him, I think I would be wise enuff to get out of the relationship quickly. The difference in mindsets will cause a lot of unrepairable cracks in the relationship eventually.<br><br>And let's face it- a person is the sum of her experineces. You cannot love some parts of her and reject others. It all comes in a package. If let's say you have also done something wrong before you met your partner, which you are bound to have, like maybe break another girl's heart, is she supposed to hold it against you too? No, because she is looking at the person you have become, the wiser you who has learnt from his experiences, not all the mistakes you have committed. A person is really greater than the sum of his parts.<br><br>So have I ever regreted? Frankly, the answer is no. I don't believe that my body is the ultimate gift for my partner. I think prizing virginity is a stupid notion of possession- I have her viginity, therefore she belongs to me. And if you place all your hopes and dreams in the person you give your virginity to, there is a higher likelihood that you end up being disappointed. Why? Becos you see it as the ultimate gift, when it is actually not. There are other things that matter more.<br>Perhaps, my strongest argument is that I see my body not as a scared temple but something more organic- something I use to give and receive pleasure with a loved one. It's just a tool, a function of love. It does not represent love itself. That said, I dun have sex with people I have no feelings for.<br><br>And I would not have taken back all my sexual experiences in the world because it has colored my mind 'like wine through water'. I may have regreted doing it with one or two guys, but my mistakes have also taught me lessons on life. And these experinences have shaped my way of looking at the world, the person I am. They are invaluable as far as I am concerned.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br>Any comments on this? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
