            <div class='col-md body'>Embedded in the mind of an idealistic gay, is what we call the "exodus dream". It is a self-deluding vision, a mindset that leads one to believe that he or she is oppressed here in Singapore.<br><br>The countless number of young gay men and women whom we have talked to has rambled on enthusiastically in such a manner. Waxing eloquently about how such a 'land of the free' would do wonders to their boring simple lives, or how all their problems will dissolve and be for the better the moment they touch down on their promise land.<br>Most of them have a common motivating factor, be it the need get away from their families, get away from their environment and start "afresh" or basically just running away from their lives.<br><br>Then there are the ones whom genuinely believe that they can improve the quality of their lives by taking the bold step of migration. They believe that their social and personal problems will have an enhanced environment for improvement.<br><br>It is widely perceived that once the pressure from fear of the law, family pressure and the need to lead a hidden lifestyle disappear, one can start leading a life of free will and expression.<br><br>Gays in Singapore think that their life is hell due to the conservative Asian society's view of homosexuals as social deviants. Furthermore the law against unnatural sex (Section 377 of the Penal Code) is an added prejudice towards us. The promise of total political freedom and protection from discrimination, in the land "where all are equal" had lured thousands of Singaporeans to the developed first world countries.<br><br>What most chooses to forget, or remain ignorant of, is the fact that in these so-called free countries are numerous cases of hate crimes against homosexuals. And free speech may be all and good, but it too is a double-edged weapon. Bigoted homophobes also have the freedom to speak against us. Back home the Asian approach is to try and tolerate those who are different from us. It may not be the best of solutions, but hey, at least we are alive for it.<br><br>Putting the homosexuality issue aside, let's take a look at government policies in general. In the recent National Day Rally PM Goh announced that every citizen is to be issued the New Singapore Shares. Additionally a sum of money would be distributed into each and every CPF account. Now how many non-oil producing countries in the world do that?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's law against unnatural sexual practices places us at a certain disadvantage; however there has been no cases of policemen barging into gay couples' homes and dragging them to the nearest neighborhood police centers for their activities behind closed doors. Fatal assaults of gay couples however, are known to take place in various so-called democratic first world countries.<br><br>Singapore may be a conservative society that would not officially recognize people like us. But at least I do not have the fear of having to wake up, or worst still, the thought of my loved one caught in an Anti-Gay pride parade or attack.<br><br>We need not worry about our citizen status, for here in Singapore all are equal, regardless of race or religion.<br><br>In conclusion, leaving the place where you were borne and raised is not a solution to find a home for your heart. A lot of us fail to see that the problem lies neither with the environment nor the fact that we are gays. We create our own environment and our sexuality is but an excuse for that which goes wrong in our life.<br><br>Our decisions in life make for that which we live in. Wake up and smell the morning coffee. The problems in your life would not just disappear just because the time zone is different.<br><br></div>
