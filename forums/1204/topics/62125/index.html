His marriage with his wife Mary is shattered and he does not even have the chance to see his one year old daughter. Exhausted, Ming's everyday life seems like hell, but he still firmly believes that the situation will change.<br><br>At this time, a star of tomorrow is on the rise within the police force. Young officer Yeung Kam-wing (Leon LAI) with one great service after another and his under 40 age he is headed to the top of the police force; in Ming's eyes that is who he used to be! On a chance encounter, Ming and Wing become good friends but discover Wing's mysterious side. One of HON Sum's spies commits suicide right in front of Wing. Ming suspects that Wing may be just like him, an undercover agent for the mob!<br><br>As Ming is about to start an investigation, he realizes that a mysterious handicapped person is following him night an day. From Sum's spies, Ming discovers that the mystery person is Sum's former business partner Shum Ching (Chen Daoming), who appears to be related to Wing. Deciding to turn a new leaf, Ming goes through all kinds of hardship to find one piece of evidence after another. On one hand he wants to destroy Ming, on the other he has to prevent his own identity from being exposed. Unfortunately every time he gets close, he ends up with nothing. Wing and Ching even force him into a corner.<br><br>After numerous setbacks, gradually Ming feels that Wing is not suspicious at all and begins to doubt himself......<br><br>2001, it is the best of times.<br><br>Yan has been with Sum (Eric TSANG) for two years already, but Sum has never trusted anyone easily and only assigns meaningless jobs to Yan. In order to gain his trust, Yan betrays himself and breaks the law time and time again.<br><br>As time passes, Sum finally trusts Yan and even assigns him to be a mysterious Mainland businessman Ching's contact for a Mainland smuggling network. Unfortunately behind this business, Sum hides other ideas and causes a rift between Yan and Ching. Yan escapes death on several occasions and even attracts the attention of security department's Wing. He finds himself with enemies everywhere.<br><br>His superior Sunperintendent Wong (Anthony WONG) realizes that he is losing control and tries his best to pull Yan out. Both are endangered. Yan is gradually losing himself until he meets Dr. Lee (Kelly CHEN). Because of a severely violating crime, Yan is sentenced to psychological consulting. Originally Yan plans to ignore the court order but Dr. Lee who is responsible for this case refuses to yield. Yan is finally persuaded and accepts therapy.<br><br>During hypnosis therapy, Yan reveals his true identity. Dr. Lee becomes interest in Yan while doubting him. A relationship between a clear minded woman and a hypnotized man begins. Sum sends another order to oppose Ching's smuggling group. Yan knows this is his last chance to gain Sum's ultimate trust and decides to betray Superintendent Wong and face Wing's prosecution. Ching's group goes on the hunt and starts a slaughter ... in the end everything is in the clear!<br><br>As Ming falls into Hell, Yan rises to Heaven. Both cops want to live their lives anew. The end will put an end to this infernal era.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.gv.com.sg/Booking/movies/images/detail_texaschainsaw.jpg"><br><br>On August 20th, 1973, police were dispatched to the remote farmhouse of Thomas Hewitt, the former head-skinner at a local slaughterhouse in Travis County, Texas. What they found within the confines of the cryptic residence was the butchered remains of 33 human victims, a chilling discovery that shocked and horrified a nation in what many still refer to as the most notorious mass murder case of all time. Wearing the grotesque flesh masks of his victims and brandishing a chainsaw, the killer, known as Â“Leatherface,Â” would gain infamy when sensational headlines were splashed across newspapers throughout the state of Texas: Â“House of Terror Stuns Nation Â– Massacre in Texas.Â”<br><br>Local authorities would eventually gun down a man wearing a leathery mask and declare they had their killer, which abruptly closed the case; however, in the years that followed, many close to the grisly murder case would come forward to level accusations that police had botched the investigation and knowingly killed the wrong man.<br><br>Now, for the first time, the only known survivor of the killing spree has broken the silence and come forward to tell the real story of what happened on a deserted rural Texas highway when a group of five young kids inadvertently found themselves besieged by a chainsaw-wielding madman, one who would leave a trail of blood and terror that would forever become known as Â“The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Â”<br><br>New Line Cinema presents The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a terrifying journey into a heart of unimaginable darkness as five young adults are stranded in a rural Texas town, only to find themselves fighting for their lives against Leatherface and his bizarre clan. Inspired by the 1974 classic film of the same name, the new film stars Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel and Eric Balfour. Co-starring are screen veteran R. Lee Ermey, Lauren German, David Dorfman, Andrew Bryniarski, Terrence Evans, Heather Kafka and Marietta Marich.<br></div>

The production cost will reach HK$70 million. Days ago a report claimed that the film will have eight Best Actors with a total salary of HK$30 million. Lau Wai Keung said that is business secret and could not be revealed. As for whether Francis Ng Chun Yu and Tony Leung Ka Fai will join the cast, Lau Wai Keung is still studying the roles and have not actually talked with them yet. Right now the script is only at its fourth draft. The director also is considering Sammi Cheng Sau Man to reprise her role, but the final decision will lie with the final draft of the script. The White Dragon King gave the film one-word advice of "good". As for Lau Wai Keung, he was advised to keep his temper in check, be careful while driving and avoid high place. The film's only actress Kelly Chan Wai Lam yesterday did not appear. Alan Mak Siu Fai explained that Kelly had the flu and could not attend. Anthony Wong Chau Sun was working on a television series in Guangzhou and could not return in time for the event. On the other hand, yet to be confirmed cast member Li Bing Bing due to her multiple film deal with Media Asia attended the event.<br><br>This film is mainly actor driven and the only actress is Chan Wai Lam, but he would not have any onscreen romance with her. His role has always been talked about as the villain, will this be his first villain role? "The first time I heard the story the role was a villain, now it's changing." He felt that the character is unimportant. Because each film has many structures, as long as he did his part well then he is fine. Earlier at the press conference Lai Ming expressed that he has not signed the contract yet. Yesterday he said that he has already signed it and explained that at the time he has not finished reading the script and thus has not signed. He stressed that absolutely no unpleasantness has taken place. The fact is he has known Lam Kin Ngok and Mak Siu Fai for a long time. As for HEROIC DUO (SEUNG HUNG), his film with Dior Cheng Yi Kin, not performing well in Hong Kong, Lai Ming had no special comment. The film has performed well in China perhaps due to different viewer taste. He felt that director Benny Chan Muk Sing's focus was not on the Hong Kong market. Chinese Best Actor Chen Daoming two days ago arrived in Hong Kong for the morning ceremony yesterday. Today he returned to China to continue work. Some claimed that he would play a mob boss. Chen Daoming said that he has seen the script and indeed the character exists but for now he does not know whether he would play that role. For his first collaboration with Lau Ta Wa and Lai Ming, he flet that both are good actors and he has heard Wai Jai's songs. This is also his first Hong Kong film and he hopes that through this chance he could understand Hong Kong film production methods. Thus whether the role is a hero or a villain matters not to him.<br><br>Chen Daoming has worked with Leung Chiu Wai earlier on HERO. He never thought that they would work together so soon again. He also suggested to the writers to reduce garbage dialogues in the film because a movie is not necessarily better with more lines. His salary was rumored to be HK$2 million. Is he paid better in China or Hong Kong? "First we haven't talked about salary yet. Is that important?" He said that even with HK$2 million he would not be paid more than working in China. Leung Chiu Wai's role died in INFERNAL AFFAIRS. This story will take place six years before so he has a part in it.<br><br></div>
