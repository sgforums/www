            <div class='col-md body'>To love, with Ser<br>June 24, 2004<br><br>After nine long years, James Lye and Diana Ser to wed this Sunday<br><br>By Elisa Chia<br>Story and picture courtesy of TODAY<br><br>AN IMPRESSIVE, pea-sized diamond glittered on her left ring finger.<br><br>"ItÂ’s priceless!" Diana Ser chuckled, before deftly steering the conversation away from specifics about the sparkler.<br><br>Right, getting specific was silly of this reporter! Money shouldnÂ’t matter when it comes to love.<br><br>The 32-year-old Channel NewsAsia presenter will be tying the knot with actor-turned-banker James Lye, 35, this Sunday.<br><br>The big day will begin at about 8.30am, with James picking Diana up from her parentsÂ’ home in Potong Pasir.<br><br>The couple will exchange vows and rings in the presence of 500 guests at the Ritz Carlton Millenia hotel at 11am. The celebrations will culminate in a fivecourse Western luncheon, with close to 100 bottles of Moet and Chandon champagne being popped.<br><br>Celebrity chums Hossan Leong and Darren Seah are the emcees, but apart from them, none of the best men and bridesmaids are from the entertainment scene.<br><br>Asked how many sponsorship deals theyÂ’ve accepted for their wedding, Diana broke into laughter again Â— merely saying they were offered "good rates".<br><br>But this much the bubbly bride-to-be would share: The couple will be driven around on their wedding day in a dark blue Maybach Â— a Daimler Chrysler luxury car worth $1 million, according to Diana. Her gowns Â— "ItÂ’s slightly vintage, with lots of Chantilly lace" Â— are by local designer Kai.<br><br>Home is a split-level apartment in Orchard Road, into which the couple moved last September.<br><br>Save some brief footage which will appear on a Channel NewsAsia news bulletin, the wedding will not be televised, like that of American TV reality show couple Trista and Ryan.<br><br>"ThatÂ’s only for people who are truly famous!" she humbly demurred. SheÂ’s just being modest, of course.<br><br>Diana and her husband-to-be, who works with Citibank, are household names in Singapore.<br><br>TheyÂ’ve been together for nine long years, though Diana admitted that the going was not all smooth Â— their relationship went through "on-and-off" patches over the years.<br><br>"ItÂ’s more on than off lah. You know, itÂ’s the usual couple fights and cold wars Â… not so much the fact we were in the limelight," she said.<br><br>Cupid struck Diana and James in 1994 on the set of Showbuzz, right in the heart of MediaCorpÂ’s headquarters, the Caldecott Broadcast Centre.<br><br>"I was supposed to be his cohost in Showbuzz," Diana recounted. "But I got bumped off at the last minute Â… and Lauretta (Alabons) came in."<br><br>Diana became the entertainment showÂ’s research writer instead.<br><br>"Of course I was disappointed! But precisely because I didnÂ’t become his co-host, he then decided to ask me out," Diana smiled coyly. "He didnÂ’t want to be involved with a colleague he worked closely with. Well, at least that was what he told me!"<br><br>Their first date was a dinner at an Italian restaurant. Although Diana didnÂ’t know it was supposed to be a date.<br><br>"When we first went out, I thought he was trying to sell me insurance. I kept waiting for him to pop the question: Would you like to buy insurance?" she laughed.<br><br>"When I met him, he was a model-like figure who had just came back from the States and spoke with a drawl. It didnÂ’t occur to me that he was interested in a petite girl like me.<br><br>"I thought he would go for the model type. Hence, the assumption that he was an insurance agent."<br><br>But they werenÂ’t an item "till a good four, five years later".<br><br>"It took us a long time. It was hard. He had just started in the entertainment business and I was trying to build up my career as well.<br><br>"We werenÂ’t comfortable going public simply because we donÂ’t know where it was heading. We didnÂ’t want to be a Bennifer," said Diana, referring to Ben Affleck and Jennifer LopezÂ’s ill-fated romance, which they blamed on intrusive media attention.<br><br>But a normal life is what she wants. James is far from a glamour boy Â— or a playboy as he was said to be in the past Â— and the two want to start a family as soon as possible.<br><br>"James is a very family-oriented person. I guess every woman wants to marry a man whoÂ’ll take care of the family. WeÂ’re ready. ItÂ’s a matter of when weÂ’ll be blessed with them," she said, adding that they hope to have three children, just like their families.<br><br>"WeÂ’ve made plans to go on our honeymoon at the end of the year, but we just realised the other day: How are we going to do that if IÂ’m pregnant?"<br><br>Which means that those Royal Caribbean cruise tickets will be on hold, for now.<br><br>Grab your copy of 8 Days this week for wedding photos of Diana and James.<br></div>
