            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SeaWhale:</div><div class="quote_body">Let's not forget :<br>In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and occupied it for several months, plundering it of its wealth and committing atrocities against its people. (If you insist this is Western propaganda, please fly to Kuwait and ask the Kuwaitis, who are also Muslims). With the backing of the UN, US led a coalition and defeated Iraq in Kuwait. In its retreat, the Iraqi army set on fire several oil fields in Kuwait.<br><br>Following the liberation of Kuwait, Iraq was required by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to disarm itself of all weapons of mass destruction and long range missiles, and allow UN weapons inspectors to verify the disarmament. However, Iraq played hide and seek with the inspectors and even expelled them at one stage. For not complying with UNSC, United Nations imposed economic sanctions against Iraq. In Sep last year, USA asked for UN resoluation 1411 requiring Iraq to disarm and co-oporate with the inspectors fully or face serious consequences. Today, 12 years after Iraq was ordered to disarm by UN, the Chief Inspector still cannot declare that Iraq has totally disarmed itself of WMD.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. There was a diplomatic fallout between the Iraqi regime and Washington in 1988. I had read about this quite sometime ago, and have a somewhat fuzzy recollection. But from the little I could recall, it was something about Washington ignoring Iraq requests for cooperation in technological advancements and humanitarian aid. They(Iraq) believed that it was not paid it's dues for doing the dirty work in the IRAN-IRAQ war, since they were the main tool the US used in fighting the Iranians. It is a fact that the American's were the ones who armed Saddam with Chemical weapons to use in the IRAN-IRAQ war.<br>Now I am mentioning this because on the 1st Day of the War, an Iraqi minister was giving a press conference and it was showed LIVE on CNN. He was rambling about how the US forces will be defeated and then he stopped to explain to a foreign journalist why Washington is taking such a stance against Iraq. This were his exact words, "Let me tell you about 1988. I'm not talking about 1998 but 1988. Washington....." CNN, paused the coverage abruptly, and the CNN anchor came on with a smaller caption of the press conference in the background with the speech muted. A full 30 seconds later, they resumed the broadcast of the press conference.<br><br>Looking at the current military capabilities of Iraq, do you think this regime is even capable of another invasion on Kuwait. Their soldiers are carrying AK-47's for goodness sake. Their missile defense systems are so in effective. The US is the one who possess WMD.<br><br>WMD are not pencils or erasers the Iraqis can hide under the desert. After 10 over years of inspections, they have yet to find any except chemical agents. It's true that Iraq had used chemical agents to kill Kurdish guerillas in the North. But it's all western propaganda on they killing women and children. They were not targeted but were just collaterals.<br><br>Use of chemical weapons. Why this uproar? What difference does it make to die from a bullet wound or one from nerve agents? It's still the same bloody outcome. hell awaits you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
