            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">From strapping it on to riding into the sunset </span></strong><br><br>Out in the boat and ready to get in the water.With your feet firmly installed in the bindings, sit in the water with your knees bent and the board parallel to the water's surface, floating naturally. The bottom of the board should be facing the boat. The rope goes over the top of the board and the handle should be held with both palms facing down and your arms should be straight. Let your knees fall open so that your arms are resting between them. Pull your shoulders back and keep your chest up.<br><br>Once you are ready, inform the driver. When you feel the boat starting to pull, concentrate on maintaining your body position; strong bent knees, arms straight, shoulders back and chest up. As you start getting pulled out of the water, don't try to "muscle" your way up with your arms. Let the boat do the work. When it comes to a tug of war between you and the horsepower engine in that boat, unless you're Superman, you aren't going to win.<br><br>The board should begin to plane on top of the water. Once the board is above the water, straighten your legs to a standing position as you bring the rope to your lead hip. Twist at the waist so that your shoulders are facing the boat and your feet are facing the shore. Keep the handle at your lead hip, your shoulders back, twist at the waist, your chest up and back straight as though you were standing on solid ground, with knees slightly bent.<br><br><span class="small">*Article from WakeWarz</span><br></div>

You are also going to want to have the rope centered like you do for a normal wakeboard start.<br><br><strong>First Way:</strong> Sit in the water with the board floating face up and you floating behind the board. Now put your heels on the board and keep the board afloat on top of the water in front of you. This will feel awkward because you feel like you are going to leave the board as soon as the boat pulls you up. Actually, what will happen is when the boat pulls you up, your body weight is going to come forward and down causing the board to push into the water and stay under you.<br><br><strong>Second Way:</strong> This way is a little harder for beginners because it involves holding the board. You need to sit in the water holding the board with one hand. This means holding the board to your feet out in front of you and holding on to the rope with the other hand. When you get the slack out of the rope, you will be able too let go of the board because the water will be pushing it against your feet. Now you can put your other hand on the handle and you are ready to go.<br><br><strong>Foot Position:</strong> I recommend putting your back foot on the tail of the board and your front foot more in the middle. The way you set your feet is the way you are going to have your feet when you get up.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Don't know about wakeboarding? Start here!! </strong></span><br><br><strong>What's wakeboarding?</strong><br>For those who don't already know, wakeboarding is a combination of surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding and waterskiing.<br><br>A wakeboard looks like a fat snowboard with a pair of bindings to secure the wakeboarder's feet to it. Most boards are 130cm to 142cm long and 42cm wide.<br><br>Propelled by a speed boat, the rider on the board pulls off body leans and jumps while whizzing across the water.<br><br>A wakeboarder can hit speeds of about 30kmh while riding on the boat's wake, from where he launches a variety of tricks.<br><br><strong>The tricks</strong><br>For beginners, there are the toe-side and heel-side edgings, which involve cutting the wake and manoeuvring to the left or right, and surface tricks which involve turning the board 180 deg or even 360 deg.<br><br>Intermediate riders do wake jumps and grabs - that is, grabbing or touching the board after popping off the wake - and basic rotational tricks.<br><br>The advanced rider will do soaring jumps, massive flips andprogressive rotational tricks executed in mid air like those performed by the pros at the weekend's wakeboard competition.<br><br>Basically, the more advanced one is, the higher and further one can jump.<br><br>Most advanced tricks require the rider to first be airborne. Apart from executing the tricks with precision, the rider must also be able to land and steady himself afterward.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why wakeboarding?</strong><br>The fact that this dynamic sport allows for the rider to exercise creativity in executing the stunts accounts in part for its growing popularity.<br><br>The sport is also addictive. The adrenalin rush from the speed keeps thrill-seekers coming back for more.<br><br>For others, it is more about getting a good overall workout and a glorious tan.<br><br>Having a bunch of friends who wakeboard will pretty much get you into the groove because the enthusiasm is infectious.<br><br>I got dragged into giving it a shot by a few ex-colleagues who tried it and loved it.<br><br>The exhilarating feeling of landing a big jump - 'You call that big?' my instructor taunted - and nailing an Indy grab for the first time overwhelmed me.<br><br>I just couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the week.<br><br>I have paid it forward by being the main reason all of my close friends have started or tried wakeboarding.<br><br>What we'd give up to hit the water? Plenty.<br><br>We are natural party animals, but we would cut down on nightlife to save money for boat rental, wakeboarding accessories and expensive surf wear.<br><br>Many among us are also natural night owls, but we would wake up at 7am and travel through half of Singapore just to hop on a boat and ride the calm early-morning waters.<br><br>Yes, we're hooked.<br><br><strong>Getting started</strong><br>It costs roughly S$70 to $105 per hour to rent a boat. This cost is usually split among four to five people.<br><br>Most instructors double as boat drivers so you actually get tips and coaching during the session.<br><br>Some wakeboarding centres in Singapore such as Pro Air Watersports at Marina Country Club offer beginners' courses at about S$250 for four hours - enough time for four or five people.<br><br>What to wear: A T-shirt or bikini top and a pair of board shorts is standard attire.<br><br>Some fashion-savvy wakeboarders do put a bit more effort - and money - into what they wear though. The sport is, after all, quite a 'glamorous' one, and many go out there to see and be seen.<br><br>Whatever you decide to wear, just make sure your garments hold up or you might find yourself caught in an embarrassing peek-a-boo moment.<br><br>Of course, bring a change of clothes so you can shower afterwards.<br><br>Everything else - other than the water and sunscreen! - will be provided by the wakeboarding centre: the rope and handle; the wakeboard and bindings and the safety vest whichkeeps you afloat and protects your upper body.<br><br>If you want to buy your own wakeboard, brand new or second-hand ones can be bought at some wakeboarding centres. Most will allow you to try the boards out first.<br><br>A brand new wakeboard and bindings will set you back by between S$750 and S$1,500. You can save a few hundred dollars by purchasing a used one.<br><br></div>
