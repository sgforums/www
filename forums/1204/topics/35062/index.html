            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Extracted from The Straits Times</span><br><strong>Taxi shortage issue unresolved</strong><br><br>I AM writing in response to the Land Transport Authority's new service regulations and the article, 'Slammed for taxi shortage, Comfort eyes 4 proposals' (ST, Feb 6).<br><br>The measures that they are implementing or proposing only address the problem at a superficial level and at an increased cost to consumers.<br><br>My idea of good service is convenience at an affordable rate. Convenience would mean being able to flag down a cab with relative ease and not being stuck in a taxi stand queue for more than 15 minutes.<br><br>During peak hours, there are long queues at taxi stands in the city but no empty cabs in sight. Through my conversations with several cab drivers, I understand that this is mainly because they will have to pay Electronic Road Pricing charges if they enter the zone without passengers.<br><br>This misallocation of resources goes beyond the peak hours.<br><br>Take Changi Airport, for example. There always seems to be more cabs than commuters there. This would imply that there is a shortage of taxis elsewhere.<br><br>So what will the newest measures and proposals by the LTA and Comfort achieve in the end? The LTA's service regulations make it 'easier' for commuters to book a cab.<br><br>Does it address the problem of misallocation of resources? Does it encourage cab drivers to go to areas with a supply shortage?<br><br>My opinion is that it merely passes the burden of poor service on to the consumers.<br><br>Consumers will continue to find it difficult to flag down a cab and will continue to wait at taxi stands with no cabs in sight and, ultimately, be compelled to book a cab and pay the additional $3.20 for booking charges.<br><br>Why are consumers being made to pay for bad service? This new regulation merely makes it easier for desperate commuters to book a cab without addressing the real problem of misallocation of resources.<br><br>As for Comfort's proposals, the increase in the peak-hour surcharge attempts to motivate cab drivers to be more responsive during peak hours but, in fact, penalises consumers for poor service in the first place.<br><br>I am, however, glad that Comfort is considering expanding its fleet because that would address the problem of inadequate supply directly.<br><br>The regulatory body and cab companies should get together to resolve this poor allocation of resources instead of coming up with measures that penalise the consumers.<br><br>CHIU LI YU<br><br><span style="color: red;">you folks think price increase will really rectify or lighten this problem?</span></div>
