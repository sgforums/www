            <div class='col-md body'>We're forced to have s3x, say 5 in 100 students<br>Survey shows those who reject s3x usually cite fear as the reason, and not because they think it is wrong.<br><br>THE results of the survey are troubling: Five out of every 100 secondary school students claim they have been 'forced' to have s3x.<br><br>Six out of every 100 said they have been pressured into performing s3xual acts they did not want to.<br><br>The survey also revealed that one in two youngsters has been bullied in one way or another - they have been called names, teased, heard nasty rumours about themselves and been the butt of sarcastic remarks.<br><br>These results were released yesterday by the Northeast Community Development Council (CDC) and Fei Yue Counselling Centre, which conducted the poll.<br><br>A total of 5,853 students, aged 13 to 17, from nine schools in the Northeast CDC were canvassed for their responses on topics that ranged from satisfaction with their family life, vulnerability to s3xual activities, involvement with youth crimes and experience of being bullied.<br><br>Of those surveyed, 3,086 completed the section on pre-marital s3x, while the other 2,767 responded to the one on delinquency and bullying. They were polled last October.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the survey, 259 students said someone had tried to get them to have s3x in the past 12 months, and 83 gave in.<br><br>Those who turned the person down usually did so out of fear - fear of pregnancy, fear of contracting ####-transmitted diseases or fear of losing self-respect.<br><br>The fact that they were not motivated to do so because they believed it was wrong, shocked the handful of people The Straits Times spoke to.<br><br>Social worker Tony Ong, from the Fei Yue Family Service Centre, wondered: 'Does it mean that if safe s3x is guaranteed, a lot of them would have s3x?'<br><br>Mrs Wijaykumar Rukmani Devi, who is in charge of student welfare at Bowen Secondary, said: 'If five in 100 say they were forced to have s3x, then the number who actually had s3x must be larger because some would have done so out of love.'<br><br>Both believe parents and educators should play a bigger role in instructing teenagers about s3x, because it is better to be upfront about the topic and because some youngsters have nobody to speak to about it when they have problems.<br><br>Serangoon Secondary principal Dilbagh Singh said: 'We've known all along that s3x and bullying are issues youths face; now we have the data to prove it.'<br><br>Teachers in his school meet students individually every week on a rotational basis, he added, to find out if they have problems.<br><br>As for bullying, Radin Tri Iskandar, 15, a Secondary 3 student of Serangoon Secondary, said: 'The older students would call me 'stupid' or 'idiot'. But I'd tell myself it's not true and ignore them.'<br><br></div>
