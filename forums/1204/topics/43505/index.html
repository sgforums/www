            <div class='col-md body'>Got a close friend since Secondary 1. We are in university together. We are quite close, and would share our thoughts on a lot of things.<br><br>One day, he introduced me to this girl that he likes. It was a normal introduction and outing, nothing more. Few days later, I got to meet this girl again. This time, I asked for her phone number to remain in touch as casual acquaintances.<br><br>I got to chat with the girl occassionally. When my friend found that we had been chatting with each other, he told me he felt 'betrayed'. I told him there is nothing between me and the girl. I don't even like the girl in the first place. Yet, he chose to think of me of someone who had betrayed his trust, and stepped in as a rival competitor.<br><br>And I make a stupid mistake, telling him that "even if I like the girl, it is up to the girl to decide to accept or reject the relationship."<br><br>The hatred lasted on for weeks, months. Though I didn't really hate him, I was fed-up and troubled by the matter for a long time.<br><br>Now things seemed to be okay between me and him. However, we seldom talk to each other anymore. We don't ask each other out on weekends. We don't chat even when we meet each other at a common friend's outing.<br><br>There is this sense of awkwardness between us. The feeling I have inside may mirror the kind of feeling that you are feeling now. It sucks big time. I don't think there is ever a way to get the friendship back to the original state again. All you can do is to accept that such unhappiness had occurred and carry on life from there.</div>
