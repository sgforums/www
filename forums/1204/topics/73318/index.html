It was a close call; she had visions of dead people accompanying her during her darkest minutes. But now that she is blessed with a second chance, she vows never to return to self-destruction again, or to Sam -- her romantic interest.<br><br>But just when Joey looks forward to a brand new life, she discovers that she is pregnant. Confused and desperate, Joey tries to contact Sam but only gets hurt by his evasive response. Being tortured by the thought of an abortion, Joey finds herself becoming delusional and emotionally unstable. She is frequently threatened by the sudden presence of strangers, and also feels stalked by a mysterious woman. The stalker actually confronts her on one occasion -- making eye contacts with her on a train platform, then, throwing herself at a running train! Joey breaks down at the sight of the suicide, only to discover later that Â“no jumperÂ” is found on the trackÂ…<br><br>Joey suspects herself suffering from pre-partum depression. Yet she decides to keep her baby. She is hoping that her love for her child will support her to counter the odds. Yet her problems do not stem from her psyche but her former suicide attempt; the vision of dead people during her near-death minutes was only a prelude to her newfound ability Â– she has been able to see the dead since. The revelation strikes mercilessly when Joey pays a visit to the hospital and gets trapped in an elevator with a woman in labor -- Joey witnesses the most petrifying stillbirth caused by a ghostÂ…<br><br>Joey urges help from a Buddhist monk who reveals an agonizing truth -- beside every pregnant woman stands a spirit awaiting the next life. What Joey has witnessed was indeed a failure attempt of reincarnation that the stillbirth was only a tragic coincidence. The monk further explains that seeing the dead is indeed an innate but degenerated ability of human. This ability is sometimes revived in extreme cases of near death and laboring, during which the survival instinct would utilize every available resource to protect the body.<br><br>Â“A spirit is only a co-existing energy, like a tree, a fly, like you and me,Â” he explains, Â“If you have a reason to exist in the form you are now, so do they.Â”<br>But Joey cannot live with the sight of the co-existing and the fate of her child Â–- the woman spirit who has committed suicide is indeed going to be her child! If Karma is the explanation, what good or evil could she have done to this unknown woman?! OrÂ… has she? Joey is determined to unveil the identity of the mysterious woman, but every truth comes with a costÂ… and this one in particular is not what Joey can afford.<br></div>

Adolescence changed JeabÂ’s immediate social group and he started hanging around with other boys, and even agreed to torment the other girls -- including Noi-Na -- at his friendsÂ’ behest. Noi-Na was understandably upset and angry and her family moved to another province a week later. Jeab didnÂ’t see her after that, but 20 years later, he received an invitation to Noi-NaÂ’s wedding. He wants to attend her special day, of course, but how can he live down the shame of his earlier, irresponsible actions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://202.172.226.84/Booking/movies/images/detail_50firstdates.jpg"><br>Scatological and sentimental, satirical and sincere, 50 FIRST DATES pairs Adam Sandler with Drew Barrymore in this romantic comedy about the power of love and short-term memory loss in Hawaii. Henry Roth (Sandler), the local marina veterinarian, only dates tourists because he's afraid of commitment--that is, until he meets Lucy (Barrymore). Unfortunately, Lucy lost her short-term memory months ago in a car accident, and for her, each day is October the 13th. She follows the same routine every day--breakfast at the same restaurant, pineapple-picking with her dad, and eventually bed time, where sleep wipes away her short-term memory. Henry, however, refuses to be forgotten, and as his puppy love matures, he embarks on a quest to restore her memory, or at least be a part of her everyday routine. But vying for Lucy's attention isn't always easy. Sandler explores various neophytic approaches before making a video for Lucy to watch every morning, reminding her of who she is and what she's doing. The film includes a trademark Sandler ballad as Henry serenades Lucy with his ukulele and a series of familiar salacious puns. Rob Schneider plays Henry's best friend, a goofy native stoner whose physical hijinks earn many of laughs, and a cameo by Dan Akroyd as Lucy's doctor rounds out the cast.</div>

The film opens in the Garden of Olives (Gethsemane) where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Jesus resists Satan's temptations. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is arrested and taken back to within the city walls of Jerusalem where the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his results in a condemnations of death.<br><br>Jesus is brought before Pilate, the Roman Governor of Palestine, who listens to the accusations leveled at him by the Pharisees. Realizing he is confronting a political conflict, Pilate defers to King Herod in the matter. Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who gives the crowd a choice between Jesus and the criminal Barabbas. The crowd chooses to have Barabbas set free and to condemn Jesus.<br><br>Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and flagellated. Unrecognizable now, he is brought back before Pilate, who presents him to the crowd as if to say "is this not enough?" It is not. Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma, ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes.<br><br>Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem all the way up to Golgotha. On Golgotha, Jesus is nailed to the cross and undergoes his last temptation -- the fear that he has been abandoned by his Father. He overcomes his fear, looks at Mary, his Holy Mother, and makes the pronouncement which only she can fully understand, "it is accomplished." He then dies: "into Thy hands I commend my Spirit."<br><br>At the moment of his death, nature itself overturns.<br></div>

While Wuornos confessed to the six murders, including a policeman, she claimed to have killed only in self-defense, resisting violent assaults while working as a prostitute.<br><br>Bravely burrowing beneath the tabloid headlines about AmericaÂ’s first female serial killerÂ—and the mediaÂ’s sordid designation of Wuornos as an unrepentant monsterÂ—in the midst of the horrors and pathologies, first-time writer-director Patty Jenkins unearths an unlikely love story between two misfits.<br><br>Nearing suicidal despair, Wuornos wanders into a Florida bar, where she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a young woman sent by her parents to live with an aunt in order to Â“cure her homosexuality.Â” WuornosÂ—victim of a tragic, abusive upbringingÂ—quickly falls in love, and clings to Selby like a life preserver.

Maniacally devoted to his job, when he's on duty no crime goes unpunished - and he's always on duty. And that's a good thing, because he has some metaphorically big shoes to fill: his mother was a legend on the force, one of the best cops in the history of Bay City. But while his mom stuck with the same partner throughout her entire career, due to his extremely zealous brand of police work, Starsky burns through partners faster than his beloved Gran Torino goes through spark plugs.<br><br>Detective Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (OWEN WILSON) is having career issues of his own - he's a good cop, but his hazardously laidback personality and desire for a quick buck don't always get the job done. He has excellent instincts, he just needs a little bit of focus to keep him on the admittedly less profitable side of the law. Exasperated Bay City Police Captain Dobey (FRED WILLIAMSON) has found the perfect solution for two of his biggest problems: pair up Starsky and Hutch and put them out on the streets.<br><br>As soon as the two mismatched crime fighters unhappily begin their first day on the beat as a team, a "floater" turns up on the Bay City coastline. With the help of Hutch's dynamite, street-savvy informant Huggy Bear (SNOOP DOGG), the two begin to unravel the mysterious murder case. Investigating their first clue, the boys meet Staci (CARMEN ELECTRA) and Holly (AMY SMART), Bay City Cheerleaders who are more than eager to help - in any way they can.<br><br>All signs seem to point at wealthy businessman Reese Feldman (VINCE VAUGHN), but Starsky and Hutch just can't seem to make a case against him. Unbeknownst to them, Feldman has cooked up a plan to foil the DEA and is plotting the biggest and most lucrative drug deal of his career.<br><br>The unlikely duo will use their canniest undercover skills, hardcore street smarts and striking good looks to solve the crime and make sure the criminal does the time. Because, as David Starsky says, "In Bay City, when you cross the line, your n*ts are mine."</div>

Henry Roth (Sandler), the local marina veterinarian, only dates tourists because he's afraid of commitment--that is, until he meets Lucy (Barrymore). Unfortunately, Lucy lost her short-term memory months ago in a car accident, and for her, each day is October the 13th. She follows the same routine every day--breakfast at the same restaurant, pineapple-picking with her dad, and eventually bed time, where sleep wipes away her short-term memory. Henry, however, refuses to be forgotten, and as his puppy love matures, he embarks on a quest to restore her memory, or at least be a part of her everyday routine. But vying for Lucy's attention isn't always easy. Sandler explores various neophytic approaches before making a video for Lucy to watch every morning, reminding her of who she is and what she's doing. The film includes a trademark Sandler ballad as Henry serenades Lucy with his ukulele and a series of familiar salacious puns. Rob Schneider plays Henry's best friend, a goofy native stoner whose physical hijinks earn many of laughs, and a cameo by Dan Akroyd as Lucy's doctor rounds out the cast. </div></blockquote>]<br><br>i wanna watch....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
