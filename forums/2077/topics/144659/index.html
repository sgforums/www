Unless we turn into a welfare state.. but that would mean higher income tax for everyone else..<br><br>2) Reasons against: private companies will continue to exploit this loophole..<br><br>to be honest, i dont know which would be a better solution.. Ageism has become one of the biggest form of discrimination in the work arena.. due to the aging population.. you have more aged workers than the economy can handle.. this is happening not just in Singapore but elsewhere too..<br><br>Other countries do have a welfare social net to take care of aged citizens but not here..<br><br>At the end of the day.. I have no solution.. ha..</div>
