                                  financial challenges and possible closure with enrolments dropping and
                                  school fee debts mounting.</em></p>
              <p><em>Financial and liquidation experts say
                                  many private schools are under strain as the economic crisis bites and
                                  parents default on the payment of school fees. They warn that small
                                  independent schools, which flourished under the Howard government, are
                                  especially vulnerable as the economy falters, but that even some of
                                  Melbourne's established schools are finding it tough....</em></p>
              <p><em>Already, one independent school has sought advice from the liquidation and bankruptcy trustee company Warner Kugel.</em></p>
              <p><em>Company
                                  partner Steven Kugel said the school had contacted his firm early this
                                  year "because their board was talking insolvency" and the school was
                                  concerned it might not be financially viable to open this year. Mr
                                  Kugel said that while the school had not yet acted on liquidation, the
                                  impact of rising unemployment could see more private schools facing
                                  insolvency.....</em></p>
              <p><em>Insurance company Swann Insurance will this week begin offering school
                                  fee protection insurance to parents, designed to cover the cost of fees
                                  should parents be unable to meet their commitments.........</em></p>
              <p><em>However, Andrew Blair, president of the Australian Secondary
                                  Principals Association, said student transferrals from private schools
                                  to state schools had increased markedly this year and he expected some
                                  independent schools would be forced to close within the next 12 months.</em></p>
              <p><em>"I would be surprised if some of the lower-fee independent schools didn't close," Mr Blair said.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Many
                                  of these places were established on the margin with significant

                                  choice for the Australian community and offer a niche fee structure.</em></p>
              <p><em>"But

                                  credit crisis and some of these schools will fall over."''</em></p>
