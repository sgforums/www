              Here is some info on driving in Australia for overseas drivers: http://www.dpi.wa.gov.au/licensing/yourlicence/1365.asp
              
              Regarding accomodation, you can consider sharing with other postgrad or professionals. You can check out the following for accomodation choices:
              http://perth.gumtree.com.au/
              http://www.realestate.com.au/
              
              Also, I see some people posting here for house shares. Check it out: http://www.studyconnect.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=fb82b567f36efd4065828a01b7788a46&amp;f=34
              
              Australia uses the same voltage. Just make sure to buy some international plugs. Here is what the Australian socket looks like: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Type_I_.28Australian.2FNew_Zealand_.26_Chinese.2FArgentinian_2.2F3-pin.29
              
              Regarding travelling, you should venture on your own since you have a car. Just get a good map and drive away!
              
              Can't answer the other questions, so I will leave that for someone else.

              <p>The renting thingy depends on your budget and how comfortable you want to be.  And if you need furniture, the local salvation army outlets should have some decent ones.  Same with the issue of getting a car, if you are in the hostel or a house near the university, you wont want a car sitting in the garage for most days.</p>
              <p>Just make sure that wherever you are staying has the following: Washing machine, Dryer, fridge, bed, table &amp; wardrobe.</p>
              <p>You should also be investing in a water filtration jug and another water filter tank that fits into your fridge.  Perth's water is relatively safe to drink, but on the safe side, filter them or at least boil them in a smaller electric jug to make your tea and coffee.</p>
              <p>Chinese herbs is not necessary since Perth has a decent Singapore/Malaysian chinese population.</p>
              <p>For diving and trekking, I rather you use a guide because australian waters are different and the trekking is not like our Singapore Bukit Timah.</p>

              <p>If you are buying a car, you need to register it to a driver's license. Legally, you can drive on a Spore's license for 3 months, after this period, you need to get a WA license.  To get a WA drivers license, all you need to do is to rock up to any <span>Metropolitan licensing centre to take your theory test. After you pass your test, you get your license as you have a full Spore license. </span></p>
              <p>Check out your Uni sports club for most sports.</p>
              <p>Diving, Ningaloo reef is good for diving. If you like abalone, Esperance is a good spot. Rock Lobster is plentiful in WA. Make sure you know your bag limit.</p>
              <p>As for Treking, I presume that you are thinking of the driving into outback for long expedition. . Go with groups and get a guide. Do not attempt to go into places where the road ends into the desert on your own if you do not know what you are doing. The Desert is hash place and people can get seriously hurt or killed. There will be some form of adventure club in Uni. Check them out.</p>
              <p>Tip: Try not to bring a whole heap of stuff from home. If you can get them in WA buy them here.</p>

              <p>Hey sorry to hijack your thread, but I wanna ask...you are in your mid 30s and you are going to take your MASTERS full time... so you must quitted your job to do this? What made you to take this decision? What are the risks you considered before you took this path?</p>
              <p>I am also in the midst of considering taking my masters in Australia but most likely will consider going to UniMelb for that...I am 31 this year BTW</p>

              <p>Hi all, thanks for all the replies. Really helpful.</p>
              <p>Starry99, thanks for all the websites. Know u are going there too rite? maybe can arrange a meetup?</p>
              <p>Viciouskitty, wow, your nick sounds fierce. ;) are u going perth soon? U have a pack list, meaning u are going there too?</p>
              <p>Whitsundays, thanks for the driving licence info. Troublesome to pass the test? I am considering buying a car, but will give up the idea if it proves too troublesome. May just rent a car whenever I wan to leave Perth. I should be staying near the uni. U thank that is a good idea?</p>
              <p>caleb chiang, thanks for info. I have adaptor but need voltage adapter?</p>
              <p>gasband, for your query, I am not quitting my job la. Took sabbatical. Was really tired and wanted something new to refresh my life, so hit upon taking time off to go somewhere new. So studying a masters in australia seems like a good way out. Sometimes we have to close some doors for other doors to open. Thus, I am trying to open some new doors to my life. Hope this helps.</p>
              <p>cheers to all.</p>

              <p>I've been to Perth, very very quiet place, the place that started Singapore a Apple Strudel craze.  Apparently, lots of students from Singapore studied in Perth and handcarry those strudels back.  (If only we can have krispykreme donuts!)</p>
              <p>There is there couple of streets which is full of bars and at least a 'Singapore's Chin Chin Chicken Rice' outlet.</p>
              <p>Chin Chin was popular for their Tomato Sauce hananise Pork Chops.  The founders son/grandson is settled in Perth now.</p>
              <p>From there, a trip to freementle is easy, either by car or those cruise ship thingy.  There is also plenty of wine if you drive thru the wine areas.</p>

              <p>Hi, school fees depends on course, from abt 19k to 30k sing. living expenses abt 450 to 600 pw should be quite comfortable.</p>

              <p>VK74, sounds like a cool life u have huh.... from your descriptions, sounds like i should pay a visit to the chicken rice store....haha. I am a wine drinker, so i am looking forward to swan valley for the wines there. If u do come over to perth, let me know la....can work out something. If u do meet me up, I might then be the reason u will come over....haha....*smile*</p>
              <p>the uni college is abt 300pw, with food, electricity and stuff thrown in. Maybe I might stay there, seems to be cheap and good. Use the savings to tour WA.</p>

              <p>Its cheaper to do an extra pair of glasses in Singapore.</p>
              <p>And medical wont come cheap, so you best be taking good care of yourself.</p>
              <p>1. Take those vitamin C fizzy tablets, throw into your orange juice in the morning.</p>
              <p>2. Change the dish washing sponge once a month, and remember to clean the lint off your dryer as often as you can.</p>
              <p>3. Avoid the casinos, if they become a regular nightly entertainment, you are sunk.</p>
              <p>4, Buy bread, have cellapane wrapper ready so you can wrap four pieces of bread per cellapane wrap and put into the freezer.  When you want to eat, take out a pack of four slices, microwave &amp; toast the bread.</p>
              <p>5. Eggs, you can always boil six out of the dozen, mash the boiled eggs with mayo, chilli sauce &amp; pepper and tupperware them in the fridge. You busy students wont have that much time to cook, so the eggs mayo, bread could become a staple.</p>
              <p>6. You should be bringing some stationary over, forget the A4 size papers, but do bring along some small siccors to leave in the kitchen and the laundry area.</p>
