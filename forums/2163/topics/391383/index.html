              <p>Hi  I post this in overseas cause i like to draw some feedback from Australian counterpart.</p>
              <p>Is it a common meat?</p>
              <p>I saw in Carrefour they sell frozen Kangaroo Steak.....any idea if it is any good and usually do you eat it medium rare. or well done?  Do you eat it just like any Red Meat? or stew?  or perharps a Shepherd Pie. replace lamb with Kangaroo mince?  </p>
              <p>Do they take baby Kangaroo or adult size?  (<em>I am not sure if I want to know this answer?)</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Kangaroo is becoming more common these days.  I believe the meat comes from the adult kangaroo not the joey.</p>
              <p>The smell of kangaroo meat can be a little bit strong but not too hard to get used to.  You can eat it like steak if you wish to.</p>
              <p>When my mum was here, she had mistaken the kangaroo meat in the freezer as beef and she made a stir fry out of it with brown onion.  It turned out pretty good.</p>
              <p>Kangaroo meat is actually quite healthy as it has very little or no fat.  Give it a try! </p>

              <p>I don't know where you got your information from that it's for pet.  They sell kangaroo steak/fillet/sausage in supermarket for human consumption too.  And infact, it's getting more and more common these days.  Some restaurants even have kangaroo meat on their menu.</p>

              <p>i get me info from woolworth and coles major supermarket in oz.where didja get yers from?</p>
              <p>kangeroo meat is generally regarded as cat and dog food..they come in prepacked with the brand SELECT.its at the meat section counter at any supermarket.</p>
              <p>so many years in oz from trips spanning way back to 1995 to permanent status......i have yet to see someone offering BBQ kangeroo meat at Bunnings or at festive events in any place in oz. its not common in oz culture to consume roo meat but it is common for the russians to consume them in russia after importing them from oz.</p>
              <p>i cant believe u folks are eating kangeroo meat in melbourne even as a health alternative.</p>
              <p>please read my reply properly above that they can be found not only as pet but human food too.</p>

              its not common in oz culture to consume roo meat but it is common
              for the russians to consume them in russia after importing them
              from oz.</p>
              <p>i cant believe u folks are eating kangeroo meat in melbourne
              even as a health alternative.</p>
              <p>please read my reply properly above that they can be found not
              only as pet but human food too.</p>

              <p>actually the franklins downstairs of my apartment sells marinaded kangaroo steak and i've seen it at woolworths too, both for human consumption of course; but that may because i'm in sydney.</p>
              <p>my housemate bought the kangaroo steak from franklins and cooked it and it smelled great; he finished the entire cut (around 400g) with no complaints so i can only assume it's nice.</p>
              <p>i'll probably try it myself soon!</p>

              <p>Cat eats fish in can too so does it mean that something is wrong with us that we eat cat food?  There are a lot of reject from the meat we have like pork/chicken/lamb/beef ended up becoming your pet food too.  Do you eat fish head curry back in Sg?  Apparently they can be rejects too.  Something wrong with Asians eating curry fish head?</p>
              <p>Reason why there are more beef/lamb/chicken than kangaroo meat in the supermarkets is because there are more farms for beef/lamb/chicken to meet the demand of the general public. Apart from kangaroo meat, people also eat crocodile, rabbits, emu, ostrich and camels but the demand is still not as big. In other countries people eat horses, dogs, possums etc. Each has their own preference so learn to respect it!</p>
              <p>For the benefit of those who are not living in Oz, Bunnings is a big hardware store and happen to have sausage sizzlers every weekend.  Considering they only charge $2.50 for each sausage, do you expect to get a gourmet sausage (such as kangaroo) at that price?</p>
