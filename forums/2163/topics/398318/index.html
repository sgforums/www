              <h1 class="heading">How I became a nasty little racist
              <p>My family moved to Balmain when I was a teenager and until recently I’ve mainly lived in the Inner West of Sydney. I tried the Eastern Suburbs for a while but decided it was too cashed up and pretentious for my left-wing sensibilities. So I stayed close to Glebe and Newtown, went on the right marches, studied the right subjects at uni, and voted for the right political party.</p>
              <p>But a couple of years ago my boyfriend and I found ourselves priced out of the inner city rental market - a direct consequence, I told myself, of my lack of materialism and desire to pursue a modest creative life.</p>
              <div id="more">
              <p>We moved to south-western Sydney - to a suburb I had never even visited - where our newly renovated two bedroom apartment with large balcony and lock-up garage sets us back a mere $330 a week.</p>
              <p>I now live in an epicentre of multiculturalism where Anglos are almost non-existent, and so at 41 I find myself a minority for the first time in my life. And I don’t like it. The median strips resemble the streets of Bombay - continually littered with household rubbish. We’ve renamed the corner fruit and vege shop The Rotting Fruit Emporium where the over-ripe produce is certainly cheap but has the molecular structure of cask wine.</p>
              <p>The butchers which specialises in halal meat, particularly goat, is as hygienic as the average outdoor dunny, and the Bongo Mart, the local equivalent of a convenience store, has never stocked anything by Kraft, Arnotts or Cadbury’s.</p>
              <p>Of course, the trouble with being immersed in difference is not that I can’t get organic truffle oil pasta or a babycino but that I’m confronted with the fact that what I thought were my values - reflected in those books with their bleeding heart titles like On Toleration, The Ethos of Pluralisation, and Multicultural Citizenship - seem to be so easily eroded by minor council violations committed by anyone I consider ‘other’.</p>
              <p>Indeed, my self-righteousness received a boost from said council when they recently launched a ‘Quit the Spit’ campaign, designed to deter ‘foreigners’ ignorant of ‘our ways’ from gobbing all over the street. I’ve even begun to yell the slogan at people who violate it.</p>
              <p>I’m stumped as to how the culturally specific conventions by which I live my life have come to be immutable, universal laws of nature in my mind? What’s happened to me? I’ve become the type of person I was always most intolerant of: an intolerant person. It’s positively unAustralian.</p>

              <p class="timestamp">06:20pm | 27/01/10</p>
              <p>Enjoyed the article - not so much some replies.</p>
              <p>Oh my God Australia. The race debate, if you can call it that, is going nowhere!</p>
              <p>Why are some people so freaked out by difference?</p>
              <p>Lived here 4 years and have often been asked if I find Australia more racist than UK (where I’m from). Short answer is no - there are plenty of people of that persuasion in both countries and by no means limited to “anglo” peoples in both countries.</p>
              <p>The major difference I feel is that in UK intolerant people have gotten over the idea of difference and realised they just don’t like people of other races. In aus it seems the meer fact of being different is an affront to those who choose to be intolerant. We don’t do it on purpose you know. Get over it and hate me for a reason - then we can discuss things.</p>
              <p>As for dodgy standards in cleanliness and hygiene in shops etc.that’s an issue of abiding by and enforcement of the law. To put it all down to culture is just lazy and also gets us all off the hook re: doing something about it -  as in ‘those lot are always up to that its their culture - can’t do anything about it or i’ll be called racist.”  Blame appointed and responsibility abdicated in one fell swoop.</p>
              <p>And btw I think I have done my bit in integrating into Australia,  from acquiring a taste for beer and learning david boon’s middle name, to regularly cheering on my aussie rules team at home games. But I will never (and never want to) get used to the word “wog” in general conversation.</p>

              <p>Whats with the quaint term ‘Anglos’ all of a sudden?  Why are we copying the US in everything?  Anglo what?  Saxon?  What next…? Visigoths?  Jutes? Romans?  Carthaginians?  Stupid stereotyping.  Get out of Sydney if you don’t want all that shite.  Just don’t complain.  Sydney is a sh*t-magnet for ghetto lovers.  Other cities in Australia are nothing like what you describe and I hope never get like it either.  What basket case NSW is with so many shockingly weak govts, and people like you that choose to live there simply to say you live in Sydney!</p>

              <p>Ahh the irony.</p>
              <p>Immigration will do the same thing for Modern Australia as the “First fleet” did for the Aboriginal people of this Country.</p>
              <p>While the Australian’s of Anglo extraction are telling the Aboriginal people to get over it - with the next breath they are blaming the new comers for ruining everything and non respecting “our” ways. I love it.</p>
              <p>White man came, chopped down the trees and scared the beautiful mother earth. Why man told the locals to get over it. compare that to what is happening now…</p>

              <p>Residents of Mosman and Woollahra have joined those in the Sutherland Shire as among the Sydney people least tolerant of cultural diversity and multicultural values, a map of the city's racial attitudes reveals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Two weeks after the Cronulla race riots, tens of thousands of people returned to Sydney's beaches for Christmas Day, while church leaders called on Australians to be tolerant and to take responsibility for the violence in the beach suburbs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now researchers have produced a map - based on a survey of 1800 Sydney residents - that they hope can be used in programs to counter racism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The survey is part of work by Associate Professor Jim Forrest, of Macquarie University; Kevin Dunn, of the University of NSW; and others, from which Professor Forrest has produced the map.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Professor Forrest said the least accepting groups were in outer suburbs where populations are mostly solidly Anglo. But the least tolerant also include culturally diverse places such as Liverpool and "old" wealth areas such as Mosman and Woollahra. Waverley, which adjoins Woollahra but is more culturally diverse, is among the most tolerant.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Among the most tolerant are people living in the local government areas Sydney, South Sydney, Leichhardt, Auburn and Pittwater.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Professor Forrest said wealthy, better-educated areas of northern Sydney were quite tolerant and inner-city areas highly tolerant.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Less tolerant areas include outer locations such as Gosford and Campbelltown, but also culturally mixed areas such as Bankstown and Ryde. Bankstown has a substantial Muslim population, while Ryde has many Chinese and Koreans. Culturally diverse areas such as Parramatta, Marrickville and Penrith, and the suburbs Hurstville, Randwick and Botany, are tolerant.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At St Mary's Cathedral yesterday, Sydney's Catholic Archbishop, George Pell, confronted the race riots. At a Christmas Mass where there was standing room only, he noted the high number of visitors to the cathedral in the lead-up to Christmas. "I wonder if it was a reaction to the Cronulla riots … a rejection of cowardly violence."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The head of the Australian Anglican Church, Phillip Aspinall, suggested a resurgence in church attendance might be attributed to the "uncertain times", noting the race riots and last year's tsunami. He called on "every Australian" to take responsibility for the violence in the riots. He challenged the "very way Australians define themselves" and encouraged them to get on with people "we don't know, love or like".</span></p>
              <div id="contentSwap2" class="pageprint" style="display: none;"><a name="contentSwap2"></a>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the survey on racial attitudes, residents were asked to respond to two statements: 1) It is a good thing for society to be made up of different cultures. 2) Australia is weakened by different ethnicities sticking to their old ways.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Responses to other statements by 5056 people in Queensland and NSW immediately after the September 11 attacks showed 12 per cent held beliefs akin to racial supremacy. More than 13 per cent believed "races" should be kept sexually separate. About the same ratio admitted being racially prejudiced.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dr Dunn told a conference this month: "There is a strong and ever-urgent need for the realities of racism to be acknowledged. Without doing so, it is impossible to develop anti-racism."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But Professor Forrest said Australia was generally less racist than most societies. Similar studies in Britain had revealed one in five to be openly racist. He believed the US figure was about one in three.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At a Christmas Mass in Richmond, in Melbourne, Father Peter Norden reflected on Sydney's race riots, saying a glance at the crib would reveal "some Middle Eastern looking gents, carrying some suspicious looking parcels … They certainly wouldn't have been allowed on Cronulla Beach in the last two weeks."</span></p>

              <h3>Bina D’Costa</h3>
              <p>Nitin Garg had arrived in Australia from Jagraon, in the northern Indian state of Punjab, expecting a promising future. Three years later, as a permanent resident and with a postgraduate degree in Commerce he left for India in a body bag. By the time the next ‘breaking news’ occurs, his violent death will be forgotten. But for his mother, his 98 year old grandfather and his siblings, Nitin’s violent stabbing at West Footscray in Melbourne will be forever remembered with the tears of losing a loved one and the guilt for making the decision to send him to the West, which is assumed to be safer than India. Nitin and perhaps his whole family’s future relied on his endurance, even if dreadfully lonely, in an alien metropolis. The south-eastern state of Victoria, one of the most multicultural locations in the world, is where 21 year old Nitin died alone on 2 January 2010. Violent deaths and assaults like his stabbing, racially motivated or not, have consequences, not only in political terms but for personal lives.</p>
              <p>Nitin’s death occurred during a month in which three other Indian taxi drivers were assaulted in Melbourne and Ballarat. From May last year, reports of violent attacks on Indian students in Melbourne and then in Sydney appeared in newspapers the world over. The violence was particularly widely reported in India, inciting extremist anti-Australia responses that included the burning of effigies of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in New Delhi. Reacting to the aggression, Indian students organised peaceful protests in Melbourne and Sydney which themselves turned violent and ended with police intervention. Subsequently, there have been further protests in Melbourne and Sydney with Indian students coming out to raise awareness about safety issues, the rising crime rate and the unfair justice system in Australia.</p>
              <p>A lot has been written so far on the subject, and rightly so. Understandably, the coverage has been extensive in the Indian media, which has framed the issue as one of deeply entrenched racism within the Australian society. Further, at a time when Australia and India’s strategic partnership is growing, the attacks have made the Australian Government extremely uncomfortable. India’s Foreign Minister, S. M. Krishna, has recently warned that if attacks on students continue, the Government may advise students not to travel to Australia. All the same, for Australia, this crisis in the education sector is not only about its ties with India and its own global image as a major education provider nation but its own uneasiness with the ‘R’ word.</p>
              <p>Australia’s relationship with international students goes back over five decades to 1950, following the establishment of the Colombo Plan for Cooperative Economic Development in South and Southeast Asia in that year, an organisation fostering cooperation among the countries of South Asia and the Pacific. Today, education is a full-blown industry, and has moved ahead of tourism, Australia’s other main services export, in recent years. Indeed, the education industry in Australia is the third largest export earner behind coal and iron ore.</p>
              <p>Students from various parts of Asia provide the bulk of the Australian education system’s financial backbone. There are now almost 100,000 students from India alone, contributing almost USD 2 billion to the economy. While the Indian market is still smaller than that of China, numbers have grown by 55 per cent, compared with a growth of 19 per cent from China. Students from the subcontinent accounted for 19 per cent of total international enrolments in 2009.</p>
              <p><strong>Imagined racism or an Inconvenient Truth?</strong></p>
              <p>Much as racial background and English speaking skills are crucial issues in the education industry, there are class issues within the South Asian community at large in Australia. Shortly after the student protests, taxi drivers of South Asian origin demonstrated in Melbourne for their security. Many of them felt unsafe driving taxis at night with increased incidences of attacks. While those demonstrations were widely reported in Australian media, the global media – including the Indian media – did not pay much serious attention to the predicament of taxi drivers. All the while, there was great focus on the plight of the students. This neatly ties into conventional notions of class struggles, as most Indian students are from relatively well-off families. While some South Asian taxi drivers are also students, recent attacks portrayed as only targeting the Indian student community created a different kind of anxiety about Australia. Both the press and the middle class in India were able to mobilise critical public opinion to pressure the Australian Government to respond to this.</p>
              <p>Australian Indians also find these new debates about race relations uncomfortable.  Over the years, many Indians who settled here have gone to extraordinary lengths to blend in and adopt an Australian colloquial style of speech if not a perfect ‘Aussie’ accent. Many of the second generation migrants are more comfortable in their Australian identity rather than their Indian skin colour. There is a deep divide between migrant South Asians/Indians and the student community. Many migrants now feel that their peace and comfort zone have been destroyed by the students and their protests. Inadequate support has been offered to the students from Indian social bodies in Australia. The President of the Federation of Indian Associations of Victoria, Vasan Srinivasan said, ‘Each and every time anything happens in the state of Victoria, they (Indian student leaders) immediately come up and say it’s a racist attack on Indian students’.</p>
              <p>Indian media advocacy has played a critical role in terming recent events a crisis in race relations. Although dubbed hysterical behaviour by the Australian media and political leaders, the Indian media has a point, which I return to later. However, it is also a concern that as a nation with a long colonial history, the Indian media plays the race card in sensationalist reports. The cartoon depicting the Victorian Police as KKK members in the Mail Today is an example of this.</p>
              <p>This recent debate re-produces an ‘imagined’ and ‘racist’ nation that has sportsmen (especially cricketers) who do not hesitate to deploy racist slurs against the opponents. Racism is not only a Western (read White/Caucasian) phenomenon. South Asians have played their own part in constructing racist beliefs and practices. After all, the Andrew Symonds and Harbhajan Singh episode only occurred in recent history.  Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh had been banned for three Tests after the International Cricket Council ruled that he racially abused Australia’s Andrew Symonds during the Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground in early 2008. While the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the financial superpower of the game, was able to turn the decision to Singh’s favour after he called Symonds a monkey, this incident highlights ‘reverse’ racism of Indians/South Asians against Australians.</p>
              <p>Beyond the race issue, the Indian media’s cringe when portrayed in the international sphere as a poverty-stricken nation (for example, Arvind Adiga’s <em>The White Tiger</em> or last year’s film <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> were criticised for depicting India negatively) but not as the global power as Nehru projected articulates a paradox in Indian identity.  Poverty, caste issues, gender violence, and the exclusion of minorities are only a few concerns that may be discussed only in the domestic and private space but not the international and public space. Political leaders and a significant section of the Indian media and entertainment industry manifest in their work a highly nationalistic, great power image of India.</p>
              <p>Australia on the other hand, has a long and uncomfortable history of racial politics in a colonial and neo-colonial asymmetrical pattern with its own indigenous population. During the Liberal Government’s rule under John Howard, Australia’s position vis-à-vis the refugees (e.g. the ‘Tampa crisis’ and the ‘boat people’ crises) highlighted Australia’s deeply entrenched racial anxieties. These anxieties about the ‘other’ intensified with the ‘global war on terror’, and resulted in incidents such as the Mohammed Haneef episode. Under the Labor regime of Kevin Rudd, Australia is in negotiation with Indonesia to build a detention centre which will process asylum applications of the new ‘boat people’, Tamils from Sri Lanka.</p>
              <p>The assaults on Indian/South Asian students bring forth this racial tension. As such, the sporadic nature of at least some of the attacks was ignored and a pattern of hate crimes or racist attacks on Indian students in Australia was drawn. In turn, this was directly linked to the ultimate pressure point – money. The students contribute to the Australian economy not only by working in the country but also bringing financial resources from home.</p>
              <p>It is clear that in different times different racial/ethnic groups are targeted. After September 11, people from the Arab world reported abuse and assaults. In recent years, there have been reports of the murder of a number of Chinese and Vietnamese students. These have not been investigated as hate crimes, but rather as violent acts with other, non-racial motives. However, the sheer number of Indians/South Asians being assaulted means race is at least one of the factors that contribute to these events. The incidents themselves were said to have been taking place for months, with 1449 people of South Asian origin reportedly having been assaulted in Victoria, where Melbourne is located, between 2007 and 2008. The Victorian Police stated that this number increased by 5.4 per cent in 2009, to 1525. In the 2006-7 financial year there were 1082 attacks on Indians/South Asians in Victoria alone. These individuals were victims of crimes such as robberies and assault, about 50 per cent of which occured in workplace. The assault rate for Indians in Victoria was about 1700 in every 100,000, against 700 in every 100,000 for non-Indians.</p>
              <p>The important fact to note is that it is not only Indian students who are being targeted, but also other South Asian/brown students, particularly men. There is no clear-cut distinction in statistics about this simple fact. All South Asians are often counted as people of Indian origin. Gender is, in fact, an issue because a significantly higher number of male students are involved in shift work, and are therefore more vulnerable. By portraying the violence as racial attacks only against Indian students, the already marginalised students from other South Asian states have been doubly marginalised and silenced.</p>
              <p>South Asian students in the media have stated how they have encountered racist slurs and aggressive behaviour in public spaces. Gautam Gupta from the Federation of Indian Students, Australia notes that ‘Bloody Indian, go back home’ is a commonly used insult during many of the attacks. Both public debates and private discussions with Indian and other communities in Australia suggest that a majority of them perceive that the racist attacks have a criminal and opportunistic pattern (for example robberies) as well. The Victorian and New South Wales (NSW) Police have downplayed the race factor and stated that the attacks do not highlight a culture of ‘curry-bashing’ but rather are criminal offences against a vulnerable population. The Victorian Police Commissioner expresses this vulnerability in terms of a ‘soft target’, an identification that is problematic as the vulnerability is produced and reinforced because of racial and economic anxieties.</p>
              <p>The race issue is finally being discussed, though in small doses and only by a few. Former Defence Force Chief Peter Cosgrove, who lived in India for a year, told ABC Radio that Australians were ‘disinclined to downplay, much less dismiss, the potential racist elements in what is becoming a litany of criminality’. Indians/South Asians <em>are</em> disproportionately targeted according to a reluctant admission made by Simon Overland, the Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria on 20 January 2010. He stated that Indians are over-represented in robbery statistics and there is a racist element to some attacks.</p>
              <p>The debate about race is threatening to open a Pandora’s box that would highlight the dire situation of international students in general, many of whom are treated disrespectfully in their own environments (including their educational institutions in some cases) and in other communities. Melbourne University Professor of Higher Education Simon Marginson stated, ‘Racist targeting is involved. Indian students do have a special problem. And there isn’t enough official and civil concern about international student security in Australia.’ He also called for a cross-border agency to oversee the security of international students. The outgoing Aboriginal Social Justice Commissioner Tom Calma also stated that some government policies are directly racist.</p>
              <p>The insecurity of living as a foreign student with a temporary visa, always subject to the suspicion of work permit violation by the authorities, is part of a hard everyday truth for many students of South Asian origin. Monash University demographer Bob Birell suggests that sheer numbers have pushed Indian students out of inner-city haunts into the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. However, on some occasions, South Asian/Indian students are not preferred tenants. It is, of course, true that many live farther away from the city centres to take advantage of cheaper rents.  Indian, Nepali, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan students also stated to this author that it was difficult to find housing close to their educational institution or work places in big cities. Whatever the push, South Asian students are forced to live in unsafe neighbourhoods. Some of these neighbourhoods have rampant criminal gang activities. Many work late night and/or early morning shifts, and spend a substantial amount of time using public transport, making them vulnerable to attacks in empty train stations or streets.</p>
              <p>The Australian Police has limited information about the assailants which suggests that they are overwhelmingly teenagers, not exclusively Caucasians, and also include non-European juveniles. There are two critical issues underlined here. First, Indian students in Sydney alleged last June that some Lebanese youths were behind racially motivated attacks. The Australian authorities are also struggling to integrate new waves of immigrants. The NSW Police refused to admit that race was a factor here.  Police Superintendent of the Parramatta Local Command, Robert Redfern, stated, ‘The victims of crime that do occur in this area are not exclusively Indian, the perpetrators of those crimes are not exclusively Middle Eastern’. However, the reasons behind these particular attacks could be more complex.  Some areas in NSW, where Sydney is located, were traditionally dominated by West Asians but are now South Asian hubs. This has altered the demographics of these suburbs, making curry houses and falafel eateries neighbours in these multi-ethnic locations. While West Asia and South Asia have strong cultural, historical, social and political connections, as migrants from these regions in a foreign land, the battle is constructed and manifested as ‘Lebanese’ against ‘Indians’, and vice versa. During a time of economic hardship and unemployment, especially for young people who are mostly contract/shift workers, race may not be the primary motivation but frustration is targeted in a racial manner at people perceived as the unwanted ‘other’. This issue must be addressed frankly in various multi-cultural forums in Australia.</p>
              <p>Second, the Cronulla riots generated international headlines in 2005. On 4 December of that year, a group of volunteer surf life savers were assaulted in a week that had seen several other violent assaults. On 11 December, approximately 5,000 people converged at the Cronulla beach to protest these events. The alcohol-fuelled white mob hunted and attacked anyone who looked Middle Eastern, which triggered retaliatory riots by young men of Middle Eastern descent. The riots and the racist rants at ‘Lebs’ (there have of course been other racist tags in the recent past, such as Paki, Chong, Wog) have been considered as built-up resentment against Arabs; undercurrents of Islamophobia fuelled by radio shock-jocks; and the result of alcohol consumption. However, reports also reveal that an abiding sense of threat in white suburbia of being outnumbered by Muslims had been a motive in the riots.</p>
              <p>Race concerns at different times, be it against Muslims or Indians/South Asians demonstrate that Australia must deal with the hard and inconvenient truth that the race card is played for a variety of reasons. Rather that pushing it under the rug, the authority should give it the highest priority. It should be a greater concern that if race is not a crucial factor, how is that so many South Asians/Indians are being targeted?</p>
              <p>How do these events shape Australia’s future education policies? I would suggest that beyond the race factor, flawed immigration policies linked to the education sector have contributed to the vulnerability and therefore the increased violence against South Asian/Indian students.</p>
              <p><strong>Billions at stake</strong></p>
              <p>The attacks on international students have grave implications for Australia. The government is finally looking into the matter of international student safety and security. According to Australian Government statistics there were over 450,000 international student enrolments in Australia in 2007, 18 per cent above 2006. The financial concern following these events is a cause for concern for both public and private sectors involved in education and immigration. International students bring billions of dollars into Australian educational institutions. For example, in MBA courses international students each pay up to USD 40,000 a year. Undergraduate students pay USD 30,000 a year which brings it to a minimum of USD 120,000-150,000 including various other expenditures. But given the current circumstances, many international students may not want to consider Australia as their destination because of concerns for personal safety.</p>
              <p>International students contributed about USD 13.7 billion to the Australian economy in 2007-8, with the figure estimated to have risen to USD 15.5 billion in 2009. In July 2008, there were a total of 459,692 international students enrolled in Australian education institutions, which is a 20 per cent increase in enrolments from previous years. A total of 455,000 students were studying in Australia on student visas in 2007, an increase from 380,000 in 2006. Of these students, 177,954 were in higher education in undergraduate and graduate schools. A report by IDP Education states that vocational education and training (VET) is the fastest growing sector at 46.5 per cent of the total, with India, China and Korea the largest VET markets. In other areas, university enrolments also increased by 2.7 per cent and English language courses were up to 28 per cent from 2007. In 1994, Indian students represented just 1.5 per cent of the 102,000 international onshore students. From 2004-2009, the number of Indian/South Asian students rose to 109,356, just over 19 per cent of a total over half a million international students from 200 different countries. The number of South Asian male students studying in Victoria has grown by 41 per cent every year since 2004.</p>
              <p>In this globalised world, people who are able to move, and who can afford to move, are on the move. Skilled migrants prefer various Western destinations, including Australia, to build their future. It is critical to understand that migration, as a search for a better future in the West, is the primary motivation for most South Asian students to enrol in Australian education programs. Australia’s top five source countries for international students are (in order), China, India, South Korea, Malaysia and Hong Kong. The impact of having these students in Australia for its global soft power is enormous. Many of these students, as future residents, contribute to the Australian economy.  Many go back and contribute to the growth in their own country or somewhere else in the world, thereby carrying a memory of Australian life with them. Many in the Australian global alumni are in powerful positions and have the ability to shape future relations between their own institutions and Australian institutions.</p>
              <p>After the Howard Government changed its immigration policy in 2001, to allow overseas students who completed their degrees in Australia to stay on as skilled migrants, various education institutions and agents took advantage. This controversial policy originally was linked to responding to domestic skills shortages but is now perceived to be damaging the Australian education brand. About 20,000 former overseas students now achieve permanent residency every year. Most of them are university graduates, some 8000 were accountants in 2008. However, permanent residency visas issued to cooks significantly increased from 951 in 2005-06 to 3251 in 2008. The Australian education industry has also knowingly manipulated the desire to migrate. Education promoters from various colleges and universities often have to be prepared to respond to questions about finding work to support education and finances in Australia and about migration.</p>
              <p>In particular, dodgy education institutions and migration agencies, both from the home countries and in Australia, rip off international students in numerous ways, generating hugely profitable businesses for both legal and illegal migration industries. Many private agencies wrongfully guarantee permanent residency in Australia and link it to their services, which is a breach of Australia’s immigration regulations. Students complained that they were shown photographs of Flinders St Station and the Town Hall in Melbourne and were led to believe that those were their educational institutions. A small number of fraudulent students also take advantage of these businesses and pay a substantial amount of money for fake qualifications to obtain permanent residency in Australia. Both the Australian and Indian Governments are cracking down on phony training colleges and education agencies as visa factories. More than 500 Indian nationals were refused student visas between July to September 2009 because of fake financial documents, said the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.  Currently, a review of higher education institutions especially of dubious colleges and TAFE (Technical and Further Education) are underway. The Australian immigration department is investigating 23 Victorian and 5 New South Wales education institutions for breaches of immigration regulations.</p>
              <p>While the issuance of student visas following the recent events has become more stringent, the Indian media also reports that Indians have been discouraged from sending their children to study in Australia. The number of Indians applying for student visas to Australia has plummeted by 46 per cent, according to the most recent figures from the Department of Immigration. Australia’s Tourism Forecasting Committee (TFC) suggests that 4,000 fewer Indian students are expected in 2010. The TFC states, ‘the resultant loss in economic value to Australia could be as high as A$78 million (apx USD $70million) if these enrolments are not filled by other international students’.</p>
              <p>The Minister for Overseas Indian Affairs, Vayalar Ravi, said Australia must crack down on unscrupulous college operators and employers who pay students less than the minimum wage.  He rightly stated, ‘If the Government can be so strict in arresting the students who work more than 20 hours because they are violating the law, why can’t they arrest the employer who is not paying the minimum wage?’</p>
              <p>There are other concerns too. Some security threats against Australian agencies in India have been reported. After a series of events in January beginning with Nitin’s death, the arson attack on the Guruduara and the violent assaults on cab drivers, diplomatic relations between India and Australia soured. To make matters worse, Bal Thackeray, leader of the Shiv Sena, stated that their activists would target Australians in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The party newspaper Saamna quoted him stating that the Shiv Sena will ‘not allow Australian cricketers to step on Mumbai’s soil’.  Also, the <em>Times of India</em> stated that some interest groups are encouraging Bollywood to take its recently booming businesses in Australia elsewhere. These antagonistic statements are of concern to Australian authorities.</p>
              <p>Although Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Julia Gillard has downplayed the race angle, she has also stated that education providers would be shut down if they did not comply with rules relating to international students. Parliament is considering an Amendment Bill to the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000, under which the provider would need to demonstrate that its principal purpose is providing education and that it is capable of demonstrating a satisfactory standard. Gillard also visited India last year to control the public relations damage and assured the Indian Government that Australia will take the necessary steps to assist Indian students. She promised annual ministerial dialogues on education with India.</p>
              <p>It is apparent that there are futures at stake here. International students, especially from the South Asian region make Australia either their temporary or permanent homes. While the recent troubles are being portrayed as an issue of racial tension in the Indian media, some students may be being discouraged or prohibited from coming to Australia at the moment, as the above statistics suggest. This crisis will pass in time, but the distrust and racial anxieties that have been produced will leave lingering effects and hinder positive social networking outcomes.</p>
              <p>While the public debates are not going to help Nitin any longer, it is crucial that Australia takes a hard look at its hidden race relations issues and the education sector so that not another life is lost. On the other hand, Indian civil society, especially the media in its advocacy, must act conscientiously to ensure that thousands of other Indians who have made Australia their home do not become entangled in a messy ‘us vs them’ debate, as a consequence of recent questions of racial relations.</p>

              <div class="postContent">
              <p>As I flip through channels, words like violence break the silence, they come crashing in, in to my little world via an Australian reporter being phone-interviewed on FOX news: <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/racist-furore-as-mobs-riot/2005/12/11/1134235948497.html"><img src="http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/sydney_riots_wideweb__470x313,0-thumb.jpg" alt="sydney_riots_wideweb__470x313,0.jpg" width="352" height="234" align="right"></a></p>
              <blockquote>What we’ve seen here is that these locals are attacking anyone with a different color skin.</blockquote>
              <p><em>Shudder</em></p>
              <p>Since FOX news helpfully changed the subject right after that incendiary quote, I am left to frantically type “Australia” and “race” in my Google toolbar. I’m dismayed by what I find; tensions between “local” Australians and those who are of Lebanese descent have exploded. Apparently a few of the Lebanese-Australians attacked innocent lifeguards on the beach and “locals” retaliated, much to the delight of <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/12/12/1134235970427.html"><span style="color: #6b1e43;">Aussie Neo-Nazi</span></a> retards.</p>
              <p>Hordes of vigilantes who had marinated in sun and alcohol sought vengeance against the “Lebs” for this and other, <a href="http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/002663.html#comment38007"><span style="color: #6b1e43;">more disturbing offences</span></a>. No good can come of this revenge race. I cringe at the way “Middle Eastern appearance” is being tossed around, because I am just waiting for some brown person to get caught up in this tragic mix, since we look more “Middle Eastern” than, well, Middle Eastern people do.</p>
              <p>Another thought strikes me— sure enough, you tipsters are on it. Mutineer Ananthan points me towards the following, massively disturbing words in the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/thugs-ruled-the-streets-and-the-mob-sang-waltzing-matilda/2005/12/11/1134235951620.html"><span style="color: #6b1e43;">Sydney Morning Herald</span></a>:</p>
              <blockquote>A BARE-CHESTED youth in Quiksilver boardshorts tore the headscarf off the girl’s head as she slithered down the Cronulla dune seeking safety on the beach from a thousand-strong baying mob.</blockquote><blockquote>Up on the road, Marcus “Carcass” Butcher, 28, a builder from Penrith, wearing workboots, war-camouflage shorts and black singlet bearing the words “Mahommid was a camel f—-ing faggot” raised both arms to the sky. “F—- off, Leb,” he cried victoriously.</blockquote>
              <p>Indeed, victory is yours, you idiot.</p>
              <div id="a002663more">
              <div id="more">
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronulla,_New_South_Wales"><span style="color: #6b1e43;">Cronulla</span></a> is a suburb which is south of Sydney (and incidentally, the birthplace of Elle Macpherson):</p>
              <blockquote>A crowd of at least 5000 - overwhelmingly under 25 - took over Cronulla’s foreshore and beachside streets. Police were powerless as 200-odd ringleaders, many clutching bottles or cans of beer and smoking marijuana, led assaults on individuals and small groups of Lebanese Australians who risked an appearance during the six-hour protest…</blockquote><blockquote>After a local man, “Steely”, had led a chant of “F—- off, Lebs”, a young man demanded the megaphone and told the crowd it was “racist”. A bottle arced in from the audience and shattered on his forehead. He fled “like a bleeding rabbit”, someone yelled after him.</blockquote>
              <p>Here, have some perspective with regards to how significant this is:</p>
              <blockquote>Cronulla was possibly Australia’s biggest racist protest since vigilante miners killed two Chinese at Lambing Flat in 1860.</blockquote>
              <p>An eye for an eye and the whole world can’t see a damned thing:</p>
              <blockquote>Yesterday’s violence had been brewing for months. It came to a head last weekend when some Lebanese Australian men attacked members of the North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club after they asked the visitors to stop playing soccer because it was disturbing other beach users.</blockquote>
              <p>Because ignorance is as noble as serving your country in the military:</p>
              <blockquote>“Steely” - who did not want to identify himself “for fear the Lebs will come and shoot up my joint during the week” - said his children had been scared by Lebanese Australians coming in from the western suburbs.</blockquote><blockquote>“I’ve got a four-year-old girl and a boy who’s 11, and they see these bastards come here and stand around the sea baths ‘cos their women have got to swim in clothes and stuff, or they see them saying filthy things to our girls,” he said. “That’s not Australian. My granddad fought the Japs to see Australia safe from this sort of shit, and that’s what I’m doing today.”</blockquote></div>

              <div class="articleIntro">
              <p>There are clearly racial biases in our big brown land. Researchers at the Australian National University have sent out 4,000 identical resumes to employers, and the only change they made to each resume was the applicant's name. To get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name, the Chinese had to submit 68% more applications, the Middle Easterners 64% more, and the Aborigines 35% more.</p>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="col1">
              <div class="articleBody">
              <p>I wasn't surprised with these results because I hear it all the time from employers. Just yesterday I had one vow to never ever hire people from the Never Never because of an inconvenient incident with one last month. I had another refer to Asians as the smartest workers and Indians as the hardest, which indirectly implies that other races are losing the race. Are these managers racist? Or are they just responding to a trend?</p>
              <p>When I finished high school, I desperately wanted to work in advertising - not because I liked it, but because that was Amanda Woodward's job on Melrose Place. I went for many job interviews without success until my cousin advised, ''You'll never get a job in advertising because you sound like a wog.'' I'm not sure if she was right, but I immediately made a concerted effort to sound Australian (and still do) - just in case.</p>
              <p>In the UK, a Muslim cocktail waitress was barely working a week when she had to bare some skin. Using her religion as a defense, she won $6,000 in compensation last month because the new figure-hugging uniform made her feel 'like a prostitute'. At first you might consider her concerns valid, but why would a devout Muslim choose a job serving alcohol and pose on Facebook revelling in a revealing low-cut shirt? Who's at fault?</p>
              <p>In the US, the Supreme Court has just ruled in favour of white fire-fighters who were denied promotions due to their race. The City of New Haven, upon setting an exam to determine employee promotions, saw that no African-Americans passed the test, so they scrapped it fearing they'd be sued by black minorities. This ruling is huge because now people might not be able to sue for discrimination if they can't prove it was intentional.</p>
              <p>Back in Oz, the Serbian owner of my local cafe only ever hires Serbian sandwich-hands. I presume she's more comfortable with employees from her home country, but I wonder if it's really fair. Regardless, even though I'm sure they say in Serbian, ''Here's that grinning idiot'' every time I walk in, I must confess that I adore their mono-ethnic charm.</p>
              <p>Are there occasions where it's okay to be ''racially selective''? The answer is no. It would be wrong for a manager's prejudices to get in the way of recruiting a brilliant employee, and it would be sad for a hard worker to miss out on a promotion just because of his skin colour.</p>
              <p>But then maybe it would be unusual going to a Mexican restaurant where all the waiters were Korean or to an African concert where the musicians were Czechoslovakian. It's a fine line, or rather, an undefined line that needs underlining.</p>
              <p>Despite strict workplace laws, the ANU study shows how often these are broken, perhaps unconsciously. I'm curious to know if you've ever discriminated against an employee - and why. Are you a racist manager - or just racially selective? Is there a difference?</p>

              <p>i used to walk around feeling like everywhere is ok...like in singapore.but lately i do notice these white folks in australia seem to be acting like wannabe nazis with a flawed criminal bloodline DNA.</p>
              <p>their police in melbourne seem to be beating up almost everyone who is an immigrant.i dun mean one isolated policeman but rather groups.one african immigrant lost an eye...another lost 2 front teeth and they werent even doing anything wrong.they were compensated by the gov in the end.</p>
              <p>the people are superficial,they smile cuz they are forced to.just like a paid hooker!</p>
              <p>i dont think australia is ready for any industries or even different races.</p>
              <p>i didnt feel like that in new zealand or with people from the usa.</p>
              <p>chinatown.....???looks like i have to end up there the way white power runs in australia...looks like apetheid has its way here now.</p>
              <p>i met the other day some guy  from monash university who has a masters degree in engineering in oz and he ended up as a lab technician after he couldnt get a tech job in oz.his previous job was a job recruiter thing which he stayed in for 2 years.he is an ethnic chinese.</p>
              <p>i have come across way back n 1990s as well.....some girl who look like a beautiful accountant ended up becoming a toilet cleaner in brisbane.did she liked it???her face looked like she was almost going to cry.she looked chinese and rich looking.</p>
              <p>why did these chinese end up with such uneventful lives as we seee them as???could it be that theres too little industries in oz???what does it look like to u??</p>
              <p>i dun want to sound racist.....but i bet its like that in south africa back in 1970s.i guess i have TO WHACK THEM TOO.I ONLY HOPE I DONT NEED TO KILL THEM IN THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING THEM.</p>
