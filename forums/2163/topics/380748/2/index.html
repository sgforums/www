              <p><br>i don't think that's true. you can be in the real estate/financial businesses without behaving like money-sucking @sses with zero work ethics. i'm in the financial industry myself and i know that you can perhaps achieve short term success if you only kow-tow to the rich/famous and ignore the average income general masses...but one simply cannot survive for long in such industries if one lacks work ethics or depend only on the businesses of that 1 or 2 HNW indiv. </p>
              <p>you need referrals in such businesses...and you only get referrals if you do the right things. clients aren't idiots...you can cheat them only once the most....  </p>
              <p>so far, i'm quite disappointed with the level of service from the financial and real estate fellas over here in the states. perhaps they still think of us asians as poor fellas from some third world countries??! </p>

              <p><strong>Asians</strong> are the ones getting their asses kicked by foreclosures..click this <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/SME+Spotlight/Latest+Stories/Story/STIStory_432943.html">link</a> ...</p>
              <p>ASIANS in the United States, many of them living in
                  foreclosure-ravaged California, suffered the sharpest drop in home
                  ownership last year, eclipsing declines felt by whites, blacks and
                  Hispanics, according to new census data.</p>
              <p>The decline is surprising, because Asian-Americans tend to earn more than other minority groups and have less debt.</p>
              <p>But one out of three Asian-American home owners lives in
                  California, which has seen foreclosure rates skyrocket and home values
                  plummet since the housing bubble burst. And that appears to have
                  disproportionately exposed them to the effects of the housing collapse,
                  experts suggested.</p>
              <p>US home ownership rate fell to 66.6 per cent last year, the lowest
                  in six years, after hitting a peak of 67.3 per cent in 2006, according
                  to figures from the American Community Survey, released by the US
                  Census Bureau.</p>
              <p>Home ownership for Asians fell 1.24 percentage points last year to 59.4 per cent.</p>
              <p>The revelation surprised some experts such as Professor Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University.</p>
              <p>'Based on their income and relatively low debt, one would expect
                  that they would have a smaller decline in home ownership,' Prof Wolff
                  said.</p>
              <p>The median annual household income for Asian Americans was just
                  over US$70,000 (S$98,000) last year, higher than any other racial
                  group.</p>
              <p>'It's possible that it's a regional effect,' Prof Wolff suggested.</p>
              <p>'There's a high concentration of Asian-Americans in California, and
                  California got particularly hard hit by property (price) declines and
                  high foreclosure rates.'</p>
              <p>The drop in home ownership is a reversal after the housing boom
                  years, when minorities in the US took advantage of easy access to
                  financing and became home owners. -- AP</p>

              <p>I concur but wasn't it the banks who cleared these people for homeownership? Truthfully, both parties are equally to blame. And now, here we are, in a buying frenzy again.</p>

              <p>Irresponsible borrowers are just a small part of the domino effect.</p>
              <p>Not all foreclosures or distressed sale are owned by people who over stretched their financial abilities when they took up a mortgage.</p>
              <p>Many of them on the foreclosure/distressed market now are victims of the financial meltdowns. The AFTERMATHs.</p>
              <p>When they got their mortgage, the payments was within their financial abilities. But many lost their jobs, or their business went bust, had to settle for lower pay.. etc etc.</p>
              <p>Average Joes/Janes had no idea crisis of this magnitude was coming. They'd never imagined their home values are gonna plummet to nothing.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, banks arn't the ones packing their belongings and going homeless. It's the average families.</p>
              <p>The corporations are gonna win, no matter what.</p>

              <p>Coming from Singapore, you are much more prudent because you went through ups and down within short time span.</p>
              <p>The last time home prices in the US drops 30% was in 1997. The economy here is much more stable compared to tiny Singapore lah.</p>
              <p>Sure, we suffer and learn, but the people here got not much chance to suffer leh !</p>
