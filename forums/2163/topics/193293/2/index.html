In my case, it's nice to be able to return home after work, take a shower and spend a couple of hours unwinding, then head outdoors for a few hours of fun and frivolity <span style="font-style: italic;">in daylight</span>.<br><br>Currently, sunrise and sunset here in the Twin Cities are 5:30 a.m. and 8:55 p.m. respectively. The sun sets even later (around 9:20 p.m.) in late-June during the summer solstice. Businesses generally also extend their hours of operation during summer (it seems strange to be able to walk into a Borders bookstore at 11:30 p.m.!)</div>

In my case, it's nice to be able to return home after work, take a shower and spend a couple of hours unwinding, then head outdoors for a few hours of fun and frivolity <span style="font-style: italic;">in daylight</span>.<br><br>Currently, sunrise and sunset here in the Twin Cities are 5:30 a.m. and 8:55 p.m. respectively. The sun sets even later (around 9:20 p.m.) in late-June during the summer solstice. Businesses generally also extend their hours of operation during summer (it seems strange to be able to walk into a Borders bookstore at 11:30 p.m.!)</div></blockquote>it sucks when u hit a bar or club at 11 at nite and the damned sun is up. then u come walking out at 4 in the morning tipsy and the sun is STILL up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>and yes i know about late sunsets. it was setting at 11pm in mid june last year.
