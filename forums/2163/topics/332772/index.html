              <p>Perhaps its ironic that what you write is that "people there are quite racist".... THAT is racism. One definition of racism is: "intolerance of another race". Is that not what you are displaying here?</p>
              <p>Racism exists everywhere (even in Singapore).</p>
              <p>It is practiced primarily by those with weak self esteem, poor morale upbringing, or poor intelligence - mostly passed down generation upon generation.</p>
              <p>For the record, I am Australian and even though I have experienced rascism here in Singapore, I still count many asians as my best friends.</p>
              <p>Not all Australians are racists, and racism is never acceptable.</p>

              <p>Hi WoBuPaNi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would suggest you first look at applying for PR. It is not easy to get job without a PR or a visa with work conditions. Most job advertisments will specify that applicants must have work rights before they apply. Not to say it is impossible. There have been people who had employers sponsor their work visa, usually they are already here on some kind of visa, e.g. student visa and had worked for the company during the holidays, or are in certain occupations that are in severe shortage such that employers have to get them into Aus on 457 visas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at the DIAC website for information about applying for skilled migration. What do you do for your job? The application process takes 8-15 months before your PR is approved, so do your planning with that timeframe in mind.</p>

              <p><br>you should pm lionoisy for a reality check. if you can still tick against all that he can throw at you, then you can plan forward.</p>
              <p>when you say you are securing a job there b4 you go over, are you referring to internal company transfer? otherwise, you may be in for a rude shock. not all aussie companies will offer you a job and then apply the work permit for you. it's rare as i know it. in most cases, they will require you to have a valid work permit or PR status there first before they even consider you. it is not the other way round.</p>

              <p>Ok, thanks for the heads up.</p>
              <p>I was looking through the points system of Subclass 885 from the Aus Immgration website. There's this category, <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/885/eligibility-qualification-aust.htm">Australian Qualifications</a>, that i don't quite understand. Base on my understanding, I will need to study a minimum of 3 years in Aus and  graduate with a Second Class honours in order to earn 15 points. Does that mean if I were to graduate within 2.5 years with a Second Class honours, I wouldn't be able to earn the 15 points?</p>
              <p>And also, regarding <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/885/eligibility-english.htm">English Language Ability</a>, is IELTS really required to gain the 25 or 15 points? Is olvl english accepted?</p>
              <p>I understand that their immigration policy is constantly changing and by the time i graduate and apply for PR status, it could be a whole set of different rules.</p>

              <p>Ok, thanks for the heads up.</p>
              <p>I was looking through the points system of Subclass 885 from the Aus Immgration website. There's this category, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/885/eligibility-qualification-aust.htm">Australian Qualifications</a>, that i don't quite understand.

              <p>Spot on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, you have to spend at least 3 years in your study if you want to get 15 points. If you only take 2.5 years, then you only get 5 points.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have to take IELTS. Doesn't matter if you have O level, A level or a degree in English Language.</p>
