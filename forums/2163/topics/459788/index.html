              <p>PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called on Singaporeans living abroad to take part in Our Singapore Conversation, since they too have a stake in the country's future.<br><br>Speaking to Singaporeans living in Auckland yesterday, he stressed the importance of the Government paying more attention to citizens living overseas - by taking into account their concerns and keeping them updated about developments back home.<br><br>"(The national conversation) includes also Singaporeans who are overseas, who keep their links back home and who want to know about the country and its future. In today's world, it's completely possible and reasonable and good that you should also be part of this conversation, and your ideas also should contribute to the process and to the outcome," Mr Lee said.<br><br>"I'm sure there will be other opportunities you will get together. We look forward to your inputs because this is our shared future."<br><br>The 100 Singaporeans at the reception, including 25 students from the University of Auckland, were keen on contributing their ideas. Overseas Singaporeans, they said, will add to the diversity of perspectives.<br><br>Mr Allan Yee, president of the Singapore Club Auckland, which has 400 members, pledged to convert some of the club's regular activities into discussions on Singapore's future. He said the Our Singapore Conversation committee was more than welcome to send representatives to these sessions.<br><br>There was no shortage of views at yesterday's event.<br><br>Co-founders of the Singapore Students' Association (Auckland) Nicholas Chew and Melissa Tee said Singaporeans studying abroad were often at a disadvantage in looking for jobs in Singapore, because of their lack of networks and internship experience.<br><br>They said a government initiative to provide them with more information and links would help.<br><br>Mr Yee said the Singapore education system should encourage more spontaneity and creativity through less one-way-street teaching and more self-initiated projects by students.<br><br>Chairman of life sciences group NZBIO Paul Tan said firms in both countries would benefit if the regulatory authorities linked the approval process for new drugs, so that applications that got the go-ahead in one country were sped up in the other.</p>

              <h1>Singapore PM Lee calls for closer cooperation with New Zealand</h1>

              <h2>Speaking in Auckland, Lee Hsien Loong called for an even closer relationship between Singapore and New Zealand.</h2>
              </div>
              <p>The Singapore Prime Minister pointed out New Zealand was the first country that the island state signed a free trade agreement with.  He told the assembled audience of business leaders in Auckland that it is time to build on the existing relationship to extend the cooperation between two countries.</p>
              <p>"You can use us as a springboard, set up in Singapore, cover Southeast Asia or even beyond," he said.  Lee highlighted Singapore is focused on developing innovation and creative industries in the city state and can partner New Zealand on such ventures.</p>
              <p>"I've watched all three Lord Of the Rings (movies). I look forward to The Hobbit and I hope that maybe Singapore can have a small piece the next time you make... another blockbuster," Lee Hsien Loong said.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee argued that there is a strategic shift in the world economy with the centre of gravity moving eastwards. At this crucial juncture it is important that both New Zealand and Singapore work together to promote international trade through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for an eventual Asia Pacific Free Trade Agreement.</p>
              <p>The Singapore PM also answered questions on immigration as well as the impact of the economic crisis.  Lee said Singapore will continue to invite immigrants to its shore but the pace of immigration needs to be sustainable. If Singapore society can make the necessary arguments, then “the more flexible and the more vibrant” it will become.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister said in an integrated economy it is difficult to be immune from the shocks in the system but that Singapore has the policy tools and the financial reserves to meet any crisis.</p>
              <p>Speaking about the 2008/09 crisis, Lee said: "Partly, we did the right thing, partly we were lucky”.</p>
              <p>“But the conclusion is, next time, better make sure we've got the ammunition and powder dry, ready for a crisis,” he added.</p>
