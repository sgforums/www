              </blockquote>
              <p>Sorry.. if i Sound like agent, then this is a chance to say that  I am not a migration agent. If any one wants to migrate I recommend do it yourself rather than paying agents. </p>
              <p>I don't operate alone,  and we are a group of volunteers. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes in fact there are free lunch.. but i really paiseh to to say that, it's not the intention to sponge on others and actually in fact I just came back from one, some times our members organsie BBQ etc. </p>
              <p>one of our "Core member" is Uncle Phil from Australia, just do a search on the google you can see who is he.  We admire his generous and helping spirit and he has been helping out people for many years, we are a group of volunteers who just want to help and we want to extend this service to a bigger group of people</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>That's good to hear, I might try to go over there to link up. </p>
              <p>As I said we have been helping out Singaporeans for a while now, and the webpage is newish, contents will be added to our website as time permits.</p>
              <p>most of our information and advices are verbal at the moment and is real advices given by real people.. and it takes time to write on the blog.</p>
              <p>Sometimes writing might not help as things get outdated quickly.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are also many Singapore club in Australia that claim that they help, we have attended these gathering before but we don't like.. that's why I would like to take this chance to clarify these..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our club purpose:</span></strong></p>
              <p>This is a club for Singaporeans based in Australia, however we respect your privacy, therefore this club is set-up with such an objective that it is an independent self help group that does not receive any funding or help from any Government organisations and therefore does not feed back membership details and opinion to any Government body.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our club vision:</span></strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Our club vision is to be the Real Singapore Club of Australia!!</p>
              <p>We think that there are too many Singapore Club in Australia, but we aim to be the most successful one!</p>
              <p>We hope to help out newly arrived students or new migrants who left Singapore without a job to settle in Australia.</p>
              <p>A Place we can speak Singlish, hokkien, teochew, malay, etc to anyone who turn up and understands what we are talking..</p>
              <p>We aim to be self funded club.. a real independent club owned by members </p>
              <p>Finally... We hope to have a physical club house or at least a kopitiam which we can call our own... where anyone can turn up any time to talk cock or have a quick meal or beer or a  nice cup of kopi-o.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks all for your comments, and Thanks for the chance to allow us to clarify,  I will be around to answer any questions..</p>

              <p>Not that I don't trust you, but if you are a member who has said "things" here before, it is prudent NOT to give personal details linking yourself to the "things" you have said.</p>
              <p>Nowadays there are not only governments interested in this data, but also vigilantes with a political agenda. Eg those who are very free and set up sites to make political accusations.</p>

              <p>I can understand why some forumers feel sceptical about one Singaporean giving a helping hand to another fellow Singaporean. As Singaporean, we are brought up to believe nothing is free and anything that is free is not sustainable for a small country. We have attained to be the third riches country in the world as reported in Asiaone, but gotong royong or community spirit is a rare commodity in modern Singapore with an increasing diverse and fractions society set against a backdrop of influx of new migrants and foreign talents due to globalisation.</p>
              <p>I left Singapore 40 years ago to work and live overseas(long before the term "quitter" was coined). From my experience as an Overseas Singaporean, I know that " a good neighbour is better than a distant relative" don't you think a close Singaporean in time of help in a foreign country is better than your family at home.</p>
              <p>Who knows I may need your help when I visit Singapore? </p>
