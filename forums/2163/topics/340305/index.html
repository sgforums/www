              <p>i know ! and the best part is, during summer break they all head back to Singapore for a holiday. then have the cheek to complain that aus or canada is boring.. nothing to do. so going back to sg is a better option. </p>
              <p>i wonder how 2 countries, way bigger then sg can be boring. i haven't been back to sg in 2 years, nothing missing one bit of it at all ! i got alot of better things to do here. </p>

              <p>that's the key; mingle.</p>
              <p>it would be so boring to go overseas and continue to clique with your SEA counterparts. i guess one should have fellow singaporeans in their frens list but to just stick to your comfort zone would have been wrong. </p>
              <p>regardless of study or live, we should make it an effort to get to know others from another culture; whites, blacks and in between.</p>

              <p>In the beginning, you'll make a lot of aquaintances first, because real friendship takes time to build.  But over time, when you have gained each other's trust, you can find yourself with new friends. </p>
              <p>If you're alone in a foreign land, things are always tougher in the first year or so and different people will have different adjustment rates and adaptability.  Plus, all of us face different circumstances and challenges which will determine how well and how quickly we settle in.</p>
              <p>Now, I have Malaysian/Singaporean friends but I've also made friends with quite a few Aussies and people of other nationalities like South Africans, Polish, Romanians, Indians, British, etc.  It's a really interesting mix. </p>
              <p>The key is open mind and no expectations.  You'll find a lot of differences with those who come from different places but try to focus on the similarities and not accentuate the differences. </p>
              <p>The longer you remain overseas, you'll realise that the more you'll lose friends who are back home anyways.  "Out of sight, out of mind".  Migrants will always tell you that they think fondly of their friends back home but their friends quickly move on and forget them all too quickly.  All migrants I've spoken to talk of this stage they go through where they are 'neither here nor there' - going home is no longer the same because things change, and yet you aren't exactly firmly rooted in your new home yet.  It's the uncomfortable stage where one finds oneself 'in limbo'. </p>
