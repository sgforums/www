In addition, I still need to take a domestic flight to connect with SQ on the coast.<br><br>Northwest Airlines' coach class is better suited to accommodating cattle, but they do offer the most direct routing from Minneapolis to Singapore (MSP/NRT/SIN) and their airfares are usually the most competitive.<br><br>Any way you cut it, it's still a long haul. 20 hours in a cattle pen is definitely pushing the limits of human endurance.</div>
