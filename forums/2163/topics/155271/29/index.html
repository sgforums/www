From what I read on the MOE link, my daughter can get a total exemption since she'll be in Sec 1 next year. My son unfortunately will have to learn, the poor boy. I can't afford private school in Sg so I'm thinking, retirement in Sg isn't going to work. And boy are you ever right. The longer we are overseas, the poorer we get. That stinks.</div>

It's hard to create a niche here even. IT here isn't the same as IT in Sg. Agree? I keep hearing so many people in Sg are dying to leave but IMHO, life is good there.</div>

Bo pian, really. Thing is, his family's all there. Both the in-laws and the outlaws.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> There is a power struggle within the inlaws and we refuse to get involved. That's why I'm happy my friends live on the other side of the water where it's cheaper. Prices there still affordable and that's the town we got married at. It's near the base and near the first place we ever rented too. *sigh* So anyway. I'm glad our relatives live on the other side of the water. At least 90 mins away from the closest one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If only we could sell our Sg flat, then no need to struggle so much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

That's why I've been having near sleepless nights thinking about this. When we had the kids, we thought, let's retire in Sg. Now it's not so clear cut. Though my kids have spent alot of time in Sg, they don't know what the school system is like. I know they'll go through alot of teasing and finger pointing directed at them which is something no Mother can tolerate well. We're thinking, haiz, move back to Seattle, see how things go. We have good friends there, all Navy or retired military. They are helping us find a house there as well as a job for the hubby post-retirement. The plan is to move up this summer before school there starts. We're just waiting to hear from the navy about logistics and funding.</div>

We started renting out one room when my CPF went down to nothing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I'm a little frus at the situation really. My parents weren't savvy with their money. They rented for the longest time until they bought a flat which they later had to sell. Then they went back to renting. Years later, when I bought mine before leaving Sg, I wanted to rent it out. But how could I do that knowing that my parents are renting? So for the past 10 years, I've been paying the mortgage one way or another. I told them I was going to sell it some day. Now that some day has come and I can't. I've been thinking of buying a smaller flat but there are no 3 rooms with a cheap price. I've emailed HDB and they say they have no studio apts to sell for the next 2 years.</div>

I have a friend who moved from No Cal to TX and she loves it there. Big house, etc. Not Sgporean though. Will he take the green card anyway? That would be easier for him to then move to Canada as a US green card holder?</div>
