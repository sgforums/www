We arrived about 11pm and then were out again about 7am the next morning.  I did manage to try some Newfoundland breakfast specialities at the hotel before I left, though.  Very nice.  As expected, it involved smoked salmon.<br><br>Not in NJ yet.  I'm now in Houston.  Just got back here after going home to San Francisco.  Back to work for the next week.  In about 2 weeks I'll be working out of NJ, with a nice transcontinental commute.<br><br>I see you're in Toronto.  I love going there.  Was going there at least once a month during the winter.  In fact, 2006 began for me in Toronto.  I was too tired to stay out till midnight, so I went back to my hotel room.  But I was still able to see the fireworks.  My hotel was a block from Nathan Phillips (is that what it's called ) Square.  The next morning I had an excellent dim sum meal in my hotel.  My last trip was in March, but I only remember passing out in the club and being carried back to the cab and the hotel by the rest of my crew.</div>
