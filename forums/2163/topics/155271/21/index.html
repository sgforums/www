Cracking skin is something that almost everyone living in these cold and dry climes has to endure. Sometimes, the cracking is severe enough to cause bleeding. It's not so much a problem at home, as many residential central heating systems have built-in humidifiers. Portable cold water humidifiers, though somewhat noisy, can also be used to humidify individual rooms in the house.<br><br>Many people rub moisturizing cream on their hands to prevent skin cracking. It works, except that you have to put up with that 'grimy' feeling through the day.</div>

Since his mental condition does not make him too amenable to reason, you did the right thing to complain to your landlord. If I were you, I'd take the additional step of reporting the situation to the police; they'll probably tell you to take the matter up with your landlord, but at least you've partially 'covered your butt' in case the situation escalates to some kind of physical confrontation.<br><br>Are the neighbours on the <span style="font-style: italic;">other</span> side of Mr. Mental Case's apartment complaining too?<br><br>Let us know how things turn out!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, Fatum....Canada has ZERO TOLERANCE of any display of racial discrimination.  Well, at least I know here in Toronto, we hold this value with utmost importance.  That neighbour of yours could get himself into trouble here.  He's been getting away with his behaviour!<br><br>Have you discussed with your your room mates?  You shouldn't have to put up with this and handle this all by yourself.  You paid rent!!!  Your landlord should say something to this guy.  You didn't fork out money to subject yourself to sleepless nights.  Your landlord, being the owner of the premises has the right to impose some kind of rules and considerate behaviour for all concerned and all have to abide by it, otherwise, hit the road, man!  Like my friend like to say to his kids "My Way or The HighWay!"<br><br>Whatever it is, please take care of yourself.  And I honestly hope you will/can resolve this issue.  If need be, move.  We all deserve better.</div>
