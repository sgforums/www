Whenever we move, the first thing we look for is Yeo's soy milk and Milo.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I found Milo in Japan but ouch! expensive! 438yen for 500g. (US$4.30 +/-) The base commissary stocked the Vitasoy soy milk so we made do with that. My daughter doesn't like milk so by hook or by crook I had to find soy milk that she would take. When we got here, I found the Ranch 99 again so I'm happy. So you know what I have to do when I move up to Seattle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I know what you mean about the no-sugar option. I had to forgo the condensed milk in my Milo when I was pregnant with my daughter because I had gestational diabetes. Ever since then, I've gotten used to the taste and I love it. As for no-sugar soy milk, bleh!</div>
