              <p>It was snowing lightly for most of yesterday, but due to the intense cold (-2°F/-19°C), the salt laid down on the roads was largely ineffective at melting the ice. The result was an evening commuting nightmare. It took nearly an hour longer for the bus to get to the park-and-ride lot, and along the way we were entertained with sights of numerous vehicles in ditches off the freeway. No shortage of stupid drivers around here.</p>
              <p>The weather's actually much better today: the sun is out and the temperature is currently a balmy 11°F (-12°C). I should have worn my bermudas to work!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>The US is being pelted by bad weather from coast to coast. Even those of us in sunny southern cal aren't spared. Snow has been falling around the 2500ft level. Many San Diegans who have never experienced snow in their lives have been driving up to the mountains to play in the snow. However they went up without tire chains so it's a mess up there. I'm content to stay in the lower elevations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's been pouring since Monday and as a result, the Tijuana river banks have swelled causing some ranchers to lose their horses. One man drowned trying to save his horses. The weathermen say we'll have a dry couple of days before getting pelted by more rain after the weekend.</p>

              <p>was driven to skydive today at Lake Elisnores California USA.</p>

              <p>while crossing the mountains, we saw plenty of snow.  thankfully our car has snow tyres so we were crossing fine.  the environment guysclosed the road for a while to clear out the snow and we waited 15 minutes before driving that road and seeing that snow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after the skydive, we drove back from Temacula and went thru that mountain road again.  This time, plenty of cars parked on the side of the road and we see plenty of people trying to play in that snow.  I still see more rocks then actual snow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The mountains we are at are snow covered too.  Pretty view.  Not fully snow capped, but still pretty.  Will try to post pictures when I stop thinking about the moment I jumped out of the plane.</p>

              <p>Yikes! Most of Minnesota is currently under a blizzard warning. The current forecast calls for about 7" of snow and wind gusts of between 30 and 50 mph later today and into tonight, creating white-out conditions and lots of blowing/drifting snow. Temperatures by tomorrow morning are expected to dip to -8°F (-22°C) with a wind chill index much lower than that.</p>

              <p>Well, another fren just jio me to New Orleans this week, but the flight ticks are very elusive.  So I am waiting till Jan 09 to go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then there is Hawaii, though my funds are really running low liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just today!  Sis's fren decide that its too much trouble getting her visa and she watns to save money, so she wont be coming to USA!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just spent 1+ hour, on the phone to the airline and the travelling agent to readjust my flights, and they still tell me they will call me! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>which they tell me the same one week ago!  Now they are saying I have to pay for my ticks back because I was a no show for my flights home on 17 Dec!  They keep giving me a runaround,  call the airline, airline say wait they will call me.  Then finally I called this morning to chase them and they tell me to call travel agent. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I call travel agent, they run me around to about 4 different operators, and the 3rd one was so indian accented I tell him to write me emails instead.  But finally he transfer me to someone with more american accent fella and that fella kept me on hold for 30 minutes!  Travel agents call was for a full 52 minutes!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Darn Darn Darn!  I could have just go home by Mid Jan 09 and save this trouble!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I most likely have to buy a fresh ticket back to Singapore!, which I most likely wont, maybe fly direct to phuket instead, since the price is the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Darn her fren and she wanting to see snow and explore USA! Darn Darn Darn!</p>

              <p><br>Yeppers, I wanted to do it again, was waiting for my sis fren to come then got kakis to do it with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think for my flight and the jump, because of the noise of the plane, most of us arent that tense and the instructor kept a jovial presense among us. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the initial leap from the plane, from feeling gravity on the plane floor to suddenly no gravity, thats where the panic started.  Its like doing the Hotel of Terror Ride &amp; the Malibu Rider at California Adventure park.  Its that you suddenly lift away from gravity/seat kinda feeling. (Thats where the panic started, but it faded when we stabalised and started flying face down.)  It was cold though, maybe because of the snowy weather.  I regret not wearing any decent sports gloves.  Plus my face muscles was moving left right and centre because of the wind.  Its ugly so thankfully I didnt request for vids and pics from up there.</p>
