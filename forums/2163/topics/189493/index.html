            <div class='col-md body'>well, put it this way, it depends on the pace of the societal assimilation<br><br>can you imagine, with the recent surge in the numbers of PRCs (falungong members included) coming to Singapore, we can be expected to change our way to fit in these newcomers?<br><br>similarly, the migration of Middle Eastern and Central Asian peeps only started few decades ago at most, I dont think its fair for the Australiam government to decide suddenly they had to change the society values just to accomodate these people. I remember laughing at one news extract where the one Muslim family protested the break-in of their house by the Aussie CT team. I mean, the issue is that there is a possibility that place is a terrorist hideout, and they shouldnt be considering whether there is women in the house or not, since there is more important issues  at hand.<br><br>The kind of societal assimilation we are looking at should be one that happened over a long period of time, Singapore is a good example, we are basically in the Malay homeland, and it took 200 years before we decided that all four racial groups are here to stay, through thick and thin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm going to go out on a limb here.<br><br>If we're talking about skilled immigration, there really isn't a problem.  There are limits to the number of people admitted, and that creates a filtering process through which people with the greatest contribution to make come through.  All things being equal, if they've bothered to go through the hassle of the immigration process, they're probably motivated to make good on their lives in their new country.<br><br>Now here's where it gets contentious.  Taking in refugees is a noble idea, but it does seem to cause a lot more problems than skilled migration.<br><br>First, their countries of origin tend to be in very poor state for them to be refugees in the first place, and this places limits on the skills that they bring along with them.  While they're getting themselves upskilled (and that's not a given thing), it's a drain on the new country's coffers.<br><br>Second, the state of the original countries would be chaotic, and moving to a new country where rule of law is taken a lot more seriously can be a big adjustment to make.<br><br>Third, these people are not in their new countries by choice.  One would think that they would appreciate having their lives saved, but more often than not they stay stuck in survival mode and try to get away with as much as they can, which doesn't gel well with civilised society.<br><br>To some extent, the above applies to illegal immigrants as well.<br><br>Like I said, morally I'm all for the idea of a refugee policy.  The practical side of things, however, can get extremely messy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I land on the extreme line of immigration ...<br><br>If refugees want to come in , that's fine when their reasons are valid and checks out . Therefore I support detention centers for that purpose.  Duty of the Country who takes them in is to make sure they speak the <span style="font-style: italic;"> lingua franca </span> of that country . Skill them up if they must - so that they become contributing citizens of the country<br><br>They ACCEPT THE RULES/LAWS and learn about the new culture they are going to integrate with . I don't see anyway how we can actually accomodate the "women have no rights rule or lower in status than men " in certain cultures.<br><br>If they don't like it , they can jolly well go back to where they came from coz i am frankly sick of middle easterns/africans making lewd remarks to girls who are wearing a proper attire yet in their eyes are skimpy and therefore "asking for it" .</div>
