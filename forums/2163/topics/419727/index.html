              <p>I done some reading and a bit of research here and there. If you are not a degree holder is it close to impossible to get a job or a visa even if you are willing to take on crap jobs?</p>
              <p>By crap jobs I mostly mean manual labour or unpleasant tasks that most would shun.  Toilet cleaning, flipping burgers, etc...  Can Singaporeans already in Australia or thinking of moving to Australia verfiy?</p>

              <p>they have no high tech industries or lack of it.thats why i end up making my own business here.im in oz by the way.</p>
              <p>first of all most foreigners who get jobs are either asian chiobus or masters degree doing a sporean diploma job or they get to know asian coonections to get their dream job.</p>
              <p>a job isa job......just another day in prison with better food n freedom.no point werking and earn only $4k/mth with only $50/year increment as a burger flipper or cleaner.for now ,as long as yer head structure dun look european or at least and indian then not much hopes fer getting dream or decent jobs.best u setup yer own factoryb n sell stuff worldwide.</p>
              <p>done some research on australias high tech industries last month.their supposedly silicon valley which is suppose to be as good as the one in america is not really going anywhere.they set in up 2 years ago and havent seen much progress.,it mainly empty buildings and empty roads....no high end manufacturing and progress.IN  FACT,phiillliipines has more silicon valley than australia with INTEL.malaysia is also progressing thanks to spore side that sends its operations overseas to malaysia.</p>
              <p>and when they do have a job even if u a a singaporean and applied for a spore technologies job as an oz permanent resident to service singapore army tanks in rockhampton.they will reject u even without anyinterview even.their time i think is precious and the managers are paid $100/hr or so everyday and they wont want to waste time interviewing a singaporean even if their boss is a singaporean and owned by a singapore stat board in oz.my bad experience in oz.</p>
              <p>they seem to only give temp jobs to asians  really or really end of the stick or dead end jobs....u dun expect them to give an asian a manager or directors job do u???if they had enough jobs....i suppose u could see indian accountants werking in westpac or some other credit union banks...but most end up werkin as taxi drivers or at burger kings...one also got murdered when he went to werk.,</p>
              <p>i have heard of other stories where extremely highly educated sporeans with oz permanent resident status and well groomed sporeans couldnt get a job in city areas and ended up working for the singapore military for its australian sub contractors.after 3 months later he  had to leave.....why???perhaps he was forced out by his australian counterparts who might  appear racist perhaps?one thing i know is when yer salary reaches $70k/year all the aussies be it black or white want yer job.</p>
              <p>immigration to oz isnt meant for softies.if u cant make it in spore or led an easy life in spore or worldwide.....high chance u would end up commiting suicide in oz.its advisable to setup up yer own factory or online connections worldwide.oz is just a stepping stone.....dun stay on that rock for long to get what u really weant in life.....whatever u do.....just dun step backwards or lose balance.</p>

              <p><br>a flood victim?i was thinkin of moving to some other state!this state qld is cursed..so hot n steamy yet still got floods!!no rain also still got floods...temperature boiing steaming hot at 31C also got flood!</p>
              <p>anyway im not affected by floods.serves them right really for negelecting to build dams to store water when theres no flood...and when theres no flood they say theres drought and all the farm animals die due to no water.say they are damned if they have rain.....and damned if they dont have rain....and all the flood water gets thrown away into the sea right now instead of building more damns and reservoirs to store em!</p>
              <p>if thats the way they want it....so be it.</p>

              <p><br>hmmm..i think  parents did not get me overseas as the only source of immigration.i could immigrate to oz by myself  in the past as i had mentioned before as above n elsewhere.however that would leave my old folks in spore.not me to leave my folks behind.please READ carefully!i cant be repeating this all the time.under th e skilled immigration status i could immigrate anywhere thats considered favourable to my purpose in life.spore is gone case....i cant get those engineering materials without being a big timer.spore is not meant to breed folks like bill gates,thomas edison or even colonel sanders of kfc fame.even the owner of creative industries of spore  mr sim already said spore hasnt got a good enviroment to progress.....their majority of people are kinda shallow n narrrow minded....i dont know why thats the case but i suppose its the same in oz n all parts of the world. remeber...only the best get to immigrate..bring their folks,cats n dogs there too like i did!</p>
              <p>what university did ditzy come out from anyway in australia........obviously yer folks must have paid plenty fer yer degree.or were u born as u were in comprehending stuff!</p>

              <p>First of.  Thanks to all those that replied. Of course, no one intends to flip burgers or be a janitor for the rest of their life.  What I meant is but merely a stepping stone, like doing part time first while studying in a profession that is listed under their GSM list.  Then finally applying for work after graduating.</p>
              <p>And by what you said Hitman2010.  It seems like racism is very much well and alive.  So even though my line of work falls into their "wanted" list, there is high chance that I will not find employment there, yes?</p>

              <p>First of.  Thanks to all those that replied. Of course, no one intends to flip burgers or be a janitor for the rest of their life.  What I meant is but merely a stepping stone, like doing part time first while studying in a profession that is listed under their GSM list.  Then finally applying for work after graduating.</p>
              <p>And by what you said Hitman2010.  It seems like racism is very much well and alive.  So even though my line of work falls into their "wanted" list, there is high chance that I will not find employment there, yes?</p>

              <p><br>just clobber racism like how u clobber real cannibals.they are not ready for the modern world unless u show them u have an australian degree masters etc....other than that i have read stories n seen tv on what happened to many chinese in ww1 and ww2.</p>
              <p>in ww1,a sniper who was part chinese and part white went to turkey and was regarded the best sniper in the australian army and killed the turkish sniper who was sent to hunt him down.total kills by eurasian aussie sniper was by the hundreds on turkish soil.after the war he died a broken man and died in poverty.his sniper assistant led a better life and wrote a book later on as a sniper.</p>
              <p>in ww2,one of the chinese australian tried signing up for the australian army and was instead given a white feather meaning cowardice in the aussie army.due to the nature of his colour and ability to blend in in asia he was taken on by australian army special services where no aussie white dudes could fit into japanese occupied asia.chinese guy was posted to a US submarine where he was a highly decorated soldier..where his records of service was vouched by submarine captain.</p>
              <p>aussies arent really ready for modern world.just looking at their industrial system u would already know its counterproductive and har5d to make up for deficiencies without importing many. people from overseas.but once in oz these highly skilled [eople end up meeting with folks who want high quality people.i have myself seen that they would get guys not knowing how to screw  STUFF properly and looks as if it was done by drunks at werk.they would get thios type of people fromn the interviewer....as long as they are white.if u are asian....they would dismiss u as a coming froma country producing cheap stuff and working in highly dangerous sweat shops!and often their interviews seem to be based on,,,,"are u lying to me about what u did in spore?!!!!" with that angry look or perhaps using body language as the sole principle of employing folks........kinda like the negotiator movie with samuel jackson as the cop who studies eye movement of  criminals.....that would apply to only 1% of highly skilled cops.these folks are loosers really.....so if u get a job either u have a masters degree doin a kids job or simply they cant do it!</p>

              <p>......kinda given up on these people really... ..they are so choosy when they have nothing to build up on.but oz is a good stepping stone.its better than singapore practically.just be wary of racist bank officers,nosey supermarket checkout girls and uneducated vietnamese PR who got their status by being a janitor of some sort.</p>
              <p>just dont expect too much from them.</p>
              <p>1)their fixed deposit is 6.5% /year average sometimes much more!</p>
              <p>2)their cars  2000 model is around $7k and would be good for first car owners to damage them up without getting hurt at all</p>
              <p>3)they have materials needed in small towns needed for most engineering stuff</p>
              <p>4)their food is cheap  pork is $7.5/kg n sometimes less,lamb ribs  sold in spore herbal soup shops would go for $9/kg while in oz its $4/kg.1.25l pepsi is $1</p>
              <p>5)electricity is cheap many fold as compared to spore!</p>
              <p>however</p>
              <p>1)jobs are scarce</p>
              <p>2) technology of industries is backward</p>
              <p>3)industries there often mean a worker is crushed to death or suffwer horrific injuries</p>
