              <p><br>Not really. The eyewear business is pretty competitive here in the US, and you can usually get a good deal on prescription glasses, especially if you keep an eye out (no pun intended!) for coupons in the papers and promotional mailings.</p>
              <p>To give you an example, I recently had two pairs of prescription eyeglasses (with lightweight, impact- and scratch-resistant plastic lenses, no tinting) made at a local eyewear chain for just a smidge over $150, inclusive of the eye exam.</p>

              <p><br>ohh...that sounds pretty decent! my glasses made in singapore are all $200+. perhaps the quality might be different? or that i always get ripped off in singapore?...but i'm totally ok with going for the more budget ones. anyway...a pair of glasses can last me for years and years (on average, i use one pair for at least 2-3 years, sometimes even longer)!</p>
              <p>how about the cost of contact lens? i use monthly disposable ones. i pay about $150 for 14 pairs.  </p>

              <p><br>yah...someone was telling me that based on her own experiences...paying for excesss luggage can be super expensive on certain flights bound for US. so in the end...she'd rather just pay for another plane ticket to enjoy the additional luggage allowance!!!</p>

              <p>My last trips, I used army kit bags which is cheap at about S$12 at the army market.  They are pretty useful for lugging around clothes.</p>
              <p>Get a decent 29 inch hard luggage for your precious/breakable stuffs, avoid jewelleries in them and have a towel in your handcarry that is convenient to take out of the handcarry.  The towel is good to rest your head on in the plane.</p>
              <p>My experiences wise, JAL to Narita is very comfy with flight entertainments.</p>
              <p>The Japan to USA leg of the journey might be more cramped and dont have as good service so you are better off with some muscle relaxant to sleep on the flight.</p>

              <p><br>Not really. The eyewear business is pretty competitive here in the US, and you can usually get a good deal on prescription glasses, especially if you keep an eye out (no pun intended!) for coupons in the papers and promotional mailings.</p>
              <p>To give you an example, I recently had two pairs of prescription eyeglasses (with lightweight, impact- and scratch-resistant plastic lenses, no tinting) made at a local eyewear chain for just a smidge over $150, inclusive of the eye exam.</p>
              <p>How does this compare to the cost of having glasses made in Singapore?</p>

              <p>Re: glasses</p>
              <p>All this time, I've been getting my glasses thru the mail from my regular optical place in Sg. But but but, since I became a Costco member, it's cheaper to get it done through them. I did the math and even after postage, Costco wins hands down.</p>
