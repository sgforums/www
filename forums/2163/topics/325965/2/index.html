              <p>Hi Jeanwoo,</p>
              <p>It depends on where she stays.  If she's staying in Boston.  She does not need to worry since there is subway there.  As for other cities and towns, she can travel via public buses or trains.  The schedule of the pubic bus of my city, Haverhill, is about 30 mins apart during weekdays. Some times i will take the bus to take my daughter for her gym lessons.  We've also taken the train from haverhill to Boston. The journey is about 1.5 hr.  Oh yeah, it takes about 30 mins if we drive to Boston. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh yeah, here's two links hopefully can help lostintransition. </p>

              <p>credit trial will also take awhile to form...do we still have a good chance to find decent rental but perhaps to pay a higher rental deposit? what's the typical rent payment arrangement like? do we pay for the entire year/half year upfront or just pay a deposit (how many months typically?) and the remaining through monthly payments?</p>

              <p>Hi lost,</p>
              <p>I can only offer non legal, techical comments.</p>
              <p>1. laptop should work if you have the power cables that is suited to the US electrical outlet &amp; voltage. Its also cheaper to purchase them at USA.</p>
              <p>2. Communication devices like handphones, please buy them in USA, though they are more expensive and not as advanced as the models we have in sg.  Otherwise, a quad band phone with the power cable for US electrics will do.</p>
              <p>3. Do shop and buy a chinese wok to bring to USA.  Also those sieve like thngy that you can boil pasta or noodles in. Or those flat girdles for indian cooking.  Not to mention those cooking books.</p>
              <p>4. and if you have small feet like mine...size 35.  Do get your heels in sg and fly them over.  Also get about 3 or 4 pairs of those really cheapo fake crocs for you and hub.  Just dump them at the front entrance, your backyard, your garage and even your toliet bathroom.  they are great for shuffling around with socks during cold weather.</p>
              <p>5. Buy those pashmina shawls too and bring them over. they are good to use as well as gifts.  And jeans, especially if you get them cheap in sg at those Ck dept stores for S$10/- a pair.  Those jeans are really thin and wont be too warm to wear even in summer time.</p>
              <p>6.those L'oreal face products are good too.  Avoid any cleansing products that will be too dry for your face because the weather there will require more moisturising ingredients.</p>

              <p>thanks viciouskitty!!  such practical, down-to-earth advice are exactly what i need.</p>

              <p>I forgot to mention bras.  Especially those push ups.</p>
              <p>Caucasian women tend to have their boobies further away and the bras in USA tends to be wider in front. Theirs pants &amp; tops are longer so you may find their clothing a bit too big, including underwears has more materials and look like grannies undies.</p>
              <p>And do bring along those cheap to buy netted bags to easier do your laundry.</p>
              <p>And static is common in USA so you might want to buy those anti static wristband or net with a ball to bounce off static from your body.</p>
              <p>You really just need to go to USA with your cash, online banking &amp; documents.</p>
              <p>Oh, and do drop by the Central Police Station for a CNCC when you have your visa documents. The CNCC can come in useful some way.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The landlords will usually run your credit ratings to make sure.. you're not a lousy tenant. But it's still up to the discretion of the home owner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since you have no credit ratings.. just let them know your background.. like where you work and how much is your pay .. ... you just need to convince the owner you won't lapse on your rental or thrash their home. And if you have no pets.. it's even better.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Every home owner has their fair share of nightmare renters.. so they want to make sure you're not one of them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When you rent.. you will likely be dealing directly with the home owner who lives nearby.. or a property management company. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For your own protection.. it's best to put your deposit into ESCROW. Typically one month deposit... you need to decide or negotiate the length of the lease/rent with the owner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Most landlords prefer longer lease term as it saves them advertising fees and the hassle of dealing with short term renters.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I wouldn't suggest you let your hubby teach you.. since he is also new to the place.. and may not be as well versed with some driving rules and regulations as a local driving instructor...</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If I am not wrong.. you get capital gain exclusion as a resident.. and I don't think you qualify for <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=102319,00.html">NRA ( Non-resident Alien)</a> status.</span></p>

              <p>I suggest you pick up a copy of Culture Shock USA. They do have a section on the local cultures and etiquettes(complete with helpful quizzes at the end of the book) and this may help you integrate into the American society <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>Currently, my rental apt is from the property management company and not private landlord.  One thing great is that they take care of the maintenance.  I'm staying in North of Boston whereas you will be staying in South of Boston. </p>
              <p>I looked at New Bedford..there's no listing from property management company.  But saw one there's at Dartmouth, near to New bedford.  2 bedroom and 2 bath plus washer and dryer is only $1200 per month.  Not sure if heat and gas is included.  But this rental price is definitely considered as cheap.</p>
              <p>But the min lease period is 1 year for property management company apts. </p>

              <p>And Jeanwoo is true...do what the Americans do......like when my hubby has company family function. We'll always go and stay as long as we can....though personally I dislike these types of functions.  So far, I have attend summer party at boss's house; company dinner followed by watching ice hockey match.  Just last Sat, they booked a campground and we spent the entire afternoon talking and playing. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for driving, your hubby can teach you.  But like what Jeanwoo mentions, he himself is new to this place. You may want to consider going to a driving school. </p>

              <p>Since you'll be new to the US tax system, for the first couple of years, you might want to engage the services of a CPA. Even though we've been doing our own taxes for years, every time we relocate, there are many issues that crop up which we can't handle. We have a CPA whom we use and he charges us $180. His fees are tax deductible too. Just remember to save all your paperwork? I'm very anal when it comes to filing our taxes, saving every piece of paperwork that may reduce our taxes. Also remember, it's not good to get a large amount back from the tax guy every year. Your goal is to be as near zero as possible. Too much money back = you're overpaying and the govt is holding on to your money, interest-free.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>learning to drive:</em></span></p>
              <p><em>i actually heard it's more costly to learn driving in US hence the reason why i was thinking of learning most part of it here in SG first and then go over for a short refresher (since we are driving on different sides) &amp; to take the test.</em></p>
              <p><em>yt123 was suggesting that i can learn driving from my hubby? that's allowed in US!? that'd cost next to nothing to learn then =)</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just remember, you may be a careful driver but others aren't. Again, the AAA holds driving courses for newbies, so check into that. I didn't take such a course. Every time we relocate, I familiarise myself by driving during off-peak hours running short errands. You sound like money isn't a problem for you so I would invest in a driving course, if I were in your shoes. Especially since your hubby's new to the States too. No offence but it sounds like the blind leading the blind.</p>
              <p>Oh and when you buy a car, get one with heated seats. You'll love it as much as I do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>the cold:</em></span></p>
              <p><em>ya..i heard about the cold in the east coast. where we are going to stay - buzzards bay/cape cod...i heard most people will leave in winter and only to return in summer. it's an area where people come for their summer vacation...hence i can imagine the area to be very dead in winter. it's very likely that we'll also return to SG during winter. but i note your advice regarding heating for the apartment. thanks!</em></p>
              <p>We call those people snowbirds. We get plenty of them here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I enjoy dressing for winter. There are tricks to dressing for winter to keep warm without the bulk. Layering is key. Don't buy your winter clothes in Singapore. They styles are sooooo old. Invest in a good winter coat, knee high socks and maybe thermal undies. Some good sites to check out are <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com">www.eddiebauer.com</a>, <a href="http://www.jcrew.com">www.jcrew.com</a>, <a href="http://www.landsend.com">www.landsend.com</a>, <a href="http://www.llbean.com">www.llbean.com</a> and <a href="http://www.garnethill.com">www.garnethill.com</a></p>

              <p>As for assimilation, that comes slowly. Your hubby's co-workers and their spouses may be your first avenue. If you're a natually gregarious person, you'll be set in no time. For those of use with kids, it's a little easier.</p>

              <p>i actually heard it's more costly to learn driving in US hence the reason why i was thinking of learning most part of it here in SG first and then go over for a short refresher (since we are driving on different sides) &amp; to take the test.</p>
              <p>yt123 was suggesting that i can learn driving from my hubby? that's allowed in US!? that'd cost next to nothing to learn then =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>suggest you might look at a economical and practical way to learn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) take your written test (u can go to DMV get a booklet and learn) than go and registered it is the same day test as you registered.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Check with DMV to see if you can learn to drive so long there is  a valid designated driver with a local driver licence beside you. YOU got 1 year to learn after the test.  Since yt123 mention i think you should be able to drive with your husband beside you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) after you are confident with the driving you want to take the driving test. Check out which DMV u want to take the test, usually different people will have different say....find a driver instructor at that DMV. Find out their teaching rate. And signed up for 4/5 hour lesson</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He/She will teach you the technique to take the test and teach you the local traffic regulation.     </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) go take the test and IF you PASS GO Take your honey to the car dealership.....ha ha ha......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you fail registered again lor....I think in this case you save quite a bit at least you don't have to spend $$ on lengthy learning your spouse can help u on basic driving skill. but only spend on getting testing technique and tips from instructors.</p>

              <p>When you sell, could mean the difference between these two tax rates schedules in Singapore. One being a tax resident rate, the other a non tax resident rate. It's best to consult a tax accountant for tax planning advice, not those accountants that just do tax filing. Most folks don't know anything about taxes to do any appropriate planning to minimise it. I had a friend who does accounts (non-graduate), he once told me, "what's the point of learning taxation? You just submit your returns to IRAS and let them compute the tax for you." But after doing a tax planning module, I realised that you could make substantial tax savings by knowing how to manage your affairs. The tax tables abit messed up, but I think you should be able to make out the difference.</p>

              <p>regarding taxes...so much info to digest..i don't even know where to start. i'm used to filing my own (as self-employed) and my spouse's (employee) taxes in SG but the US tax system seems much more complicated. really need to spend some time to figure it out.</p>

              <p>as for driving...i was suggesting to my spouse that he could possibly teach me to drive and he rolled his eyes. he said he can guide me but i shld still go to the driving instructor for the basics. he had stayed and driven in US for awhile...so altho his familiar, he's still not confident to teach me. so yes, i'll probably find a qualified instructor for that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for stuffs to bring...bras!! haha...will definitely stock up on some. good thing is i ain't exactly small size (size 14)...i've problems finding clothes of my size in singapore unless i go to places like M&amp;S, dorothy perkins etc. (but they are freaking ex) so US sizes should suit me fine...i love shopping at the megamarts like target and the clothings are pretty affordable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for housing, what my spouse's employer is providing for a subsidised apartment will cost $1000+ (inc utilities) which we thought is pretty decent as we ourselves haven't been able to find anything cheaper around that area. we might consider dartmouth too...'cos i'm thinking of going to school there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can i check if you folks save/invest in US? what kind of options are available? my friends are all so envious that i can start an account with vanguard soon. is the propensity to save high when you work/live in the US considering the net income after taxes &amp; cost of living?</p>

The pill that treats the condition affects the liver so the second pill prevents the liver from overreacting. I had to pop those pills for one year. Nowadays it's a 6 month treatment.</p>

              <p>Also remember, it's not good to get a large amount back from the tax guy every year. Your goal is to be as near zero as possible. Too much money back = you're overpaying and the govt is holding on to your money, interest-free.</p>

              <p>so do i understand correctly that one will have to estimate the amount of taxes one will have to pay for the year (base on income/deductibles) and to declare that amount for tax withholding? any penalty for under/over-estimating the amount of taxes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>talking about places where most of the residents are "snowbirds"....is it a good idea to own properties in those areas?</p>
