            <div class='col-md body'>So it started to snow again around noon today. It was coming down pretty heavily at times, but at least it wasn't the obnoxious, wind-driven type of snowfall that blew flakes into your nostrils when you walked into the wind.<br><br>It was more than enough, however, to make a total mess out of the evening commute.<br><br>About 5" had fallen by the time I left the office, and it was still coming down. A quick glance out my office window just before I headed down confirmed that traffic on the freeway was virtually at a standstill.<br><br>I got to the bus terminus at the usual time, and waited for the express bus to arrive. And waited. And waited. It finally pulled in about 45 minutes late. The bus driver mentioned that traffic on the freeway was barely moving. Uh-oh, this wasn't looking good...<br><br>The bus made its way through downtown St. Paul to pick up passengers, many of whom usually took the later service but wanted to leave early because of the snow. The result was a very SBS-like, packed-to-the-gills, get-your-laptop-bag-outta-my-crotch express bus that entered the freeway.<br><br>Once on the freeway, the "express" bus was anything <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span>. We crawled along at the proverbial snail's pace in the breakdown lane (in MN, municipal vehicles are allowed to drive on the breakdown lane when traffic is backed up), at times actually <span style="font-style: italic;">overtaking</span> the mostly stationary traffic.<br><br>A regular trip from the downtown terminus to the park-and-ride lot in normal traffic usually takes about 30 minutes. This evening, it took a little over 90. Good thing I went to the bathroom before leaving the office. Minnesotans, by and large, are a hardy and tolerant lot, and there were no complaints from the passengers during the ride. In fact, when the driver announced the destination as we pulled into the P&amp;R lot, most of the passengers broke out in cheers and applause.<br><br>The sun had set by now. The next 10 minutes were spent brushing off the thick layer of snow that had accumulated on my car during the day. Good workout for the wrists.<br><br>It's about a three-mile drive from the P&amp;R lot to my house, mostly along a winding and somewhat hilly two-lane road. The road had apparently only been partially plowed, and traffic was slow-going and heavier than normal. As we crawled along, I kept a safe following distance from the minivan ahead of me, and was having difficulty keeping my car going straight because of the ruts in the snow.<br><br>It also didn't help that the (pardon my French) SOB in the SUV behind me obviously thought I was going too slow and was tailgating me. Then, on one of the downhill curves, the minivan ahead of me started fishtailing and drifted sideways into the snowbank on the opposite kerb. Fortunately, it impacted the snowbank very slowly, and oncoming traffic had enough time (and distance) to stop. The (pardon my French) SOB in the SUV behind me obviously saw this, as he backed off and stopped tailgating me.<br><br>When I got back to my townhouse, I had to spend another 30 minutes shovelling snow from the inclined driveway so my car could make it up and into the garage. Having a long driveway is great as there is ample parking when you have a large number of friends over, but it is a (pardon my Fuh-rench!) b<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>itch to keep clear of snow in winter.<br><br>So, who still likes winter after reading all that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
