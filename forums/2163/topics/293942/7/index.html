              <p>I read in Japan that they store snow and became a air cooler during summer.</p>
              <p>i think is time to learn to preserve snow and use it in Hot Summer when we needed the cool temp.</p>

              <p>Several winters ago, not long after I moved up here, we had a bitterly cold day where the temps dropped into the negative teens, with a howling wind driving the wind chill index <em>much</em> lower. I took a chance of making the short walk from the office lobby to my car after work without any ear protection. Big mistake. By the time I got into my car, the bitterly cold air had penetrated into my inner ear, causing extreme pain and an almost complete loss of my sense of balance. The resulting nausea almost caused me to throw up in the car; I had to use both arms to "anchor" my head to the headrest until my sense of balace returned. It was not a pleasant experience.</p>
