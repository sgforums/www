I've only been here about 3 years and she's visited twice. She likes it here cause it's warmer than SFO but I have to drive her everywhere. She's getting older and I worry about her well being.

              <p>Changes come fast and furious to Singapore. The skyline has been dramatically altered within the last few years, and there's no shortage of new construction projects, especially condos. I'm actually beginning to believe that 6 million people in Singapore by 2020 might actually be feasible.</p>
              <p>We've been eating out almost everyday, and I'm frankly a bit tired of the local fare already.</p>
