              <p>on the same note, a week ago, we made an offer on a house but our offer was ignored (it wasn't a lowball offer but the seller didn't even bother to reply...is that normal???!!)...we upped the offer to the sellers' "price range for consideration" and got rejected....essentially, they wanted the full asking price which we absolutely refused to give to them.</p>
              <p>we were planning to make an offer on another house yesterday and were told by the listing agent that they were gonna sign the P&amp;S agreement that afternoon at the full asking price. we were like ??????!!!!</p>
              <p>so we figured everyone is rushing for the tax credit deadline and offering ridiculously high prices.....we might be better off waiting till after 30 april. i don't believe the housing prices will not drop further with the increase in interest rates....</p>

              <p>Your parents know bout your gun purchase or not ?</p>
              <p>You are not planning on shooting yourself or some kids are you ?</p>
              <p>Soon your gun will be stolen by some crooks and you get hauled to the police station for the crime you didn't do.</p>
              <p>Then you'd realise no girls wanna go out with you.. because date rape at gun points are not uncommon here.</p>
              <p>Gun ownership is a very private thing, you don't go around telling everyone you have a gun.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I think you've just made a mistake with that purchase.</p>
              <p>If you are just too bored or too rich , please volunteer your time and money to local charity or volunteer organisation.</p>
