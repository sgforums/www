              <p>prices of everything seem to be going up, up and up. the freaking bak-kwa is over $40+++/kg now (i thought that's the CNY prices??!!!).</p>
              <p>at least the hawker centres/coffee shops/food court food prices still pretty reasonable....so that's a good thing! i haven't cooked a single meal since i'm back....hee hee....always eat out lor...i live in tiong bahru...havelock and tiong bahru mkt and many other good food places all within easy reach.</p>
              <p>i'll be here for another 3.5weeks more....hopefully won't put on weight =P </p>

              <p>It has been pretty quiet in here, but I think that is perhaps due to people being out and about enjoying the summer and not having time to post. I know I've been "guilty" of that.</p>

              <p>Hi all, it's been a while. Hope everyone is well and doing fine.</p>
              <p>LIT: Thanks for asking. It's been a cooler than usual summer for us in SoCal. Mildest it's been for 3 decades (I think that's what the media said). Aside from the hassle of the move and everything associated with that, it's been all right. Kids are settling into their routine at their new school, I've been getting more hours at work (which I dislike), etc.</p>
              <p>The house, well, it's been keeping me super duper busy.Mum came for a short visit, I painted the entire exterior of the house, dug up the dirt in the entire back yard, planted grass from seed, decimated the bamboo forest planted by years ago, etc etc, Too much to go on, don't want to bore you with details. :P</p>
              <p>Hope your Sg hols went great. How are things with you?</p>

              <p>Ugh. What a depressing thought. I actually like fall but quiver at the notion of what lies thereafter.</p>
              <p>On a slightly brighter note, I'll be leaving for Montana this Thursday to go prairie dog hunting with a couple of friends. </p>

              <p><br>Funny you mentioned the rain, as we got hit by a very strong line of thunderstorms early yesterday morning too. Woke up at around 12:30 a.m. to the sound of howling wind and torrential rain, but it was mostly over by the time of the morning commute.</p>
              <p>Thanks! I've no doubt about enjoying the p-dog hunting trip--it's just the 11-hour drive there and back that makes it tiring. I'll post pictures once I get back!</p>

              <p>Prarie dogs or Richardson's squirrels? The squirrels, my cousins call them gophers, run rampant on their farms. If you guys kill less than 500 of them(gophers) in a weekend you weren't really trying.</p>
              <p>Gonna be using a .22 or .17 cal? Anything bigger would be overkill....unless you're honing your sniping skills.</p>
              <p>I have a couple photos I took of 'gophers' that got in the way of a .22 that I won't share here.</p>
              <p>These are what they shoot pretty much every day on the farm in eastern Montana:</p>

              <p><br>skid,</p>
              <p>Here's a link to my picture thread from our last p-dog hunting trip to Montana in  2009:</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/2163/topics/377320">2009 Montana p-dog trip</a></p>
              <p>I believe the species we were hunting was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-tailed_Prairie_Dog">black tailed prairie dog</a>. At least, they certainly looked like the one pictured in the Wiki article.</p>
              <p>The three of us will be using essentially the same guns this time round: I'll be shooting my usual AR varmint rifle with a 24" barrel, Dave will be using both a 20" AR varmint rifle <em>and</em> a Ruger .204 bolt-action, and Bob is bringing his 20" AR.</p>
              <p>Whereabouts in eastern Montana are your cousins located? We'll be staying in Glendive and shooting on BLM land just outside Terry.</p>

              <p>They're in Lustre, Montana which is about 3 hrs northwest of Glendive. The closest actual town to Lustre would be Wolf Point.</p>
              <p>Nice photos from the previous hunt. The scenery could be from Lustre, it looks exactly the same.</p>
              <p>Hope you have good weather....they've already had snowfall in Lustre this month.</p>
