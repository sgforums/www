              <p>Speaking of mold...My Niece's fiance bought a house in Sacramento that has a mold problem.</p>
              <p>The former owners knew about it and didn't disclose the problem. He knows they knew because he learned they had sued the builders and won a settlement, along with other homeowners in the development.</p>
              <p>He found it(mold) because a leaking window that was never fixed caused him to have to pull up carpeting, and surprise...mold.</p>
              <p>So now he's suing the former owners, the house inspector, and anyone else he can get a nickel out of.....like they say, buyer beware!</p>

              <p>Yes, he pm'ed me a couple of months ago and informed me of his pending arrival and short stay here. He says that he's secured housing, a short bicycle ride from campus. I told him that I'd be happy to show him around what little I know of the county. You probably know more. Give me suggestions?</p>

              <p>I only tip service people every Christmas. I'm not a big tipper. I only give $10 to the sanitation guy, the newspaper carrier, the mailman and the yard guy. I don't tip for one-off jobs. </p>

              <p>It's Sunday, what are you guys up to? I'm taking the neighbours out for a dim sum lunch. The first time I took them, they were baffled at the whole thing but they loved it. This is the 4th time I'm taking them.</p>
              <p>I also found a nice ramen shop run by Japanese. Too bad I stumbled on it, four years after moving here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Then I found a Daiso! Hallelujah! The next thing I want to find is a good Indian supermarket. Hope I'm not asking too much.</p>

              <p>Guess what, guess what, guess what? I found three places we used to visit when we lived in Japan!!!!</p>
              <p>Firstly, found a nice Japanese supermarket called Mitsuwa . Inside it was a dirty dish store and a small store selling this and that - things that we used to enjoy browsing through. Best of all, there's a small food court by the check out stands. No guesses as to where we'll be hitting the next time we eat out. </p>
              <p>Then we found Book-Off! This is a second book store that's really well laid out and organised. </p>
              <p>Lost: there are many Indian restaurants here, especially downtown. Most of them are buffet eateries. I've sampled at least three places but none I enjoy enough to head back. So I'm still on the hunt for one. </p>
              <p>The problem with having lived in so many cities and different countries, is being a rolling stone, gathering no moss. With our latest discoveries, I guess living here has become a little more bearable. </p>

              <p>You're preaching to the choir. As Singaporeans, most of us are used to having things within easy reach. Here you need a car like you need your liver. I live in a small town and it's bugging the heck outta me. I'm a city girl and cannot stand living anywhere too far from the hustle and bustle of a concrete jungle.  Unfortunately, in America, the closer to the heart of the city you live brings on more problems. Like the lack of available parking and living on top of each other. I have vowed to never live on top of or below anyone ever again. Apartments here aren't built with solid concrete walls so it's possible to hear your neighbours. No more of that nonsense for me. </p>
              <p>CA property tax here is high. It's based on the buying price so you get the picture. With falling property prices, one can submit to have your property tax lowered. I'm happy I did it. Every little bit helps. </p>
              <p>I know you're dying to become a homeowner but it's not all that great you know. I don't know how long you'll be stateside, whether you'll be here forever but I know I will be so homeownership was inevitable for us. </p>
