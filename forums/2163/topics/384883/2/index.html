              <p>hey...me city gal too!!! =P talking about driving, i finally went to take my learner's permit test and passed. can't believe it's so easy here...only 25 MCQ! have been driving around town for practice. i thought i'd have difficulties adjusting to the left hand drive....but it ain't too bad actually. aim to take my practical test within the next couple of months.....</p>
              <p>while i'm quite interested to buy a house...i'm pretty hesitant as well. my spouse is the one who's more set on buying...and he has been actively looking around. i think he's very keen to stay here for good...but the main concern is his job...whether or not they'd extend his contract into a long term one.</p>
              <p>but meanwhile...we are sticking to a very short investment horizon of just 3yrs. so pricing has to be very good value for money and at a budget that we are very comfortable with keeping it beyond 3yrs if we can't sell it without incurring a loss.</p>
              <p>anyway...i told my spouse that if got really good deal than buy...if not, just forget it and rent. so we'll just work on that basis.</p>

              <p>Hope you sell lots and lots but be prepared if you don't. Being a crafter is a hit and miss affair. So don't make too many. When I taught preschool, we'd make glove puppets as Christmas ornaments.</p>

              <p>If and when you do get a machine, do your homework first. Ask yourself what you'd like the machine to do for you. Since I'm on the machine almost everyday, the machine I've had for the past almost 15 years just wasn't doing it for me. I'm now on my fifth machine. I have dedicated machines for certain tasks. Also, you may want to click on www.etsy.com. It's a site for crafters. Check out what you'd think may sell. Have fun and good luck. </p>

              <p>Don't be disheartened. I know it's difficult but if you think along the mindset that you're not in Kansas anymore, it'll be easier on you. My guess is that you haven't built up enough of a credit history for those institutions to know how responsible you guys are, financially. Give it about a year. Pay all your bills on time, etc and soon enough you'll have a clean credit history. But remember, you each have establish your own credit history. You can't ride on your hubby's since each person's history is judged separately. Since you don't have a job right now, it's hard to do that. Make sure you have an ITIN first. Tax time is already here. Deadline for filing is April 15. Since this will be your first time, hire a tax person to assist and guide you. JHMO. If you would prefer to talk over the phone, let me know? I can always pm you my phone number. </p>
              <p>In the interim, please don't go applying for credit again. This only hurts your credit. The more you apply for and get rejected, the more red flags on your credit report, the more red flags, the more rejections, the lower your credit score. It's a vicious cycle. If you really want to know your current credit score, you can pay to find out on www.annualcreditreport.com. Scores between the 750 and 850 range is what you should strive for. You'll enjoy lower interest rates on credit cards, loans, etc. Which is fair if you ask me. Unlike in Sg, where everyone pays the same interest rate on credit cards. (I could be wrong since I've been away a long time.)</p>
              <p>Re: commercial machines. I have one, by sheer chance. It has a walking foot which I l was looking for.  A crafter I know sold her almost new one to me. I've had it for almost a year now and I have yet to touch it. (note to self: touch said machine). That thing is so powerful!</p>

              <p>You don't need the help from any bank to get an ITIN. Try going to www.ssa.gov and see where that takes you? </p>
              <p>CCs are important here in the States. Without one, you can't make a room reservation, car rental reservation.... No matter what, you really really need to establish a credit history. Go to www.experian.com and see if there is any advice on how to get started? Good luck.  We're here if you need help.</p>

              <p>You don't need the help from any bank to get an ITIN. Try going to www.ssa.gov and see where that takes you? </p>
              <p>CCs are important here in the States. Without one, you can't make a room reservation, car rental reservation.... No matter what, you really really need to establish a credit history. Go to www.experian.com and see if there is any advice on how to get started? Good luck.  We're here if you need help.</p>
              <p>And in other news... oops I did it again. I'm back at Sears starting mid January. Wish me luck and a boot to the head.</p>

              <p>about the credit card....actually i've had no issues using my debit card for all the reservations, online payment etc as i can pay by either debit or credit....so do i still need a credit card in that sense? it's not like i need to get a loan or something in future. i suppose i can go apply for one of those poor credit history card but i'm just not too happy about the fees that i have to pay to get one of those.</p>
              <p>ohhhh....u r going back to sears!! congrats!! let us know in advance of any huge discounts. hee hee...i'm looking for a microwave and sewing machine.</p>
              <p>ya...i know...one way to obtain the ITIN is to get the bank to write a note....at least they do the work not me....but the damn bank is just so damn non-responsive. think we are gonna move our money somewhere else soon...their loss not ours. so i'll have to obtain the ITIN via another way....</p>

              <p>You never know what the future holds since you say you'll be here a while. Fees are inevitable. Welcome to America. Since you bank with a credit union, start there. Forget regular banks. Their fees are way too high. Before you move your cash to another institution, have a sit down with Customer Service first. Tell them you'll do it only if they help you get an ITIN.

Ask to see their identification and their badge<br>before answering their questions. However, you should never invite<br>anyone you don't know into your home.<br><br>- Census workers are currently only knocking on doors to verify<br>address information. Do not give your Social Security number, credit<br>card or banking information to anyone, even if they claim they need it<br>for the U.S. Census.<br><br>- REMEMBER, NO MATTER WHAT THEY ASK, YOU REALLY ONLY NEED TO TELL<br>THEM HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE AT YOUR ADDRESS.<br><br>- While the Census Bureau might ask for basic financial<br>information, such as a salary range, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANYTHING<br>AT ALL ABOUT YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION.

Eventually, Census<br>workers may contact you by telephone, mail, or in person at home.<br>However, the Census Bureau will not contact you by Email, so be on the<br>lookout for Email scams impersonating the Census.<br><br>- Never click on a link or open any attachments in an email that<br>are supposedly from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

              <p>This happens all the time. Not just with this exercise. Scammers are always on the hunt. You never know when so, always shred unwanted correspondence with your name and address on it, never put your SSN on your checks, never have your SSN on your driver's license, etc, etc. ID theft is very real and growing.</p>

              <p>What type(s) of games? Are they graphics intensive?</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt the current generation of <strong>net</strong>books have the horsepower to run graphics intensive applications and games since they give up power for portability, but some of the higher-end <strong>note</strong>books and laptops, especially those touted as desktop replacements, should be able to handle gaming applications.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Funny you should ask. I was just at Best Buy. They have a free magazine which I was leafing through. One of the articles was on netbooks and gaming. They say that netbooks aren't made for gaming. Do you have a Best Buy in Canada? I bought a cheapie Acer lappie for gaming several months ago. Only cost me $298!</p></div>
