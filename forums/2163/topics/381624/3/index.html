              <p>the bigger mall have okay sales like jetta mention most of the 75% + 40% are older styles which i can understand. But the boutique stores are more aggressive at 50% for all.</p>
              <p>I was eyeing on an Eddie Bauer Sun Block shirt for 1 years.....and finally the price came down by 50%.....That price stayed for 1 years its not going down till this friday I got the last pcs of my size.</p>

              <p>Was I complaining? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> I was a snug bug. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Hibernated the entire day. Bliss! We need more rain though. Everything unlandscaped is so bone dry. Any plans to for a Christmas getaway? We're still thinking about going inner tubing at Big Bear. Looked fun as we drove by the park last year. After our dismal and aborted attempt at snowboarding and skiing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Hit the base yesterday. They mail out a scratcher card six times a year. Depending on your luck and which covered spot you scratch, you can get anywhere from 5% to 50% off your purchases for the day. They've refined their mechanics. Before, you just scratched the one circle and enjoyed the discount for the rest of the day. Those who hit the lucky 50% savings would buy computers, furniture, appliances. I guess the exchange was losing money that way. Which explains why the scratcher card now has three covered circles. Each time you shop you scratch one circle. How unlucky we were - three 5% circles. Haiz!</p>
