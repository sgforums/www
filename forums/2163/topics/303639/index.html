            <div class='col-md body'>I usually don't pay too much attention to these. But this news has gone to all major news paper including washington post, USA today.   major TV network like CNN , ABC CBS and since it reported more than 1 county.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>UFO Sightings in Stephenville, Texas<br>More Than 30 People Insist They Saw a UFO Flying Over Their Town<br>Dozens of people in a small Texas town are talking about an unexpected visitor, but the question is, where did it come from?<br>The residents of Stephenville, Texas, claim to have seen a UFO, described as a mile-wide, silent object with bright lights, flying low and fast. So what was it?<br>These are not headlines from a supermarket tabloid. This is actual front-page news.<br>More than 30 residents insist they saw the unthinkable a gigantic UFO.<br>"It was very intense, bright lights," said local newspaper reporter Angela Joyner.<br>"The lights were like going like this," said Constable Leroy Gateman making hand gestures to describe what he saw when he spotted the UFO.<br>Rick Sorrells says he saw it while he was hunting deer in the woods.<br>"You look at the trees, and it was right here," Sorrells told ABC News correspondent Mike Von Fremd as he showed him the location in the woods where he spotted the UFO.<br>Steve Allen, a 50-year-old pilot, was at a campfire with friends and says the object was a mile long and half a mile wide. "I don't know if it was a biblical experience or somebody from a different universe or whatever but it was definitely not from around these parts," Allen said.<br>Allen drew a sketch of the object, which he said traveled at amazing speed without making a sound. While drawing, Allen told Von Fremd that he saw "an arch shape converted in a vertical shape, and then it split and made two of them, and then these turned into just fire and it was gone."<br>A spokesman for the 301st Fighter Wing in Fort Worth says no aircraft from his base was in the area, and says the objects may have been an illusion caused by two commercial airplanes. But those who saw the lights don't buy that explanation.<br>"It's an unidentified flying object," insisted a former Air Force technician.<br>"It was so fast I couldn't track it with my binoculars," said Gateman. </blockquote></div>
