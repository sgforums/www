The Harris fire (the first one) was started by a downed power pole. Downed by strong Santa Ana winds. Another fire was started by a car with a broken transmission, on the side of a road. There were sparks and that started a fire. San Diego county is a very dry place. We're supposed to start our rainy season soon. Aside from that, it hardly rains here. The joke is, because it hardly rains here, when it does, people don't know what to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
