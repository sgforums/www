              <p>I got mine at 17 in Sg. When I got married and we got stationed in Japan, I had to retake it so that I was kosher to drive on and off base. Then when we moved to Hawaii, I had to retake it. Then we moved back to Japan and I had to take it again. Then we moved here and since my Hawaii license was still kosher, all I had to do was get it renewed. Whew!</p>

              <p>Yah, that many times. Having to drive on the left side of the road in Sg and Japan, then on the right in Hawaii, then back on the left in Japan and finally on the right again, took practise and patience. When we arrived in Seattle and picked up my Subaru, I didn't dare drive. I just couldn't jump back into the swing of things just like that. So during the drive from Seattle to San Diego, my father in law had to tag along. I wasn't the first one to baptise my brand new car, he was. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> </p>
              <p>I had a Legacy too! My father in law gave it to us because he bought a Dodge Ram. He really ran that Legacy into the ground but it served us well.</p>

              <p><br>I got my license in Singapore, and obtained a US license right after I got here to attend college. As I recall, the written portion of the test was just a series of very easy multiple choice questions, and the driving portion comprised one trip around the block with the examiner. The parallel parking part was what caused a lot of license applicants to fail the driving test--which frankly surprised me as the space allowed for the maneuver was nearly twice what I was used to in Singapore!</p>
              <p>Minnesota drivers are, for the most part, sane, except just after the first snowfall/hard freeze of the season, when a significant number of those driving SUVs think their vehicles are immune to the laws of physics and end up skidding off the road due to excessive speed.</p>

              <p>Me too. hence I did not get the E65 when it came out... still the E65 does drive very well, test drove a 740i Sport for a day.</p>
              <p>On another note... my fan belt just snapped left me stranded in the hills for around 2 hours. My water pump also gave up the ghost. The strange thing is that I had two BMW dealerships check the car over and a BMW specialist and they all missed the problems... hmmm.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>Me too. hence I did not get the E65 when it came out... still
              the E65 does drive very well, test drove a 740i Sport for a
              day.</p>
              <p>On another note... my fan belt just snapped left me stranded in
              the hills for around 2 hours. My water pump also gave up the ghost.
              The strange thing is that I had two BMW dealerships check the car
              over and a BMW specialist and they all missed the problems...
              hmmm.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>The E38 is still the charm. The E65 lacks the driver/car connection. In fact all new BMWs are like that now.</p>
              <p>A good tech should predict when certain parts should fail. I picked up a few tips from a couple of friends who have indie BMW shops plus my own experiences from racing one. If you changed your water pump, plan on replacing the thermostat, expansion tank as well. Also the radiator hoses. Quality of belts can be checked to see if there are cracks. FYI, I never follow the miles to replace parts. Driving habit differs and that affects when parts fail. Also, alternator tends to go out on BMWs as well.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is still a charm, the thermostat was replaced last year on warranty. No sure about the expansion tank. The radiator was also done last year, including hoses, thanks for the heads up.</p>
              <p>You race BMWs? What do you race? any suggestions on improving the performance of my e38? what would you suggest? Trying to gather information, but no many tune a 7 series...</p>
