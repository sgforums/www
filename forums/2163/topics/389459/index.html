              <p>Yesterday, 2 Singaporeans were killed and 4 injured in a car accident during their road trip from Great Ocean Road to the Grampians.  What a tragedy!</p>
              <p><img src="http://images.theage.com.au/2010/01/29/1076088/st_crash-420x0.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="300"></p>
              <p>Please guys, drive carefully and allow more time to travel instead of trying to squeeze everything in one day.  Australia is a huge place and it takes longer to travel from one place to another than expected.  Use<a href="http://www.whereis.com"></a> <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/">http://maps.google.com.au/</a>  or <a href="http://www.whereis.com">http://www.whereis.com</a> to plan your trip and add 30 min on top of the calculated time shown on Google map or whereis.</p>
              <p>For full news report of the accident, click <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/warning-on-long-road-trips-after-tourists-die-20100128-n1pv.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p>My heart goes out to the family who lost their loved one in this accident.</p>

              <p>I believe you're referring to <em>cruise control</em>, which maintains a set speed without your having to keep your foot on the accelerator pedal. Cruise control doesn't steer the vehicle for you, though.</p>

              <p>People might think it's only 250km away, if they do 100km/h, you should be able to get to the destination in 2 hours and a bit.</p>

              <p>this is a crosswind.. it hits the side of your car and it actually pushes your car sideways even when you're driving straight.. you have to compensate...</p>
              <p>we do not experience that here in Singapore.. so most drivers don't know how to deal with such things...</p>
              <p>then there's stuff like fog, dirt roads, icy roads, the lack of street lighting.. and the biggest killer of all, fatigue...</p>

              <p>1) They are driving a car that they are not used to. Usually people start their driving hoilday right away on their rental car, did not get enough time to be familiar with it first.</p>
              <p>2) Poor planning - people do not calculate the time they need correctly. They just blindly measure the distance. They did not consider the type of road, and take into consideration that they stop a lot to take photo and explore things. Thus they under estimate the time they needed. Also must take note of the day light time, for some countries at certain season - sunset start to set by 4 or 5 p.m</p>
              <p>3) Do homework on road to take. Some road in area like grampians are not really mean for normal travelling. There are some special road that are for slow nature observation.</p>
              <p>4) Some road oversea - can be very straight and have field on both side, esp when it is between 10+ to 3+ with the heat and the light - can lead to driver to be lost concentration and doze off. </p>
              <p>5) Crosswind - usually you can feel it, if you driving on straight road easily. Usually it is curve or turning - which crosswind cause accident .<br>6) Wild animals - kangroos &amp; emu at grampian. Usually they start coming out in sunset. Outback - even have horses and camels.</p>
              <p>One advice is alway put a few days to stay in the city at the end to to use a buffer - so you do not need to rush, the most eat into those days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This way you do not have the need to rush, in victoria - there is place to stay all along the way . that is what is call driving hoilday - drive to where sleep at where and carry on.</p>
