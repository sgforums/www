              <p>Hey fellow wanderers, am in the vincinity of Calgary for a while and I wonder if there are any Singaporeans in Calgary wanting to hookup or something?! Its been a while since I have been back to Singapore and I would like to meet some Singaporeans and maybe eat some proper food for a change.</p>
              <p>The stampede is on in Calgary too so Singaproeans give me a shout!</p>

              <p>no, I was in saskatchewan, but I drive over to edmonton and calgary every now and then .... cos there were no T&amp;T where I was ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>the stampede is a very redneck thing ... it would be interesting only if you like getting leglessly drunk, honky tonk music and buggy races.</p>

              <p>Alberta is very redneck...I think I want to go just to wind the rednecks up. Depends on whether any of my friends wanna go though. NOT venturing into redneck territory alone.</p>
              <p>I have not seen a single black person since I arrived about a week ago. It seems the people here in Med Hat think they are cowboys.</p>
              <p>Are you no longer in Canada then?</p>
              <p>I took a drive to Edmonton the other day... 550km there, 550km back. That impressed upon me how big Canada is. We drove for 6 hours and we were still in Alberta.</p>
              <p><br>Btw, I think Tropika is closed now. How is the Chinatown in Calgary like for authentic food?</p>

              <p>I'm working in Canada. I will be off again round about Dec time so I get to experience a little of the notorious winter.</p>
              <p>So no one in Calgary? I will be in Calgary over the weekend.</p>

              <p>nope, I'm back home now.</p>
              <p>medicine hat eh ... are you in the 
              military by any chance ? there to support maple flag ? I've never been to medicine hat, I usually cross over from lloyldminister much further up north. My fishing mates liked to camp at cypress hills for the trout there though, you may want to take an excursion there. There's also the famous dinosaur park quite near to you as well.</p>
              <p>if I were you I'd give the calgary stampede a miss. Next time you're up in edmonton, edmonton mall is worth a look. Was the largest mall in the world for a while. T&amp;T supermarket would probably be your favourite place from now on.</p>
              <p>There's a malaysian place in edmonton that sold outrageously expensive roti canai, which is just roti prata by another name. The name escapes me at the moment, you may want to dig around.</p>

              <p>Not miitary though I work with the British Army a lot. They have a training area here that is about 5 times the size of Singapore, or about half the size of Brunei, or just larger than Luxembourg. In short, the training area is MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASIVE.  Took a little trip into the training area the other day and I was in awe of how serious the training is here. They can lob 155mm arty shells at each other here for real. They've got MBTs and loads of other armor here. It is fan-freaking-tastic.  The SAF would kill for such a training area I tell you...</p>
              <p>Not sure the troops on the ground think the same though. The mozzies are like nothing I've ever experienced.  Like every other able(-ish) bodied male, I did the whole Tekong thing in the Infantry. I used to think the reclaimed land area in Tekong is Mozzie paradies. Until I came here. The Mozzies here comes in swarms. I would not like to do an exercise here.</p>

              <p>haha, yeah, the summer mozzies are terrible.</p>
              <p>the SAF do find their way up there too, at cold lake and moose jaw. Ex Maple Flag. There were a bunch of young chaps running around in my part of the boonies spouting singlish, they were NS boys on R&amp;R.</p>
              <p>trust me, T&amp;T would be your favourite place. It's an asian supermarket chain. And they sell freaking nearly everything that asians eat. You can get authentic meat and char siew baos there, pork floss buns like bread talk, authentic roast duck and char siew siew bak, all your instant noodles from maggi to indomee to nong sim, and a whole lot more you've never seen before. You can stock up on cans of braised pork trotters etc etc, laksa mixes, authentic curry powder etc etc. You can get fresh sushi, sashimi, tako balls, and weird stuff like duck's tongues and baby octopus and jellyfish if you're lucky that day. They have branches in vancouver, calgary and edmonton.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but then it's good to experience the local culture to the full lah ... I loved fishing and the outdoors there, and I stopped by a lot of one street towns right in the boondocks where things seemed to be still stuck in the 70s and an asian face is a wonder. You can order those burgers and onion rings and waffles and biscuits and gravy and root beer kind of stuff. it's quite interesting.</p>
              <p>oh, and regardless of what they say, kokanee is still the best beer.</p>

              <p>Just got back from Calgary.  Went to the Stampede. I think you were right. It is just a big fair. It was pissing down, so I didn't bother going to see the rodeos etc. Just wanderd around the fair with a mate. The fair was really nothing special but the women... OH MY GAWD... the women. In Boots. And denim shorts. And cowgirl hats. Man - are canadian women beautiful.</p>
              <p>There was one bar within the fair itself, so we went to get a beer. Two cups of Coors Light cost us C$15!!! We left after just one drink each. However, I think I ought to reiterate that the women in the bar were stunning. It was just hot women after hot women?! Maybe it is the boots. </p>
              <p>So, off we went, and after some gentle interrogation, a local gave us the name of a street - 17th Ave - and several bars. So on our jaunty way we went. The Yardhouse is the first of many planned stops. "Planned" being the operative word, and you know what they say about plans...</p>
              <p>The Yardhouse - Food was so so, the beer is ok, the women are hot. The waitresses are hot. We spent several hours in there before decinding to leave. The bill came to about C$80 for 2 blokes - one a heavy drinker, the other (me) not so much.</p>
              <p>We ended up in a Club that was supposed to be rough (and full of wild women). I dunno why the taxi driver described it like it was supposed to put us off...but his short description was enough to make it a must go.</p>
              <p>The Club Is Awesome. Canadian Women Are Hot.The Music Is Great. The Drinks aren't too expensive.</p>
              <p>What more can 2 blokes want on a night out?</p>
              <p>None of us pulled but that is my fault. I need a lot more practice...</p>
              <p>So to summarize Calgary:</p>
              <p>Stampede - meh.</p>
              <p>17 Ave - Yeah</p>
              <p>Sorry no pics at this time. Maybe next time...</p>
