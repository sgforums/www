              <p>I had submitted my resume to a famous British betting firm based in Stoke, England and the employment is subjected to my availability to work in Stoke. The one-way trip by air will be paid for but housing and accomodation will be on my own. </p>
              <p>I would love to work in a beautiful place in Europe especially where everyone speaks English like England. Of course I'm a huge football fan and I will get a chance to attend big Premier League and European matches! The nice weather and taking occasional road trips to France or Italy! There are so many things I love about Europe!</p>
              <p>However, I still have no idea how much money I need in order to settle down in the UK, what kind of procedures I must go through and what to expect working and living in England especially for a Singaporean(costs of living included). </p>
              <p>I need to know various details before I accept their job offer. Thanks for your answers!</p>

              <p>if its technician ...then its ok.its a safe job.just dont do the same job as an uneducated gang member no matter how well they are dressed.or if they try to con u by giving u a technician job but end up u help out the gangsters do their dirty jobs...then....no point you even werk there,,by then its already too late n they probably wont let u go without killing u.</p>
              <p>its a gambling house or betting house.they bet on $$$$$ without doing anything!!!what sort of people do u expect to be your supervisor??its obvious the guy at the top supervising u wont be a masters degree or even be an o level holder.its not a job in a factory or high tech place where everyone have an educated mindset.in places like these betting house...they would do anything for anyones nickels n dimes.</p>
              <p>go build a business.....if u want real $$$.u not going to get much working in places like those.</p>

According to that theory, the education of laborers, is not only useless, but pernicious, and dangerous. In fact, it is, in some sort, deemed a misfortune that laborers should have heads at all.
