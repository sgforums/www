              <p>Ceramic tiles are okay for the bathroom floor. The gap you're talking about is the grout line. I'm not a fan of wide grout lines. No, they still make 10x10s and I don't mind using it in the bathroom as long as they come in tasteful colours. </p>
              <p>So, did everyone eat their fill and more? I didn't make too much so we're already done with leftovers. </p>

              <p>we're ok i guess.....there's nothing much to do around here...my town is quite dead in the winter months. shops are starting to close for the winter too. the only year round residents are ourselves and a handful of 70 year olds..&amp; turkeys, racoons, rabbits, squirrels, deers, foxes &amp; many many birds....hahaha</p>
              <p>we've been driving around quite a bit to explore new places i.e. rhode island, new hampshire, berkshires etc. and am now wondering where to go and what to do during winter?</p>
              <p>no sign of snow yet...but it's getting chilly. we are down to the 30-40s now. was actually planning to go back to singapore in jan to avoid the cold...but looks like we may stay just to live through our first winter to see how it's like.</p>
              <p>still not really sure what to do with the snow. neighbour said our clamshell paved driveway is a nightmare to shovel - by hand or with machine. so we are wondering if we should park the vehicle on the road instead.  </p>

              <p>Sounds like you guys have rented a nice place. Also sounds like hell to heat. You're a braver soul than I could ever be. It reminds me of when I lived in Japan. The house was so old and so cold, my liquid detergent froze solid. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

              <p>Is your driveway inclined? Shovel/snowblow it as best you can, then spread a thin layer of sand on the driveway to provide traction for your vehicle <em>and</em> pedestrians walking on your driveway.</p>
              <p>If your driveway has a dark surface, clear enough snow to expose <em>some</em> of the surface. The exposed portion will absorb the heat from the sun and gradually melt most if not all of the snow from the remainder of the driveway.</p>
              <p>Before you decide to keep your car parked on the road, check with your local ordinances about when you need to keep your street clear of parked vehicles for snowplowing. You might get ticketed if you fail to do so.</p>

              <p>oh wow....sounds like farmland to me.  hehehehe~~~  well, i have lived in a town with a population of only 6,000 before so i know what you mean.  yeah, it is getting chilly but still single digit and by toronto's standard....nice...hehehehe.....  do u ski?  u can go up north to vermont? good idea to stick it out your first winter.  given a lovely november, weathermen said we may get whacky winter.  oh no.  how much do u have to shovel?  just the driveway?  for us, 'cos we are the end unit, we have to shovel the sidewalk too. but we have a snow blower.  that helps.  but i guess it won't work on your driveway.  bundle up and enjoy the weather.  somebody told me "it's not that that it's too cold, it's about one being under-dressed." ;-)</p>

              <p><br>I think both of you did the right thing by staying put cause you need to really get down and get used to the weather.</p>
              <p>I was in Adams for a week during the snowing weather and my friend had a Jeep with a snow shovel attached. That helps to level the snow in his driveway. There are grey fox and coy dog, rabbits and Turkey wonder into his land.</p>
              <p>Since you are on rented property there aren't much you can modify. Just insulated well very soon this winter will be over. </p>

              <p>Once you get your license, to quote Dr Seuss, oh the places you'll go! Even more so you shouldn't buy a house yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> Get your wings first, jmho. </p>
              <p>Drafty windows are terrible. Head for the Home Depot and get insulation. Comes in a long roll of varying lengths. Insulate your outlets too (I may have already given you this tip. If I have, pardon me.) Get drapes with blackout fabric/insulation. </p>
              <p>I also am bundled well. Don't don cotton, this doesn't help fend off the cold. I'm always in knee high socks and thermals (I like the silk variety) when it gets too cold. Kohl's has a good sale on knee highs right now. </p>
              <p>Oh and I called my friend in RI. She is in the midst of a move to Texas and will share with me later. </p>
