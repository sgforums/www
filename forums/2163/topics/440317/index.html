              <p>Hi friends, does anyone have experience?</p>
              <p>My son was born in Singapore and he had China citizenship at that time. </p>
              <p>When he was 7 years old, he got his Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p>Then we migrated to Australia when he was 9year+ old.</p>
              <p>Now he is going to turn 13.</p>
              <p>We intend to get him Australia citizenship next year.</p>
              <p>Do I need to apply "exit permit" for him? Can he renounce<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 26px;"> </span></span>his Singapore citizenship?</p>
              <p>Anyone knows? Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>Beyond the age of 11, he will not be allowed to renouce his singapore citizenship until he completed his military service. He can choose not to turn up for military service, but then he will get black listed, and if he ever land upon singapore soil, he will be arrested as a defaulter.</p>

              <p>The story about "blacklisting" or whatever, is not relevant to your family at all. The reason why it is hard to take up SG citizenship again is because NOW we are having at least 1.5 million foreign talents trying to be Singapore permant residents alone. Even more trying to be converted from PR to Singaporeans. </p>

              <p>its there in the army orders n laws.just look for it.i dont think your son would be able to work in singapore without first spending a few years in a military prison.many people like him all ended up in prison instantly upon landing at changi airport.he can not go back to spore anymore.in fact he cant even keep his spore passport.spore is more strict than china in this area.if your son needs to go back to spore to work once he has an aussie degree,high chance he will still be jailed for a few years.some from europe some from phillippines..etc etc..the list goes on.</p>
              <p>the army  logic is for them to make and control.since when did any army need to really explain their logic in any decision to anyone?your son will not be able to come back to singapore anymore even for a short 1 day tour.if your son due to anyones fault didnt know those laws,he will still be jailed for a few years in a small dark prison....probably naked.even if he changed his name,he could be traced from his foreign passport.think u can forget about landing in spore.its not logical.yes.you can try to email to the immigration department in singapore.</p>

              <p>actually i think u could also have  unknowingly broken another army law for minors.dont u need to pay a bond of like $60,000 to the army b4 you left spore for australia like most of the people who sent their sons overseas?i know it all pretty sounds strange with this type of laws.i find it strange too.</p>
              <p>breaking an army law be it as a kid is not forgivable to the army.unless they have a dual citizenship law in spore soon and a relaxation in national service punishment laws.i think he can come into spore on a transit which means he dont need to check out of immigration counter and wait for next plane to his next destination.</p>
              <p>living with that is hard as in a death mark on his head.this is an imperfect world we live in.</p>

              <p>The "age 11 rule" applies if you are in Singapore and are going to leave Singapore. Within the territory of Singapore, you may not renounce Singapore citizenship beyond the age of 11.</p>
              <p>If you are overseas, how can you expect Singapore jurisdiction to apply? Simply go to the Singapore embassy nearest you, fill up a form and get rid of it once and for all. Many have done so and will continue to do so, it takes mere minutes. This applies at any age.</p>
              <p>Your main concern is having citizenship or right of residence in Australia or your chosen country of residence, otherwise you will be stateless.</p>
