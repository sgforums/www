              <p>I think coming from SG and returning back to SG does have some adjustment to do and accept its environment. But over time you can adjust to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personnally i find that both age and career level is a serious consideration from settling to different countries. Why don't you considered You n your hubby age, career level. And ask yourself if after 4 to 6 yrs down road you decided that going back to Aust is a better choice. Do you still have time to swing it around and start all over again and not have to gave up too much. There is always a trade off. Good luck.     </p>

              <p>Well, I was thinking of doing nursing, when I saw my dad on his deathbed in a private hospital in S'pore, full of foreign talents, and not being able to communicate properly with him. Seriously, I think SGH was so much better as compared to those expensive private hospital. I was surfing the internet for getting started in a nursing course. But I am totally lost and do not know where to start. Do I start with a cewrt in Nursing?</p>

              <p>nursing in sg you need hospital to sponsor. Hospital sponsor they look at your age.  if not you pay on your own.</p>

Hubby is an accountant, so should be quite mobile. Me in marcom has limited career span. That's why I was thinking that I will work full time in S'pore, and take up Nursing Dip part time.

              <p>What's the chance for you to get  your mum to travel between Singapore and Australia (like stay here for up to 3 months) if she doesn't want to live here for good?</p>
              <p>While I understand your good intention of looking after your mum, you need to learn to let your siblings over in Singapore to share the responsibility.  It makes little difference when you go home as you'll be working most days.</p>

              <p>Instead of just moving back to Singapore for good, you can always take sometime off to go home to be with your mum.</p>

              <p>yet in Adelaide, one can enjoy great wineries and the wonderful countryside with quaint cafes just 45min away from the city, can't do that in Sg. Plus produce is so much cheaper and fresher. There are spots where one can hang out late the whole night and feel secure... at home or at a friends place... LOL!</p>

              <p>Hi Honeymouse, thanx. My mum would not want to leave my two brothers alone. In fact one of my brothers gave up a very good job in Mel to relocate back. (He has another good job in S'pore, so no loss for him). However, my mum always come back to an empty house and have dinner alone. And she is more dependent on me to get things done. I have to call a few times daily. When I ask her why she cannot get either of my bros to do things, she will said, "cannot depend on them, they MIA". grrrr.</p>
              <p>Between last June till now, I had flown back to S'pore 6 times.. Luckily I have a great boss. I resign from my job, but boss and director said they will take it that I will be coming back someday...big???</p>
              <p>My hubby is very understanding. Told me to go. He said in life, when we have to do something, we have to. He will be joining me once he completes his CPA program. </p>
              <p>I feel kind of sad to leave Mel, and was delaying my trip back. But, when mum called and complained about the state of the house, the paperwork of dad's estate still incomplete for the last 6 months, guess I have no choice. She said, "when you come back, you settle everything hor"....I dun have the heart to tell her, I am sad to leave Mel. </p>
              <p>Maybe, I will take ur advice and spend some time there and see how things go.</p>

              <p>I feel that your mom doesn't really need you there except for company and to settle a few issues.</p>
              <p>The only reason why she doesn't want to move to Melbourne is because she's bored?  Frankly, you have to think of your future.  It will be hard to expect you to move back to Singapore and be happy if you're accustomed to the lifestyle here.  Boredom can be easily solved, but career, pace of life and employee benefits are things that you really need to consider. </p>
              <p>Your mom has to learn to be independant.  She's playing the "I need you, daughter!" card and making you feel guilty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">  I'd say take a few months to return and be with her, but you do have to consider, in the long run, would you and your husband prefer to live in Melbourne, or in Singapore? </p>
              <p>Thank God my mom is independant.  She and dad are enjoying their semi-retirement and they relish the idea of me being over here so that when I eventually get my own place, they can come and stay with me now and then.  She and dad have foresight too and they are saying stuff like maybe in future, I can help my bro and his family migrate here when life in Singapore becomes unbearable.  And I've told her that when my baby niece grows up, if she wants to, she can come over to Melbourne to study and I'll look after her food and lodging. </p>
              <p>Sometimes, you have to learn to be firm.  It's not that you're being unfilial but you can take care of your mom over here just the same.  She has to consider that you and your husband have your entire lives ahead of you!</p>
              <p>Besides, look around you - there are many Asian grandma's and grandpa's who moved here with their children and they somehow manage to find their own niche here. </p>
              <p>Think about this carefully.  Do you really want to give it all up to return to Singapore?  It's not cheap to move there and back and vice versa.</p>
