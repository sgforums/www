              <p>Mainly because of family. My dad passed away a few months back. And I have started to wonder if I should make the move back for my remaining parent. I am here, but I always worried about her. Though I have other siblings in Singapore,they are hardly home. If I moved back, I might have to take a pay cut, and re-adapt to Singapore working culture.</p>

              <p>If you're serious about doing Nursing, do it in Melbourne.  The training isn't better, and in fact, clinically, the standards of the nursing grads are much poorer than back in Singapore, but as you'll be studying in THEIR Uni, they kinda cut you more slack, in a sense. </p>
              <p>It's definitely much more expensive to study here, but you can HEX it.  Besides, it is so much easier to pass your clinical attachments here.  Nursing stress in Singapore is unbelievable and extremely unreasonable. </p>
              <p>Besides, if your goal is to remain in Melbourne, it makes more sense to train here.</p>

              <p>If you're serious about doing Nursing, do it in Melbourne.  The training isn't better, and in fact, clinically, the standards of the nursing grads are much poorer than back in Singapore, but as you'll be studying in THEIR Uni, they kinda cut you more slack, in a sense. </p>
              <p>It's definitely much more expensive to study here, but you can HEX it.  Besides, it is so much easier to pass your clinical attachments here.  Nursing stress in Singapore is unbelievable and extremely unreasonable. </p>
              <p>Besides, if your goal is to remain in Melbourne, it makes more sense to train here.</p>

              <p>Well, I was thinking of doing nursing, when I saw my dad on his deathbed in a private hospital in S'pore, full of foreign talents, and not being able to communicate properly with him. Seriously, I think SGH was so much better as compared to those expensive private hospital. I was surfing the internet for getting started in a nursing course. But I am totally lost and do not know where to start. Do I start with a cewrt in Nursing?</p>

              <p>Mum is 58. She finds Melbourne boring. The only places she loves here are high maintenance. Crown Casino. Shopping in expensive shopping belts, and Alfresco in Lygon Street (little Italy).  She likes the convenience in S'pore </p>
