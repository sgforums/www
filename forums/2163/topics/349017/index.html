              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm a Singaporean and have been living overseas since I was a child. Recently, I have started working at a firm with a branch in Singapore, so I will be able to come back to Singapore once every two months or so.</p>
              <p>I've been thinking of applying for a driving licence in Singapore, and I am seeking some advice on how I should go about this? Browsed some driving centre websites and I'm aware of the tests and such, but would like to know how I can arrange my future visits to coincide with my driving lesson/test plans.</p>
              <p>Any help or suggestions on possibilities and/or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>The strangest thing,  a friend of mine was recently pulled over by a Singapore Traffic Police.  He was driving his father's car.</p>
              <p>This friend stayed overseas for a long time, and has a Singapore Driving Licence that has been expired 4 years ago.  He holds American Driving Licence though.</p>
              <p>Silly guy showed the TP his sg licence...........and the TP was giving him a lecture, which was totally wrong......</p>
              <p>As long as he has a american driving licence, not staying back in Sg for 6 months.  Then his american PR and american driving licence is use-able in Sg.</p>
              <p>So for your case, you have six months to get a valid Sg driving licence.</p>

              <p>Or, if you mean you have not even a driving licence.  Thats too tricky a situation which I think meant fanciful manipulation of your travel dates.</p>
              <p>You need to return to sg, do the colour blindness test, book for the theory lessons &amp; practical lessons.  Schedule a return to do the tests......</p>
              <p>Or if you were in Japan, then try locating a Chunfu Driving Test centre of sorts, that has links with Singapore's Comfort Ubi Driving School.</p>

              <p>Hi viciouskitty74, thanks for your reply. Yes, I don't have a driving licence currently. Thanks for your suggestions, but no, I'm not in Japan :)</p>
              <p>I will be able to come back as frequent as once a month, would that help? Can you give me an indication generally of what I should do the next time I come back (which is probably going to be in 3 weeks time).</p>
