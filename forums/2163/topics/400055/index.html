              <p>Lots and lots! During that time frame, there is the annual Pullayup fair. The original Pullayup scone is da best! The Walla Walla onion is so sweet, you can eat it like you would an apple. </p>
              <p>Places and venues to experience would be Snoqualmie Falls, this was where Twin Peaks was filmed. It's a really nice hike down to the falls. Woodland Park Zoo is a nice big zoo. Take the Seattle Underground tour for a bit of trivia. We really enjoyed the experience. Sample Ivor's clam chower, really nice, rich and creamy. Alki Point is really pretty. Lots of quaint shops to and restaurants to sit at and look at the people passing by. </p>
              <p>MG has lots more to add, I'm sure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>I was there last week, so here's what I would suggest according to the things that I enjoyed:</p>
              <p>Vancouver - Visit the Aquarium (it has belugas) and the surrounding Stanley Park has great views of the city. Gastown has old buildings, high street stores and a unique steam clock. Take the sea bus across the bay to North Vancouver, walk around Lonsdale Quay market. Walk the Capilano Suspension bridge, see salmon swimming up the ladder in the hatchery and hike the surrounding trails. English Bay is beautiful and you can pose with the inukshuk (piled stone sculpture). If you want more hikes and nature, drive the sea-to-sky highway to Stawamus Chief rock, Shannon Falls or Whistler/Blackcomb mountains. There's another inukshuk up there that was used as the Olympics icon. Oh, you might be able to catch the ice hockey exhibition season in September.</p>
              <p>Seattle - Watch fishmongers toss fish to one another at Pike Place Market, have an Acre of Clams at Ivar's for lunch, do the underground and sub-seattle tours (the guide you get makes or breaks the experience though), go up to the top of the Columbia Tower (cheaper and taller than the Space Needle, which you can see; from 9 - 11am you can see Mt Rainier on a clear day), go on a foodie tour. If you have the time and the interest, the Museum of Flight is worth a look but it's pretty far away. You get to walk through actual Concorde and Air Force One planes.</p>
              <p>I think I have you on FB so you can look at my photos of these things too.</p>

              <p>Thanks guys....  thanks KB.  I will go and have a look at your photos later. </p>
              <p>I don't think we have time to do Seattle...  will spend 6 days in Van then off to Alaska (7 days) and then to Calgary/Banff for 6 days then back to van for 1 night then head home.   Should be good. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Yep, KB....  these places are on the list.</p>
              <p>Do you think it's worth joining a tour to the Whistler, Grouse Mt, Capilano Bridge etc?  We are not going to drive as we will be driving on the different side of the road from what we have used to in Oz......  Don't think it's a good idea especially we are probably still feeling tired from the long haul flight.</p>

              <p>You can take a Greyhound bus to Whistler but it's a 2-hour ride. I joined my relations living there and we drove up.</p>
              <p>You can get a public transport day pass for CAN$9 at 7-Eleven or Mac's (not McDonald's). Take the sea bus from Waterfront Station to Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver and from there, bus no. 236 takes you to Capilano Bridge, the hatchery and Grouse mountain in 30-40 min.</p>
              <p>The bridge, the trails (which lead up to Cleaveland Dam) and the hatchery are worth a visit. They were at our doorstep so it was easy for me. There isn't a great deal to see up on Grouse Mountain at this time of the year aside from the bear and wolf enclosures and a lumberjack show though.</p>
