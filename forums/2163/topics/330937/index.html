              <p>Well Jetta, I'm sure those had been difficult decisions to make. But there's no telling if you would be a high flyer, or at the very least, a happy person if you were to stay.</p>
              <p>And there's no comparison which would be a better decision for us, since we only live once, and once implies that we have no other lifetimes to compare with.</p>
              <p>You should really just keep moving forward and be the best you can be, instead of lamenting the days gone by. Once is nonce, make the best of it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Someone posted this inspirational story a while ago, and I find this topic to be an appropiate place to re-post it. TS, you are probably years ahead of what your high-flier friends have always wanted to achieve in their lives - to retire and enjoy life with their families.</p>
              <p>Maybe you feel that life is incomplete without some sort of great achievements under your name like being "The ex-CEO of The So-And-So Company" - you feel that your life is simply wasted if you were to die 50 years later just like that, no achievements, no anything to your name.</p>
              <p>But little did you realize, if you could nurture your kids to grow up to be great people, you have achieved the best thing any mother on earth could do. Just imagine the day when one of your kids graduates from college, become entrepreneurs and eventually marry a boy/girl - you would be so goddamn proud that your decades of love and care have transformed the cute, little toddler you used to carry in your forearms into such a useful, responsible adult in the society - and achieving as much as you do too. That's why, when parents say that they're always proud of you, they really mean it.</p>

You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the <br>processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise." <br><br>The Mexican fisherman asked, "But, how long will this all take?" <br><br>To which the American replied, "15 to 20 years." <br><br>"But what then?" asked the Mexican. <br><br>The American laughed and said that's the best part. "When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions." <br><br>"Millions?...Then what?" <br><br>The American said, "Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos."</span></td>

              <p>Jetta,</p>
              <p>Being a happy parent is much better than a lonely high flyer, dun u agree?</p>
              <p>Perhaps u used to hav high inspirations before u were married, hence the "what ifs" now..We are always at the cross roads &amp; once we hav decided which route to move on, the other route will always b a mystery.  It's good to ponder about tat mysterious route tat we din take back then...but dun let it gets too much into our head.</p>

              <p>Feeling pensive because I just found some old friends on Facebook. The ones still in Sg are high flyers now as with some overseas. Makes me think, what if...? What if I had decided not to get married and move away? Would I be a high flyer today had I stayed? Can't help but wonder, you know? Compared to my life back then, I haven't achieved anything besides parenthood. Haiz.</p>

              <p>The grass will always look greener on the other side. But when we struggle to get to that other side, and we look back from where we came from, now that good old side's grass look greener. So we ask ourselves, do we cross back??? It'll be an endles cycle.</p>
