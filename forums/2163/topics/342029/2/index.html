              <p><br>Sigh, you dont get it.</p>
              <p>There is no 'May' regards to doing your NS.</p>
              <p>You want to do your foundation year programme in Oz. Must return to Sg to do NS or your parents forfeit the 70 +k for your NS.</p>
              <p>Which also means, you will be arrested at airports for when you dont return for your NS.</p>
              <p>After the army, you work and hopefully get enough $$$ to go back to Oz to start your degree.  You need to check that FYP has expiry dates.  You dont go back to Oz for a few years. You need to do FYP again.  Check your courses you are eligible to take and whats the conditions.</p>
              <p>Fair or not?  Who am I to say.  I didnt do any degrees, and I didnt use any parents money for courses the moment I step out of 'o' levels stage.  Technically, I paid my school fees since Sec 2 because I was working part time then.</p>

              <p>Then what do you intend to do?  Even if you work, it's going to take you a helluva longer than two years to get the collateral you need for the loan in the first place.</p>
              <p>To be blunt, if you're so desperate to get out of Sungapore as it is, pardon me if I take your assurances of returning to serve your NS with a large pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>Your most straightforward option is to get your NS over with ASAP.  Your parents don't have the resources for yout to do fyp, so you're pretty much stuck there.  Either geth them to take a loan out for you, or work for the money.  Either way, nobody's going to loan a 16-year-old kid a few tens of thousands with no collateral or any form of security.</p>

              <p>That reminds me of one of my ex-classmates who was a Filipino PR.  After Sec 4 he went back to Manila and disappeared, and I didn't hear from him until I was halfway through my NS.  He called me up one day and said he was back in town.  I said, "Great, let's catch up for a beer".  He said, "No can do - I'm at the airport and I've got an MP here waiting to take me to begin my BMT". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Hi guys, I have a similar question. Sorry TS that I hijack this
              thread. I'll start another one if need be.</p>
              <p>My situation and question is somewhat like his,</p>
              <p>I'l be completing my Diploma in Accounting next year's March,
              and soon after that enter NS.</p>
              <p>Planning to go over to Australia to further my studies and get a
              degree after the 2 years of national service since I won't be able
              to make it into the local Us. (My GPA currently is only 3.1
              excluding this last semester)</p>
              <p>My girlfriend is also planning to go the same route as me and
              she had already got accepted into University of Melb.</p>
              <p>Total cost of the 2-year degree will be approximately
              AUD$100,000.</p>
              <p>Anyone knows if this amount can be loaned? Either through banks
              or CPF?</p>
              <p>Thanks all for the time to read!</p>

              <p>That doesn't sound right.  My total expenditure for 8 years was slightly over $200,000, and over that period I earned around $100,000 through part-time work.</p>

              <p><br>That was your time.</p>
              <p>Nowadays Ozzie or US Unis know to disallowed part time work unless its on campus, and they are closing down the numbers of students that gets PRs in Oz after they graduate and lands a job.</p>
              <p>So even if you do graduate in Oz, you might not get a job, and you dont get a job, you can forget about staying there and be a PR.</p>

              <p>how true it is....i went thru' exactly this 3 weeks ago.</p>
              <p>bared my a/c savings book and payslips to the real estates agents when i made my leasing application submissions. also wrote a 200words 1 page profile of my family so they know roughly who we are, what we do. ridiculous!</p>
              <p>this is true for leasing properties that are in demand.</p>
              <p>and imaging sending out 15 applications of the same.</p>
              <p>i gotta hunt for referrals as well. luckily got frens, relatives and colleagues to help out. if one is alone, it is gonna be tough here down under. not impossible to get lodging but harder.</p>
              <p>it is both a humbling and uneasy experience for me. glad i am over that hump now.</p>

              <p>You need skills.</p>
              <p>Which means you should be looking to get yourself trained in blue collar work.  Be in from ITE or Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>Learn stuffs like cooking, baking, aircon servicing, pumbling &amp; car repairs &amp; machinery repairs.</p>
              <p>You are what, only 16 years old.  Plenty for you to learn, before you decide which country to settle in.</p>
              <p>Pick something that will be in demand, and you will have your choice of countries to live in.</p>
