              <p>1) No idea.<br>2) You need A levels or the Australian equivalent to apply for university.  O's will not do.<br>3) Once you pass the age of 16, your parents will have to put up a bond to ensure your return to do your NS.  IIRC, the bond is $75,000 or half the combined annual income of the parents, whichever is higher.</p>
              <p>Add it all up, and the outlook's not too sunny, I'm afraid.</p>

              <p>Student loan maybe give you 3k.</p>
              <p>Insurance loan maybe can get you 4k+</p>
              <p>Scholarships maybe pay your studies.  But you need to show proof that your results are outstanding.</p>
              <p>Bonds also the same thing.  They prefer to see your results and be assured that you can really deliver as their employees later.</p>
              <p>And unless you already showed scholarship quality, which then the companies or gahment bodies will be contacting you direct to ask you to apply with them.</p>
              <p>Your 'O' levels are no use.</p>
              <p>And frankly, you can sign on to ITE or Polytechnic thru sponsorships, but I never heard of sponsors of 'O' levels student that cannot show proof of being able to work.</p>

              <p><br>Sigh,  You dont like to read things that are not beneficial to you right?</p>
              <p>Ok. My answer:  No.  Not for Australian Schools and Australian Universities.</p>
              <p>And if you uses your parents CPF for your studies in Singapore, you are legally bound to return in cash the moment you start working whether you are in Australia or elsewhere.  Plus Interest.</p>
              <p>If you are borrowing a loan from your own CPF, you are also required to return the borrowed amount when you finished your studies.</p>

              <p><br>Are you earning a income yet?  You got no $$$ other countries wont accept you either.</p>
              <p>If you really want to get away, then request to finish your NS  first.  Work, get your money and go.</p>
              <p>Without NS, without $$$, without proof of earning capability and without a scholarship/education level.  You maybe can go to malaysia and be a illegal immigrant and work as a begger.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, I have a similar question. Sorry TS that I hijack this thread. I'll start another one if need be.</p>
              <p>My situation and question is somewhat like his,</p>
              <p>I'l be completing my Diploma in Accounting next year's March, and soon after that enter NS.</p>
              <p>Planning to go over to Australia to further my studies and get a degree after the 2 years of national service since I won't be able to make it into the local Us. (My GPA currently is only 3.1 excluding this last semester)</p>
              <p>My girlfriend is also planning to go the same route as me and she had already got accepted into University of Melb.</p>
              <p>Total cost of the 2-year degree will be approximately AUD$100,000.</p>
              <p>Anyone knows if this amount can be loaned? Either through banks or CPF?</p>
              <p>Thanks all for the time to read!</p>

              <p>Err...tech, you mean your g/f and you combine fees or just for yourself?</p>
              <p>your g/f is her own problem, its up to her to come up with the $$$.  And its better she either work first to generate part of the $$$ before she goes over, most likely earlier then you.</p>
              <p>Then she can experiment and rent a place and you can go over later to take over from her.</p>
              <p>For you, unless your parents give you $$$, or you saved your own $$$, or you get a scholarship/company bond.....there is no way can loan the full amount of the $$$.</p>
              <p>You still have to consider living expenses?</p>

              <p><br>ok. So you got two years to laze around. Hopefully earning and saving money for after your NS go get a degree in Oz.</p>
              <p>Is that what you are saying now?</p>
              <p>Or you are still waiting for people to give you $$$ to do whatever you want to do?</p>

              <p><br>Your priority is acutally the $60k.  I believe its payable in few instalments?  Not everything at one shot.  You only need to show proof that you can pay for the 1st semester.  ie. maybe a 20k bank draft bring over to Oz? Check with your U on the amount need to show.</p>
              <p>40k accomodation is kinda too much. You planning to stay in a mansion and drive a brand new bmw?  Eat lobster everyday? </p>
              <p>Wit it down to 10k, and keep maybe another 10k on standby for emergencies for two years.</p>
              <p>Some parents got insurance for their kids?  Talk to them to ask whether it can be cashed out for your studies.</p>
              <p>Then check with your clans for grants/sponsorships, they usually have maybe a few k available for their clan kids going for further studies.</p>
              <p>And if you family is active in grassroots or temples. Check for any such grants thru there.</p>
              <p>The rest is bank loans, but maximum 2 months of your salary if you ever worked. So if possible, work a few months or a year will help you secure some bank loan.</p>
              <p>Then its your parents to try to generate funds, thru their savings, bank loans for you and maybe even a credit line.  Or your sibs to help out.</p>
              <p>Make some sacrifices, clear out your room, and let your parents rent it out.  Save the rental for you.</p>

              <p>Now I could be wrong, but playing the averages, your attitude towards school implies that you're somewhat less than a straight-A student.  That being the case, forget scholarships, forget deferments, forget anything that your average student would not be granted.</p>
              <p>On top of that, you're not a gazillionaire either by your won rights or by family association.  Also, nobody would be so stupid as to loan you money knowing that the money's going to be used for you to blow town.  Besides, given the questions you're asking, it's doubtful that you would know what collateral is, much less have any to put up against your loan.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: there ain't nuthin you can do, son.  Suck it up, finish your NS, possibly finish JC/Pre-U/poly and then think about going overseas to finish your studies - hopefully by that time you'll have scraped up the dosh to afford the tuition and living costs, which would be in the neighbourhood of 30 grand a year if you spend carefully.</p>
              <p>Reality's harsh, but you may as well get used to it instead of hurting yourself living in dreamland.</p>

              <p>Let me elaborate the rent out bedroom thingy.</p>
              <p>Fren was lucky and was often stay in at the camp after his bmt.  He had the family rent out his bedroom and he sometimes goes home to wash his clothers and sleep on the living room floor, he was too tall and his legs wont fit onto the sofa.  The camp has rooms and beds plus makan so he saved on those.</p>
              <p>G/f was a legal studies poly grad, she worked for 2 years and save 1 year saving on food, her salary &amp; no entertainment and borrows 10k from her parents to go to Oz.</p>
              <p>In Oz, she shares a room with a fren that was already in Oz, pays rent, eat bread, tongpang on fren's cars to go sightseeing.</p>
              <p>If you cannot save on the tuition fees, you need to save on the living expenses. 2nd year of studies maybe can let you work part time, so you need to consider doing such work to keep you staying in Oz.</p>
