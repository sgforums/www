              <p>I didn't even bother looking at the loooooong posts.

              <p>Statistics is such that you have to be very careful when
              analyzing and interpreting them.  Basically, to give a short
              example, </p>
              <p>10 pregnant women give birth.  8 healthy babies are born, 3
              babies didn't survive.</p>
              <p>Is the healthcare system to be blamed for the 3 deaths? 
              Depends on the situation!</p>
              <p>1 baby died because her mom is a drug and alcoholic
              abuser.  Hospital's fault?  No.</p>
              <p>1 baby died because<span style="color: #ff0000;"> it was stillborn.  Hosp</span>ital's
              fault?  Maybe.  Need more info.</p>
              <p>1 baby died because of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)
              within its first week of life.  Hospital's fault? 
              Depends on whether baby had already been discharged or still under
              the hospital's care. </p>
              <p>But you don't see the scenarios!  What's reported is only
              "30% infant mortality rate" in this sample group. </p>
              <p>This is a very simple example of how you cannot just take
              statistics at face value without doing a more intense study on the
              sample group, the norms, and all the other statistical and
              empirical data typically required.</p>

              <p>While SG can improve in the past few decades,why did oz not advance</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And oh yes.......there is some slight difference to giving birth in sg or in Oz.</p>
              <p>In sg, we have our neighbourhood GP downstairs our hdbs.  Plus, gynae insists on once a month check up if a female is preganant,  though the cost of each visit is roughly S$150/-, so its kinda affordable.</p>
              <p>In Oz, you dont go to GPs unless you are really sick.  So self medication is the norm.  You and wiffey might want to research on possible non prescription medicine for yourself and the baby should you decide to stay in Oz.</p>
              <p>A mere good private doctor is roughly A$500 per hour fee.  So you cannot be expecting to see a doctor as and when you want it.  Or have your baby scanned as often as once a month.  So do consider some of the costs that you can bear for you and wiffey.</p>

              <p>What level of education are you referring to? I thought compulsory education in Australia was free? Were you comparing university fees?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>School is compulsory in <a title="Australia" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/wiki/Australia"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australia</span></span></a> between the ages of five/six-fifteen/sixteen, depending on the state, with, in recent years, over three-quarters of students staying on until their thirteenth year in school. Government schools educate about two-thirds of Australian students, with the other third in independent schools, a proportion which is rising in many parts of Australia. Government schools are free although most schools charge what are known as "voluntary" contributions, while independent schools, both religious and secular, charge fees. Regardless of whether a school is government or independent, they are required to adhere to the same curriculum frameworks. Most school students, be they in government or independent school, usually wear uniforms, although there are varying expectations.</p>

              <p>I am suggesting if the parents cannot make it in Oz, have to return to Sg.</p>
              <p>Instead of the Australian School in Singapore, they might want to have the child in Singapore school systems to save costs.</p>
              <p>And its difficult to push a child into the Singapore School System if they already spent a couple of years in a Australian Schools.</p>
              <p>Cos Sg schools and Oz schools focuses on different thing.</p>
              <p>The best explanation I can suggest is: American/Oz Schools dont have as much homework as Sg schools.</p>

              We will be going as Permanent Residents to Australia. So it looks like medical costs of delivery will be covered by medicare.
              
              But my Oz PR is not approved yet. I am expecting it in Mar end or Apr. 
              
              I have a male child Singapore citizen of 5 years. You can understand why I am in hurry. I don't know whether the new baby is a boy or girl. I want my new baby to directly become Oz citizen. That's why I want to go before delivery as long as the flying is safe for mother and baby. We have a very good gynae and we will follow his advise. The delivery is due in Aug beginning. I hope we can make it in time.

              <p>I was busy, but this tot was on my mind the whole day!</p>
              <p>Well, I wanted to suggest:</p>
              <p>If you know its a girl, maybe can stay in sg a bit to finish the delivery in sg.  Where family or domestic maid support is cheap and plenty.</p>
              <p>If its a boy, you need to set aside some finances to get domestic help in Oz.  I assume thats why there is a rush to go to Oz.</p>
              <p>If they are twins, woo hoo.....then at least plan for extra finances, to bring some family help up to Oz, in addition to the domestic help that you get in Oz.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>......</p>
              <p>Am currently trying out and more or less confirmed to be working with a US Chinese family with 1 year old twins come March or April.</p>
              <p>And I did help out a family member a few years back, with a 2 year old and a 10 month old.  So I know how difficult it is to get people, or simply to have someone help alleviate the numerous chores that one has to completed in Ang Moh Country.</p>
              <p>Its a totally different scenerio in Australia, USA or Europe as compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Do take note that baby seats are mandatory.  And never ever shout or slap your kids in public. And if you in hard water area.  Do consider filtering the babies bath water before using on them.</p>

              <p>As a PR in Aussie, giving birth in government hospital is FREE. I gave brith to my son there 9 years ago. It cost A$600 per day to stay in hospital but because I was covered with their Medicare, I didn't have to pay a cent. Furthermore, you see the doctor at the hospital once a month but on the last 2 months, you see him twice a month. When it was time to delivery, he sees you once a week. There's no scanning to see the baby at all if you are seeing the hospital doctor. Theu only use the snakk tool to hear your baby heart beat. The check-up is not like Singapore at all.</p>
              <p>Also, for your delivery, you can choose the type of delivery. In Singapore, you just lie on the bed with your legs up to push. But in Aussie, you can opt of delivery in the pool of water, squating, and other methods... you can also delivery in the comfort of your home, but all that have to be arranged with your doctor weeks before delivery.</p>
              <p>After you delivery, you can go home (if you delivery in hospital) as soon as you can walk or know how to look after your new born (the nurses will teach you the basic if it's your 1st child).</p>
              <p>One more thing is that you get from the government  (social security office) A$300 (remember that was 9 years ago) as a gift to start up your nursery and buy milk or what is needed for your newborn.</p>
              <p>Then there is a place to go (I forgot what they are called) to get your free baby injections and check up every few weeks or months... Everything for the child is free.</p>

              <p>If you want to delay going over to down under by a year, you have to make sure you pay for your boy's health and education fee in full. Doing so will make sure that your boy will not have any NS liabilities if he needs to do a transit through Singapore.</p>

              <p>It doesnt guarantee u when things go wrong</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SG hospitals offer u gimmicky service and the perks .It offers u the service but with the perks which has to be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAID</span></strong>. When things go wrong, u cannot sue the hospital.</p>
