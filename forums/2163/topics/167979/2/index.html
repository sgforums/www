Usually I dont travel with good friends (coincidence). I hv a few travel buddies, whom can "fit well" when go travelling. Easy to compromise, same frequency, same interest...we agreed to OTOT (own time own target) when she prefer shopping, where I prefer visiting cathedral. So is a good combination ya. Otherwise, sure a lot of conflict.</div>

More than 4 and everything becomes harder to arrange and/or more expensive to arrange, e.g. harder to find bigger guesthouse, need to pay more for a bigger rental car to acomodate ppl + luggage, etc. and most difficult of all, make decisions that everyone will be happy with - which I've found (to my regret) that it is near impossible to happen for a grp of 6.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> That was the lousiest F &amp; E holiday I've ever had - in Perth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
