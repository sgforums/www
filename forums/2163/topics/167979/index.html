We get only our bed. It was like a big hall with some 20 beds in a row. Meals was simple between $1.00 - $2.00. Our group of 4 would hire a bus from one destination to the next and place out ads on the notice board to invite other bagpackers to join in our bus. We would then split the costs of the bus fares. We end up like paying $15 each for the bus.  We make alot of foreigners friends along the way. Maybe sometime I will share some of the beautiful photos with all of you.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
