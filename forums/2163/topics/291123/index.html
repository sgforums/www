            <div class='col-md body'>Guys I need a new one because the expiry date of the CNCC is only a year from date of receipt.  I am planning to renew a visa while I am overseas and by the time my current CNCC would have expired hence requiring a new one. It will  save alot of time if I am able obtain a new one now before they ask for it when I renew the visa. It is alot less trouble if I am able to get one while I am in singapore.<br><br>Also for people overseas, you can actually apply for it (given you also have a notice from a immigration office requesting for it) BUT you would need to go to a police station where there is a approved fingerprinting staff to take a full set of your fingerprint before sending it to singapore police with a money order.<br><br>The issue for overseas people is that not all police station are able to do a full set of prints and if someone is not in a central city where there is a central police station you are stuffed especially when you are in a more rural area. It means you would have to travel to the main station just to get a set of fingerprints done be it by plane or hours of driving.<br><br>Most countries doesn't require you to have any notice in order to apply for a criminal check cert!<br><br>Anyone in the same situation before? Please chip in and help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had to get one many years ago, but my memory is fuzzy on this. It was called a background check (could have been known as something else but the Americans call it such so that's what I remember i as). From the time of application to receipt, it took about 2 months. I remember having to go to a police station in Chinatown to get this done. I can't remember if I paid a fee or not.<br><br>We were moving from Japan (where I also had to get one done, took about 2 months too) to get stationed in Hawaii. I was told that I couldn't move there directly without getting that Singapore Police background check thingy. And that I had to be in Singapore to apply for it (rules back then, may differ now). So I had to spend 3 months in Singapore waiting for the paperwork before I could move. There were many other things I had to get done too. $$$$$$  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I do know that if you've lived in one country for more than 3 years, you will need a background check from each of those countries.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm trying to recall what I had to do to get my CNCC when I applied for skilled immigration back in 2002, but I certainly didn't have to turn up to the cop shop personally - I was on a bridging visa at the time, which did not allow travel out of Australia.  If memory serves me right, I went to the local police station in Meklbourne, got my finger and palm prunits taken, and then the cops sent the prints and request for the CNCC straight to the SPF.<br><br>I wasn't too fussed about SPF knowing that I was ammplying for immigration, but agin, IIRC, they do require you to state a purpose for applying for the CNCC.</div>
