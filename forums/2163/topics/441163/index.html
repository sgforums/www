              <p>It all started with the chicken rice. I am the biggest fan of Sergeant chicken rice in Hong Kong. But today i would not get to satisfy my chicken rice cravings...</p>
              <p>I am writing this because i feel compelled to share my experience. As an overseas Singaporean of 15 years, today is the worst encounter i've ever had with another Singaporean...and over chicken rice. </p>
              <p>So here goes the story... </p>
              <p>Today i made my way from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, looking forward to my favourite Sergeant chicken rice at Tsim Sha Tshui Silvercord Plaza, Food Republic. To my disappointment, the chicken tasted like yesterday's chicken meat. After eating a few more pieces (i kept eating as i couldn't believe the chicken tasted so bad), i decided to ask for a small portion of today's fresh chicken. I promptly returned the chicken and it so happened there was a Singaporean working at the chicken rice food outlet. I explained that the chicken was not fresh and ask if i could change to a small portion (seriously i just wanted 3-4 pieces for taste).</p>
              <p>"NO" was his answer. Even when i explained that i come from Singapore and am surely qualified to determine if the quality of the chicken is good or not. "NO", because i already ate a quarter of the half chicken i ordered. So if i ate one piece i can change, but if i eat more i cannot change....??</p>
              <p>Does he not understand that i just want a few pieces, that i travelled all the way from China to eat the chicken rice?   </p>
              <p>Instead, "NO","NO","NO".</p>
              <p>What happened to countryman courtesy? Instead it's money, money, money.."i'll lose money if i chop up a couple of pieces for you". Unbelievable.</p>
              <p>My fellow overseas Singaporeans, i take pride in being Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Having to argue over chicken rice today with a fellow Singaporean in a foreign land, is for me in the beginning anger, but actually now disappointment and with a tinge of sadness.</p>

              <p>Seriously if it was so bad you should have went back and demanded a change immediately instead of eating a few more pieces.</p>
              <p>I think the other Singaporean thinks that you are just trying to be funny with him coz you can still finish so many pieces since it was bad.</p>
              <p>Anyway, even in Singapore, I doubt any hawker will give you a few extra pieces of new chicken because you finished a few pieces that taste bad. </p>
              <p>It looks really lame from the other person's pt of view you know like you are trying to pull a fast one on him.</p>

              <p>It all started with the chicken rice. I am the biggest fan of Sergeant chicken rice in Hong Kong. But today i would not get to satisfy my chicken rice cravings...</p>
              <p>I am writing this because i feel compelled to share my experience. As an overseas Singaporean of 15 years, today is the worst encounter i've ever had with another Singaporean...and over chicken rice. </p>
              <p>So here goes the story... </p>
              <p>Today i made my way from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, looking forward to my favourite Sergeant chicken rice at Tsim Sha Tshui Silvercord Plaza, Food Republic. To my disappointment, the chicken tasted like yesterday's chicken meat. After eating a few more pieces (i kept eating as i couldn't believe the chicken tasted so bad), i decided to ask for a small portion of today's fresh chicken. I promptly returned the chicken and it so happened there was a Singaporean working at the chicken rice food outlet. I explained that the chicken was not fresh and ask if i could change to a small portion (seriously i just wanted 3-4 pieces for taste).</p>
              <p>"NO" was his answer. Even when i explained that i come from Singapore and am surely qualified to determine if the quality of the chicken is good or not. "NO", because i already ate a quarter of the half chicken i ordered. So if i ate one piece i can change, but if i eat more i cannot change....??</p>
              <p>Does he not understand that i just want a few pieces, that i travelled all the way from China to eat the chicken rice?   </p>
              <p>Instead, "NO","NO","NO".</p>
              <p>What happened to countryman courtesy? Instead it's money, money, money.."i'll lose money if i chop up a couple of pieces for you". Unbelievable.</p>
              <p>My fellow overseas Singaporeans, i take pride in being Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Having to argue over chicken rice today with a fellow Singaporean in a foreign land, is for me in the beginning anger, but actually now disappointment and with a tinge of sadness.</p>
