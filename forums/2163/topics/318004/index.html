              <p><br>If they are short of hairstylist and the citizen population is not able to fill the gap, then I agree with their policy of sourcing for foreign labour.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore's case, even if the citizen population is able to fill the gaps, they will still import more foreign labour. So as to force down our low salaried workers' wages, they hope to compete with China in terms of wage cost. Kind of like banging your head against a concrete wall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Their policy is a failure, as can be seen from the high rate of inflation (6.7% in April 2008) as compared to other similar GDP per capita countries. With the use of so much low wage workers, it's suppose to bring down price levels (e.g. transport, food, retail, energy, etc), instead it led to widespread inflation, obviously the cost savings has not been passed down to consumers.</p>

              <p><br> Simple reason. You are not a CITIZEN in Australia. Citizenship has
              it's privileges unlike Singapore which is a liability if you are

              <p><br>At least you could be sure of getting medical treatment with the high taxes you pay in Australia.</p>
              <p>The best part is, you still end up with higher disposable income after the high taxes in Australia as compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p>The thing with the Singapore regime is, they use the profits they get from taxes, invest it in monopolies in Singapore, then when super normal profits is made, they keep it in the government coffers instead of using it to help her citizens.</p>

              <p><br>If they are short of hairstylist and the citizen population is not able to fill the gap, then I agree with their policy of sourcing for foreign labour.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore's case, even if the citizen population is able to fill the gaps, they will still import more foreign labour. So as to force down our low salaried workers' wages, they hope to compete with China in terms of wage cost. Kind of like banging your head against a concrete wall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Their policy is a failure, as can be seen from the high rate of inflation (6.7% in April 2008) as compared to other similar GDP per capita countries. With the use of so much low wage workers, it's suppose to bring down price levels (e.g. transport, food, retail, energy, etc), instead it led to widespread inflation, obviously the cost savings has not been passed down to consumers.</p>
