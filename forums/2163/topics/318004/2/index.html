              <p>I don't agree.</p>
              <p>"Vagrants and lazy do-gooders" are part and parcel of every society. Just because a small bunch of idiotic dole-bludgers do take advantage of the welfare system doesn't mean that you should exclude the majority of people who do have proper jobs and pay taxes from the safety net the Government provides for the population.</p>
              <p>I assume you have lived in Australia for a while, at least, enough to know that programs like 'A Current Affair' are akin to tabloids like 'The Sun' in UK and 'The New Paper' in Singapore. Just a bunch of overhyped claptrap by the Australian media - always known to blow things out of proportion.</p>
              <p>About medical treatment by Medicare. Sure, it can be a big mess. It does seem like a mess right now with all the reports of badly managed hospitals and long waiting lists for medical care. But I think you're missing the point.</p>
              <p>Australia provides free and greatly subsidised healthcare for the Aussie population. That is the point.</p>
              <p>Here's a simple example. A country may consider prostitution illegal by law, but obviously prostitution still exists. This means that it is recognised by law that it is <strong>wrong. </strong>So no matter if Ah Hock feels horny and wants to bang a couple of chicks for $20 per head, but doesn't get caught, <strong>he is still liable to be arrested and tried under the law.</strong></p>
              <p>Just like in Australia. At least people who have been left out in the Medicare system can bring it up to the courts and the justice system because despite how they have been treated/went through they still can seek remedy for the lack of care/responsibility the system owes them.<br>In Singapore? Oh, you're "lucky" enough to have the Government bestow you with Medisave - <strong>you</strong> owe them not the other way around. 'Lucky' enough to be able to languish in a 'C' class ward with a drip (pay extra $2 for top up ah.) with 6 other terminally sick patients on 'controlled medication' (because the best and most effective are reserved for the full paying patients in air-conditioned 'A' class wards lucky/smart/rich enough to have private insurance or savings.</p>
              <p>That's what happened to a friend's grandma. Died of breast cancer thanks to the questionable care administered by the doctors in her 'C' class ward. It was disgusting to say the least, the level and quality of care, accomodation and treatment she was given just because her family didn't have enough money to pay for full treatment and had to rely on the pathetic excuse of a Medisave the Government in Singapore provides.</p>
              <p>About your comment about the Australian Government being like the PAP. Are you seriously kidding me?<br>At least we can <strong>vote</strong> for the guy man. In Singapore 'mysterious' things happen and poof, hey, here's your guy for the next 7 years or whensoever they decide one fine day to hold the election. (While sitting in their overstuffed sofas eating kaya roti the big guy decides, gee, I think its a good day to have the election after the 34268762 walkovers were successful)</p>
              <p>We can complain about Australia because we love it and want to see positive change. But if we're just earning the wage here and living within the Australian system we reap benefits Singapore could never give us ever in a million years because they value their citizens/PRs and still b|tcing about it then maybe its time to seriously consider if Australia is the right place for us since Singapore is so 'great'.</p>

But given their wages, they still make more than the average Singaporeans and could afford more despite their high tax structure.

              <p>my initial dealing with frens and folks down under to prep my moving over leaves me with the impression that everything is more impartial and transparent there.</p>
              <p>rent a house? don't matter who you talk to, the rates are more or less fixed as listed on the rent sites.</p>
              <p>buy a piece of land? same thing.</p>
              <p>even job wage for temps are regulated. not that i am going to be a receptionist or nurse when there, but their starting pay is A$17/hr and $27/h respectively. minimum wage is $12.50.</p>
              <p>here, i just sold my car and even with the agreed price, the car salesman tries to fleece you with a few hundred dollars when you drive it down to their showroom to seal the deal. not once....i ended up just selling it and moved on from this unpleasant episode. rental? months ago, i have expatriate frens who, upon agreeing on a rental price of an apartment with the owner, only to have the deal renegaded hours later becos of another higher offer received. just last month, another indian colleague of mine who were told at the last moment that his rent will increase 25% from next month by his landlord even though his rent agreement is not up. he moved out in protest.</p>
              <p>you may say that since i got my sight outta here, my lens is tainted. however, there will be tons that i will missed; my mates, food, sembawang park, etc. but the fact is my kids will probably grow up a better person than if they were to live here.</p>
              <p>that much i am sure of....</p>

              <p>this is probably the toughest part; when we broke the news; they were supportive, though i could sense immediately my mum is sad. she's always been tough person outwardly but i could tell this time round. she is also selfless, so she sees this as positive overall. my dad is more practical.</p>

              <p>Fatqueenlet, australia is good place to live and work. But if u have some expectations of living standard here. U have to throw singapore out of the picture. its because in Australia, infrastructure is not so developed as in singapore, Internet  pornography is censored, Entertainment is limited.</p>
              <p>But what is lacking in Singapore is found in Australia eg. cheap cars, Nature, relaxing lifestyle, Higer wages, Workplace laws and welfare.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taxes are higher, but basic life is not compromised. u will still be able to afford basic necessities like food, transport and home.</p>
              <p>Just remember , dont make superficial and surface comparisons . singaporeans who di this, i know of has since returned back to Singapore  It all boilds down to what u really want in life.</p>

              <p>Which suburban areas has such cheap rental? Are they very far from the city. And how many bedrooms are these. I am in Melbourne now, but I dun think there are such cheap places. Even a one bedroom in Coburg cost abt. AUD720 - AUD780.</p>
              <p>Can U share this with us....It would be very helpful to those that are renting on the high side. Thanx</p>

              <p>u may be surprised. its Burwood i last noticed ...But again, u really have to look.....look for those areas near TAFE schools and Unis and usually the whole of these places are "rental"areas to students. So there wil be a small market there - a student market...As u know since so many ppl are renting out, it will bring down the rental in that particular place...</p>

              <p>I don't agree.</p>
              <p>"Vagrants and lazy do-gooders" are part and parcel of every
              society. Just because a small bunch of idiotic dole-bludgers do
              take advantage of the welfare system doesn't mean that you should
              exclude the majority of people who do have proper jobs and pay
              taxes from the safety net the Government provides for the
              population.</p>
              <p>I assume you have lived in Australia for a while, at least,
              enough to know that programs like 'A Current Affair' are akin to
              tabloids like 'The Sun' in UK and 'The New Paper' in Singapore.
              Just a bunch of overhyped claptrap by the Australian media - always
              known to blow things out of proportion.</p>
              <p>About medical treatment by Medicare. Sure, it can be a big mess.
              It does seem like a mess right now with all the reports of badly
              managed hospitals and long waiting lists for medical care. But I
              think you're missing the point.</p>
              <p>Australia provides free and greatly subsidised healthcare for
              the Aussie population. That is the point.</p>
              <p>Here's a simple example. A country may consider prostitution
              illegal by law, but obviously prostitution still exists. This means
              that it is recognised by law that it is <strong>wrong.</strong> So
              no matter if Ah Hock feels horny and wants to bang a couple of
              chicks for $20 per head, but doesn't get caught, <strong>he is
              still liable to be arrested and tried under the law.</strong></p>
              <p>Just like in Australia. At least people who have been left out
              in the Medicare system can bring it up to the courts and the
              justice system because despite how they have been treated/went
              through they still can seek remedy for the lack of
              care/responsibility the system owes them.<br> In Singapore? Oh, you're "lucky" enough to have the Government
              bestow you with Medisave - <strong>you</strong> owe them not the
              other way around. 'Lucky' enough to be able to languish in a 'C'
              class ward with a drip (pay extra $2 for top up ah.) with 6 other
              terminally sick patients on 'controlled medication' (because the
              best and most effective are reserved for the full paying patients
              in air-conditioned 'A' class wards lucky/smart/rich enough to have
              private insurance or savings.</p>
              <p>That's what happened to a friend's grandma. Died of breast
              cancer thanks to the questionable care administered by the doctors
              in her 'C' class ward. It was disgusting to say the least, the
              level and quality of care, accomodation and treatment she was given
              just because her family didn't have enough money to pay for full
              treatment and had to rely on the pathetic excuse of a Medisave the
              Government in Singapore provides.</p>
              <p>About your comment about the Australian Government being like
              the PAP. Are you seriously kidding me?<br> At least we can <strong>vote</strong> for the guy man. In Singapore
              'mysterious' things happen and poof, hey, here's your guy for the
              next 7 years or whensoever they decide one fine day to hold the
              election. (While sitting in their overstuffed sofas eating kaya
              roti the big guy decides, gee, I think its a good day to have the
              election after the 34268762 walkovers were successful)</p>
              <p>We can complain about Australia because we love it and want to
              see positive change. But if we're just earning the wage here and
              living within the Australian system we reap benefits Singapore
              could never give us ever in a million years because they value
              their citizens/PRs and still b|tcing about it then maybe its time
              to seriously consider if Australia is the right place for us since
              Singapore is so 'great'.</p>

              <p>At least in Singapore the vargarants and lazy people don't tax the system. It is well proven that countries with a welfare system in the end do not do well, just take a look at the USA. Now we all know where Australia is heading. When I speak about such people, I speak from personal experience, not programs like today tonight. Besides you do not need programs like today tonight to highlight the problem, have you ever stood outside a centerlink office?</p>
              <p>At least the PAP do something... look at the infrastructure that Singapore has. In Australia, the political parties bitch about so many things that it is a wonder they get things done at all.</p>
              <p>My friend recently went for a double bypass... the surgery was fine, but because the hospital was careless, he ended up getting a very bad viral infection of the bone and he is still suffering today, some six months after the operation, and we are talking about someone who has the best medical coverage in an A class type ward. Not some C class ward. So you tell me.</p>
              <p>What credible opposition do we have in Singapore to vote for?</p>

              <p>in any system, there is bound to be people exploiting it. singapore is not spared. just ask the biggest culprit, the gahmen themselves.</p>
              <p>the question is, do you remove a well-intended policy because of a few bad apples or do you manage it?</p>
              <p>you live your life but once. of course one cannot predict the outcome. however, in singapore, if you fall into the majority grouppo who needs to work well into their 60s at subsistence level just to get by, well, i better bail out early.</p>
