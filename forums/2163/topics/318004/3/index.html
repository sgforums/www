              <p>I agree with RedDust...in sg we work like crazy just to be able to afford minimum living. just thinking of doing this until 60+...got me really afraid...actually its not more about ourselve but more about our children. just thinking about them struggling like us now..working non stop just to make ends meet....do i want this life for them?</p>
              <p>Life in sg is very predictable. since its so well controlled.</p>

              <p>the question is, do you remove a well-intended policy because of
                                      a few bad apples or do you manage it?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>redDust,</p>
              <p>you took the words right out of my mouth.</p>
              <p>People, you've got to think this way, every country, even a third world country or a fourth world country like Africa can provide a good life, status and privileges to <strong>anyone </strong>with money.</p>
              <p>Every country has its 'metro' city area with at least one or a few big glitzy buildings and fine dining restaurants for the elites, aristocrats and rich farts.</p>
              <p>What separates a country from another country, and what separates the West from the East currently, despite the rapid modernization in Asia, is that the West will take care their poorer and middle-classes.</p>
              <p>A middle-income fellow with a family can still live in a house, earn a decent wage, protected by his union (not some sham union) and afford certain luxuries in life. He is protected by the Government with their welfare system.</p>
              <p>No matter how you put it, the poorer to middle class in Australia (as an example) still lives a far better standard of living than a poor to middle class Singaporean who has to work like a dog in the dog eat dog system with little to no help from the Government, with occasionally scornful comments like "Don't expect anything from the Government" (ok then, why should they expect taxes from the people if they don't want the people to 'expect' anything from them? Wtf, that's what taxes pay for!).</p>
              <p>Yes, there are abusers. But do you think that a strict policied country like Singapore doesn't have its abusers? Of course! Does that mean whatever measly system Singapore has in place currently to support the disadvantaged and poor should be cast away just because of a bunch of exploitive bums? No! Of course not!</p>

              <p>Zecyan88,</p>
              <p>If you are willing to spend sometime on it, you can do the application yourself and save the agents fees. I think app fee now is around $2K? If you are thinking of moving to anywhere else other than SA, you might find it hard as places like VIC, NSW etc are considered "closed".</p>
              <p>To ship a container down, you should check around, there are varying prices.</p>
              <p>Next question is public or private school. Big difference in school fees, esp with 3.</p>
              <p>What kind of life do you want to live here? Job prospects? Will your significant other be working as well?</p>
              <p>Initially get to the aus immigration website, look for the class of visa that you will be applying for. Are you skilled? Etc... have a good read through the requirements which are all no the net for you to find if you spend sometime. Then think through a strategy.</p>
              <p>Initial cost of moving can be a lot or a little, depends. What do you intend to do in terms of housing? How much do you want to spend? Where do you want to live?</p>

              <p>What do you mean Vic and other states are 'closed'? As long as a person get PR, there is no restriction on where he could live in Australia. Unless you are referring to the Regional Skilled visas, then perhaps the other states are no longer sponsoring new applications?</p>

              <p>Yes Migration is having a seminar this Saturday if you would like to
              find out more about your elibility and agent fees. I don't know how
              much the fees are yet, but I'll find out on Saturday. Give them a call to find out more. I have called various agents and they seem to be rthe friendliest.</p>

              <p>Last year, there was talk that the criteria for application for PR in Australia will be tightened.  That then resulted in a huge increase in the no. of applications submitted as people tried to beat the deadline.  In fact, the Dept of Immigration received three times the number of applications they usually received over that period of time, and as a result, right now, every single application is backlogged. </p>
              <p>As of last month, they were still processing applications sent in on November 2007.  Even if you are in a preferred profession where priority is given to you, as long as your application is not sponsored by your Employer, ie. you have chosen to apply as an independant applicant, you have to join in the merry queue.  If you are not in the preferred profession, or if your eligibility score is low, there's no telling when they will process your application. </p>
              <p>The rental situation in Victoria is pretty tight at the moment. I have heard complaints from colleagues re. steep increases in rental, and the difficulties they face getting rental property because the turnout of people wanting to rent the same place as you is usually pretty large.  A Singaporean friend who recently moved here said that there were at least 30 people who turned up to look at a South Yarra apartment.  Because it is the landlord's market now, if you are not gainfully employed, you might find it tough to find a place to rent because the landlords are quite fussy now and they can select their tenants. </p>
              <p>I got to know a lot of Singaporeans who have moved here and typically, they all reported feeling extremely homesick and depressed for the first 12-18 months.  And now that I've helped other Singaporean friends settle in, we all realise that Singapore has its virtues afterall and there are things you will struggle to accept initially.  Things like the high costs of services, the inefficient services, the lousy infrastructure, racial prejudice, how expensive it is to eat out, how early shops close here, etc will be tough to get used to.  However, you will also realise that there are perks too, like a better working environment, union backing, higher wages, fantastic bargains for certain items, and the freedom to be whoever you like and do whatever you like!</p>
              <p>Basically, you learn to become more adaptable after you get over the initial shock and homesickness.  I love to speak to Aussies from all walks of life from various native countries and the stories of struggling to settle in initially is quite similar no matter which country we come from.  Migrants from countries like Afghanistan, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, etc will feel that it is a godsend to be here because their conditions back home can be pretty deplorable.  However, Singaporeans have it good, although very few are appreciative, and it was only after coming here that I learnt to realise Singapore's merits. </p>
              <p>In any case, if you're coming over with your family, you have to do your groundwork and research thoroughly.  Do not set your expectations too high, and give yourselves a gentle transition period.  And when the going gets tough, just remember that in time, you will settle in and adapt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>i think there is also a age limit for the primary applicants if you don't have a ton of money...i am not too sure, you need to check.</p>
              <p>as for place of settlement, it is actually pretty dumb. you can apply via south australia, but nothing can stop you from settling in melbourne.</p>
              <p>as for diy or agent, it is up to you. if you are not too familiar, it's better to spend some money to get it sorted for you. my fees then was a$2.5k, i think. i got an attorney to help me. there are a few incidentals along the way, but it is only a few hundred bucks. i think, all in all, you need not spend more than s$5k for it. but if you are comfortable diy, it's probably better.</p>
              <p>you should just google the aus immi site. all the infos are there.</p>

              <p>Cost of using a migration agency for me is almost 5k++ (kindaof lost count <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png">) for a family of 4. you may want to take your guage from there. (i use Allan Hall Migration, but i don't suggest you using it...service is quite bad..staff alway resigning).</p>
              <p>You can try DIY. much cheaper. All you need to do is download all the forms on the Auz mit site . fill them up and bring all the supporting docs..</p>
              <p>Perth new suburb cost 450k for a nice landed place..350m2 i think...just visited a friend...am drooling at the house keke. (but i find perth boring...)..i still like NSW.</p>

              <p>Last year, there was talk that the criteria for application for PR in Australia will be tightened.  That then resulted in a huge increase in the no. of applications submitted as people tried to beat the deadline.  In fact, the Dept of Immigration received three times the number of applications they usually received over that period of time, and as a result, right now, every single application is backlogged. </p>
              <p>As of last month, they were still processing applications sent in on November 2007.  Even if you are in a preferred profession where priority is given to you, as long as your application is not sponsored by your Employer, ie. you have chosen to apply as an independant applicant, you have to join in the merry queue.  If you are not in the preferred profession, or if your eligibility score is low, there's no telling when they will process your application. </p>
              <p>The rental situation in Victoria is pretty tight at the moment. I have heard complaints from colleagues re. steep increases in rental, and the difficulties they face getting rental property because the turnout of people wanting to rent the same place as you is usually pretty large.  A Singaporean friend who recently moved here said that there were at least 30 people who turned up to look at a South Yarra apartment.  Because it is the landlord's market now, if you are not gainfully employed, you might find it tough to find a place to rent because the landlords are quite fussy now and they can select their tenants. </p>
              <p>I got to know a lot of Singaporeans who have moved here and typically, they all reported feeling extremely homesick and depressed for the first 12-18 months.  And now that I've helped other Singaporean friends settle in, we all realise that Singapore has its virtues afterall and there are things you will struggle to accept initially.  Things like the high costs of services, the inefficient services, the lousy infrastructure, racial prejudice, how expensive it is to eat out, how early shops close here, etc will be tough to get used to.  However, you will also realise that there are perks too, like a better working environment, union backing, higher wages, fantastic bargains for certain items, and the freedom to be whoever you like and do whatever you like!</p>
              <p>Basically, you learn to become more adaptable after you get over the initial shock and homesickness.  I love to speak to Aussies from all walks of life from various native countries and the stories of struggling to settle in initially is quite similar no matter which country we come from.  Migrants from countries like Afghanistan, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, etc will feel that it is a godsend to be here because their conditions back home can be pretty deplorable.  However, Singaporeans have it good, although very few are appreciative, and it was only after coming here that I learnt to realise Singapore's merits. </p>
              <p>In any case, if you're coming over with your family, you have to do your groundwork and research thoroughly.  Do not set your expectations too high, and give yourselves a gentle transition period.  And when the going gets tough, just remember that in time, you will settle in and adapt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Lionnoisy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not sound to compare the two statistics because</p>
              <p>1. we do not know how 'permanent departure from Australia' is classified (left more than 3, , or 5 or 10 years?),</p>
              <p>2. given that Australia permits multiple citizenships, Australians are therefore more likely to take on citizenship of another country,</p>
              <p>3. we know that most Singaporeans who migrated permanently do not give up their citizenship. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Between 70,000 - 90,000 Singapore residents are away from the island-state for more than 12 months according to a report in Feb 08 in the ST. Of course not all of these 70,000 would have migrated, as many would just be working overseas. Even if we take half of this number, i.e. 35,000, compared to the approx 30,000 Australia-born residents who 'departed permanently', the rate of migration out of Singapore is way higher than Australia!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I agree that migration is a personal decision. Anyone thinking of doing so should weigh the pros and cons himself, decide for himself what he wants in his life, and what he is willing to forgo in Singapore for what he could potentially get in a new country. Australia is not perfect. You gain some, you definitely lose some. It is just a matter of personal preference. It is not about cheaper cars and bigger house (for the same price in Singapore) in Australia (an argument often bandied about). It is a total change in lifestyle.</p>

              <p>rokprince,</p>
              <p>The 457ie visa is stopped in 2003, meaning you cannot start a biz then apply for PR.(its a loop hole they covered)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, you have to apply for a PR visa but under biz skill or investor class before you setup shop. (there are many ways to get a Aus PR, just that you use money investment as the carrot for them to approve it) others with will have to use skill or dependent as a reason etc.</p>
              <p>You will have a higher chance of getting approval. provided you meet their needs.</p>

              <p>The 457ie visa is stopped in 2003, meaning you cannot start a
              biz then apply for PR.(its a loop hole they covered)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, you have to apply for a PR visa but under biz skill or
              investor class before you setup shop. (there are many ways to get a
              Aus PR, just that you use money investment as the carrot for them
              to approve it) others with will have to use skill or dependent as a
              reason etc.</p>
              <p>You will have a higher chance of getting approval. provided you
              meet their needs.</p>
              <p>Which gov don't need incoming money...</p>
