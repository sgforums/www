              <p><br>As far as I know, it is not difficult to get a job with a Commerce degree in the accountancy-related industry. The profession is in high demand in Australia and you actucally get bonus points if you apply as an accountant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said that, the migration program was tweaked beginning Sept last year to give preference to people who have working experience. While before PR was practically given on a silver platter to accounting graduates fresh out of school, now you have to get at least 12 months work experience before you can apply. You may get a temp graduate visa which allows you to work in Aus to get the necessary work experience to apply for PR. Of course, if you have relatives in Aus who could sponsor you and you meet the points test, you could still gun for the PR straightaway.</p>

              <p><br>Hi noob...it should be pretty easy for commerce grads from Melbourne Uni to get into one of the Big Four in Melbourne. Immigration keeps changing its rules. So when u graduate, they might change the rules for migration again.</p>
              <p>For now, I heard from frens that Dimia gives Temp visa to grads from skills in demand courses, and during the tenure of the Temp visa, you must get a job relevant to your degree, failing which u will not get the PR.</p>

              <p>I would not recommend a temp visa.</p>
              <p>Australia's migration laws are very violatile and temp visas are already not very well received by the local Aussies, who are obviously the ones who call the shots as they wield actual voting power.</p>
              <p>A temp visa will require you to work 2 years before being eligible to apply for a PR. Every Sep there is a change in the migration law. <br><br>Simple example: Just before this Sep India was assessment level 3. That means that they had to show 2 years of living expenses to support themselves (or they will have most likely find an illegal job if they do not have enough money to foot expenses). This Sep it was changed to Assessment level 4,  it became 3 years of living expenses.</p>
              <p>That is a shit load of money to consider for these Indians who pay in rupees. Though you might think it isn't related to you, a simple factor to consider is that their playing field was narrowed so much so effectively more than 1/2 of the Indian migrants automatically became ineligible to even get a student visa in lieu of migrating here.</p>
              <p>Likewise, you could be affected in the temp visa section if they decided that any temp visa after the next Sep changes will no longer be able to apply for a visa or its changed to 4 years. Something like that.<br>It would be a very huge risk to want to extend the time period of being 'in limbo' (what I call the instability of being on a student visa/temp visa to get a PR as any changes could affect you.). Not to mention the huge investment you would have already made if you've been here 2 years, all settled and shit.</p>

              hi everyone,
              
              i`m looking forward to migrating to aussie too...
              in fact i`ve been on the idea for sometime already..
              recently pondered onto a website called migration experts..
              i seemed eligible, but i stopped my application when then requested for a `registration` fee to be paid in order to proceed with further application status..
              
              thinking that it might had been a scam, i stopped there.
              until i chanced upon this thread and get to know that i can actually apply direct to the aussie govt..
              
              can someone enlighten me on the appropiate steps and the fees involved? i`m looking forward to staying in melbourne or sydney doing engineering related job...
              my status is:
              Age: Under 30
              Qualifications: B.Eng w minor in Biz ( Mech )
              Marital: Single
              Proficient in English as well...

              <p><br>You need to nominate an occupation, meet the age and english requirements and pass the points test to apply for PR. Presuming you're enrolling into an undergrad course in an Aussie uni, you could only apply after you have completed your degree, i.e. 3-4 years. If you do not have a relative to sponsor you, you'd probably need to work another year on a temp visa before you could get your PR. Then again, the legislation might change in 4-5 years time.</p>

              <p>If you have a relative who is a Aussie PR or citizen, he or she can sponsor you for PR. In that case, you only need 100 points rather than 120 points. The relative has to be a parent, sibling, uncle/aunt, or nephew/niece, I think. Check out the DIAC website for more info.</p>
