              <p><a href="../../../users/221421">M42 ORION</a> How the hell did you know my Uncle give up his nationality? Which part of your stupid brain make you think that? You are an extremely low creature.</p>
              <p>My uncle never abandone his citizen and still a 100% Singaporean. He did not come here for Thai girl. His Singaporean relatives never give a shit about his welfare, only want his retired premium. He immigrated to Thailand because only we want to take good care of him. When I was in Singapore he treated us like his own son and daughter, even my father who is a Singaporean ran away and have an affair with a China woman. Is that something wrong that I treat him like my own father?</p>

              <p>My uncle whom is a Singapore citizen, he immigrated to Thailand after<br>being retired. He is over the age of 70 and he is in critical<br>condition. He is admitted to ICU at Hua Chiao Hospital in Bangkok. But<br>the medical fee has raised to 120,000 Baht. He doesn't have any saving<br>and insurance.

              <p>you shld ask your uncle if he has cpf funds left, specifically his medisave. that in part can be used as his hospital expenses. if he has children still residing in singapore, i think his children too can help pay using their medisave. or if you are willing to co-pay his hospital expenses, it can be manageable.</p>
              <p>if he is in critical condition, it may be difficult for him to make the trip down south. so that too warrant some thinking.</p>

              <p>Sura,</p>
              <p>1st thing 1st.  Please be patient and polite even if the forumers are being rude.</p>
              <p>As far as I understand, thai persons are very polite and patient.  They do not appear rude, not even online.  So if you can control your response, then you can expect decent responses.</p>
              <p>Your uncle has retired, and he most likely only hold Thai Permanent Resident status.  He should still be Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Most airlines or even the budget airlines will not allow your uncle to board the plane to return to Singapore, if he cannot stand and walk down the walkway to the planes.</p>
              <p>So your only option is to fly your uncle using those medical flights which cost about S$10k per flight.</p>
              <p>Even retired, your uncle might still have some medi save in his a/c.  And even if not, he is still entitled to some discounted medical from Singapore.</p>
              <p>Please advise what is his medical situation before we proceed further.</p>
              <p>PS. I have families in Thailand.  So I know some stuffs.  But not all.  But if you give detailed description, then we can advise more.</p>
              <p>Also, your uncle may not have some living arrangement for Singapore.  Sending him to Singapore, are you prepared to get him a decent living space and seek medical treatment at the same time?</p>
              <p>And you best ask his approval before sending him to Singapore.  Or he might just think you are trying to get rid of him.</p>
