              <p>From feedback received and online discussion, it is apparent that there is much misunderstanding on Minister Khaw’s comments on nursing homes in JB. Some expressed objection to using the nursing homes in JB for their elderly. They felt that this would tantamount to abandoning the elderly overseas.  We commend their spirit.  Indeed, we would like to state categorically that nobody is advocating that the elderly be abandoned, here or overseas.  Minister’s comments arose from the requests by many Singaporeans to use their Medisave for overseas hospital care where competent care is available at lower cost. Unfortunately, his comments have been twisted out of context. (MOH clarifies:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is a matter of options and affordability (The New Paper, 18 Feb)</span></span></p>
              <p>Minister Khaw was only sharing an observation about the different cost structures in JB and Singapore, and in fact this option is something that those who want to stretch their budget are already doing. On why nursing homes cost more in Singapore than JB, it is a case of market realities arising from different stages of economic development. This is not a failure of Singapore's healthcare system, but a reality that our cost of living here is higher.  Our doctors and nurses are paid more their counterparts there; likewise the cost of land and construction.(MOH clarifies:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why nursing homes cost more to build and run in Singapore (The Straits Times, 20 Feb)</span></span><br><br>We certainly encourage families to strive to help their elderly age-in-place, i.e. at home. The vast majority of Singaporeans do, and we commend and applaud their strong family bonds.  The fact is that not all patients can be cared for adequately at home, while this may be the top wish of the patients and their families.  Sometimes, they do need to be admitted to a hospital, if conditions are severe, or to a nursing home, if the conditions are less serious.  They are not "homes for the aged" where the elderly has been abandoned by their children, with no family to return to. Many commentators  may have mixed up nursing homes with homes for the aged.  Ultimately, whether the patients should be cared for at home, at nursing home in Singapore, or at nursing home overseas, are decisions for the family to decide. (MOH clarfies: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Strong families ties and values in care for the elderly. (ZB's english translation, 23 Feb</span></span> )<br><br>For the low income group, they do not have to worry as Government subsidy ensures that nursing homes here will be affordable.  Each year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) provides about $110 million in operating subsidies for the Intermediate and Long-term Care (ILTC) services, which include nursing homes. Needy families will get the subsidies they need, and even from Medifund.For those who can afford unsubsidised nursing home care, keeping the borders open provide them with options.  This is the context in which Minister Khaw made his comment.<br><br>In fact, some readers shared the view that the availability of lower nursing homes in JB gives many Singaporeans more options. One such reader is Mr. Dennis Teo who wrote a letter to The New Paper “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">For some, JB homes could mean better care</span></span>” (20 Feb).<br><br>You can also view the context of Minister's comments in Parliament in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">video clip</span></span>.</p>

My purpose for starting this thread is I would to know if there is any medical treatment in Singapore that is affordable for retiree, I should not use the word 'free' in the beginning. It is better he can be treated in Singapore because he is a foreigner here and the hospital does not accept a non-Thai patient unless he has the insurance and enough fund to pay for the treatment. My uncle is in critical condition that's why the hospital has no choice but to accept him.</p>
              <p>I have contacted a Thai-government charity fund org to see if they can help my uncle to cover the full medical expense.</p>

              <p>Thank you <a href="../../../users/241150">Rednano</a> for the information. I appreciated. It seem my uncle condition is getting worst so air-travel is impossible. I think he should stay in the hospital until he is recover a little. The hospital is willing to lower the medical bill.</p>
              <p>English is not my first language. I shouldn't use the word 'immigrant', people misunderstood that he gave up his nationality and settle here. He's still a Singaporean. He stays here by visa.</p>

              <p>If your uncle cannot fly, you might need to consider driving him back to Singapore, if you really think that will help his financial condition.</p>
              <p>Also, do consult with the Singapore Embassy about him returning to Singapore as a last resort.  They have the connections to help facilitate his return to Singapore, but cannot contribute to the expenses of your uncle's return.</p>
