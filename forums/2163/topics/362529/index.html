              <p>Most Australian people in Melbourne are kind towards Asians, especially if you dress sensibly and speak good English. Generally If you are understood and display a joyful personality, Australians will take a liking to you. The most maligned Asians in Melbourne are the ones who do not speak English, and do not take any sort of effort to integrate into Australian Society (does not necessarily involve turning white/pretending to be white overnight), but rather choose only to stick within their own asian groups.</p>
              <p>Note also that there tend to be several Australians (usually the exception) who will hate asians no matter how they speak, sound or look like, I've dealt with them and it would be in my own interests not to be offended, as we have all been guilty of racism at one point or another in our lives.</p>

              <p>Some Indians have copped violence, but no more so than anyone else.  They seem to think that just because they're fee-paying students they are above the rest of the population and have the right to damage our train stations.</p>
              <p>As for the burrito-munching asshat, he took gladly took millions of our dollars, did a shithouse job of running the company and then made up stories of racism to cover up the fact that he was basically useless.  I still don't have my bloody braodband thanks to his tequila-guzzling, tamale-scarfing bullshit.</p>

              <p>well, i live and study in Sydney atm, and i dont think aus is racist. Actually quite accepting. Considering that there are loads of races residing in aus,</p>
              <p>eg, greek(highest amt in melb), french, arabs, asians, hispanics, etc.</p>
              <p>Btw, i think ive gotta agree with what locals in Sydney say abt Sol Trujilo. Ungrate. Hahaa. ppl complaining that he took up the top job at Telstra and run it into shit. Cant agree more.</p>
              <p>Now Telstra's services are made private and its very expensive,(plus unreliable).</p>

              <p>Some Indians have copped violence, but no more so than anyone else.  They seem to think that just because they're fee-paying students they are above the rest of the population and have the right to damage our train stations.</p>
              <p>As for the burrito-munching asshat, he took gladly took millions of our dollars, did a shithouse job of running the company and then made up stories of racism to cover up the fact that he was basically useless.  I still don't have my bloody braodband thanks to his tequila-guzzling, tamale-scarfing bullshit.</p>

              <p>which state are you at? I was at Victoria, Melbourne and I encountered quite a few incidences while studying there. I can give you 2 examples. I was walking one night and stopped at a traffic light, got a car stopped in front of me, and spat at me. Luckily the distance the car and me were not near. the other example was at city centre, where I was taking a tram. got this lunatic standing at the tram stop, saying out loud, asians go home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They should also go home as the land belongs to the aborigines. they took away the land from the natives. look who is talking.</p>

              <p>A car spat at you?</p>
              <p>Lunatics are lunatics.  There'll always be some nutjob saying something of the sort; catch the same guy at the same tram stop next Tuesday and he'll be yelling about how the banks are run by satanic cults, on his Thursday special is a two-hour rant about flouride in the water - don't forget to tip your waitress, folks.  If you take that as proof of racism, your skin's way too thin and you're one of the contributors to this inflated charge of racism.</p>
              <p>I've been in Melbourne since 1994 and over the years I've stayed in Hawthorn, Camberwell, Brunswick, Doncaster, and Eltham.  I now work in the city, but while I was at uni I had jobs in Nunawading, Wantirna, Werribee and Flemington. In all that time over that range of suburbs, I've never had a single problem.  Either someone up the really loves me, or you're just suay.  Personally I believe we make our own luck.</p>
