              <p>hi arapahoe,</p>
              <p>good to know that you are settling in back home in SG. as with any relocations...i guess it'd take awhile to adjust but i'm sure you'll be able to do with much ease.</p>
              <p>i've friends (non singaporeans) from overseas who are moving back to SG too (previously worked in SG and then left to go europe/USA). seems that asia is the place to be now - particularly singapore. even the ivy league universities are eyeing singapore now and several have already made plans to set up campuses in SG through joint collaborations</p>
              <p>who knows....with the state of the US economy...we might be back home eventually too. but well, we'll just take it a step at a time now....and see where the path might lead us. whatever it is...i'm thankful for the opportunities that are available overseas and in SG</p>
              <p>keep us posted on the happenings in SG and wish you all the best.</p>

              <p>Well......it took me a while to accept the notion that i am returning to Singapore. I see myself more as a Asia Pac Rim kinda of a guy.  </p>
              <p>In career I am part of a group that managed the entire Asia range from NZ, AU to S.Korea  to India. I don't think the current state of economies call for statics career, when the wind blow West ward i will be on the road again........it is what it is...................Wayfaring Career.</p>
