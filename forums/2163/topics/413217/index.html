              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>So I have sort of settled down in SG....after X months…lawfully employed.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>During the 8 months i have learned that due to the global downturn plenty of folks had wanted to come to work in singapore ........headhunters in Singapore are flooded with calls and resumes from the US, Canada, the EU other than the immediate Asian countries to apply for jobs in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Jobs vacancies posted are applied thru internet from all over the World. So if you think why companies don't response for overseas candidates because you are not the only person applied. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Companies no longer have Human resource for recruitment, but Talent Recruiter most likely they are outsource within HR department.   </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In Singapore Salaries and experiences does not necessary come hand in hand. With the appreciation of SG currency Salary is negotiated at Price Point. Cost of living is pretty high in Singapore so do not assume your US salary is going to pay for living expenses in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>On the good news to All Singaporean.....still there is a direction for Singapore organization to prefer to hire local Citizen first.....!!!! Because of excessive foreigners proportion. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>I met plenty of returnees from NY, L.A. Indian profession from US, and European...........some of them lived so closed together when i was in Los Angeles.......!    </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>So if you are overseas and for employment reason have to return to Sing. If the Heat don't kill you....You probably can survived..... not too bad ...cause i have met lots of returnees already waiting for the next jump....heeee...!!!! </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Every morning I take the train to work….the first leg of my journey I am one of the few Singaporean in the train most are foreign workers……and foreign financial consultants. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>So how’s my work...............every morning I got into office.....I say ......."Ohaiyo to my <span> </span>colleague.....than "Ang yong ha sa yo"  .....follow by Bonjourno.......than Sawadeeca..to .....and nanmastay to my working buddy.......and plenty of Malaysian ....Lah.......</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>I work with my vendors also happen to be Filipinas, Malaysian, other asian.....</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>So on a day 2 day basis I found myself have very limited contact with Local Singaporean….Did I say I return to Singapore!!!! The only time I am reminded I am in Singapore is during lunch time I go to the canteen and order my Chicken Rice. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Thank God it still taste the same..... </span></p>

              <p>Singaporeans who can only be employed in Singapore and by Singapore companies aren't winners but losers in their society.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter how much money you can earn, it's really about how much options and choices you have at your disposal.</p>

              <p><br>SG companies preferred to hire Singaporeans because they are cheap, hardworking, easy to enslave and threaten, less likely to cause trouble because Singaporeans are fearful because they have alot more to lose compared to foreigners, no overheads for accomodations/visas.</p>
              <p>It's not because you are loved by them when you imagined you're being loved.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans who can only be employed in Singapore and by Singapore companies aren't winners but losers in their society.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter how much money you can earn, it's really about how much options and choices you have at your disposal.</p>
              <p>When you have zero option and choice, you are definitely not winning in your job and life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take a look at Fandi Ahmad, true blue Singapore winner. Soon his sons will be kicking balls overseas and their sons will be kicking balls in the galaxy. Best thing that Singaporean can do is to be a physiotherapist and wipe the sweats off their cocks in the locker room.</p>

              <p>I am sorry what make you think i work for SG companies.........the point is...it doesn't matter anymore...cause if the next Greenbacks that stick in another country I will be gone....No attachment.</p>
              <p>In any case most SG companies would not hire folks like me cause we are too far off culturally....to be localized. It is their lost.</p>

              <p>vito,</p>
              <p>then why become a leader in the first place?as a leader of any country on this planet,it is your responsibility as a leader to control everything under your control and not let other factions control it.</p>
              <p>this means u know shit about being a decent human so when u talk bout macroeconomoics or even yer future....i highly doubt u are in control of it!but thats ok..........u can go blame it on the feds or PAP or yer moma if the situation gets outa control.</p>
              <p>its folks like u that this planet cant stand a chance as u are neither in control of your enviroments...dun bother shaping it to a beautiful world.....assume it would get better/////damn....u folks are asking for it.</p>
              <p>anyway im not here to lecture u.....if ya wanna werk n make a werld a rotten place....go ahead...make my day...dont bother becoming a leader or anything....yer next excuse if u ever would end up as a leader would be either"once in 50 years event.....or......we cant do anything about the recession.......or.....there is no free meals....or......we need more foreigners even though island is 2 million outa 4 million refugees or citizens....extremely low savings or fixed deposit rates for decades etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>araphoe,</p>
              <p>i wasnt talkin bout usa.i was thinkin bout spore.to me usa shut down back in 1997......so i stopped thinkin bout it in 1997.but what i have observed that their materials and engineering are good and i have sourced every kind of materials and have found it very good for engineering as their distribution line is the best n cheapest i have seen.now that is how every country should be.</p>
              <p>i have no issues with u coming back to spore to werk if u need to be near loved ones  other personal problems.but coming back to spore to work again is NOT WISE.....IF U HAVE A GREEN CARD OR US CITIZENSHIP.U COULD SIMPLY SOLDIER ON IN THE USA.</p>
              <p>if u have none but a spore citizenship...i understand yer standing for having to come back to spore.</p>
              <p>whatever macroeconimcs or political feds or obamas hamburger dinner....if he cant fix the economy...dont blame it on the feds....blame it on the teamS LEADER .its like if u got someone to paint a house....and painter do a screwed up job...u do not talk to the painter.....u talk to the painters boss.</p>
              <p>THAT IS LEADERSHIP!</p>
