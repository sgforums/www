              <p>Hi, I am an expat currently in SG, but heading home next year. I thought singaporeans abroad would have also gone through the process of getting exit permits and posting bonds for their boys and I hope this is okay to ask here. My sons are 7 and 4 now, they will be 8 and 5 when we return to my home country next year. Their dad is singaporean, so there are steps we need to follow in order to defer ns so the boys have until 21 to decide, they either come back alone at 21 and do ns and then keep their singapore citizenship, or renounce their singapore citizenship at 21 and just keep their european one and not return for ns - they are dual citizens right now.</p>
              <p>So I think I am fairly clear on the process and aware that rules change periodically and I will have to keep up to date on the rules on my boys behalf. Where I am unsure is the bond issue. I will need to post bonds for the boys when the reach 13. But I will close all my bank accounts here obviously because I will not come back other than perhaps for holidays. Will I be able to do a bankers guarantee in the UK and list Mindef (or whoever necessary) as the recipient? Did any of you process this from the UK or did you keep an active bank account here and process from here? And it's $75,000 each right? Did you have to place the $75,000 in full or is it some sort of insurance type thing? Is it true the boys can't visit Singapore when they have an exit permit in place? </p>
              <p>I apologise in advance for any offence anyone may take. In my heart I doubt after living more than half their life in another country they will want to come back for ns. Especially when they have to renounce one of their citizenships at the end of it all anyway. Would love to hear from others who have been there, done that. And there is nothing to do immediately on leaving except to ensure that mindef or central manpower people know we have left?</p>

              <p>actually according to mindef spore, even after yer sons complete their 2 years NS they are not allowed to go oveseas unless to work or to study.they did not state they would allow yer sons to live near u.in fact they would punish yer sons with a jail sentence and a big fine too if they want to leave the country after national service of 2 years from what i last read the black n white.they may go overseas foer short trips ..holidys etc.</p>
              <p>they are only allowed to stay overseas for less than 6 mths or so n need to report where they are going before flying off or its also a jail n fine for them. best to read up on reservist overseas laws for folks who have completed their 2 years ns in spore.</p>
              <p>spore is pretty much a north korean from that aspect.</p>

              <p>well, if u feel that most probably your boys will not want to come back for ns since they lived more than half of their life elsewhere, in my opinion, u dont even need to consider holding on to singaporean citizenship for them. since your husband is singaporean, he should know how life is in ns. if your boys spent their formative years in a european country where they have not much of exposure to asian languages, i dont think they will be able to survive easily in ns. Ns use Malay for commands and talk in a mixture of singlish and hokkien dialect. ns might in fact put more stress to your boys. on top of that, like a said, since they spent their formative years elsewhere, and they grew up in a different kind of environment and are educated by that country, they are not obligated to serve ns just because they are born here. probably to u, holding on to dual citizenship is better, but if u can forsee your future and your family wont be back for long term, why need to hang on to sg citizenship.. plus, british citizenship enables visa-less travel to more countries than singapore citizenship. other than that, i am sure u know british citizenship comes along with EU citizenship and they could travel freely in the eurozone...</p>
              <p>well the above is my opinion, dont be offended if u dont like what i said. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I apologise in advance for any offence anyone may take. In my
              heart I doubt after living more than half their life in another
              country they will want to come back for ns. Especially when they
              have to renounce one of their citizenships at the end of it all
              anyway. Would love to hear from others who have been there, done
              that. And there is nothing to do immediately on leaving except to
              ensure that mindef or central manpower people know we have
              left?</p>
