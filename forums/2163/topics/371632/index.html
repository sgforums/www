If you're given a choice to study in University of Melbourne and Monash University ONLY in Australia, which one do you think is the best to pursue for your Commerce degree? Many say that MonashU gives you more hands on work which is closely related to the real working society, but based on ranking, it is much lower compared to Melbourne University. However, UniMelb is known for arts faculty and Commerce is part of it. It is more well-known, prestigious and recognised. Would like to hear for advice. Thanks!</span></p></div>

              <p>dude...</p>
              <p>Im a student studying in Sydney but half of my family lives in melb, so i travel to and fro quite often. I also look arnd for uni's cuz ima in yr 12.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alrite.</p>
              <p>1st things 1st. Melb uni is definitely more prestigious than Monash. Just take a look at the UAI req, or i think, now known as ATAR.</p>
              <p>Also, it depends where you live, if you live like in the city, eg like near Flinders station or along Swanston st, then its really advisable that you go to melb uni, cuz trams go along that line.</p>
              <p>If im nt wrong, Monash Uni is in the outskirts of the city.</p>
              <p>++yes. depends on the campus as well.</p>
              <p>Well. ima not too sure abt commerce courses, but there is a big diff in Melb uni and Monash uni.</p>
              <p>eg. UAI req for medical sciences -- approx 99.7~99.95</p>
              <p>where as for monash its approx --- 85~87</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>biiiig diff biiig diff..</p>
              <p>make you choice wisely. :D</p>

              <p>hello friend. I'm a Singaporean studying in melbourne university. There are many factors to be taken into consideration when choosing a university to study in. Even between a limited choice of Monash or Melbourne, you have to take into consideration the level of Ji Siao you are willing to put up with for a slightly more prestigious degree. In my opinion, and the opinion of many other students, Monash University is better run than Melbourne University, and you will definitely receive a higher quality of education. Melbourne University has a better name, and it is definitely impressive when you present your degree as one coming from such a prestigious institution. However, you must note that even though the faculty of commerce in Melbourne University tries very hard to ensure that their students receive an all-rounded approach to learning (especially under the new model), alot of things remain unaccounted for, priorities are not met, and emphasis is being placed upon money (yes, your money) rather than the quality of education. If you study in Monash University, you can be assured that you will get back 110% of your school fees in the form of your intellectual development in the School of Commerce. If you study in Melbourne University, you can be sure that your school fees will be used to pay for 42 Inch Plasma TVs which will only be installed when you leave. However, Melbourne University is a prestigious school. So it would make up for the lack of teaching quality. Choose wisely my friend.</p>
              <p>Also, Melbourne uni has more hot ang moh chicks.</p>

              <p>Can't speak for Monash, but I finished my doctorate at Melbourne Uni and buggered off as quickly as possible.  The name rests on the law and medicine faculties, and the the rest of the university's pretty damn ordinary.  Sure as hell they can't train undergrads to save their lives.</p>
              <p>It's a nice brand name to carry about, but that's about it.</p>

              <p>I got into undergrad on the basis of my A-level results, although I've seen some people either take the A-level equivalent or do a foundation year.  I haven't come across an entrance exam per se.</p>
              <p>That said, for the doctorate they did have a screening process because they had to select 12 out of 1200 Honours applicants, so they reviewed not only academic results but experience as well, and they held interviews for the shortlisted candidates.</p>
              <p>Not sure what you mean by a workable degree.</p>
