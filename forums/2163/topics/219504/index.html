And sometimes I do feel rather ashamed that I know so little about my own country. After experiencing the genuine cosmopolitan life in London, Singapore seemed rather like a desert to me.

Dont know if they had moved or was under renovation.Also had a bit of trouble changing trains at some MRT stations.When we asked people for direction in singlish they thought we were trying to be funny or trying to pick up singapore girls.In other countries you can know how rich the country is by looking at the price of Macdonalds Cheese Burger for me I always gauge the SIngapore ecocomy and standard from the price of roti pratas.Once upon a time it used to be 20 cents (with telur)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, I sometimes feel like an outsider, especially when meeting up with friends, which by now after 9 years away, they have forgotten about me.<br><br>Anyway when we do meet up, you can tell the difference, I am in casual and everyone is in 'work' wear, exchanging name cards, networking!!! I am left out of it all.<br><br>Plus my friends usually introduce me as my friend from UK!!!! and I am not, I am Singaporean. So usually I just don't open my mouth, as I don't have British accent, just plain singaporean!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I am always lost, almost a country bumpkin when I get back.<br>I don't really identify with my friends, as I did my 'growing up' in UK. I got married here, bought our home here etc.<br><br>But it's always good to go back once in awhile, but now that even my parents have come over to join me, there's less chance of going back!<br><br></div>
