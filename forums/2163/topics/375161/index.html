              <p>I think there's a difference between 'dropping' your native accent, and 'picking up' a new accent.</p>
              <p>I know lots of people who have spent many many years (like yourself) overseas working, studying and all - and still have a reasonable 'normal' accent. Sure, they don't 'lah' and all that much, and generally language structure can be different - depending on which part of the world they have been.While some may dropped their local accent, they sure don't suddenly speak like natives of another part of the world! Most speak like our news readers - almost accentless English.</p>
              <p>but.. there are also some people who spend a couple of years overseas, and come back suddenly speaking with the weirdest accent that's neither here, nor there.</p>

              <p>I learnt in a linguistic course that how accents differ is because of the way they pronounce each syllable rather than trying to pronounce the entire sentence with an accent.</p>
              <p>Singapore english (not Singlish) has its own accents because it tends not to emphasise each letter fully. For example, the word "accent". Most people pronouce it "ACK-Sen".. without the "t" lightly pronounced.</p>
              <p>Also, alot of words have its emphasis placed differently (I say differently, not wrongly).</p>
              <p>the word "Computer". Alot tend to say, "KOM pute er", while other accents tend to be "kom PUTE er"</p>
              <p>other common points are words that contain "a", "i", "u".</p>
              <p>e.g. "Ikea", North Americans say it, "eye KEE uh", Europeans/Singapore tends to say it "E kee ah"</p>
              <p>Iraq/Iran, Southern US accents mostly say it, "EYE rak, EYE ran", Singapore says it "E-rak", "E-ran"</p>
              <p>Bugis, American/English will either say it, "BUCK-eas" or "Byoo-JIS". Singapore will say it "BOOK eas"</p>
              <p>In conclusion, i would say to adopt another country's accent, we would need to actualy break down each word and see how they pronounce it.<br><br>Either way, language is dynamic and ever-changing due to local conditions (New Zealand and Aussie have distinct accents), I don't think there is such a thing called "wrong" or "right" accent just that social perception makes it think one accent "more correct" then the other.</p>

              <p>That's because most Singaporeans are chinese. chinese language is mono tone.</p>
              <p>You pronouce words in a mono tone way. One sound one sound.</p>
              <p>Ni -  Hao - Ma?</p>
              <p>That's three tones.</p>
              <p>But english is not mono tone.</p>
              <p>You don't eng - and then - lish</p>
              <p>It comes out in one complete tone - english.</p>
              <p>That is why chinese speaking english has a what they call ching chong accent.</p>
              <p>Some chinese that have lost all their chinese culture or raised on english; know nothing about chinese language won't have this accent, like some ABCs or our own Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>It's natural for chinese to speak english with chinese accent.</p>
              <p>Just like it is natural for westerners to speak mandarin with western accent. They don't really speak mandarin using mono tone like chinese do. That is why it sounds weird to us chinese.</p>
              <p>They don't say <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ni </strong></span>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hao</strong></span> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ma</strong></span>, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NiHaoMa</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because they cannot control the tone. They are used to the singular tone as in their own native language.</p>
              <p>Same goes for us chinese.</p>

              <p>That's because most Singaporeans are chinese. chinese language is mono tone.</p>
              <p>You pronouce words in a mono tone way. One sound one sound.</p>
              <p>Ni -  Hao - Ma?</p>
              <p>That's three tones.</p>
              <p>But english is not mono tone.</p>
              <p>You don't eng - and then - lish</p>
              <p>It comes out in one complete tone - english.</p>
              <p>That is why chinese speaking english has a what they call ching chong accent.</p>
              <p>Some chinese that have lost all their chinese culture or raised on english, know nothing about chinese language won't have this accent, like some ABCs or our own Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p>I migrated to Australia at 17 and now at 23, i still talk with a
              singaporean accent. The reason i want to drop it is because i
              am gonna live in australia for the rest of my life and ive got
              to adapt to the culture and people here. I'm trying to develop
              friendships at work, and with a group of ABCs but somehow
              i feel my singaporean accent is getting in the way. Has anyone here

              <p>TS.. i migrated to australia when i was 15. and im 17 now.. and yes, accents do change over a period of time. Eh.... btw, are you staying with your family? like father mother? Cause the environment you're in contributes as well.</p>
              <p>depends. How often do you talk with your peers?? Also, i think that at a young age, its easier to adapt.</p>
              <p>Compare your case with an uncle who migrate at the age of 60. His accent will barely change.</p>
              <p>Bottomline.. dont worry</p>

              <p>Some can be dual accented, they can choose the accent they want to use.</p>

              <p>Migrating to Australia dont make u an Australian, u r just an immigrant. trying to become a Australian. The truth is that u r not an Australian, are u white? or are u a Aborigine? They are the true Australians. If u r a Singaporean who has migrated there, u r just a Singaporean immigrant residing in Australia holding/ not holding Australian citizenship.</p>
              <p>Same as how we look at foreigners coming here, i believe thats how native Australians look upon us.</p>
