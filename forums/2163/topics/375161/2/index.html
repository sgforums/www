              <p>That's because most Singaporeans are chinese. chinese language
              is mono tone.</p>
              <p>You pronouce words in a mono tone way. One sound one sound.</p>
              <p>Ni -  Hao - Ma?</p>
              <p>That's three tones.</p>
              <p>But english is not mono tone.</p>
              <p>You don't eng - and then - lish</p>
              <p>It comes out in one complete tone - english.</p>
              <p>That is why chinese speaking english has a what they call ching
              chong accent.</p>
              <p>Some chinese that have lost all their chinese culture or raised
              on english; know nothing about chinese language won't have this
              accent, like some ABCs or our own Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>It's natural for chinese to speak english with chinese
              accent.</p>
              <p>Just like it is natural for westerners to speak mandarin with
              western accent. They don't really speak mandarin using mono tone
              like chinese do. That is why it sounds weird to us chinese.</p>
              <p>They don't say <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ni</strong></span> -
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hao</strong></span> -
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ma</strong></span>, but
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NiHaoMa</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because they cannot control the tone. They are used to the
              singular tone as in their own native language.</p>
              <p>Same goes for us chinese.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, it really depends on the person. Some people are naturally better at languages/accents than others.</p>
              <p>Example: my mom is a Beijing native, my dad is a Taiwan native. They both moved to the US for college, so roughly a few years apart only. My dad has an almost flawless American accent when speaking English, but can also speak Chinese flawlessly. My mom can speak Chinese flawlessly but her English has a strong Chinese accent, even after like 20-30 years.</p>

              <p>Royal Assent...and Royal Accent..  seems to be both acceptable. But more commonly Royal Assent. But i don't know how the different spelling came about..</p>
              <p>Official Canadian documents shows the Sovereign giving Royal Accent.</p>
              <p>Royal Family uses Royal Assent</p>
              <p>BBC uses Royal Accent.</p>

              <p>Flash floods and "desert fire" (whatever the hell that is) = mass migration?  That's so far out from left field it isn't even in the same suburb, junior.</p>
              <p>Your line of logic is so thin you don't have to turn it to see the other side, and on top of that you're making up rubbish like "desert fires".</p>
              <p>I've been living here long enough to see bushfires coming my way, and I ain't going nowhere, sonny Jim.</p>
              <p>I suppose you're going to bullshit and tell me now that bushfires are what you meant all along.  Pardon the hell out of me if I can't take you seriously when you can't even get simple terminology right, much less the implications of the jargon you're unsuccessfully trying to spout.  Here's another news flash, booster - bushfires have been around a helluva lot longer than thermometers, much less this newfangled global warming humbug, and we haven't had a mass migration yet, so there.</p>
              <p>Only a fool would make up hysterical stories about "desert fires" and turn it into some rubbish prediciton of the Apocalypse with everyone bailing out.</p>
              <p>Just because the slightest thing makes you run about like a headless chook doesn't mean that other people are as flimsy as you are.</p>
              <p>As for global warming, I've read the research on which the Kyoto protocol was based - have you?  Do you realise that it's based on absurd premises like third-world economies running like Los Angeles by 2035?  And then, of course, the flaming idiots who wrote that tripe stand side-by-side with the protesters who say exactly the opposite and demand that the same third-world countries are going to be broke well before then, but nobody seems to notice the glaring contradiction because they're all too busy going wah-wah-wah.</p>
              <p>The pointyheads who wrote that crap are as bloody histrionic as you are, sport.</p>
