            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... I wonder if this thread was inspired by the chat jetta and I had in SB earlier today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My two sisters have been living in California since the 80s and are married to Americans; both have opted to hold on to their Singapore citizenships for whatever reason and are still PRs.<br><br>I've been living continuously here since '89 and have been a PR since '93. Even though I qualified for citizenship status after being a PR for 5 years, I didn't feel the need to go through with the naturalization process. Why? I don't know, but I'm fairly certain it wasn't due to any kind of lingering emotional attachment to Singapore.<br><br>Last June, however, I took the plunge and initiated the naturalization process. This process will reach its logical conclusion early next month, when I recite the Oath of Allegiance with several hundred other immigrants at the state capitol.<br><br>I agree with Arapahoe's contention that relinquishing Singapore citizenship does not imply the severance of emotional ties with that country. One is, after all, still able to travel freely between the two countries.</div>
