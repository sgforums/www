              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm going to do my graduate studies in UCLA this fall and i need some advice here. </p>
              <p>Haven't been to that part of us before though i know the east coast pretty well ( did internship in mit ). Some questions.</p>
              <p>Housing</p>
              <p>I intend to stay at the grad housing in ucla but i'm wondering if its a good choice. The rental is about 1 - 1.2k and i've checked some sites with rooms around that range, some lower at around 800 900. But I read somewhere in this forum of rates that goes as low as 4-500 usd. Just wondering the condition of rooms like that? </p>
              <p>Travel</p>
              <p>I've heard much about a must to get cars in LA. Is that really neccessary? is public transport really that bad? If so what is the best way to get a license ? converting the spore license? What is the process like?</p>
              <p>Any advice is appreciated! </p>

              <p>Don't live in LA but further south. Can tell you that you need a car like you need your liver in CA. No ride, no life. Just know that insurance is expensive. Lots of unlicensed folks on the road. My experience with license conversion is more than 10 years old but I think it's possible. Hey vito corleone, help please? (Vito's in LA. Haven't seen him here in a long time though.)</p>

              <p>HI ~~ welcome to CA </p>
              <p>I hope you will have a good time in UCLA, what will you be studying? </p>
              <p>the 4-500UCD rooms that you are mentioning are probably shared rooms. </p>
              <p>It is quite expensive to live in LA, especially near the schools. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Public transportations are not really convenient in Souther California, (In Northern california, it has BART). I don't know if car is absolute necessary but it is better to have a car. BUt LA traffics are bad. Anyway, ask whatever you want to ask. </p>
              <p>I am from OC, close to LA and I can ask some friends who go to UCLA things you want to know.</p>

              <p>Ok, I jacked up the response somehow.</p>
              <p>You must be thinking of USC. UCLA is in Westwood, a much nicer
                                      area. Bel Air is just north, Beverly Hills east and Santa Monica
                                      west.</p>
              <p>CA has strict conceal-carrly laws, and unless you have a very
                                      compelling reason the sheriff in most urban counties will not
                                      approve an application.</p>
              <p>If you intend to wander further afield than the immediate
                                      surroundings, then a car is absolutely necessary. If you stay on or
                                      off campus in Westwood, you can easily walk.</p>

              <p>One more bit of advice: while the campus itself is pretty safe,
              UCLA is located in a historically dangerous part of LA. If you
              intend to stray off-campus into the surrounding neighbourhoods, you
              might want to consider arming yourself with a handgun. I'd
              recommend at least a 9mm as the minimum effective caliber for
              self-defense...</p>

              <p>Hopefully I can still contribute my 2 cents. Did my grad school there MSc and PhD. For the most part I did reside in grad school housing.</p>
              <p>Some of the UCLA grad school housing are on campus, around campus and others are a bit futher away. Those around campus will have free shuttle. One of the housing units that is further away will have free shuttle and the other, called University Village, has direct public buses to UCLA (25cents a trip with student ID).</p>
              <p>My advice though is stay AWAY from campus. The traffic may suck but least you get the feeling of leaving campus for "home".</p>
              <p>UCLA grad housing is priced under the market. So take advantage of that. They offer free TV cable and internet cable. You have to cover electricity. Trash/water all paid for. Apartments are decent and over the years, they upgraded the units regardless if you're a Democrat,  Republican, Liberal, or just plain ol' Joe.</p>
              <p>West LA's public transport is not the best but you can get around. There's even one bus from UCLA to/from LAX. There are plenty of supermarkets, cinemas, eateries around as well. If you want to explore a bit further, you can always rent a car for the weekend. There's Thai Town in Hollywood, Koreatown in Mid Wilshire, Little Tokyo in Downtown LA.</p>
              <p>Whatever you heard about LA is probably true and then some. Yes Britney Spears checked into UCLA medical for depression and Lohan was there, also MJ was pronouced dead there. Just the other day, I flipped off Ben Affleck for cutting me while driving. Not everyone is an arse. We are more friendly than New Yorkers. And yes, the porn industry is still striving in the valley.</p>
              <p>It's city that you love to hate and hate to love. That's right. It's not fog, it's really smog. When you see choppers in the skies, it can be two things: car chase or celebrities. Pple in Norcal don't really get us then again we don't get the Northerners. LA is one of the most racially diversed city you will ever visit. You can enjoy cuisines literally from all over the world, ie Ethiopian to Greek, Lebanese to Burmese and Russian to Brazillian. To the point that, you might not even care much about SG food anymore.</p>
              <p>I have one advice though: work hard. But do yourself a favor when you're here. Find some time, save up some money, rent a covertible and drive up on Pacific Coast Highway. Pop in your IPod. Let the breeze comb through your hair. Stop for lunch at Malibu Seafood. Then you will know why Angelenos like it here so much.</p>
