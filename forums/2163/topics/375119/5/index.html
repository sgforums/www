              <p>In addtition to using discount coupons as Arapahoe has suggested, you'll find that you can save a boatload of money by buying online. Internet retailers usually offer a much wider selection of merchandise at lower prices <em>vis-a-vis</em> "brick and mortar" stores. In addition, in many states, mail-order/internet purchases are exempt from sales taxes.</p>
              <p>As for my CPF funds, I never worked in Singapore as I came stateside right after my NS, so the amount in there comprises whatever paltry sum the SAF contributed during my stint in the army, plus the various election bribes doled out by the PAPpies through the years. I can't withdraw my CPF funds as I haven't gotten round yet to renouncing my Singapore citizenship in the wake of my fairly recent naturalization as a US citizen.</p>

              <p>If you decide to go, I'll try and see you there? I've always wanted to see Vegas, how over the top it is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Hope the weather is treating you fine. I truly dislike winter. My house is poorly insulated no thanks to lousy 1970s insulation or lack thereof. I can't wait to move outta here. The irritating neighbours are getting to me. You know the beer swilling, loud, trash talking types.</p>
              <p>My realtor tells us we are almost at the end of the short sale process. It's been 4 months or more, I've lost track, stopped holding my breath a long time back. All we can do now is just browse Lowe's and HD to see what they have. There's much to get done since the current owner hasn't upgraded anything since 1976. Sheesh. </p>

              <p>Buy new? If only I can get a hold of my CPF stash. Haiz. The house I'm buying was built in 1974. So you know how it goes - panelling (yuck), shag carpeting (yuck), etc, etc. There will be much to do but how I'll relish that! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>How high is your power bill? I only turn on my heat when we need it, which is maybe 4 times a month and only a couple of hours each time? At least one of us is toasty. lol</p>
              <p>These are strange and unusual times so the property market is red hot. Nothing stays on the market for long. I hope I'll like being a realtor. </p>
              <p>As for Vegas, it's tempting. I didn't realise that it's a short 5 hour drive away. </p>

              <p>6 months is nothing. My realtor says she has one client who's been waiting 16 months and counting! She says BofA is notoriously slow at processing short sales. </p>
              <p>I can tell that you're salivating, wanting to buy a place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> Patience, my dear, patience. You've only been here a short while and jmho, each time we move to a new locale, it takes us about 3 years to get to know our surroundings, etc. Truthfully, I wish we had waited to buy the house we currently own. Knowing what I know now, I certainly would not have bought this place, in this neighbourhood. Live and learn expensively, right? </p>

              <p>Yup. Got a good deal on a ticket there, so I could not pass it up.</p>
              <p>An office colleague visited the Skywalk earlier this summer and showed me pictures of it. The view is undoubtedly spectacular, but the Indian reservation that runs the attraction wants an arm and a leg in admission fees. No thanks.</p>
