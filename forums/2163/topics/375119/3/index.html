              <p>There is no tell tale signs from the building. Other than the age and condition of the home.</p>
              <p>By the time, the signs appear on your body is too late already.</p>
              <p>You can ask from your agent because it is their fiduciary duty to protect your interest. All these are<strong> real estate disclosures.</strong></p>
              <p>Please read the links I provided in my previous post.</p>
              <p>In USA, you need to keep yourself informed, advocate your own rights to protect yourself and your family.</p>
              <p>But it's likely your agent don't see a need to provide the Lead disclosure info because you have no small children.</p>

              <p>side note...i didn't have to pay commission to the agent for renting. how about buying a house? who pays the commission - buyer or seller or both parties? and usually...roughly how many % for commission? just curious.</p>

                          critical. ya..my agent looked like the blur type =P</p>
              <p>side note...i didn't have to pay commission to the agent for
                          renting. how about buying a house? who pays the commission - buyer
                          or seller or both parties? and usually...roughly how many % for
                          commission? just curious.</p>

              <p>For sales commission info. read this link. <a href="http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/wiki/Real_Estate_Commissions.asp">Real estate Commission. <br></a></p>
              <p>Hardly surprising your agent is a rookie.  Only rookies will bust their butts for small deals. Very hardworking, very interested in your needs. But not very well informed yet.</p>
              <p>I do like rookies, but if you want to use them.. you need to be well informed and do your own homework.</p>
              <p>Veteran agents only go for big fishies. They are a wealth of information and experience, but can be very picky who they want to serve.</p>
              <p>If you have a specific home you want, you can go directly to the listing agent. He/she will be very happy because the agent gets the FULL(double ended) commission instead of splitting it with another.</p>
              <p>The above is just my personal experience and humble opinion.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are infamous for being "cheap". So what da ya expect ?</p>
              <p>Another article: <a href="http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/wiki/Paying_Realtor_Commission.asp">Who pays the coms</a>.</p>
              <p>"A buyer does not pay a commission!</p>
              <p><strong>Real Estate sales commissions</strong> are paid by the
              person or business contracting the agent to list the property for sale.
              This commission is spelled out and set forth in a "listing agreement",
              and is generally specified as a percentage of the final selling price,
              with part going to the actual selling agent, and part going to the
              listing agent.</p>
              <p>Buyers should always work with the best local agent they can find,
              because they can reap the benefits of the expertise of their agent
              while shopping for a home. A good agent will have a professional
              network of associated business partners such as real estate attorney,
              home inspectors, insurance agents, title agents, appraisers, and
              mortgage loan officers."</p>

              <p>We all live and learn. But ye get the hang of it eventually.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we're all so used to having everything pre-packaged and shoved in our face.</p>
              <p>Here, ya just gotta adapt and do some research on your own. The good thing is, 90% of them information is available online. Just need to perfect your googling and yahoo-ing skills.</p>
              <p>You haven't yet establish yourself here. So banks are probably gonna give you low credit ratings.</p>
              <p>Which bank did you apply for credit card  ?</p>
              <p>For home loans, banks typically ask for your previous years  income tax statements and how much you have in your savings, then  they'll figure out your equity  and debt to income ratio. They may even limit your loan amount based on the information you furnished. Interest rates are quoted based on their assessment on your credit ratings. If your rating is poor, you get a higher interest rate.</p>
              <p>You may be able to get a small loan, if you put a big downpayment. But the banks will want you to prove you have that money in your bank first, before they'll give you the nods.</p>
              <p>But prior to submitting for loan approval, it is important you don't make any major purchases on your credit. Example, a 2K wide screen TV, or a new car.... etc.</p>
              <p>Right now, you need to focus on improving your credit ratings. Once you have a good rating, everything will be easier.</p>
              <p>I know it seem rather daunting, and I don't wana scare you lah.</p>
              <p>Imagine you are a fresh grad just starting out with zero credit rating. You'll be just fine.</p>

              <p>our bank accounts are with sovereign so we applied for the credit card with sovereign and got rejected. we also tried BOA for a secured card...so far, no news yet. my spouse might be able to get a card but 'cos i don't have a SSN...i might not be able to obtain a credit card ever? any ways to get around that? it seems like i can't apply for even store credit cards 'cos of the lack of a SSN. i feel like some illegal immigrant here =( </p>
              <p>my bank now needs me to obtain some form of tax number 'cos i don't have a SSN. they informed me that they might have to cancel my account if i don't have the tax/SSNs (they had overlooked this requirement earlier when they had approved of my account setup). unbelievable! frankly..i'm not too impressed with the level of service at the banks over here.</p>
              <p>we don't really want to bring a lot of money over to the US yet. so our bank accounts in the states aren't too impressive right now. i'd only wire money over from singapore as and when we need more. so i doubt the banks will consider us favorably for the housing loans. sighhh. only silver lining is that rental opportunities are plentiful and the rents are very low.</p>
              <p>over here...it's history this, history that...we just arrived for gods sake! how to have any form of history?! and how are we gonna get any form of history if we get rejected for everything that we applied for?</p>
              <p>only good thing was my husband managed to get a very low insurance rate for his car 'cos we requested for letters of proof of no claim history, driving history from the traffic police and our insurer back home...which the local car insurer here accepted as past driving records. i'd really advise those who are coming here and planning on driving to go get those reports. </p>
              <p>we also managed to get our car from international autosource at a reasonably good price and our car was delivered within a month of our arrival in the states (and they paid for our car rental prior to the delivery of our car)..so i'd recommend them too.</p>

              <p>our bank accounts are with sovereign so we applied for the
                      credit card with sovereign and got rejected. we also tried BOA for
                      a secured card...so far, no news yet. my spouse might be able to
                      get a card but 'cos i don't have a SSN...i might not be able to
                      obtain a credit card ever? any ways to get around that? it seems
                      like i can't apply for even store credit cards 'cos of the lack of
                      a SSN. i feel like some illegal immigrant here =( </p>
              <p>my bank now needs me to obtain some form of tax number 'cos i
                      don't have a SSN. they informed me that they might have to cancel
                      my account if i don't have the tax/SSNs (they had overlooked this
                      requirement earlier when they had approved of my account setup).
                      unbelievable! frankly..i'm not too impressed with the level of
                      service at the banks over here.</p>
              <p>we don't really want to bring a lot of money over to the US yet.
                      so our bank accounts in the states aren't too impressive right now.
                      i'd only wire money over from singapore as and when we need
                      more. so i doubt the banks will consider us favorably for the
                      housing loans. sighhh. only silver lining is that rental
                      opportunities are plentiful and the rents are very
                      low.</p>
              <p>over here...it's history this, history that...we just arrived
                      for gods sake! how to have any form of history?! and how are we
                      gonna get any form of history if we get rejected for everything
                      that we applied for?</p>
              <p>only good thing was my husband managed to get a very
                      low insurance rate for his car 'cos we requested
                      for letters of proof of no claim history, driving history from
                      the traffic police and our insurer back home...which the
                      local car insurer here accepted as past driving records. i'd
                      really advise those who are coming here and planning on driving to
                      go get those reports. </p>
              <p>we also managed to get our car from international autosource at
                      a reasonably good price and our car was delivered within a month of
                      our arrival in the states (and they paid for our car rental
                      prior to the delivery of our car)..so i'd recommend them too.</p>

              <p>No SSN ? That's odd. You still need to have a SSN when you file a joint income tax ( for married couples) .</p>
              <p>What is your visa classification again ?</p>
              <p>Social security department does issue the cards to non-working visa holders. Have you apply to them yet ?</p>
              <p> Anyway, I hear ya pain girl.</p>
              <p>Remember, this country is big and the population is bout 300 million. They won't move as fast as you are used to in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But everything does eventually fall into place. Ya just need to be patient.</p>
