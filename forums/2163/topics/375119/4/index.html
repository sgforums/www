              <p>yup indeed...according to the info provided, i need the SSN denial letter to apply for MASS licence/learner's permit. but when i went to the DMV with the letter...the staff were like "what the hell is this?". geez....</p>
              <p>i'm on H4 visa...and am not allowed to work or earn any form of income. so i don't have a SSN. i've applied for a tax number...so far no news...will see how that works out.</p>

              <p>thank god my landlords didn't ask for reference letters/good citizen records etc. i had wanted to go to the singapore police to request for the CNCC but i didn't have time.</p>
              <p>does paying my rental/utilities/telephone/cable/internet bills contribute to building up good credit history in anyway?</p>
              <p>i was worried that the overdrawing transactions (with the penalty charges) might negatively affect our credit score. would it? in any case, i told the bank AVP to waive the charges and she did.</p>
              <p>actually apart from all these admin headaches...everything else is great. we've been driving around checking out new places almost every week. we were in newport RI yesterday and the place was just so beautiful. and it's the scallop festival in buzzards bay this weekend...so we are looking forward to some yummy treats! </p>

              <p>Did you guys have Costco or American Tires? </p>
              <p>I got mine at American Tires and they have warranty replacement, I had similar situation where nail penatrate thru the side of my tire...Talks about How? and they replace it for free. Free rotation.</p>
              <p>Also the lowerest cost of Tires is $55 per tire at American Tires ......china made.</p>

              <p>It's logical that SSN shouldn't be issued to non-working non-immigrants anyway. Because if you don't have a income, there's really nothing to track.</p>
              <p>In the past, SSN had been a very convenient way of verifying your identity and making sure you're not a illegal immigrant, thus SSN took on an "off label" role.</p>
              <p>Anyway, don't get mad with SSA for some bad habits other organization adopts.</p>
