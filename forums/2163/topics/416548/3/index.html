              <p>The weather hasn't affected us directly, we're lucky to enjoy a good location. It's bad though. Flooding in the city areas, a few sink holes, closed on ramps, broken pipes, etc We're drying out now. Just in time for another round on Wednesday. How's the weather in your neck of the woods?</p>

              <p>wow...you folks really love your butter cookies!!!! can't remember the last time i ate them. everytime i buy one tin....i'd regret afterwards 'cos it takes forever for me to finish one tin....especially those yucky flavors!</p>
              <p>so our first storm was over. no big damage apart from tonnes of broken branches from nearby trees. the shovelling is gruesome....all the snow is so icy/clumpy. yucks!!  and the roads are slipppppppppppery like hell</p>
              <p>we are leaving for our long roadtrip soon!! we are driving from MA to key west......so excited. hopefully the weather conditions are flavorable. i'm bringing my thickest warmest jacket as well as my swimsuit.....tee hee</p>

              <p>It got down to -19ºF (-28ºC) this morning. At this temperature, the lining of your nasal passages and nasal hair freeze up with every intake of breath, making it a thoroughly unpleasant experience to walk outside.</p>
              <p>Vehicles also tend not to fare too well in such severe cold. I nearly didn't make it to work this morning as, after leaving the relative warmth of my garage, the cold was thickening my car's clutch fluid and causing the clutch pedal to take progressively longer to release, such that by the time I got to the park-and-ride lot, it was taking the clutch a full five seconds to engage.</p>

              <p>After that recent run of wet weather that brought flooding to many areas, we have been enjoying weather in the 70s. Talk about a U-turn! Everyone is saying this is so unusual and that this summer is sure to be a scorcher.</p>
              <p>But with good weather, there is a downside. Weeds have overtaken the back yard. More work for me. Yay.</p>

              <p>Like your new ride leh. Simi brand lai eh? Can't tell from the pic. Congrats! Hope you struck a good deal.</p>
              <p>Too bad you live so far away. I'm on 30 days medical leave. Trying to relax, destress, etc.</p>
              <p> So what am I doing? Trying to get my figures squared away for my annual tax appointment. I'm sooo buried under sooo many pieces of paper, grrr! So tempted to buy that thing you see on tv to scan and organise all receipts, recipes, etc. Also trying to get things done in the house. Like get both cars parked in the garage and not on the street. There was another spate of vehicle break ins last month just two blocks away.</p>

              <p>What's the mpgs like on your new ride? I love wheeling and dealing. :P</p>
              <p>Re: leave. Aches and pains, haiz.</p>
              <p>Yes busy working at getting my tax figures ready for my appointment next week. Sian you know. Soooo many receipts, etc, etc to consolidate and compile. As for CW, I'm not so enamoured with the game like I used to be because... I am now enamoured with Cityville. hahaha!</p>
              <p>Today, with the help of my handyman, I finally got the shed done. Tomorrow will be spent moving the overflow from the garage into the shed. I am hoping to get it all done so that I can finally  park both cars in the garage tomorrow night. After that, I am ready to sit my butt down and complete the damn tax exercise.</p>
              <p>MG, I hope you're doing okay with that Mother of all winter storms in your neck of the woods.</p>

              <p>hey folks...happy lunar new year! may the new year take all the aches and pains and cold away :P and replace them with much good health, happiness and warmth! :)</p>
              <p>heard about the lousy weather...you folks drive/walk safe and stay warm.</p>
              <p>am in the sunshine state right now...temperature is in the 80s. hot!hot!hot! i realised i no longer like "hot". can't wait to return to the new england cold.....but hopefully the sleet/ice would be gone by then.</p>
              <p>talking about instant noodles and asian spices....i buy them online from efooddepot and asiansupermarket365. the former offers a great variety and the prices slightly cheaper (soooooo many different variety of instant noodles - i buy the thai brand of tomyum noodles). but asiansupermarket365 sells some unique malaysian foodstuffs like the ipoh tau sar piah and ma ti soo that i love.</p>
              <p>sighhh.........don't remind me about tax filing time :( bleahhhhhhh</p>
              <p>all your heating bills are VERY REASONABLE!!!! i'm surprised that littlestream's heating bills are also so low. mine could be closer to $200 during this time i think.......but not complaining 'cos still much lower than my bills last year.</p>
              <p>haven't got time to sew anything since before xmas.....can't wait to get back to my sewing machine and that big stack of fabrics.</p>
              <p>are you folks cooking anything special for CNY eve reunion dinner??</p>

              <p>It's friggin' -4°F (-20°C) this morning, with a wind chill of -18°F (-28°C). I lost all feeling in the toes of my right foot on the walk in from the bus stop.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, this is the last cold snap of the winter; temps this weekend are expected to climb into to mid-30s.</p>
