              <p>It looks like things are going to get messy this weekend in the Twin Cities with the anticipated arrival tonight of a <strong>huge</strong> snowstorm that is expected to dump 24" of snow and bring with it howling winds and sub-zero (in ºF) temperatures. The winds are forecast to reach over 40 mph by late tomorrow, creating snowdrifts up to 5' and whiteout conditions, and dropping the windchill down to -25ºF (-32ºC) and below.</p>
              <p>It should be an interesting weekend. The Department of Transportation is strongly recommending no unnecessary travel during the snowstorm. I think I have enough food in the house to hold out for at least three days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>What I woke up to this morning. The snow started late last night but didn't intensify to bilzzard proportions until later in the morning, after this picture was taken.</p>

              <p>On our way to the gun show in downtown St. Paul. It was a <strong>complete</strong> mess on the roads, with dozens of cars stuck in snow both on and off the roads. It was at this time that the batteries in my camera conveniently decided to die.</p>

              <p>Back from the gunshow, and the intense winds have begun to drift the snow.</p>

              <p>The snow that drifted up against my patio door. Looks like I have a lot of shovelling to do after the storm passes.</p>

              <p>Things are really quiet on my end. No parties at all. Family lives too far away for any kind of family get together. The weather has been interesting though. Nothing like the raging weather system pelting you guys up north.</p>
              <p>Have you guys scored on any gifts? With the extended holiday shopping hours, I come home all worn out from having to stand for hours. Needless to say I am the last one to go prowl the malls for deals.</p>

              <p><br><em>WTF??!? </em>Don't you store your cars in the garage?</p>
              <p>Sorry to hear about that. At least you can draw consolation from the fact that whatever was stolen can be replaced, and your vehicles suffered no physical damage during the break-in.</p>
              <p>Do the police have any leads on who the perps might be?</p>
              <p>Both my cars are garaged when I'm home, and I also make sure that there's nothing of value in my vehicles when they're parked in public--in fact, the most valuable item in my cars are probably the tire pressure gauges in the glove compartments!</p>

              <p>DAMN DAMN DAMN! Both cars got broken into this morning. Dick heads took our sunglasses; my gps, the mounting hardware and charger; both our cell phone chargers; my entire CD selection and some stuff I had in the boot which I was going to donate to the local Goodwill. Damn it all!</p>
              <p>Both our cars are alarmed but didn't go off. There is no visible exterior damage to the cars. I wonder if there is such as thing as an alarm disabler?</p>

              <p><br><em>WTF??!?</em> Don't you store your cars in the garage?</p>
              <p>Sorry to hear about that. At least you can draw consolation from the fact that whatever was stolen can be replaced, and your vehicles suffered no physical damage during the break-in.</p>
              <p>Do the police have any leads on who the perps might be?</p>
              <p>Both my cars are garaged when I'm home, and I also make sure that there's nothing of value in my vehicles when they're parked in public--in fact, the most valuable item in my cars are probably the tire pressure gauges in the glove compartments!</p>

              <p>Since the move into a smaller home, I've had to use the garage as a catch all while I try to accommodate stuff into the house. Hence having to park the cars in the driveway. Found out after the fact that my neighbours have had their cars broken 3 weeks ago but no one told us about it. Damn.</p>
              <p>Hubster called the police, related all that was taken. I'm just glad they didn't take my license and registration or anything with our name and address on it.</p>
              <p>Lit: Of course things are not out in the open. We live in America! lol. Plus I'm not that stupid hor. :P The only clue that they had of a GPS is the round black sticker-like thing on the inside of the windshield.</p>
              <p>As for the weather.... we're getting pelted by the rain. LA is swimming under 3 inches already.</p>

              <p>That's 23 inches of accumulated snow, measured just outside my front porch today. Look beyond the ruler and you can see it's deeper where the snow has drifted.</p>

              <p>we are getting our first snow/rain storm today.....it's quite scary out there right now. 'cos our house is quite exposed.....i can hear the snow/rain slapping like crazy against the house/windows as the wind gusts are like 45-60mph...i sure hope nothing breaks.</p>
              <p>snow accumulation ain't much though....we are only expecting about 1 foot the most.</p>

              <p>I might drop by Wallyworld after work today to pick up a few extra tins of them. They were priced at $3 each before Christmas, and then discounted 50% thereafter.</p>
