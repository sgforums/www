It's amazing how the landscape has changed just from being away for 3 years. Soon as I'm able, I'm going for the Go phone. I don't make as many calls on my cell as I used to. Good thing I can write it off as a business expense. If both the kids had cells, I'd drop the land line but they don't so I can't.<br><br>Say, what do you think of the Cricket?</div>
