              It's never easy with regards to immigration. I have looked at US and Australia and both are tough. It takes 6 months to a year for them to process applications.
              
              How about Cali? Even though they have prop 8 now, I'm sure something will work out. At least the Americans are more open towards homosexuality. Or even Australia. At least they recognize same sex couples.
              
              Singapore is...... Singapore. We can never change PAP and their rigid thinking. So better to move elsewhere?

He's having entry visa which need to be renewed mthly and always have to face some snobs answer their sarcastic questions at the checkpoints.. Most of his friends with the same nationalities with kids somemore, their PR, work passes, long term all rejected. Work passes even worst, applied tru MOM website within less than one hr rejected. They simply dont care abt the families they are breaking. after all of us are human beings with feelings? Thats why I said its difficult to settle here. And I might need to move.. my husband cant take it anymore after so long not able to work... Almost 90% jobs here requires PR and higher chances for a PR to be approved u must have a job.. </em></p>

              Oops, sorry about mistaking you for a male. :D
              
              To adapt in a country, we have to be open to other cultures and people. It will be tough in the initial period (it's the same wherever you move to), but once you get the hang of things, it will be okay. You'll definitely miss your family, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
              
              I am also moving because of my OH. He will be accepted in Singapore (I think), but we are not about to try it yet.

              Wow this is sad to hear. Now I worry about the future when we finally decide to move back to Singapore. Argh! Damn Singapore!
              
              And it's even more sad to hear that they make it so hard even for people who have children! What a nasty country we're in!

Seeking lawyer's advice soon who knows one of the forummers here is a lawyer <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png">...... . Starry ur case might be different.

              <p>Hello, thanks for the tots..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yah he had a hard time answering their questions, after all he is a tourist with an approved visa. He deserved some respect.  If they are not welcome. Then dont approve their visa so they wont get into this country, just to get some silly treatments with the checkpoints..</p>
              <p>Well the story goes like this.. He ever visit Spore and fell in love with this country.. so he went back and cant forget spore.. We met at clarke quay and since then keep in touch..</p>
              <p> initially I've said no to him many times, but his strong determination and his character moved me alot, hes one of a kind and even now I dont regret marrying him coz he is really nice and I believe will make a good father too..</p>
              <p>One of the conditions to marry me was he need to settle in singapore. I only said yes when he just signed a new contract with a new company for one year. He breached it  and needs to pay a lum of $ to his employer. Then he flew over and we got married last May08</p>
              <p>One fren of mine promised him that he can get a job in his company, after checking he realised that his company reached the quota for foreign workers..</p>
              <p>Till now its hard to get a company to apply workpermit, s pass or employement pass.. even so high chances it mite get reject, coz his frens were experiencing it now.</p>
              <p>I dont mind to share He is from egypt, and before this working with british company in Egypt exploreworldwide.uk as a senior tour leader over there, then as a general manager in one hotel.. Having a bachelor degree in tourism and hotel management in Cairo Uni.</p>
              <p> I never like to relocate but after this yah like what u said food does not matter anymore as long as we are peacefully settle somewhere.</p>
              <p>Thanks again!!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>My hubby only has an associate's degree, so not good at all. It's not even from the list of unis that immigration maintains. Oh well. It sucks. I understand how you are feeling. If I were you, I would choose to move somewhere else since the country is not welcoming at all. Our govt only tries to keep the elite people and is willing to forgo anyone slightly less than elite. So why should we be patrotic? ;) I am only responsible for my parents' well being, not the country's. Country doesn't give a shit, why should we? ;)</div>
