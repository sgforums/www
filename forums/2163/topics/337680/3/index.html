              <p>It is not ICA's responsibilities to make sure your family stay together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You and your husband are the ones responsible for making sure the family stays intact.</p>
              <p> If you really think just because you are having an "anchor" baby.. your husband should have the right to become Singapore PR. You are being very naive.</p>
              <p> The ICA's responsibilities is also to ensure foreign men don't abuse the system by coming to Singapore on a visitor visa , make Singaporean women pregnant and use them ( the woman and the baby )as a ticket to get out of their God forsaken country.</p>
              <p>I pray that man don't abandon you and your baby once he figures out he's not getting where he wants to go.</p>
              <p> I feel sorry for your parents.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Jojobeach,</span></p>
              <p>R u working with the ICA?   If yes pls help to convey our difficulties.. Thanks in advance for that.</p>
              <p>I guess all married couples are aware that its our responsibility to stay together, go tru good n bad times together. bla bla bla</p>
              <p>I respect yr opinion if u said so, but what do u think of the treatment we got from them?  And why certain nationalities get their PR/workpasses/longterm approved immediately? Whats up with all the sux questions treating us like criminals? We deserved some respect too no matter what.</p>
              <p>Im the one who is not willing to move, while he is the one agreed to be with me. Only me and my parents know how much he had sacrifice for my sake, he dont need a PR or SC he just want to be with me and future baby, and hes not desparate to live in SG.</p>
              <p>"anchor" baby?? I dont really understand that term, but our baby is not made outside marriage, we went tru our traditional Muslim marriage after a year of date. I agreed to marry him only because he promised to settle in Singapore. We are glad that we are blessed with this baby and dont have to wait for so long. Both of us love children too.</p>
              <p>I have to tell you that you are wrong to say that abt him, he didnt make use of us as a ticket to get out of his country, Im not rich and he knows that before our marriage in fact he got a degree while I dont. If he wants to do that he wld have done that with rich western ladies in his tour grp. he will bring me to live with him no matter what, and till death do us apart.</p>
              <p>YES I am naive, naive till I dont know that I only make my husband suffer for mths now, naive not to know that my country is capable of doing that to us. If I have known this from the start, I wont ruin his life and dignity. I'm ashamed of my country for being prejudice and inflexible.</p>
              <p>He cant bear to leave me handling my pregnancy alone, he knows that I need him, so he will continue to accompany me for checkups and into the labour ward and then he will have to move on, and I need to understand that.  After nearly for 8mths of hardship do you still think that he will abandon me? </p>
              <p>Bad ppl comes from every part of the world, even our own citizens make mistakes/crimes, even inmates gets a second chance, but why cant we even give a chance to ppl like them.</p>
              <p>You dont have to feel sorry for my parents, coz neither me or them are suffering from his bad treatments. All of us are only suffering from the treatments from ??? I guess everyone know the answer...</p>

              <p>Newdude,</p>
              <p>You must be a very young girl and a very foolish one too.</p>
              <p>Since you have no intention of leaving Singapore.. why in the world you get pregnant BEFORE he gets his PR ?</p>
              <p>Wanting a baby before your husband can establish his PR status in the country YOU want to live.. is just plain foolish and irresponsible.</p>
              <p>There are many trans-national couples who got married and wait for everything to be completed before they have their children. It's called "family planning".</p>
              <p>You must be so ignorant.</p>
              <p>Western women will not want to marry men like your husband.. because they know too many cases of them making use of young innocent females to establish their overseas status. Much like the China girls who uses Singaporean men to get a SG PR. Once they are done and got what they want... they either abandon them or ill-treat them.</p>
              <p>If you really love your husband so much and wants your child to grow up in a complete family. You should just go to your husband's homecountry. From there.. you can apply the SG PR for your husband and the SG citizenship for your child.</p>
              <p>You may think your hubby is nice to you now.. wait till you go back with him to his country or he decides it's not worth the effort just to get his PR in Singapore. By then.. we'll see if Mr Nice Guy.. turns into the biggest mistake of your life.</p>
              <p>And your baby will be the most innocent victim who has to carry the burden of your foolishness.</p>
              <p>To protect our sisters and daughters , I'd rather ICA officers treat foreign men who wants to take the short cut to our land ... harsh.. than to have them come here and think they can easily take advantage of our securities.</p>
              <p>You know why the ICA is giving your hubby a hard time ???</p>
              <p>Just because you are married to him does not gives him automatic rights to PR status.</p>
              <p>YOU the sponsor must prove that you can support him financially for the next few years, so that he does not become a burden to the SG society.</p>
              <p>Are you financially stable and able to do that now ? IF NOT, then If he is really that capable to take care of himself in SG.. then it's best he comes in on a valid work visa..so that he can establish his capability to contribute first and take care of his wife and baby......then apply for a PR later.</p>
              <p> Not that the ICA are racist.. you want to blame , blame it on your hubby's qualifications.</p>
              <p>A few couples I know have gotten their PR and they are from middle east.. Only took them less than 6 months to get approval. Those couples have strong academic and industry experience, and they don't need to marry a SG girl to get into SG.</p>
              <p>And that part about him cancelling a contract and paying a lump sum penalty ... girl.. are you really that GULLIBLE ?</p>
              <p>Why must he quit his job just so he can marry you ?</p>
              <p>Why couldn't he KEEP that job.. come over to marry you.. and go back to his job and wait for the PR to be approved before making you pregnant ? If he had done this instead..both of you probably wouldn't be getting so much flak from ICA.</p>
              <p>So.. after all is said...my suggestion is ..</p>
              <p>Instead of having him bum around in SG.. which is making it even harder for him to get a SG PR.</p>
              <p>He goes back to his home country , find himself a decent job so as to make sure he can take good care of you and the baby.</p>
              <p>You can apply for your baby's SG citizenship while living in Turkey as long as one of the parent is a SG Citizen ( YOU).</p>
              <p>As a family that can survive on your own.. it will look better on the paper you submit to ICA.</p>
              <p>In other words.. ICA DO NOT APPROVE BUMS.</p>
              <p>So stop blaiming it on racism or anti-immigrants or terrorism. And it has got nothing to do with ICA's humanity or not.</p>
              <p>If you don't know how to make your situation look good for submission.. you're in for a rough ride FOR A LONG LONG TIME.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: #000000;">We are the ones who are goin tru all these.<span>  </span>AND WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE to label them as bums?? What proof do you have to show they did not try hard enuf? Have you asked ICA for the rejection list of certain nationalities &amp; and approved nationalities? <span> </span>Have you gone tru the job applications to know how many they have applied? Are you aware that 99% of job here requires PR? Have you seen the receipt from his ex employer the amt of sum he paid? Do you know that its stated in his contract  he cannot leave his job to fly here and go back?<span>  </span>Do you know how ppl in love will act just to be with each other? Have you realized how many CHINAs PRs/work permit holder you are surrounded now? If you have done the research on all these only then you are FIT to comment. <span> </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: #000000;">HAHA!! Why must I wait till he got a PR to get pregnant? Let me tell you that you are the PLAIN FOOLISH ONE TO SAY THAT TO ME.

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: #000000;">Why must we be childless with the situation they planned for us? We can have our first child first then continue with family planning. I also know that lah… Do you know a child is a GIFT from GOD? Shd I abort the baby just because daddy doesn’t have a PR?<span>  </span></span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">They can easily reject millions of our applications and by the way do you know that PR is renewable after 4 yrs? Do you know that when its renewed it can be rejected again? By the time we mite be childless because of infertility, and I hope that you don’t misinterpret that I’m an old girl and desperate to get married and the truth is Im not very young and Im not old. And FYI I am financially stable and have never  borrow money or ever sought any help from the GOVT or frens for financial assistance!!!!</span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">If they think they don’t want them to be a burden to the society, the more they shd do it the other way, make it easier for them to work. Not by rejecting their applications even if they managed to secure a job with an employer.<span>  </span>We believe this is not because of academic.<span>  </span>Does that mean all the other nationalities have a PHD then?? They can’t even speak simple English not to mention to hear them sing the national anthem.… </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">why edit </span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">ur</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"> long phrases to a very short good luck.. but well since Im half way tru I still post these in reply to yrs. . </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">I don’t expect </span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">ICA</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"> to bend over the rules, I expect them to be more flexible towards their citizens. They encourage ppl to marry, encourage more babies bla bla bla.. so what’s wrong to give residency to our spouse. If they can easily offered citizenship to ppl who are not even their citizens in the first place. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Yes I was the one reluctant to move, to prove that he is sincere he have to. By coming all the way here we know that he is sincere. Furthermore it’s hard if we were to get married over there. Go n check it out yrself why I said that, <span> </span>if we plan to settle here, it makes more sense to have the wedding in SG.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Besides hes a man, being a gentlemen he is suppose to go all the way for the bride.. not the other way round. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Love is unconditional “look who is talking” ?? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Call me selfish but I just need to ensure that this man that Im marrying can go tru all these challenges, then he can fit into SG, but again I didn’t expect the situation to be this bad. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Do you know that turkey and </span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Egypt</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"> is different, coz u kept on emphasizing turkey in yr last posts… They are different in culture/upbringing etc. Don’t label all of them as rotten, just because </span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">ur</span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"> fren is unlucky to get married to that chap.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Before marrying spore citizen, A foreigner has to provide ROMM with his single letter endorsed by his country embassy. Did your fren got that? <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">I don’t really trust the way they approved PR.. depends on the kindness of the officer process yr applications. However I will still try after we moved. </span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">But like I said Newdude.. if your hubby wants a chance of getting his PR.. he needs to BE EMPLOYED .. even if he cannot find work in SG.. he needs to go back and establish his career..so that he can have something to show </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">ICA</span></em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">. “ I know that, and that is why I’ve only applied for his long term pass not PR”. <span> </span>Some lucky ones managed to get PR even without a good degree or working. Again duh!!! </span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">The longer he is unemployed.. the worst his chances becomes. <span> </span></span></em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">That is why he will moved on after I gave birth, right now he is accompanying me coz he knows that I need him by my side. And its not easy to leave a job only after working for a few mths. Its only few mths more to go… </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">You do what you need to do for your family Newdude. “Yes I know that and I will fight all the way!!</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">You can shake your head at me all you want. I know of a lady who got pregnant with a Turkish guy also in the tourist industry when she visited that region on holiday. That guy insisted he wants to come to </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"> to marry her and when she finally did a back ground check.. she found out he already has 3 other wifes. Now.. she is a struggling single mother. </span></em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Jojobeach even if you are married to yr own Singaporean fella, you can still be a single parent, coz marriage is like gambling either u win or lose.. need I tell u more? So meaning most of the single parents/divorce cases out there got married to a foreigner? LOL!</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;"> I'm just warning you that .. if that can happen to other females.. it can also happen to you. </span></em><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">I already consider all the factors before I agree to marry him. So that its not an issue anymore.<span>  </span>The only thing I know who he is, Im the lucky one to have him as my soulmate and he will always be. GOD Willing! </span></p>

              <p>Newdude,</p>
              <p>Then it is just too bad. Perhaps I was hoping he wasn't from Egypt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go read this ....someone who did what you did....</p>
              <p>Click on this link,   <a href="http://marwarakha.blogspot.com/2007/11/relationship-warning-do-not-get.html">Do Not Get Involved with Egyptian Men</a></p>
              <p>She is just one of many out there....we've heard so many stories of Egyptian men who go online preying on young girls and lonely women in Myspace and face books and other social networking sites.</p>
              <p>Anyway... for your case.. the rice has already been cooked, your baby is on his/her way.</p>
              <p>All we can do is pray that you do not become one of them.</p>
              <p>That's why I say " Good Luck".</p>
              <p> This is another forum I found with plenty of warnings against EGYPTIAN MEN.</p>
              <p>Click this link , <a href="http://www.egyptsearch.com/forums/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=004698">Egyptian Men</a></p>
              <p>I'm not saying that he must be one of those scums..</p>
              <p>If he isn't .. we are all very happy for you.</p>
              <p>If he is... well.. you have been warned..and you should have thought of a Plan B for you and your baby.</p>
              <p>You must understand that Immigration policies in most developed countries are almost ALWAYS reciprocal.</p>
              <p>That means.. both party must show some acceptable level of good faith.</p>
              <p>Right now.. with your situation...it is hardly any form of good faith. Having a baby does not constitute to good faith on his part.</p>
              <p>Let's face it.. Egyptian men do have a bad reputation GLOBALLY. Do you think the government wants too many of them in our country ? Not likely so.</p>
              <p>If ICA allows your husband to simply becomes a PR because he got you pregnant.. then any scum who wants to get into our country can just go online and prey on innocent SG girls... get them pregnant and claims PR status. Is this the so called "Humanity" grounds you based your request for the rules to be relaxed ?</p>
              <p>Yes. to you.. you want to be an exception. But to ICA.. you are just one of the many who tried this route and failed.</p>
              <p>Fighting the system is one thing. It's like constantly hitting your head against the wall.</p>
              <p>If you don't know how to navigate the system.. and position yourself in a more favourable situation to ICA.....then no matter how many letters you write to them.. it will just get rejected.</p>
              <p>OK.. enough of my naggings.... all the best to you.</p>

              <p>ICA can always revise their policy, for eg, if a couple get divorced or separated the PR wld be forfeited.. this is called flexiblity.

So no excuse for not being flexible, if u really care abt ur citizens...</p>

              <p><em>Is this the so called "Humanity" grounds you based your request for the rules to be relaxed</em> ? After for so many posts its seems like u simply still dont understand, I meant They shd also think if a family is separated, what kind of problems the spouse wld be facing? still a single parent right!!!

              <p>If you don't want to understand how to fix it.. what to do ?</p>
              <p>Come back here and update us when you finally get his PR yah ?</p>

              <p> You will eventually realize that most developed countries uses similar foreign/immigration policies.</p>
              <p>For you to go to his country is rather easy, but it's not so the other way round.</p>
              <p>Yes, you say.."just revoke the PR if the marriage failed", now how will it work if that foreign man fathered a Singaporean child with a Singaporean woman and got divorced anyway ? How can you tell .. which of those foreign men are genuine and which are not ?</p>
              <p> Ask yourself .. who carrys the burden of proof that he is not trying to take advantage ? Right now... you and him have nothing to show, everything is stacked against your favour.</p>

              <p>Yes ah.... don't blame ICA what no humanity.. tear family apart ok ? Please be responsble for your own action and decision.</p>
              <p>SG just need to be very selective who they let into the country. Especially men from countries who are notorious for disrespecting women.</p>
              <p>If the Egyptian guy can proof he is really worthy.. then by all means....</p>
              <p>Why ban the whole chicken because of some bad eggs ?</p>
              <p>So... bad eggs gets ICA rejected.... good eggs.. we welcome them.... Simple as that. OK ? Good.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately... you are not the one to decide for ICA if your hubby is a good egg or bad egg. First he needs to show ICA he is a good egg.. then let ICA acknowledge that he is a good egg.</p>
              <p>Skeptical ? Sure.. we should just assume all bad eggs are good.. is that what you are saying ?</p>
              <p>OK.. so you want to marry him.. but you don't want his country. What kind of marriage is that ? So he gave up his career and family for you.. now you expect the whole country to give in to you ?</p>
              <p>Oh I'm totally sure he can prove himself.. but he can also prove his capability while he is IN his country.</p>
              <p>There's no ICA rules that says the foreign spouse MUST prove his sincerity IN Singapore.</p>
              <p>So, the only person who is not allowing him to prove himself.. is none other than you...since you decide to marry him.. you should be prepared to go to his country to live as a family. Since you are the one insisting he must be in SG.. then who to blame for tearing your family apart ?</p>
              <p>By going back with him..he'll have plenty of opportunity to prove himself that he can indeed provide for his family and take care of them. That's really what a man should be doing anyway.</p>
              <p>What relevance is your question about those who got married to locals and get divorce ? Ofcors there's a difference...</p>
              <p>Local men already are local..they are not marrying sg girls to get a PR.</p>
              <p>Foreign men who are rich ? LOL....They don't need to marry a SG girl to get a PR.. our gahmen will welcome them with open arms anyway.</p>
              <p>Right now.. your hubby cannot make it into Singapore without you.. see the difference ?</p>
              <p>very easy to understand.. why must I keep reminding you ?</p>

              <p>LOL...why be a party pooper ?</p>
              <p>You should just change the topic to... How Do we Import a foreign Spouse ?</p>
              <p>You Meia.. a legal immigrant yourself. Should know first hand.. that you can't just go to USA or other developed countries. Make a girl there fall in love with you.. have baby with her.. quit your job in Singapore .. fly there..for a few years without a work visa ... live off her below average income..and expect the Immigration authorities to grant you a PR there. Even if you do.. they'll treat you like a alien criminal and you'd be stuck in their immigration grid for years to come, worst case.. they will deport because you have violated immigration rules.</p>
              <p>Singapore's ICA is already very generous to award foreign spouse... with social visa... and in my opinion.. that's already a big mistake.</p>
              <p>If anybody wants to immigrate.. they should just do it the right way.</p>
              <p>In a forum.. we can dispense with the hokey pokey pretentious niceties and be honest with each other. Don't you agree ?</p>
