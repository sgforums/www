              <p>Yah when I asked them they said its their policy not to reveal, but one of his frens recently had some confrotation with the officers, they said they r trying to protect SG from terrorism. For those who r dating foreigners, they need to know all these esp if u r not willing  to relocate....I hope I can adapt to live in another country, but before that I will continue to fight all the way.. Hope they have some sense of humanity. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>While they are all in the League of Arab States, and of course you are right that Egypt lies in the African continent, there is no real geographic meaning to "Middle East" as the term is far too vague as to which geographical areas should be included or not. "Middle East" has been pretty much used as a term in more political/economic contexts. </p>
              <p>In absolutely any site you search for Middle East, Egypt will be there. Turkey is also included, but it is geographically considered Eurasian, sitting on the cusp of Europe and Asia. The other Middle Eastern countries are pretty much in the Asian continent. </p>
