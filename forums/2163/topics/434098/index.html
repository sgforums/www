              <p>Hi all, here's a few questions requesting for help.</p>
              <p>1) I am singaporean, how do I apply for student visa for study in uk? where do i go to apply?</p>
              <p>2) Anybody in Leicester, UK? or perhaps anyone familiar with travelling from london to leicester? I am not confident of travelling from london heathrow airport to the university. Anybody can be my guide? because i don't think the university will be so good to get someone to help me along.</p>
              <p>Its quite urgent as i will be reaching latest in august this year. I would really really appreciate if somebody could be my guide as this is the first time i would be in uk.</p>
              <p>Pllllleeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaasssssssseeeeeeeeee... its really urgent!!!</p>

              <p>I am british so cannot help you with question #1</p>
              <p>as for question #2; its too bad you are not flying to London Gatwick airport because there is direct rail link to leicester from there - or Birmingham airport is much closer.</p>
              <p>otherwise you can get a coach from heathrow to Nottingham and it stops in Leicester, takes about 2hr + 20 mins. :)</p>

              <p>other general advice/information since you are coming to UK for the first time;</p>
              <p>1. in singapore you got very low crime rates, so you may be used to taking liberties such as going out at night alone. Please don't have this attitude in Leicester...especially if you go outside the city centre. there is lot of crime and gangs violence in leicester. honestly its not known to be a very nice place. stay in city centre or student areas where its more safe.</p>
              <p>2. if you arrive in leicester and get confused because everyone is Indian...do not worry, you have reached your destination :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. bring warm clothes</p>

              <p>1) The British High Commission <a href="http://ukinsingapore.fco.gov.uk/en/visiting-uk/visas/">website</a> is a good place to start, as are these guys <a href="http://www.vfs-uk-sg.com/visa-info.aspx">VFS</a></p>
              <p>2) National Rail's <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">website</a> indicates that trains bound for Leicester leave from the St Pancras railway station. Take the Underground from Heathrow (buy your oyster card at the station office, keep it for travel in London and return it to get your deposit and remaining value back), get off at King's Cross/St Pancras and follow the signs.</p>
              <p>You can buy your ticket to Leicester there and then at the ticket office. If you plan to stay in London a day or so, buying your ticket by 6pm the day before you leave gets you cheaper advance fares.</p>
              <p>But Larry is right, Heathrow's not the closest airport. Birmingham is the nearest major airport. Lots of European carriers (and Emirates too) fly there. Choose wisely.</p>
              <p>If you expect to travel around GB a lot, at any railway ticket office, you can pay for a 16-25 railcard which gets you 1/3 off the train fares. You'll need to show your passport.</p>

              <p>I've been only to Northampton. It's a small town surrounded by villages, famous in the past for producing shoes, and it has a top rugby team. Very few buildings are more than 5 storeys high. If you like racing, Silverstone is minutes away (make that hours when Formula 1 brings the traffic jams). It's on the main line between Birmingham and London, so it takes just over an hour to get to the capital by train.</p>
              <p>Sheffield, Doncaster and Hull are in Yorkshire (south, south and east respectively), which is in the north (still just over 2 hours from London).</p>
              <p>P.S. Travelling by coach is cheaper, of course, but I personally despise dealing with road traffic.</p>
              <p>And if you do go to Leicester, don't be shy and miss the Deepavali/Diwali celebrations there.</p>

              <p>i checked emirates, they have direct from sg and the prices are quite fine. so in your opinion, birmingham would be closer to leicester? what transport do i take at birmingham airport?</p>
              <p>i dont think i have time to linger around in london or other places. i would be travelling to university straight away. i dont trust coaches too. prefer trains. i just want to get to university in the fastest and least hassle way.</p>

              <p>you said "direct from sg"...im pretty sure emirates always go via dubai, maybe thats what you meant. im flying from birmingham to singapore via dubai in a fortnight.</p>

              <p>getting from Bham airport to leicester is easy, its 10 minutes train journey from airport station to birmingham new street station (officially UK's ugliest building...not good way to begin your stay xD) then direct train to Leicester about 50 mins.</p>

              <p>You will have to change planes, and the length of the stopover depends on the flight you pick for the next leg of the journey. The shortest I found for SG to Brum is 2 hours.</p>
              <p>As long as all the flights on your journey are with the same airline, you don't have to think about lugging your luggage around, it will be checked-in through to your final destination. I've done it countless times.</p>
              <p>To get to Leeds this way, however, you need to fly with KLM, and you'll have a stopover in Amsterdam. It's the only airline that flies to both SG and Leeds.</p>
              <p>And if you're going to carry loads of luggage to Manc, instead of flying SIA, save some money, fly with Emirates and you'll get 30kg baggage allowance. That's 10kg more than other airlines (unless you're flying to the Americas)</p>

              <p>You'll be surprised by the amount of stuff you accumulate when you're abroad. I had to post some stuff home and check in more than 35kg after just 6 months. Luckily the baggage allowance in the US is 45kg.</p>

              <p>It depends on what the airport offers. Almost all have duty-free shopping, many have free wi-fi or internet kiosks, and a few like Amsterdam and Seattle have museums and galleries.</p>

              <p>anyway was talking with one just now, we argued because our views differ as he feels that i should bring more winter clothings (he change his tees every 2-3days), but on other hand i would prefer to bring more summer tees as i feel i could change them everyday (a similar coat /jacket shouldnt be a problem to be worn everyday aint it?) and dont forget need to buy more long-johns...</p>

              <p>Save some space and buy your winter clothes there, where you can find nicer stuff at better prices, even in charity stores. You should still pack a windbreaker and a jumper/sweater because it can get wet and windy even in summer. That and one pairs of long johns will suffice for the first week or so.</p>
