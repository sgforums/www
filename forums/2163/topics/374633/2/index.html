              <p>i've been trying to find toe socks but to no avail.....</p>
              <p>my landlord's place has got lots of rugs and carpets...but they were still wearing their shoes indoor. i'm not really used to that....i have indoor slippers that i change into at the door entrance for walking around the house.</p>
              <p>another thing that require getting used to is the fact that people enter their houses through the backdoor instead of the front door. my landlord didn't even give me the key to the front door.....</p>
              <p>but over here...most people don't lock their houses/cars...that's what amazes me the most. like some of the rental houses that the agents brought me to....we just walked right in as the houses were all not locked even though no one was in there.</p>

              <p>Toe socks?  Hard to find, but got lah, maybe not as cheap as what you get from Sg.</p>
              <p>Find those japanese supermarkets, sure will have.</p>
              <p>And you mean the folks comes in thru the service entrance?  Where you park the rubbish bins?</p>
              <p>Or they come in thru the garage?</p>
              <p>And wear shoes in the house is normal,  you maybe have to provide shoe covers to your visitors and guest to cover their shoes for walking around in your house.</p>

              <p><br>1 more months when the weather get cold in your area. I try not to leave shoes outside as crawlers of all kind will try to get into the house.</p>
              <p>MA  houses are old and as to why landlord would not let you have front door but only back door keys. Sometime they made certain decision for whatever they foresees but when you get to know the landlord bring the subject up in a casual conversation see what the landlord said. (poke abit see why...?) it is for fire safety to have access for both doors. Let them know you won't changed the lock.</p>
              <p>Right you only push out the trash the night before the collection. so that it won't block the driveway.</p>
              <p>Jap market....have you smoke out the asian community in your area yet? check around if there are no japs market try Korean market. They have similar items.</p>

              <p>Our relocation package comes in the form of a lump sum, for us to spend on whatever we wish. That's why I need to arrange for all our air tickets and movers etc. We are already bringing 2 dogs with us, so I don't know how much more excess baggage we can check in.</p>

              <p>Jojo, sorry to disappoint you, but I have already settled our housing. We'll be in a very nice community with beautiful dog parks around the area. Even for rental properties, most of them only ask for a one time USD250-300 pet deposit and maybe an extra USD10-15/mth for pet rent. Would you relocate with your kids without finding out about schools first? How can anyone be so clueless? You are such a sad and vicious person, to find pleasure in another person's problems. Do you have to put people down to feel better about yourself?  </p>
              <p>FYI, I have studied, lived and worked in North America for most of my adult life. I'm not some blur goondu going overseas for the first time, so you can find someone else to impress. So much for expecting fellow Singaporeans to be helpful. Just so happens that for this relocation, I need to move more stuff than before. I want to thank those of you here (as well as from another forum) who have provided me with really good leads.</p>

              without finding out about schools first? How can anyone be so
              clueless? You are such a sad and vicious person, to find pleasure
              in another person's problems. Do you have to put people down to
              feel better about yourself?  </p>
              <p>FYI, I have studied, lived and worked in North America for most
              of my adult life. I'm not some blur goondu going overseas for the
              first time, so you can find someone else to impress. So much for
              expecting fellow Singaporeans to be helpful. Just so happens that
              for this relocation, I need to move more stuff than before. I want
              to thank those of you here (as well as from another forum)
              who have provided me with really good leads.</p>
              <p>Now let's stay on topic please.</p>

              <p>Wow.. I'm soo impressed..... with your ability to clench those butts so tightly... Singapore style.</p>
              <p>Come come, share with us forumers what intel you had gathered so far. I bet the movers list will come in really useful.</p>
              <p>Have fun in USA.</p>

              <p>Thanks. I'll be contacting some of the movers soon and I'll post about my experience dealing with them. Hopefully it will benefit other Singaporeans who are moving overseas. As for your other question, we're relocating to the east coast.</p>

              <p><br>Alot of the truck lines relations are really agencies or owner operators. They would basically unload your belonging with some DC and truck it to your place of resident.</p>
              <p>Since you are in the East check with whoever service provider you engage for the cost of East coast portvs West coast port . East port of entry would be NY, Charleston SC. or further south would be Everglades. FL.</p>
              <p>If you are concern about your belonging or furnitures than you would basically find out where they are unloading and choose your local mover in the state side to pick it up.</p>

              <p>although i didn't use a mover....my friend who had relocated from singapore to the US (east coast) recommended Crown and Astro. you might want to check those out.</p>
              <p>which part of east coast USA will you be relocating to?</p>
              <p>it's good that you can find rental easily. where we are staying - around buzzards bay....we had viewed too many houses/apartments that refused to rent to people with pets.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the well wishes. I've contacted a bunch of movers and Crown was the first to get back to me. Very prompt in returning calls. When I told the lady to call back in 30mins because I was driving, she called right on the dot. Then I was busy collecting my passport and told her to call at 4pm, again right on the dot. I've heard good things about Crown. So far, I'm not impressed by the time the others are taking to get back to me.</p>
              <p>I'm trying to get quotes now, so I'll see how the others fare in terms of service and price.</p>
