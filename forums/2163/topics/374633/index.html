              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm new here. My wife and myself will be relocating to the US soon. I was wondering if anybody has any good reliable movers to recommend. We are considering moving some of our furniture over with us if the price is reasonable.</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Well if TS already filled half a 20ft container before furniture than it is possible to just top it up with whatever junk. After all TS already paid for the entire container.</p>
              <p>BUT the cost is going to be incurred at destination since container may not allow to cross state line. It has to DeVan along the coast and truck it to the house so that might cost more if its fully loaded.</p>

              <p><br>I think it has to do with custom and liabilities especially personal effects.</p>
              <p>LCL would not be wise as other freights got stack ontop of your nice furniture....for 2 weeks. If everything come in a box thats fine but again not everything can be stacked.</p>

              <p>yes...agree that unless your furniture are antiques or family heirloom...otherwise, forget about shipping them. too much hassle...not worth the effort. there are much cheaper, better furniture in the US!!!!</p>
              <p>anyway...we've more or less settled in. we only packed 6 boxes of stuffs and shipped them by FedDex. items received within 2 days of mailing. so convenient and fast! i had eye glasses and other breakable stuffs in the boxes...but everything was intact and in one piece when the boxes arrived. only small problem was FedDex requested me not to mail food stuffs...so i didn't ship my spices over.</p>
              <p>everything else that you might need (&amp; more)...you'll be able to find it in US. we've been shopping like crazy since we've arrived. think i've done enough on my part to boost the US economy...hahaha.</p>
              <p>the place that we've rented comes fully furnished...so that helps a lot. everything that i need is available...including utensils, appliances etc. electrical appliances are very affordable in the US....so forget about bringing all your appliances which are likely not to work in the US.  </p>

              <p><br>is it alot?? most people were surprised that we only have 6 boxes of stuffs.</p>
              <p>think out of the 6 boxes...at least 3 boxes were clothings/bags/shoes. the rest were some books, eye glasses/contact lens, 1 microwave rice cooker (haha!) and a few stainless steel dishes, toiletries...that's all....nothing for you to rob lor!! =P</p>
              <p>but after the last few weeks of shopping...now we've got tonnes of stuffs....dunno how to lug them around when we have to move out of our rental place next year??!! will probably need one of those big u-haul containers.</p>
              <p>so far i haven't seen costco....what's that? around my area...only have Walmart, Target, Sears, Best Buy etc.</p>

              <p><br>That sounds like the suburbs.  You need a membership to go to Costco, so maybe a check online to see where the the nearest to you and go take a look.</p>
              <p>But if its only you and hub, maybe no need to shop at Costco, cos their bulk buying.....is really bulk!</p>

              <p>Target, Sears and Best Buy are good. So planned out the Next GREAT BUY ---- which is Thanks Giving Sales. So save up and prepared to shop.</p>
              <p>By the time you move yeah you would need to rent a U-Haul.....ha ha ha.</p>
              <p>Costco is inbetween a Hypermart to Sears/Bestbuy. Food items are sold in bulk and you can buy practically from a Diamond to a TV, books, clothing...everything.    </p>

              <p>oh yeah..i've been seeing a lot of fake crocs around...thank goodness i left all my crocs at home instead of lugging them with me. the crocs are really useful for lawn work 'cos they are waterproof. you folks wear socks at home? i just wear my indoor slippers....</p>
              <p>anyway...think the US rental market is quite bad these days? there were many houses available for rent at pretty decent prices. we went to see many 'cos we couldn't decide where to stay at first...and subsequently, the houseowners were all calling and offering to reduce their rents and help subsidise our utilities to entice us to rent with them. in the end, we got this pretty big house (3bedrms &amp; 2baths) in a very good neighbourhood for less than usd900. we thought it's quite a bargain! there were some going for usd600-700 but 1-2bedrm ones.  </p>

              <p><br>With my sister's place......I leave a pair of fake crocs at the front porch, for walking out to collect parcels.</p>
              <p>Another pair at the garage, for going in there to pick up stuff and dump rubbish and so on.</p>
              <p>Another pair at the back garden, for rushing in and out with the kids.  With socks.  Me old with bad blood ciculation, so socks to go out is a must.</p>
              <p>Sis's place is carpeted, so no shoes in the house.</p>
              <p>At the Houston place, there is a need for a pair to be worn in the kitchen, cos kitchen is cold at night and in early morning.</p>
              <p>And its thicker then room slippers to cushion the feet when needing to stand there do cooking and chores.</p>
              <p>And they should be fake, cos if real ones got lost, very heart pain!</p>
