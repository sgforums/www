              <p>Head for Target in their travel section. You'll find the adapters you need there.</p>
              <p>Nice and affordable meal? I highly recommend Rubio's. Their fish taco is heavenly. Sample all their salsa bar offerings to go with your fish taco. </p>

              <p> anyway u are already in the country. so just make sure you make a copy of the I-94 (white card) keep it with you. If you leave the country u surrender the original I-94 so you don't have problems in re-entry.</p>
              <p>Hows settling down?</p>

              <p>I'd pick AT&amp;T for their GSM network that allows you to make and receive overseas calls. T-Mobile also runs on the GSM network. Those that run on CDMA are Sprint and Verizon. Ask for discounts if you can. If you decide to get AT&amp;T for your home phone, TV and broadband, you could get bundled services which may afford you discounts.</p>
              <p>You could also look into buying phone cards or like jjb says, Skype.</p>
              <p>I found a Sg club in my area and attended a couple of get-togethers. I really didn't feel any kinship with them, sad to say.</p>

              <p><br>That would be a no because you would still need to get insurance, etc. You will also have to sit for the practical and written tests. Here's a site you need to check. <a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov">www.dmv.ca.gov</a></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Go to the Singapore traffic police website and print out your Driving license certificate of merit</p>
              <p>You need to start calling up the insurance companies to get liability insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>You can buy a car without a liability insurance.. but you will not be able to REGISTER your car at DMV without it.</p>
              <p>And driving without a liability insurance in CA is ILLEGAL.</p>
              <p>Try Progressive Insurance. Your initial cost of coverage will be high due to your lack of in-country driving record and your age. Shop around for the best deal. Not all companies are willing to cover international drivers with no in-country driving history.</p>
              <p>Once you get the approval for your liability from the insurance you can go purchase that car of your selection.</p>
              <p>Once you have established driving history with your CA license under current insurance .. you request for a lower coverage costs from your current or other insurance company. Typically one year of driving is good.</p>
              <p>Liability insurance only protects you from legal liabilities if you get involve with an accident with another party.</p>
              <p>Coverage for theft and collision is a separate insurance option on top of your liability.</p>
              <p>So if you buy a disposable car.. you don't have to worry about the theft and collision because that is not a legal requirement.</p>
