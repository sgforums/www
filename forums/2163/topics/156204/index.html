One quiet town up north east.  Have you heard of Stouffville?  Yeah, there.<br><br>Yeah, GO LEAFS GO.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>By the way, have you eaten at Lion City yet?  Over on the East side, you may wish to try out Coconut Island.  Their wat tan hor is the best.  They are on South West quardron of Kennedy/Hwy 7.  Another one is Restoran, on Major Mac and Bayview.  South East side, on Major Mac.  Their rojak is good.  Both run by M'sians.  People telling me the best one is Matahari, downtown.  Don't ask me where 'cos I've never been.  Heard it is upscale so can expect it to be pricey.<br><br>Well, happy eating or trying out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
