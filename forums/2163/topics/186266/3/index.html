The original Tacoma Narrows bridge was brought down by wind gusts back in the thirties, when winds blowing through the narrows were just at the right speed to cause the bridge deck to oscillate at its resonant frequency, resulting in the deck failing and collapsing.<br><br><img src="http://washington.pacificnorthwestmovies.com/TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse/narrows02.jpg"><br><br>I should have more images up soon.
