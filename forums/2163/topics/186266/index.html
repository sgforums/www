We also toured the USS Turner Joy, which was a Forrest Sherman-class destroyer moored next to the ferry terminal and open to the public.<br><br>While at Bremerton, on the advice of one of the locals, we took a foot ferry over to Port Orchard for lunch at Myhre's (or was it Myhle's) Bar and Grill, which was recommended to us.
