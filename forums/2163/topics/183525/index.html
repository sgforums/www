As we've been told repeatedly, a vacation in Seattle isn't complete without a visit to Vancouver, BC, which apparently is a mere three-hour drive north.<br><br>We are incorporating a two-day, one-night stay in Vancouver into this trip, and have already made the necessary hotel reservation.<br><br>As this will be my first visit to Vancouver, I am wondering if anyone (particularly the Singapore contingent currently in Canada--you know who you are!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) can suggest places of interest there (apart from Chinatown) that might be worth visiting during our two-day stay.<br><br>Thanks in advance!<br><br>MG<br><br></div>

If I had known that, I would have made a reservation at a hotel in that area. How far is Richmond from Vancouver proper? The hotel at which we're staying is located along Kingsway and is, according to their website, less than a 15 minute drive to downtown Vancouver. Needless to say, we'll be visiting Richmond and hoping to have some <strong>real</strong> Chinese food there. Perhaps even some Hainanese chicken rice!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>How's the public transportation in Vancouver?

On the bus, it took me about half an hour.<br><br>Actually if you drive up from Seattle, you will pass Richmond anyways.  Their MAIN road is No. 3 Road.  You can stop by Steveston.  There's a Fishermen's Wharf.  Go eat Fish n Chips.  You can see boats docked up there with their catch.<br><br>Parking?  Hmm........I didn't drive there so not sure.  But if you are downtown, and weather is good, you can park somewhere and then walk around town.  BUT BE SURE TO BRING A BROLLY!!!!<br><br>Remember the joke?  It rain twice in Vancouver.  Once for 4 days and the other for 3 days!!!

Only LRT, sea bus and land buses.<br><br>Sea bus to take you across to North Vancouver.  If you drive, you take the Lions Gate Bridge to West Vancouver.  Mind you, THAT is the only "driving" way!!!

The view from up there is spectacular.<br><br>Then you must go downtown and jalan jalan. Pike's Place Market is a unique place. You see fishmongers throwing fish from one person to another. There are also lots of other vendors there. People like to sit along the grassy areas on nice days. Right across the street are lots of little hidden shops. I found this corner shop selling Malaysian food. Yum!<br><br>You remember Twin Peaks? It was filmed in a little town in Snoqualmie. The waterfalls there are fabulous. You can even hike the trail down to the base of the falls. I have photos if you want to see?<br><br>Can't remember what else to tell you so I'll just post as I remember.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, based on reponses received thus far, plus a bit of research, I've come up with a list of worthwhile things to do in Seattle:<br><br>1. Visit the Space Needle.<br>2. Visit Pike's Place Market.<br>3. Go on the Boeing plant tour in Everett.<br>4. Visit the Bremerton Navy Museum in (duh!) Bremerton.<br>5. Visit the Kinokuniya bookstore in downtown Seattle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>6.

They have parades and lots of festivities. Then you can go on a Ship Open House. Hubby will be able to be your tour guide. Around the same time, the Pullayup Fair is a big deal and a must visit.<br><br>And you mustn't, mustn't, mustn't miss a trip to Mt St Helens. Awesome, awesome sight. Plus you'll be passing a factory outlet along the way down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Before you leave, you must buy some Pullayap scone mix back with you. You can find these and other Washington favourites at a Made In Washington store. Here's the link: www.madeinwashington.com</div>
