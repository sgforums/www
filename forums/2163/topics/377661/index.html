              <p>It's even worse in Singapore, wages are being suppressed by foreigners, you hardly make enough to go by, let alone consider about medical insurance and retirement savings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Due to the high influx of foreigners (government's policy to increase the population to 6.5 million), wages have been suppressed due to oversupply of labour, while prices have inflated beyond an average person's means.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The price of a 2 "bedroom" HDB (which is listed as 3 room) cost an average of $240,000. For a loan of $240,000, 30 years repayment period, interest rate of 4%, you would need to pay $1,156 per month. It would be difficult if your household income is $4,000 and you have kids and parents to feed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It's easy to find yourself in that tax bracket even if you're making less than US$100,000 if you live in a state with high state income and/or property taxes. Keep in mind that these taxes aren't uniform across all states.</p>

You don't get to deduct medical bills (e.g. spectacles, medicine, medical procedures, etc) from your gross income to derive at your taxable income. You don't get to deduct medical bills off your gross income in Singapore. GST in Singapore is a flat out on all products and services, in USA (in some states) sales taxes are not applied to clothing, food and medication.</p>
              <p>What's the highest sales tax in US? California? 8.25%? Even then, they have sales tax exemption of basic food items. In Singapore it's a flat out 7% GST on everything.</p>

              <p>You also can't make a fair comparison without taking into account the worker's wage both in Singapore and USA. The figures posted are from BLS, it is the average earnings of production and non-supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls.</p>
              <p>For goods producing industry it's US$19.33/hour and construction industry is US$21.87. I can add mining and logging for comparison because Singapore doesn't have a mining and logging industry.</p>
              <p>Higher wages coupled with higher taxes, it's still manageable. Lower wages but slightly better than higher taxes, it would be difficult.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much do you think our workers in manufacturing and construction industry get? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Maybe slightly better than a PRC worker (in the future), afterall our main labour force is PRC.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you guys really think that the higher wages with higher taxes are difficult to survive in the US, then perhaps you should come back to Singapore, have PRC wages and work hours, but you get slightly lower taxes. We welcome back the locally born Singaporeans to help us combat the PRC invasion with open arms. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Certain tax credits and adjustments, such as child and dependent care credit, adoption expense credit and deductions for qualified educational loan interest (there are probably others, but these are the more common ones), are only available if you file a joint return with your spouse. The child and dependent care credit, in particular, is very popular amongst families with young children.</p>
              <p>You are correct: California's sales tax rate of 8.25% currently makes it the highest in the nation.</p>
              <p>With regard to tax deductions for medical bills, the IRS currently only allows you to deduct the portion of your medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, and only if you itemize the deductions. It's a nice benefit, but if your medical expenses are that high, you definitely have other things to worry about! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>I am curious about one thing: has anyone in Singapore ever calculated the effective tax rate <em>as a percentage of gross income</em>, that factors in all the various taxes (income tax, GST, etc.) that a person living and working there would expect to pay at various income levels? Aside from my NS stint, I've never worked in Singapore and am unfamiliar with the tax situation there.</p>

              <p>The joint filing tax rates are lower, but the combined adjusted gross income will likely be higher and result in about the same amount of tax paid.</p>
              <p>I'm looking at the 2008 tax tables in my 1040 booklet right now (you can probably get to the same information on the IRS website). Let's assume a married couple, each having a taxable income of $35,000:</p>
              <p>If each filed separately, they would each be paying $5,100 to the IRS, for a total of $10,200.</p>
              <p>If they filed a joint return with a combined taxable income of $70,000, they would be paying $10,194 to the IRS.</p>
              <p>So whether you file separately or jointly, the total tax burden would be about the same; the tax tables make sure of that.</p>

              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/253131">deepak.c</a> - Do you live, or have ever lived in the US? If not, those of us who do know that your quotes of the stuff you find online isn't accurate. And this thread isn't about PRCs or anything besides noting the high taxes we have in the US, so there's really no need to get worked up about it.</p>
              <p>One huge thing to note about making $$$ off flipping houses in Singapore...NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX!!!</p>
              <p>I was just in LA last weekend and met up with a buddy of mine who's lived there for the last 15 years. We were both lamenting about how our friends in SG have sooo much more disposable income than we do here in the US, just so much more cash-rich.</p>
              <p>We surmised that the fact that Sporeans mostly live with their parents till their 30s or so, so it's a long time to not pay rent/mortgage. Besides, when they do get a place of their own, the CPF handles that so there's usually no out of pocket mortgage payments like us. And then we have to contend with property taxes!</p>
              <p>With the inevitable devaluation of the us$ in the near future, coupled with high inflation, medical costs, and a bankrupt Soc Sec fund...it's time to hit the Mega-millions, it's up to $122,000,000!</p>

              <p>Certain tax credits and adjustments, such as child and dependent care credit, adoption expense credit and deductions for qualified educational loan interest (there are probably others, but these are the more common ones), are only available if you file a joint return with your spouse. The child and dependent care credit, in particular, is very popular amongst families with young children.</p>
              <p>You are correct: California's sales tax rate of 8.25% currently makes it the highest in the nation.</p>
              <p>With regard to tax deductions for medical bills, the IRS currently only allows you to deduct the portion of your medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, and only if you itemize the deductions. It's a nice benefit, but if your medical expenses are that high, you definitely have other things to worry about! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
              <p>I am curious about one thing: has anyone in Singapore ever calculated the effective tax rate <em>as a percentage of gross income</em>, that factors in all the various taxes (income tax, GST, etc.) that a person living and working there would expect to pay at various income levels? Aside from my NS stint, I've never worked in Singapore and am unfamiliar with the tax situation there.</p>
