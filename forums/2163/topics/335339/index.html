              <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;">I just feel sad after reading this news... Haix... why got such people so perverted... Ask the 4 ppl to strip and rape them, its really really bad, and she has to die... <br><br>I have to admit, the girl looks cute in this picture. <br>But IMO, the press should not publish the photos of the deceased to show some respect to her, at least thats my views... If i am parents, i certaintly dun want the picture to appear in the news. <br><br>And also, australian laws are too lenient to these people. In singapore, I always complain our system is to brutal and harsh, why cane people who commit offense only once? But looking at australian laws, i seriously think singaporean law is better here, its harsher, but for these sort of perverts, they should be caned.<br><br>Sometimes i wished, those human rights people will shut their trap, if they look farther, more cases like this might not happen. <br><br>My condolences.... Haix</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;">They lost
                  their home and possessions in an earthquake earlier this year — now the
                  parents of a Chinese student who plunged naked to her death will travel
                  to Sydney to recover the dead body of their only child.</p>
              <p>The parents of Liao "Elva" Wei, 18, will make the sad journey as her
                  Korean boyfriend Tae Wook "Chris" Han, 19, recovers in hospital after
                  the couple's terrifying home invasion.</p>
              <p>Ms Wei's mother "thought Elva was safe here," a family friend was quoted by the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> as saying.</p>
              <p>An intruder held the loving couple and two other Asian students at
                  knifepoint inside Ms Wei's Waterloo unit on Monday,<strong> repeatedly sexually
                  assaulting two of them as the others were forced to watch. </strong></p>
              <p>Ms Wei and Mr Han tried to escape their attacker by jumping off the third-storey balcony.</p>
              <p>But the teenage girl died in the 25m fall onto a nearby concrete path
                  and her boyfriend sustained two broken legs, a fractured pelvis and
                  fractured vertebrae.</p>
              <p>A family friend said Ms Wei's mother was struggling to come to grips with her daughter's tragic death.</p>
              <p>"Her mother just say: 'Why? Why?' She can't believe it," May Zhang, 17, Elva's closest friend in Australia, was quoted by the <em>Telegraph</em> as saying.</p>
              <p>Ms Wei travelled to Australia on a student mid-last year from her home village in the Sichuan province, central China.</p>
              <p>She was due to sit exams at the end of this month as a part of a
                  bridging course to study accounting and economics at Sydney University.</p>
              <p>A Waterloo Study Centre spokesman told AAP he had made contact with the
                  families of both Ms Wei and Mr Han and was working on bringing them to
                  Sydney.</p>
              <p>Police described the intruder as an "opportunistic" robber who entered
                  the Waterloo unit and subjecting his captors to repeated sexual
                  assaults before leaving with less than $200.</p>
              <p>Mr Han has been making statements to police as he recovers in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.</p>
              <p>Police are still looking for the armed intruder, described as a man in
                  this 30s, 175cm tall, of solid build, with a dark complexion.</p>

              <p>I agree that this is indeed tragic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I can't see how the absence of caning as a punishment in the Australian criminal justice system has anything to do with this case. Singapore has always using caning on rapists and sexual offenders, but there are still rapists and child molestors perpetuating against women and children in Singapore.</p>
