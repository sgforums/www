              <p>jojobeach, i do NOT think i've said anything offensive or whatsoever. Those are my views. Maybe sick is a strong word, or shall I say boring, stagnent. I do have affection for Singapore as I grew up here and proud of it. Wait, did i mention a word of hate?Why judge me so quickly over after misusing a word?</p>
              <p>I am here to seek help and answers yet I happened to accidentally "provoked" jojobeach without realizing. I did mention I APPRECIATE replies from yours and jetta. Since its so easy to be misunderstood communicating via forums, I guess its such a pity for you that even after living in the US for sometime, you jojobeach still habours the island mentality. I know even though you're older than me, I would recommend you to be a bit more mature, BIG HEARTED and think for other's comments and views before being quick to sound "SARCASTIC and CRITICAL".</p>
              <p> I guess your knowledge of overseas chinese is so insufficient, perhaps you should visit or live in more asian countries to get a bigger picture of how the asian society works. If you're so comfortable why move or work in the US? Its rather easy to flame or be critical behind the computer because its the easiest to provoke people's emotions by being a hero behind a computer. Well, hats off to you for succeeding that. Because its no use to argue back as it'll never end. And i know thats what you do BEST??</p>
              <p>Jojobeach Whatever reply you will make doesn't concern me, it can only show what kind of "helpful" and "petty" person you are. Like I said, I am new here, thats why Iam here asking questions. Singaporeans like you are giving a bad name to this nation. Shame of you man jojobeach.</p>

              <p>Oooooo.. now Singapore is "Boring" and " Stagnant" eh ? Tsk tsk.. your parents obviously never teach you some manners.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can "THINK" before you post your stupid comments.</p>
              <p>Well, is there not some Indonesian Overseas forum somewhere in this world ?I'm pretty sure they will be MOST helpful to ya and less petty too.</p>
              <p>It's best you can go post your stupid comments in those forum and seek help there. Opppss.. is "STUPID" too strong a word for you ?</p>
              <p>Big hearted .. hohoho... dude.. wake up ok .</p>
              <p>You use this kind of talking in USA.. you'd be careful you don't get beaten up by the kids in school.</p>
              <p>While Singaporeans are not typically confrontational at <strong>foreigner's stupidity, </strong> the Americans dont' get their "freedom" by being weak and tolerant... they WILL take turns giving you some good old fashion American ass whooping to teach you some manners.</p>
              <p>So yah..why don't you consider this " TOUGH LOVE" instead of sarcastic and critical eh ?</p>

              <p>Good journey Vito.</p>
              <p>Please remember to TIP your server at restaurants.</p>
              <p>Standard practise is  minimum 15% of the bill  , or more if the service is exceptional.</p>
              <p>Look out for tip boxes if you arn't eating/drinking at a sit down diner.</p>
              <p>Asians do have bad reputation for being cheap and refusing to tip their servers. That's why they usually get bad table services.</p>

              <p>obviously, jojo you are MORONIC ENOUGH to think I am a indonesian. Perhaps I shouldn't reveal much at which caused such a reaction. May I ask, why are you in US in the first place? For work? in some chinese restaurant as a illegal immigrant? Think? I think you're IQ's pretty low.</p>
              <p>Thanks for revealing and advicing about how americans work. I am sure you are pretty experienced after being taught "tough love" with years of being whooped by them. I pity you really.</p>
              <p>You are the only one whose creating all these mess in the first place. You can continue being MEAN to me or anyone else. It also serves as evidence that in reality's too harsh for you to take that you have to resort to this. Forum and internet is the only place for you to vent your hatred on. Why don't you fly back to singapore and cry to you mommy? How old are you already jojo?</p>
              <p>Ooh, if you enjoy the feeling of being victorious online. I shall declare you the winner over this matter.</p>
              <p>Such a mature adult choosing to argue over such a small issue. SHALLOW-MINDED.</p>

              <p>Well i think you have to come to here to live and observed to form your opinon rather than sterotype before you reach here. You have much to learn and so you shall be at your age.</p>
              <p>But if you chose to live and work and put down your roots here than you would have to live with folks here. Hispanic, indonesian, jewish, chinese,  all alike there are good pots and bad pots.</p>
