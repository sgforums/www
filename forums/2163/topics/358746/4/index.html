              <p>Hey guys thanks a mil~ That helped alot! Now I am only waiting for my appointment and fly by July to check out the city.</p>
              <p>I heard that Pasadena has more latinos and that area is not as safe as the west LA. Is it true that SMC is easier college to do well in compared to PCC? easier classes etc.  I know about the large overseas chinese community living there, jackie chan and jet li lives in Pasadena.</p>
              <p>If you guys could choose between PCC and SMC, which would you choose and why? Considering better transfer prospects (U michigan,NYU, UCLA, Berk,USC), livable area, safety, education quality, student life, etc. Would appreciate your answers as I've never been to California.

              <p>First of all... You need to stop being a racist .</p>
              <p>Then you need to ask yourself......</p>
              <p>What do you want to MAJOR in for your UNI DEGREE.</p>
              <p>Which STATE you want to reside in.</p>
              <p>Are you going for the TOP UNI ? Like Harvard, MIT, CALTECH, Yale, Princeton ? Or are you just interested in the University in the state of your choice ?</p>
              <p>If you cannot answer these very important question to narrow down the search, then it will be VERY difficult for others to advise you.</p>
              <p>For CC selection.. as long as you MAKE SURE that CC has an transfer ARTICULATION AGREEMENT to the UNI of your choice. You have almost a free rein to the location to reside in.</p>
              <p>The standard of transfer is determined BY the UNI . So it does not matter which CC you go to. They will all transfer AS LONG AS you scored WELL in ALL YOUR EXAMS and THE UNI ACCEPTED YOUR ENROLLMENT , so MAKE SURE you choose ONLY the TRANSFERABLE courses !!</p>
              <p>Is there any reason why you chosen PCC or SMC, why not San Diego or Orange County Colleges  ? Why Southern California instead of Northern California ?And why California instead of Washington ?</p>
              <p>If you have specific requirements like staying close to Asian
                                                  community.. that will be your limitation to your residence and choice
                                                  of CC. Remember USA is a VERY big country. CA itself will take you more than 10 hours to drive from North to South, there's A LOT of Asian community in CA.</p>
              <p>If you just want huge Asian Community on the West.. then San Francisco has the biggest number of Asians. Then there's also Washington and Hawaii .. LOL... too much choices !!!</p>
              <p>After you have selected your school nearby your "limitation" .. then you consider which part of town you want to live in. All cities are livable.. if it's NOT livable.. nobody would be crazy enough to live there !</p>
              <p>Rule of thumb. The closer you are to the ocean .. the better it is. The
                                                                      more Inland you go in California.. the cheaper the housing.. and the
                                                                      higher the lower income density.</p>
              <p> The more metropolitan and closer to ocean , the more expensive in living cost.</p>
              <p>Each states has several cities, within it there's  good and not so good neighbourhood, and it can be just a street away from each other. LOOK AT THE Neighbourhood SCHOOL RATINGS in THAT neighbourhood. Typically the better the rating.. the nicer the neighbourhood.. and the higher the rentals.</p>
              <p>Here's a simple reference for Education rankings.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/sections/education">US NEWS Education</a></p>
              <p> When you come to USA.. ALWAYS keep an OPEN mind.</p>
              <p>you WILL experience CULTURE SHOCK.</p>
              <p>And you WILL realise a lot of thing are DIFFERENT to what you are used to in tiny Singapore.</p>

              <p>May grey, June gloom.... all before the sweltering summer heat. I'd rather all this than snow. *nudge nudge MG* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> </p>
              <p>And when I say summer heat, it's nothing like the heat in Sg, it's hotter.</p>
              <p>ke1234: Why do you come visit us and see? CA is a huge and very diverse melting pot. Just come with an open mind, use common sense and expand your horizons.</p>
              <p>Jojobeach has an excellent suggestion on getting a good GPS system. Life on the roads got much easier for me once I got mine.</p>

              <p>My plan is to purchase a property and sell it when I graduate thats when the economy recovers. I guess Santa Monica area is a more attractive destination for me.
