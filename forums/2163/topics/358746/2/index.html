              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>vito:</p>
              <p>Don't rely on the information online. Those apts look all fancy
                                          and stuff, but they are located in mid-wilshire, K-town area to be
                                          exact. Not exactly a convenient place to commute to SMC.</p>
              <p>One thing I need to remind you. If you look on the map, and you
                                          think it's a 10min journey, trust me, it will never be. Quite
                                          simply because this is LA.</p>
              <p>Westside rentals like I said and those places I mentioned.</p>
              <p>SMC to UCLA is by far the easiest.  My spouse did just that
                                          and graduated summa at UCLA.  Once you start your term in SMC,
                                          talk to pple, ask around, gather as much info as possible. Not much
                                          of a spoon-feeding here. You want to get the apple, grow your own
                                          tree, climb your own apple tree. SMC has a lot of resources that
                                          guarantee a smooth transfer to UCLA. Let me give you a one 
                                          important pointer. Try to be top 10% of your SMC class and your
                                          life in UCLA will be easier.</p>
              <p>jojobeach: going through SMC doesn't have to deal with SAT. Plus
                                          it's easier to apply and get admitted. Overall it is still cheaper
                                          than going through, say 4 years of UCLA.  SMC has been
                                          regarded as  one of the most competitive comunity colleges as
                                          well. There is practically no difference between those who went
                                          through 2+2 SMC/UCLA vs 4-year UCLA.</p>

              <p>If a student knows exactly which Uni/State and the major he/she wants.. it's fairly simple.. most accredited college will provide a smooth transition over to the Uni with articulation agreement.</p>

              <p>Ara, studying in SMC does not mean he can ONLY transfer to UCLA.</p>
              <p>UCLA is only ONE of the MANY Uni campus that accepts qualified transfer units from SMC.</p>
              <p>Which UNI/campus he ultimately ends up with.. DEPENDS on the major of his choice... and which one he prefers to attend.</p>
              <p>USC and UC has different GE/Lower division requirements from college level transfers.</p>
              <p>And the classes in College fills up really fast per semester. If he wants to get the classes of his choice.. he gota start cracking and focus on which Uni system and majors he needs to take at college level.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting.. there's the prerequisite classes .. and placement tests... etc etc...</p>

              <p>i am coming earlier with my parents to scout around haha but i
                  do need a ''base of operations'' where i can temporarily put up lol
                  are there such things as serviced apartments there? the folks need
                  some place other than a hotel to stay at for the week</p>

              <p>That depends on how big a spender your parents are.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of suite type lodgings.</p>
              <p>For very basic needs. Try <a href="http://www.homesteadhotels.com/">Homestead or Extended Stay America</a>.</p>
              <p>If not.. the usual big American hotel brand names are easily available on the internet. Suite or residence usually comes with kitchenette and a separate living/lounging area inside the unit.</p>
