            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm a 27-year-old housewife who has been travelling with my husband around Asia for the past year. We usually stay in a city for 2-4 months then move on to another, due to the nature of his work.<br><br>As such, I've been unable to find a job after resigning from my job in Singapore. Call it the Singaporean Curse, but I am someone who enjoys working very much. I've tried to keep myself occupied by learning a fourth language and attending classes on yoga, knitting, flower arrangement etc. but these are more like time-fillers than activities that give deep fulfillment.<br>There is still a void in my heart that I cannot seem to fill.<br><br>While I do enjoy being a housewife and caring for my husband, I resent waking up everyday and not having goals. I've considered free-lance writing, and community work...but these have not come to fruition due to the short period of stay in each city. I've only managed to do some free-lance translation work, but that is not frequent enough to keep me occupied. Worse, moving from city to city means that I've not been able to build up an immediate circle of friends. My husband travels very frequently (average 2 times a week) which leaves me very lonely.<br><br>We don't plan to have kids for another 1-2 years, so I'm likely to have plenty of time on my hands till then.<br><br>What do you girls do to fill up your time? HELP!!<span style="color: violet;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a housewife overseas too. It was on the support and advice of my husband that I quit my job. I was a postdoc scientist before but my husband was all squeamish about the stuff I work with like Malaria parasite and TB <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So anyway, unlike you, I am more lazy than raring to work and the lifestyle is suiting me fine. I keep myself busy like you do. I started running my own business who is great.<br><br>Your situation is more difficult as you have to move around from time to time which is not great. There must be some volunteer work you can do in short term basis like helping out in a old folk's home, animal shelter something like that. At least you will feel like you are contributing and helping somebody, time will be much better spent and you will feel more fulfilled in that way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh...till we settle down in one city for good...guess I'll just have to make the most of my nomadic life!! The hardest thing to bear is the lack of friends and loneliness...with all the moving around. It's also a weird feeling to be entirely dependent on another person's schedule (though fortunately, hubby has been nothing but sweet and considerate thus far)<br><br>Friends in Singapore have been very supportive and staying in touch via Messenger, emails and skype....but nothing beats having a group of friends to hang out with and share common interests.<br><br>Ha ha....guess I'm raring to work, because I've worked so little!! I did my Master degree (and got accepted for PhD programme hoping to pursue academic career, but eventually had to give that up as hubby does not want a long-distance relationship), which means I spent 5 years in university, and only 3 years actually working!<br><br>Where are you currently based?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I'm based in UK now.<br><br>Almost the same as me. I did my PhD in UK coz I wanted to be earn my boyfriend then.<br><br>Then after all that studying, I did one year of postdoc then my husband wanted me to stop working. He is sweet just didn't want me to suffer coz when I used to work in London, I had to drive an hour each way to work in heavy traffic. So he wanted to me to relax and do something that I like.<br><br>I understand that of friends. Now that I stopped working, I don't make friends anymore. All the other friends I made and scatter all over UK to meet up anyway. Plus my singaporean friends, most of them have moved on and we have lost contact. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
