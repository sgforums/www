I prefer the dry heat to the humidity we get in Singapore.  At least you don't feel "sticky" as soon as you walk out of the building.  However, you can easily get sun burnt here.  I think it is more to do with the depletion of the Ozone layer.<br><br>Not sure about the smell though.  But at least people here are more self-conscious about that and most of them use deodorant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
