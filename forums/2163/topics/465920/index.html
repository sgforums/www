              Visiting family and friends in Singapore during this CNY period. Reading news about the government's white paper on population growth for 2030. Reading on the difficulties of getting Singaporeans to have more babies. Just some thoughts on my mind:
              I am not a 'talent' that went overseas nor do I consider myself a 'quitter'... I just happened to meet someone in UK while working short term in UK.... got married and started a family in UK... for my own nostalgic thoughts, my family, my friends, I often had thoughts of returning to Singapore for good with my hubby and kids... but... hmm... being in Singapore now makes me really think thrice....
              1) the work culture... how am I going to adapt working long hours and returning home late, not spending a lot of time with my kids liaoz? I really hate to think about it. At the moment, I am able to leave work on time at 5pm in UK, get home at 6pm, cook and have family meals with my family. I think most likely, I will not have this luxury in Singapore... and I will hate it.... 
              2) the competiveness of parents on their children... goodness... my 4 year-old niece in 'tuition' and many other children of my friends in 'enrichment classes'... i just want my 3 year-old and 1 year-old to have a happy childhood!! I can understand the parents' anxiety about their children lagging behind when they get to P1, but I really want MY children to have a happy childhood like I do! .....I would not like to have this 'stress' on me...hmm....
              3) child care.... with my own parents getting old, there's no way they can help... i know i can get maids, put the children in nursery/infant care etc.... but if I want to have more than 2 children, the financial burden will be too much.... if I look after them myself, then my husband will have to work harder (longer hours??!!) and there will again be sacrifice on his part on family life.... hmm... 
              These are all in my mind when I am here now in Singapore observing the whole issue... i love children and would love to have more than 2 children... but to bring them up in UK or here? hmm....

              </p><p>well, in singapore, we do feel like foreigners in our own country.   Foreigners make up 40 percent of the population in Singapore.    Many jobs are given to foreigners, that is why in recent years many singaporeans have difficulty finding jobs.</p>
              <p>Companies rather employ foreigners from some kind of unrecognized universities than local singaporeans.     Low skilled and professional jobs are given to many foreigners.</p>

              <p>Many of us want to get out of Singapore but we do not have the means.    You have the privilege of living overseas, treasure it though I know times are pretty bad there in UK.     Somehow, I believe the economy there will turn around.</p>

              I know what you are going through while living overseas...as you said, you don't feel like fit in overthere and you miss your family in Singapore, but I think your spouse and children do feel at home there. So, if you think about your children...I think you just be there and you will feel better once the economy there picks up again. 
              
              If you really so desperate to return home to Singapore or just to be close to your family in Singapore....then you be on your own without your spouse and kids...you want that to happen?

              <p>I've been living in the US for the last 16 years, and 2 years ago had toyed with the thought of moving back to SG. I even went to the effort of going for interviews when I was on vacation in SG.</p>
              <p>I get to visit SG every year since I'm in the region for business, and SG always appears very vibrant and dynamic, with so many new things going on. Compared to where I live in the US, where all the stores and restaurants close by 9pm, SG is so much more "happening".</p>
              <p>However, after discussing this with friends and family, I soon realized that the SG work-life balance is very negatively skewed. Forget about leaving work at 6pm if you're in middle management or above. The population density is crazy, and things are getting so much more expensive.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I've decided to stay in the US until I retire, when I will probably migrate back to SG based on the convenience of living in a housing estate with shops and amenities close by.</p>
              <p>The SG that I yearn for in the mid 90's is no longer there, so I've told myself to get over it and move on.</p>
              <p>But back to your point, please consider carefully about how much of a lifestyle change you and your family will need to endure if you do move from the UK to SG. You didn't mention which part of the UK you live in, but I assume it's a stark difference from SG in terms of weather, culture, food, etc.</p>
              <p>In the end, if you do plan to make a move, it could be temporary to get your feet wet and see if you really do want to stay long term.</p>
