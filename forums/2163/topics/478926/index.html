              <p><br>in the past ,,,u cant go overseas without getting correct visa from nz ,,,such as a nz work visa ..student visa or work holiday visa.dont try goin there on a 3 mth nz tourist visa because if u want to extend to another visa u will run outa time as all  visas take more than 4 mths to process unless its a tourist visa.however in past they had 1 year tourist visa and u could even get a 6 mths work visa without even getting a job in nz or stepping foot on nz even,,,,,u need to check out on nz immigration website.,,which seems to be messy n overloaded nowadays.not to mention they clammed down on immigration back in 2005 or so.harder to get in.</p>
              <p>but if u do go on a tourist visa......not sure if u could get a job even after u got your spore qualifications converted to their equivalent..their job advertisements on newspaper daily seem to be the same as the internet.actually not much jobs to be frank.....i think everybody n kiwi people struggling there to find a job too....lol</p>
              <p>i noticed more asians in auckland and mount roskill....in fact entire of auckland region seem to be like spore but less developed...u wont know the difference n swear u were still in spore even.they have lion dance in the park....somewhere in auckland.they have japanese people who look like they just flew in from Harajuku  tokyo transplanted into an old city which surprisingly gets windy cool sea air.the sunlight is great and has not much uv lite.</p>
              <p>communities there are mainly the japanese..koreans,,,taiwanese...china chinese,,,malaysian chinese...indian,,bangladesh,,,,more like 50% asians 30 % whites there and 20% maori.tongans.</p>
              <p>those gov approved jobs on internet meant for PR or citizens of nz.</p>

              <p>First with job getting last - only skill workers are welcome. check with the country embassy for the list.<br><br>Next driver license in Oz - usually is best have. As apartment in city is expensive, and train and buses are not good. <br><br>Well please consider the tax and interest rate.  They may look better off - but are they ? 40percent tax &amp; high loan interest rate for house load - after you take in consideration - damn you are a lot richer staying here, and go there for hoildays.</p>
