              <p>Their table wines are okay, but its their liqueurs and fortified wines that I go there for.</p>
              <p>Love the Marsala de Cucina and the luqueur muscat. For cheap and good their bulk port and muscat are very good for the price.</p>

I've only tried inniskillin's stuff before ... and I suppose the prices ranges widely ... anything from mid 20s to over a hundred ... the one that I drink (and my parents bought) costs C$35 at the liqour board store, and well over a hundred in Singapore ...</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I don’t really care too much for ice wine as I find them too sweet. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For the last few years I have continue to be attracted by Chilean wineries. I find the price and quality is quite a catch. I think it is value for money if you can get it cheap. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My top recommendation would be Montes. I thinks the price and taste is remarkable. You can play with wine glass to bring up <span> </span>the aroma. The price in the US is selling between US$8.50 to US$13.00 I am sure if you get it from Santiago is half that price. I think is great drinking alone. Its equally good with food. <span> </span>In 2006 I could not find it in SG but maybe you can get it now. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2<sup>nd</sup> Recommendation would be Concha Y Toro Marques I think this is a great bottle it cost about US$13.00 a bottle. <span> Certainly with Red meat Lamb or Beef. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3<sup>rd</sup> would be wine from Conchagua valley such as Melbec. Great with food.<span>  </span>US$3.99 a bottle. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4<sup>th</sup> is Santa Helena Reserve from Colchagua Valley. This bottle is not circulated in the US.   ( I saw this bottle sold in SG restaurant for SGD80 dollars. It cost US$6.00 in South and central America). <span> </span><span> </span>I love it. Its a shy bottle. Require a little piatent and sensitive taste to explore the taste. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in -0.7pt 0pt 0.25in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">15th minutes from my apt are a couple of private wineries that they do not do mass circulation,  they are great but i don't share the same passion as i do for Chilean wines. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">  </span></p>

              <p>buy wine in france. drink wine in france. having a glass of wine is cheaper than getting a glass of water. too bad i was only 13/14. i could get a good bottle of wine for 6 euros. but the bloody euro is so strong. that cheap wine becomes not-so-cheap anymore after converting it back to canadian/singapore dollars =(</p>
              <p>my parents do sometimes buy canadian ice wine back to singapore for friends. they seem to like that kind stuff. but really i think ice wine bottles are nice =p</p>
              <p>one can get cheap strong stuff from china too. and it's really not bad. if that's the kind of thing u like to drink. i hate chinese wine though. even the smell is too strong for me.</p>
              <p>and i reckon vodka isnt too expensive in russia. seeing how most people dont earn all that much but can still afford to drink it....and the rouble isnt all that strong, so getting stuff in russia (at the right places) cant be too expensive either...</p>
