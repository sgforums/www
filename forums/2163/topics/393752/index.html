              <p>yup..definitely better social graces! i also like affordable housing/car and great shopping (both at stores and online). clean air, lots of land (translates to home privacy), nature...</p>
              <p>i dislike....expensive healthcare insurance, f**king complicated tax filing, lack of public transport options, poor accessibility to amenities...and some financial systems which i find to be not so smart (not that it bothers me a great deal though). </p>

              <p>Many things don't make sense. Take for example the day I found out my ITIN was a recycled one! Three years after using the number to file income tax, there was a hitch in getting our returns. My CPA investigated and found out that the number I was given used to belong to someone else who had since passed. Come on! Recycled ITIN?? Are you kidding me? Sheesh, that was when I decided to forget that ITIN and get a SSN.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I found out that sometimes when you include a note with an explanation, the body you're dealing with will waive the late fee/fine. Or when you're short on change, the cashier will reach into the change jar to make up the difference. How nice is that?</p>

              <p>my realtor told me that you can still get a 30-yr mortgage at age 80! how crazy is that? i feel bad for those people who've to sell their houses suddenly cos the main breadwinner had passed away. so far, most of the sales around my area have been estate sales, due to death of main breadwinner or divorce cases. </p>
              <p>ohh...and when you try to save some money by ordering the "specials" here, the servers won't give you that "you are a cheapskate!" look. i've servers highlighting to me that there are more affordable options....or the fastfood guys who'd tell me that there's no need to order a "LARGE" drink 'cos you can always refill your cups. i like that!</p>
              <p>another thing....i love love love the home furnishings here...and the interior design styles. i used to buy stuffs from Howards storage in SG but the things are SO expensive. when i go back to SG the next time, i'm sure to bring loads of home storage systems and other home accessories back with me to furnish my flat.</p>

              <p>Now that's just weird.  What's it cost the tax office to issue a new number? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>I love the fact that I live on the edge of wine country and I'm still 25 minutes' drive from my office in the city.  I love being able to strike up conversations with strangers without getting that "you've grown a second head" look.</p>

              <p>Having grown up in land-scarce Singapore, I truly appreciate the wide, open spaces here. I like the fact that I can come home from a tiring day at work and still have time (especially at the height of summer when the sun doesn't set until well after 8 p.m.) to take a relaxing drive out into the countryside, or hop into the club plane for a scenic flight to a remote airstrip situated next to a lake.</p>
              <p>The ability to purchase just about anything through the internet is another truly enjoyable aspect of life here. The savings can be considerable <em>vis-a-vis</em> buying the items locally from brick-and-mortar stores, as in most cases you do not have to pay sales tax and many internet retailers like Amazon and NewEgg also frequently offer free shipping and handling. There are few things more satisfying than coming home and finding a package on your front porch--in fact, I'm on a first-name basis with both the FedEx and UPS delivery drivers who service my neighbourhood!</p>

              <p>with paypal...dun even need to key in card number/account details....at least when i go buy stuffs at the shops...i still need to fish out my wallet from my bag and then take out my cash/card for swiping...so i've a lot of time to feel guilty about spending hardearned $</p>
              <p>&amp; at the mall...at least my spending is constrained by the phyiscal size of the shopping basket or shopping cart or the number of shopping carts i can push effectively....online, my shopping cart is limitless/bottomless! *shudders*</p>

              <p>Nowadays, about the only things I <em>don't</em> buy online are food and clothing. Everything else--from most of my firearms, to almost all of my home electronic stuff (including my recently acquired 55" Toshiba HDTV), to both of my vehicles--has been purchased through the internet.</p>
              <p>A few winters ago, the extractor fan blower motor in my furnace seized up, rendering the furnace inoperable. The local HVAC shysters wanted upwards of $300 to come to my house with the replacement motor and install it, and wouldn't sell me just the motor alone. They probably thought I'd bite as this was in the middle of winter. Well, I hopped onto the internet and found the same motor being sold at (of all places) <em>Amazon.com </em>for a fraction of that price. I purchased it immediately, and even with overnight shipping, the total cost came to well under $100.</p>
