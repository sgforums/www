              <p><br>maybe it's because i'm a city-kid and always will be. thus, i hold as a good benchmark city-states like hong kong (come on, every suburb's like a fucking city; don't bluff!), singapore .. so when i go to places like adelaide where shops close at 5 everyday, and the prettiest asian girl would be one rejected by steven lim .. i get damn sian .. of course melbourne's not so bad ... but sydney is superior in every respect - you get what melbourne has to offer and mroe. kinda like going to a mcdonalds without a McCafe, and then going to one with a McCafe (you'll find out what this is once you get to australia)</p>
              <p>but u're right, depends on what u want - i can't go to new-zealand because u ask me go see cows, i sian 1000%. sure sure, what about the milk lady that kids of the 1980s were used to seeing on their pakcs of milk? - 1) it's bshit 2) it's bshit 3) it's bshit 4) i prefer asian women. ^_^</p>

              <p>basically the professional accounting major meets the requirements professional accreditation of CPA, ICCA and NIA while the normal one accounting degree is more geared towards other uses of accountings in finance, management and accounting systems designing.</p>
              <p>i find the workload pretty manageable so far; just make sure you pay attention during lectures, take notes in class and recopy then into a proper notebook at home for easy reference. also, participate in tutorials so you will be able to gauge your understanding of the units.</p>
              <p>the education system here is based on independent learning. this means you are expected to learn on your own and participate during tutorials to make sure you fully understand what you have covered during lectures. this can also mean a lot of freedom since you're not pushed to study hard.</p>
              <p>culture wise, there's quite a lot of proportion of foreign students here and i have quite a lot of indonesians and china friends here. there's a singaporean club in macquarie if it interests you. haven't really experienced any serious racism yet; most of what i experienced were out of campus by small kids who have really ugly upbringing but it's no big deal anyway.</p>
              <p>the lecturers i've met so far are very good, though it's probably because i asked around before enrolling into classes with the better lecturers.</p>
              <p>hope this helped ^^</p>
