              <p>undergrad best should be macquarie. graduate should be monash.</p>
              <p>adelaide is a hole - forget it. perth is not v. diff. from singapore (same time zone; soooooooo many singaporeans) - once you're there, you'll understand</p>
              <p>uq is great fun - student feedback for experience is up there. but i've never been to qld in recent years, so i cannot comment.</p>
              <p>melb. is another hole .. city life sucks .. all that nonsense about arts and shit, is just rubbish .. u'll cover melbourne within 2 weeks, and then realise there's not much left - fyi, there are 4? 5 asian clubs in melb. i didn't really enjoy myself in melb although that's where most my fds are.</p>
              <p>if you're considering melb., you might as well head to sydney. personally, i like sydney best - it has the best of singaproe (vibrant, 24/7 city life) while remaining uniquely australian .. would love to move back to nsw if i get the chance.</p>
              <p>TS: fyi, i lived in AU most of my life shuttling between the states (parents posting). i didn't do my tertiary education in AU, but i did high sch there, so i agah agah recall university rankings from good guide. and don't listen to rubbish about how all unis are the same ok .. i hear that from 3rd class students at 3rd rate universities all the time .. truth is, the Group of 8 are the best in Australia, and remains the best - look at their intake score, proportion of funding u know liao ... your above list all ok .. glad you never consider some shit uni like VUT, QUT, Wollongong or blah</p>

              <p>no longer there - i missed sgp too much and came back some yrs back.</p>
              <p>macquarie is not in Go8 but it's recognised as being a good uni for it's biz courses. similarly, just like RMIT, architecture there is recognised as the best in AU. no prob. with jobs in those fields if in Australia. not so sure about singapore though so i cannot comment.</p>
              <p>note carefully that while macquarie is better, the rest are not far behind - they would be just under the bar set by mq. unsw/sydney are itnernationlly recog. all-rounded universities. if you look at Times Higher Edu. ranking .. you'll see they place in top 40 whereas mq. no where to be seen. i wouldn't consider victoria unless melb./monash though .. coz those 2 are heavyweights (hell, the only 2 decent institutions in the State), but even then you should have compelling reasons to head there because victoria's a hole.</p>
              <p>adelaide's a bigger hole. look adelaide's just a shit hole. don't even bother. unless you want to be so bored that you start contemplating journeying to the lesser hole, victoria, every w'end. that's what people based in the ACT do, whenever an extended w'end comes up (hell, even on a normal w'end) they flock over to NSW .. you'll see all the ACT car/bus plates on the highway to NSW. while ACT is the biggest hole of all, ANU is the top uni in australia - so if studies are your main concern, hole or not, you should be heading to the ACT.</p>
              <p>give uq some thought - it's reputation may not resound as brightly as anu/melb/monash/sydney/unsw but it's still recognised as a good uni, and more than that, i've heard nothing but great things from people who have studied there. one of my best mates who i grew up with in the suburbs went there for schoolies (post high school party), and liked it so much he decided to stay.</p>

              <p><br>Uni SA on site, or start in Singapore then go over? nowadays so many fo this pattern. must ask carefully. coz there's a major quality difference.</p>
              <p>in any case, with all due respect, and you probably know this is true as well, but Uni SA is a shit uni, in a hole. at least Uni Adelaide is Go8, and so far as employment is concerned, it is recognised as being SA's best uni, and ranks just as highly as the other Go8 unis (see goodguide).</p>

              <p><br>i agree. in any case, CPA/CA is always 1up over a degree because it's professional certification. everyone knows it's easy to obtain a degree, but harder to get that prof. recognition. so many ah bengs with bachelor of sciencei n finance from dnuno what lanjiao uni .. but how many got CFA L1, L2, L3?</p>
              <p>if you keen on CPA/CA .. you don't even have to go malaysia - go kaplan - amke sure u study hard, go for class, don't join ah seng play pool before, after OR DURING school. bao grad. into employment.</p>

              <p><br>comparable. sydney is slightly pricier but only slightly. living in kingsford (across UNSW) will run you anywhere from $160-240/wk - kingsford is city fringe. whereas the same amount will get you a place across melb. uni which is still within city bounds - walkable distance to melbourne central. btu again, sydney is a larger city compared to melbourne's tiny grid. so i much rather go sydney u/unsw &gt; uni melb. monash is cheap but that's because it's NUS-ish ... most of the campuses are located wayyy out (caulfield is a 15min train ride from the city, and clayton, 20min - but comex sucks, so add a 10min delay to both - and fyi, from clayton to city, day ticket is $10AUD, and service stops at midnight-ish ... you could drive, but petrol was $1.40AUD/l last i checked, and parking is $3.50/half hour on street in the city (maximum time usually about 1-2hrs), or $28-50/day at multi story. so i would not consider monash a real choice if $$$ is an issue to you because of transport costs. keep it to melbourne, sydney and unsw.</p>

              <p>same as singapore - depends on how well you do in your course.</p>
              <p>if you do well, you'll get offer from big 4 9mths before graduation.</p>
              <p>if you do shit, you'll get no offers from small 4000 9 mths after graduation. can get offer la .. shit pay lo. you'll be damn sian to find out those who go to KPMG get 45k + bonuses, but you stuck with $30+.</p>
              <p>to put things in perspective, my parents told me that the postman who used to bring mail by our place holds a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">diploma</span> in biz. and for comparison, a friend of mine graduated with honours in accounting from sydney uni, and the money that big 4 offered her back here in SGP exceeded that which was offered here (after you take into consideration the increased tax for non-residents: see ITRA Sch 7), that and the fact big 4 back here would sponsor her for CA and give adequate time off to study.</p>
              <p>gen. the singaporeans that go there don't do brilliantly. alot of poly grads who barely get by (coming in with pretty shit GPAs), and alot of jc grads who couldn't make it locally (3Cs, 3Ds kinda A level results). many of them who do stay here don't go v. far ... don't forget they are the foreigners, and native Australians will view them as such regardless of whatever propaganda is being put out (just like the way it is in Singapore), so in that sense, it is an additional hurdle in working life.</p>
              <p>i reckon, conservatively speaking, 1 in 5 will come from singapore with decent grades - these boys/girls go on and do very well.  one of my fds got 3As + 2 S Paper from RJC, couldn't get in NUS Medicine, so he came here, graduated, and has not gone back since - but his reason for staying is more personal .. that if Singapore didn't want him then, why should he go back now. Now surgeon in private hospital being taxed @ the maximum rate.</p>
              <p>so if you go there, study hard. don't just say .. no point say but results shit. AU unis give admission easy to int'l coz cash cows, but you are graded against the local students who need higher entry scores. depends on what u want in life lo ... seems like 70-80% of e sg kids there play nia .. to be fair, it's the same case with alot of internationals. so yea .. u'll meet alot of sgporeans, you decide for yourself then.</p>

              <p><br>can't speak for all schools, but afaik, bell curve exists in all Go8 unis. how bad the bell curve depends on faculty. i know for example that at monash law, it's so hardcore that if you get a high distinction there, the chief examiner sends you a congratulatory letter. then again, in most law schools, as with monash, there is a long list of prizes available - e.g. best in tax law 2004, so on so forth ... but afaik, no such letter comes when you get a HD in other faculties e.g. biz. and i'm not sure prize opp. too</p>
              <p>honours is important wherever you go - it speaks volumes about you as a graduate. wasn't it recently a survey found that hons grads get higher pay than norm grads with masters? of course u don't get hons in some lanjiao degree like early childhood psychology la ... get hons also get in a substantive course like finance.</p>
