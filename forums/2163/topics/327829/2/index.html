              <p>Hard to compare especially it's different conversion rate.  Certain things should be cheaper in Oz than in Singapore cos' there have local produce.  Then again, the beef in Oz is super expensive even though Oz has their own cattle farm.</p>

              <p>someone who just arrived in Aust will find it expensive, but in the long term they will realise as they adjust to the basic life style living cost that its cheaper than sg.</p>
              <p>But i can say aust is good for its citizens especially those old people or students studying as they get  subsidised fees for Uni and get a payment every month when studying.</p>
              <p>old people get subsidised for almost everything including transport.</p>
              <p>its not good for those filthy rich or high income earner as they get taxed heavily. In this singapore is a better place for the rich and famous.</p>
              <p>Aust is a country which upholds moral obligations to society.</p>

              <p>It's getting more and more expensive living in Australia.  Food is getting very expensive.  We just spent over $80 on the weekend on a few items including 2 loaves of bread, 3 tubs of Ski yoghurt, 1 x 2L milk, T-bone steak, 4 x canned tuna, 1 tub of icecream, 3kg of orange, vegies).  That's not even our full shopping....</p>

              <p>Why is it that prices in Singapore is more expensive relative to other countries?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's look at the iPod, in the Apple (Singapore) website a 8GB iPod Nano cost SGD 318, while the same model cost USD 199 (SGD 282.58 @ USD 1 = 1.42).</p>
              <p><a href="http://store.apple.com/sg/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_nano?mco=MTIwMDQ">http://store.apple.com/sg/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_nano?mco=MTIwMDQ</a></p>

              <p>Why the stark difference in prices? Afterall iPod is manufatured in China, it should be cheaper to ship to Singapore than the USA.</p>

              <p>It's getting more and more expensive living in Australia.  Food is getting very expensive.  We just spent over $80 on the weekend on a few items including 2 loaves of bread, 3 tubs of Ski yoghurt, 1 x 2L milk, T-bone steak, 4 x canned tuna, 1 tub of icecream, 3kg of orange, vegies).  That's not even our full shopping....</p>

              <p>it because in the shops in sg they are selling higher , the price drops fast in sg electronics consumer brand and there is a huge 2nd hand market like HWZ buy and sell forums in singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u will be surprised they are selling brand new $600 centrino laptops 1.73 Ghz with Nvidia Geforce 6 graphic card at Officeworks store here in Aust. with 1 year warranty. Look at sg Courts dept store and their sucky exp prices. and when the model turns old, they remove it from the shelves and always trying to push new exp products down your throat like someone doing a deepthroat job. bastads.</p>
              <p>the removed products from sg shops end up in other countries like Aust, Africa ect. This is the shady lucrative business model which these shops have.</p>

              <p>1) It could be the result of the government's policy of maintaining a "dirty float" (managed foreign exchange intervention).</p>
              <p>2) In free market economics, there is no reason for Apple to vary the price of it's iPod unless it's due to risk in the market. The risk that the SGD could be undervalued and the product sold in Singapore cannot convert back to the USD cost.</p>

              <p><br> There are few ways of looking at this.</p>
              <p>1) It could be the result of the government's policy of
              maintaining a "dirty float" (managed foreign exchange
              intervention).</p>
              <p>2) In free market economics, there is no reason for Apple to
              vary the price of it's iPod unless it's due to risk in the market.
              The risk that the SGD could be undervalued and the product sold in
              Singapore cannot convert back to the USD cost.</p>

              <p>so with regards to the point of living costs in Singapore .... you're saying that it's still the goverment's fault ? ....</p>
              <p>in anycase, your logic is faulty for 2), if the Singapore dollar is undervalued, then there is pressure on the SGD to appreciate against other currencies, in this example the USD, so apple'd get back more in USD terms if they convert from SGD to USD and count profits in terms of USD back home.</p>
              <p>but yeah, I get it, everything is the goverment's fault, right ?  ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
