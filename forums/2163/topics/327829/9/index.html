              on groceries... we plan to buy something on Sat morning in Victoria
              Market and do a BBQ at night.... anything BBQ-able to buy in the

              <p>Typical Oz BBQ is usually very simple.  Just some sausages and steak. Toss up some salad on the side...  there you go!</p>
              <p>It really depends on individual.  Have you got your own BBQ at home or are you using those at the Park?</p>
              <p>Whatever you do, remember to get something that don't take you forever to cook.  Following is a list of suggestion:</p>
              <p>For the BBQ (one of the following):</p>
              <p>- Steak for BBQ (usually a little bit thiner)</p>
              <p>- Chicken ribs</p>
              <p>- Lamb chop</p>
              <p>- Kangaroo steak/fillet</p>
              <p>- Prawns &amp; calamari</p>
              <p>- Sausages</p>
              <p>For the side:</p>
              <p>- Packet of chips</p>
              <p>- Salad (assorted lettuces, spinach, tomato, capsicum)</p>
              <p>- Coleslaw (cabbage, carrot, brown onion)</p>
              <p>- Some garlic bread</p>
              <p>- And some dessert after that.</p>
              <p>Drinks (soft drinks/beer/wine)</p>
              <p>Hope that's helpful to you.  That should give you plenty to choose from.</p>
              <p>Today is our 3rd wedding anniversary and we haven't got a BBQ at home yet so we might go and get one this weekend as an anniversary present for each other.</p>
              <p>Enjoy your BBQ this weekend! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Sometimes it might not be worth getting 2nd hand furniture as the cost of old furniture may not necessarily be a lot cheaper than the new one. So look around first before you purchase any 2nd hand goods.  Hope the website below will give you some ideas...</p>
              <p>http://www.sydneys.com.au/brochure/Sept08/SYDbackSept08-web.pdf</p>
              <p>As for the electronics stuffs, you can have a look at the following:  Again please do your research before committing yourself to buying anything from these stores.</p>

              <p>Hi redDust,</p>
              <p>you can try Salvos stores. They have 2nd hand everything - furniture, bedding, clothing, etc etc.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_61106.html">http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/SALV/STANDARD/PC_61106.html</a></p>
              <p>or Fantastic furniture</p>
              <p>I reckon their prices are pretty affordable and they have furniture packages.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/">http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/</a></p>
              <p>As for discounted new furniture, I'm not too sure about that - you could try warehouse furniture. I haven't been to any warehouse furniture places so I can't give you a first hand or accuate account on the furniture prices and qualities, however, their prices are supposedly up to 40 - 70% discounted.</p>
              <p>Here's a link to a directory of furniture warehouses you can look through.</p>

              <p>Wow, where have you been shopping?<br>I think you're still living a relatively international student lifestyle because the prices you're paying is through the roof.</p>
              <p>Is that for a month? Or a week? Certainly sounds like its meant to last a week or two, max.</p>
              <p>Do you travel to shop? Or shop at those annoying city Asian grocers where they jack prices up so bloody high I've seen limes going for $3 a pop. 24 hour supermarkets, IGA and certainly, 7-11s are <strong>not </strong>good places to be shopping for stuff because they're meant for the international or urban crowd with dollars to spare and won't bat an eye paying up to $2 more for everything.</p>
              <p>I spend about $80 - $100 a week on groceries for two people who probably eat for 4. Breakfast and dinner, sometimes lunches for a 6 day period. It's been stretched to 2 weeks no problem as I like to have some excess food at hand, but ultimately, its what you buy and where you buy it that matters.</p>
              <p>Things I get with $100 weekly (Mixture of Coles Supermarket, Wet market, Asian grocer &amp; Local Butcher:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Bread ($1.10) - Unless you go for the fancy $3 ones. Which isn't necessary for me.</li>
              <li>Pura Milk ($3 - $3.50) </li>
              <li>1 kg Potatoes ($3)<br></li>
              <li>Bag of onions ($1.30 - $2)</li>
              <li>Garlic, pack of 4 ($1)</li>
              <li>Bag of mushrooms (~$3)<br></li>
              <li>2 Eggplants (~$3)</li>
              <li>1 kg tomatoes ($3)<br></li>
              <li>1 kg Frozen Beans (~$2.50 - $3) (These last for abt 3 - 4 weeks)<br></li>
              <li>1 kg Frozen Cauliflower  (~$2.50 - $3) (These last for abt 3 - 4 weeks)</li>
              <li>1 kg Frozen Spinach (~$2.50 - $3) (These last for abt 3 - 4 weeks)</li>
              <li>1 kg Mixed Veggies (~$2.50 - $3) (These last for abt 3 - 4 weeks)</li>
              <li>Half Cabbage ($1.50 - $3, depending on season)</li>
              <li>Half Celery ($3)</li>
              <li>Garlic Sprouts x2 ($2)<br></li>
              <li>1 kg chicken breast/thighs ($10)</li>
              <li>3 kg natural yoghurt (for ethnic cooking) ($5)</li>
              <li>Ice cream ($4/$5 - Discounted) I usually buy discounted ice cream. Its not a necessity</li>
              <li>2 litres Soft Drinks x2 (~$2 - $3) <br></li>
              <li>Cereal ($5) (Lasts for &gt;4 weeks as its for days I don't feel like cooking breakfasts, which are few)</li>
              <li>Biscuits/Snacks (~$2 - $2.50) Anything with chocolate on/in it which is discounted, again, I am not a fussy snacker but will not buy house brand ones because I don't like the taste of it.)</li>
              <li>Eggs ($4) I buy free-range so this is a bit of a splurge.</li>
              <li>Cream ($3)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Total = <strong>AU$78 <br></strong></p>
              <p>The stuff which lasts for more than a week are merely omitted in the next week's shopping, deducing the grocery bill for the next couple of weeks, unless I use the excess for stocking up on any sauces, oil, fruit, etc.</p>
              <p>For good effect I have used the larger numbers in my calculations for the price ranges of goods.</p>
              <p>These can serve me for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including snacks, dessert.</p>
              <p>I buy my groceries at Footscray. Dodgy as it is, I don't really care as long as I go in the day accompanied by my fiance as its safer.

              <p>Footscray is filled with Asian grocers, Chinese, Indian, Arabic. It has local butchers, a large wet market and I drive there every week to have breakfast at the local Turkish cafes with my significant other, then go grocery shopping all in one little central district, all walking distance from one another.</p>
              <p>If I'm not taking the car, I go by train, bringing a trolley. Its just a few stations away from the city.</p>
              <p>Ultimately its how you choose to spend your money and where. If you choose convenience you inevitably pay more in prices. If you choose specific brands (Some expensive brand, I guess) and won't compromise (i.e. for toilet cleaner use house brand. Who cares. Its a toilet cleaner! :P) on certain things, well, you pay extra for that for nothing.</p>
              <p>Admittedly, Singapore is cheaper in terms of groceries. But if you go beyond the 'NTUC' essentials norm (like buy white button mushrooms, not shittake, etc etc) you are charged premium for it. Not to mention how some items in Australia is cheaper than in Singapore. So, really, its not much of a difference to me.</p>

              <p>Because I'm not living a student life and I cook many varying dishes in a full fledge kitchen, not just basic uni fare.<br>I also cook for my fiance, and all this is for 2 people, 3 meals a day, including cooking/baking &amp; ready-to-eat snacks.<br><br>I plan all my meals every week and basically I run my home like how I would run it with a family, different meals, meal planning, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>You'll be surprised how much it costs to keep a household running. My fiance and I are avid cooks and we cook/bake things from scratch instead of using pre-made sauces, shakes, etc etc.</p>

              <p>Good for you to be able to get cheap grocery....  I guess it's an advantage to be living near a market where food is usually cheaper and fresher.</p>
              <p>I do my shopping mainly at the local supermarkets (coles or safeway), depending which one has the best offers for things I want to buy.  I do occasionally shop at Box Hill (about 15 min drive from where I live) especially when come to meat shopping as I prefer meat from the Asian butcher.</p>
              <p>The list I gave earlier was the things I bought when they were not on special but we just had to bite the bullet to help get through the week.  That was why I was shocked to find things were so much more expensive when you got them at full price.</p>
              <p>I like shopping in the supermarkets purely for its convenience.  Weekend is the only time for hubby and I to rest, do housework, catch up with family etc.  The last thing we want to do is to spend the whole day at the shops or to travel out of our way just to get a bargain.  To us, it's just not worth the petrol and our precious time.  While we enjoy having the worth of every penny spent, we enjoy spending quality time doing something else than to shop.  Life is too short!</p>
              <p>It's a lifestyle I guess, like you said.  Everyone lives a different lifestyle as long as it works for us and we are all happy about it, that's all it matters.  However, it still doesn't mean we can't whinge about things being expensive, does it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi redDust,</p>
              <p>you can try Salvos stores. They have 2nd hand everything - furniture, bedding, clothing, etc etc.</p>

              <p>or Fantastic furniture</p>
              <p>I reckon their prices are pretty affordable and they have furniture packages.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/">http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/</a></p>
              <p>As for discounted new furniture, I'm not too sure about that - you could try warehouse furniture. I haven't been to any warehouse furniture places so I can't give you a first hand or accuate account on the furniture prices and qualities, however, their prices are supposedly up to 40 - 70% discounted.</p>
              <p>Here's a link to a directory of furniture warehouses you can look through.</p>

              <p>Good for you to be able to get cheap grocery....  I guess
              it's an advantage to be living near a market where food is usually
              cheaper and fresher.</p>
              <p>I do my shopping mainly at the local supermarkets (coles or
              safeway), depending which one has the best offers for things I want
              to buy.  I do occasionally shop at Box Hill (about 15 min
              drive from where I live) especially when come to meat shopping as I
              prefer meat from the Asian butcher.</p>
              <p>The list I gave earlier was the things I bought when they were
              not on special but we just had to bite the bullet to help get
              through the week.  That was why I was shocked to find things
              were so much more expensive when you got them at full price.</p>
              <p>I like shopping in the supermarkets purely for its
              convenience.  Weekend is the only time for hubby and I to
              rest, do housework, catch up with family etc.  The last thing
              we want to do is to spend the whole day at the shops or to travel
              out of our way just to get a bargain.  To us, it's just not
              worth the petrol and our precious time.  While we enjoy having
              the worth of every penny spent, we enjoy spending quality time
              doing something else than to shop.  Life is too short!</p>
              <p>It's a lifestyle I guess, like you said.  Everyone lives a
              different lifestyle as long as it works for us and we are all happy
              about it, that's all it matters.  However, it still doesn't
              mean we can't whinge about things being expensive, does it?

              <p>Lol,</p>
              <p>that's true. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>For my fiance and I we love the good outdoors and love going around to check out and enjoy the local lifestyle, enjoying the sun, the stroll, the people - whether it be dodgy Footscray or sunny South Melbourne...so its like an outing for us going grocery shopping because we get to enjoy time together and get to go out together under hectic work and study life. <br>Plus we are also quite stingy when it comes to money as we're saving to buy a house, planning to further studies, etc. Or maybe its just because we can be quite cheapskate - nothing beats a good discount. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><br>I guess in most ways it is what a comfortable lifestyle is for every individual.<br>Ditto on the whinging. I love doing that to eating out. I mean, I love eating out and of course being Singaporean am used to cheap eats everywhere I go, but coming to Australia I first spent loads on eating out, couldn't shake off the habit, but loved it, still. Later, I realised that I could save that money for other things given the excuse I cook better than many of these cafes and restaurants. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> Of course, not the specialty ones like Flower Drum or the newly opened Nobu (I so wanna try that one!).<br><br>I remember just complaining to everyone I knew about how expensive a bowl of noodles can be! I used to always hang out at the now defunct Singapore Kopitiam (now Hawker's Cafe) for their boneless chicken rice, then it was Singapore Chom Chom for their mee pok. But alas, the premium prices!<br>I'd rather pay $30+ for the chicken rice at Mariott's Chatterbox. Yum.</p>
              <p>But local food here is pretty good, and we love the Aussie lifestyle, so cest' la vie, enjoy, live and let live. Be happy, etc etc. See, I'm going into a wide-eyed rambling of a dreamy girl in paradise. Never got to experience real, independent life in Singapore, so Australia is really paradise for me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"><br></p>

              <p>Hi redDust,</p>
              <p>you're welcome, I'm always happy to help.<br>Ikea in Melbourne I think is crap, personally. The variety is bad, the prices aren't worth the bad variety (in Singapore Ikea is a better alternative to Mom n' Pop furniture stores selling their charming 80's furniture <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, hence popular, I s'ppose.) except to enjoy the cheaper by miles food and food deals like $2 big breakfast. <br>Do check out their deals. Once in a blue moon they have really cheap stuff (photographic memory here. Shopping is a fine art!) compared to SG. They do have some cheap household stuff here and there, but not really worth going there to shop for a whole house - design-wise that'd be a disaster.</p>
              <p>If you want boxes, I think they do have those large cardboard ones for around $6 ea? However, they aren't very sturdy for heavy objects or if you plan to overload. Believe me, I bought a couple of nice, patterned cardboard magazine holders and they didn't last even 3 days just carrying interior design magazines. Boo. <br><br>Honeymouse graciously provided the website with the store above. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You could also try Officeworks. <br>They seem to have better quality stuff. Plus you can reuse their huuuuge plastic container. I don't know about you but it works out cheaper that way since you can stow them away under your bed as bedding storage or toy storage, etc etc, than paying for a box which might cave in at the first carry. lol.<br>Think its....$30+?</p>
              <p>Their website: <a href="http://www.officeworks.com.au">http://officeworks.com.au</a><br>You can check out the store locator.<br><br></p>

              <p>No no no!  Flower Drum is not what it used to be since it changed hands - if you want the old Flower Drum style, go to Lau's Family Kitchen in St Kilda - Gilbert Lau set it up after he sold FD.</p>
              <p>As for Nobu, don't bother - the food's very ordinary and it's filled with twentysomethings who live under the misconception that being there to be seen in a cheap suit and braying loudly is the "in" thing.  Overall, it was the dining equivalent of nails on a chalkboard.</p>
              <p>If you are in Nobu's neighbourhood, head ten metres east and go to Rockpool instead.  Service is brilliant, the atmosphere is civilised and Neil Perry's food defies words.  Start with a drink at the bar - your table's perfectly safe as long as you're there - and once you've ordered your meal, have a stroll down to the kitchen where you can see the chefs at work.  If you appreciate cooking, this is the place to be.</p>

              <p>But yes, we still like to whinge about things being expensive.

              <p>If you like asian, has anyone been to the red bean cafe? The nonya fish is not bad and the chilli/salt chicken chop is pretty tasty.  They have curry fish head too, both the curry type and the assam type. Went back to Singapore Chom Chom as I was in the city for a few days and have to say the food standard has dropped since last year.</p>

              <p>As for Pho, try Indochine next to Box Hill Central, or on Victoria Street in Richmond.</p>
              <p>Back to the main topic, I avoid supermarkets whenever I can - places like Box Hill market provide sell better ingredients at a lower price.  The one thing I can't seem to find anywhere is baby squid, though. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>

              nonya fish is not bad and the chilli/salt chicken chop is pretty
              tasty.  They have curry fish head too, both the curry type and
              the assam type. Went back to Singapore Chom Chom as I was in the
              city for a few days and have to say the food standard has dropped
              since last year.</p>

              <p>Totally agreed.  I would much prefer to shop in the market than in supermarkets.  Unfortunately we don't live near a market so we just have to bite the bullets.  As for meat, we get our meat from the butcher.  I usually go to Box Hill (15 min drive from our place) at least once a month to do our meat shopping.  It's cheaper and fresher.</p>
              <p>I like the Vietnamese Pho too....  Every now and then we will travel out of our way to Springvale to have the Pho.  The one I go to has a branch in Preston and Richmond.  So far, I think their pho is the best.</p>
              <p>Missy Rhonda told me that you were here for the Singapore Day.  I would have got a chance to meet you if I didn't chicken out at the last minute.  As I am not a Singaporean, Missy Rhonda was going to have me and hubby as guests but she got an email the day before saying that only Singaporeans were given preference.  We weren't sure if that meant she couldn't bring guests so we decided to give it a miss as we didn't want to travel all the way to the city to have our access denied.</p>

              <p>Hey HM,</p>
              <p>Melbourne was good, just for the food itself and the many good chocolate stores... : )</p>
              <p>Singapore Day was a real disappointment for me as the food quality really did not stack up. The queues were so long, I gave up trying to queue for food and some stores sold out early so could not try quite a few things... oh well...</p>
              <p>Other than that, it was a good time to catch up with Miss Rhonda and my wife's side of the family...</p>
              <p>Maybe we can meet up next time?</p>
              <p>Take care!</p>
