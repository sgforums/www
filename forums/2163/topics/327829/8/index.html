              <p>There's this new store called Aldi, they have their own brands and things are cheaper than Coles and Woolworth (Safeway in Melbourne but about to change to Woolworth).  I sometime shop there too.....  but I would still prefer if I can shop and buy everything I need at one spot.  Then again, I usually get the meat from Asian butcher.</p>

              <p>There's this new store called Aldi, they have their own brands
              and things are cheaper than Coles and Woolworth (Safeway in
              Melbourne but about to change to Woolworth).  I sometime shop
              there too.....  but I would still prefer if I can shop and buy
              everything I need at one spot.  Then again, I usually get the
              meat from Asian butcher.</p>

              <p>Hey, what a coincidence! There are ALDI stores here in the Twin Cities too. I do not know what they are like elsewhere, but over here, they are more like expanded convenience stores rather than full-service supermarkets. The groceries and merchandise they carry are mostly their own house brands, and the prices are slightly less than what you would pay at a regular supermarket.</p>
              <p>There are some disadvantages to shopping at ALDI, though. The variety of groceries is somewhat limited, they do not provide shopping bags (you have to bring your own), and they almost always have only one checkout line open at any time.</p>

              <p>Don't think Aldi is as big as it is in the States.  But I do agree with you, their range is very limited and there's only 1 checkout open.  You also have to pack your own shopping into your own shopping bags. Plastic bags are not free.</p>
              <p>Like the States, the Aldi here also sells some other stuffs ranging from PC to LCD TV.  Not sure how good they are though.....</p>
