              <p>so with regards to the point of living costs in Singapore .... you're saying that it's still the goverment's fault ? ....</p>
              <p>in anycase, your logic is faulty for 2), if the Singapore dollar is undervalued, then there is pressure on the SGD to appreciate against other currencies, in this example the USD, so apple'd get back more in USD terms if they convert from SGD to USD and count profits in terms of USD back home.</p>

              <p>Yes. I agree differential pricing. By why differential
              pricing?</p>
              <p>Differential pricing is to cushion the currency risk. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>I don't really use ipods (don't like them), I was just making
              comparisons with a widely available commodity which is tangible.

              <p>okie, since your premise is that the goverment's monetary policies and tinkering with the exchange rates, as you've alleged, is to be blamed for you having to pay more for an ipod over here ....</p>
              <p>would you like to explain to me why the ipod is still more expensive in other countries, like the UK, New Zealand, Australia, than in the US  ....</p>
              <p>or that it's much more expensive in Europe than in the US ... and indeed, even in Singapore too ? ....</p>
              <p>go check it out ....</p>
              <p>are they practising bad governance, bad monetary policy ? should i ask our goverment, you the economist, or apple corporation ? ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
