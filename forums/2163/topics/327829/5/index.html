              <p><br>Nobody's blaming the price of the ipods, it is used widely as a comparison, this remark kind of shows how superficial you can be. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Apple Corp or any business conduct their businesses with anticipation of certain profit margins. If both regions have similar cost structures, there is no reason why a company should decide to charge more for one region and cheaper for another region. It is similar to going to Best Denki in two different locations (same cost structure) in Singapore and getting different prices for the same product.</p>
              <p>Businesses will charge more if the risk in one country is higher than the other, maybe risk of currency fluctuations or other risk to their investments. If you compare the price of ipods in Hong Kong and USA, it doesn't vary much because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, this removes currency risk.</p>
              <p>Whereas Singapore's ipod prices is still priced above the USD 199 range. What other explanation can there be? Others here would like to sweep queries to "act of god". Is the government responsible for the exchange rate ("dirty float")? Maybe some would answer "NO!", it's an act of god. Is the current inflation rate related to the government's policy? "NO!", it's also an act of god.</p>
              <p>So if nothing is attributable to the government, then what does the government do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Sit back and collect their multi million dollar salaries for the afew dozen or so lackeys?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no doubt that Apple sets the pricing for the ipods, but why does their pricing policy vary? Isn't it due to currency or investment risk in Singapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like I said, if you take the price of the 8GB iPod nano sold in Singapore (free port) for SGD 318 remove the GST, it will still cost USD 209.29. This price is far off from what Hong Kong (free port) charges HKD 1,550, which is USD 198.44 (USD 1 = HKD 7.8109).</p>
              <p>I guess Apple deems Singapore's more risky, that's why the USD 10 premium for risk.</p>

              from what Hong Kong (free port) charges HKD 1,550, which
              is USD 198.44 (USD 1 = HKD 7.8109).</p>
              <p>I guess Apple deems Singapore's more risky, that's why the USD

              <p>The reason why Ipod are sold more could be due to market demand from a technologicaly savy society like ours who always strive to get the latest and best in tech products. Some of the marketing subjects i learn before taught me about the market segments and target demographics/culture of consumer trends.</p>

              <p>Differential pricing is right, I do not disagree with that fact, but why do they engage in differential pricing?</p>
              <p>1) Government does a "dirty float" (managed foreign exchange intervention), which increases the currency risk.</p>

              <p>Yes Europe has a higher cost of living, but what is their GDP per capita. Same as Singapore or higher? Why not just compare prices with Hong Kong or Australia, which have similar GDP per capita? You earn a poor Singaporean's wage and you want to live in Switzerland. Isn't it kind of foolhardy? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's to be done? Float the currency, isn't it all too obvious. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Let the free market decide what the equilibrium exchange rate should be, instead of suppressing the Singapore Dollar and increasing the rate of inflation.</p>

              <p><strong>9. The expanding duty of care.</strong> When establishing liability for damage caused by trees, ownership is a starting point but not the end of the inquiry. Other potentially responsible parties include those who possess the land on which the trees grow or exercise control over the trees. For example, maintaining trees, even if they are not yours, may be sufficient to give rise to a duty of care to others.</p>
              <p>The landmark case of Husovsky v U.S. (DDC 1978) 590 F2d 944 involved a motorist who was badly hurt when a tree limb, weighing nearly ten tons, fell onto his car. The tree was located on embassy land in Washington, D.C., owned by the government of India, and subject to an agreement that amounted to an easement for the benefit of the United States. The land was controlled and maintained by the federal government, and was indistinguishable from the contiguous national park. The road through the park was jointly maintained by the District of Columbia and the National Park Service. The court found that the United States, whose duty it was to maintain and service the park, owed a duty of reasonable care to avert hazards that could be dangerous to passing motorists.</p>

              <p>Subsidised fees? Sorry if you are not smart enough , you pay FULL fees.  HECs ( the subsidy) is not really cheap either but you can pay off using income tax. ( That is why I love HECs because I didn't go to Australia to pay full domestic fees)</p>

              <p>Since when I said they are higher risk? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Don't misunderstand the issues at hand, this
              is all about Apple pricing their products, the tariffs or GST that
              the government imposes does not go into Apple's pocket, hence
              no effect on the pricing policies of Apple. When Apple price their
              products, they do so because of risk and cost structure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Differential pricing is right, I do not disagree with
              that fact, but why do they engage in differential
              pricing?</p>
              <p>1) Government does a "dirty float" (managed foreign exchange
              intervention), which increases the currency risk.</p>
              <p>2) With the increase currency risk, Apple has to price it's
              product higher to get a return that's equivalent to the risk. You
              do understand the concept of risk and returns don't you?</p>

              <p>So which point do you disagree with me? Point 1) or 2)?</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>You disagree just for the sake of disagreeing.</p>
              <p>If you have a better explanation on why Apple price it's ipod
              the way it did, I am willing to listen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes Europe has a higher cost of living, but what is their GDP
              per capita. Same as Singapore or higher? Why not just compare
              prices with Hong Kong or Australia, which have similar GDP per
              capita? You earn a poor Singaporean's wage and you want to live in
              Switzerland. Isn't it kind of foolhardy?</p>

              <p>What's to be done? Float the currency, isn't it all too obvious.

If I was the government I need more citizens like you. Folks with blind faith like you are hard to find these days. Didn't you read the link on "duty of care" which I pasted? Too convoluted for you to understand? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Highly questionable if you even have a front yard in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure I blame, but I have facts to substantiate my case. I don't go around pointing finger at everyone claiming that they are this and that based on conjectures. Sounds familiar? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Yah, nobody's at fault, especially the government. If they decide to start buying more USD, SGD falls, inflation increases (Singapore imports most of it's goods). It is not the government's fault, it is an act of god. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>don't you know that ipods are part of the basket of goods to calculate inflation now ? ... or did you managed to snatch that out of thin air ? ....</p>

              <p>go on, re-read what I've said again, of course, to you, it is everybody's fault, except your own .... perhaps you'd want to blame your parents for giving birth to you in Singapore too ? ... after all, it's not YOUR fault, right ? .... they short-changed you by having you in a place where you were able to "achieve less", as you've put it ? ... no wait, it's the goverment's fault right ? ... for encouraging them to give birth ?</p>
