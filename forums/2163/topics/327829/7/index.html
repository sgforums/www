              <p>this forum has been a very peaceful forum so please do not spoil it.  you wanna state your point, fine...go ahead but please don't go to the extreme of being personal.</p>
              <p>talking or comparing wealth and background, academic or otherwise doesn't make one a better person.  what you speak/write reflect on oneself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and oh, this is not speaker's corner hor!  we are here to unwind.  no need to get too intellectual!  bye bye!</p>
