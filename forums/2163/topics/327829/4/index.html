              <p>If it's so hard for you to understand that monetary policies has a direct impact on the citizen's lives, I am willing to accept your theory that god through his "invisible hands" manages the exchange rate, inflation and interest rates. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Also don't forget that Australia and New Zealand has higher GST than Singapore, but their ipods are still priced competitively. If you remove all elements of taxes, the iPods would be cheaper than Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hong Kong has no GST and a free port, the iPod cost SGD 281.17 even with a GST of 7% it would end up cheaper than Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>It's difficult to make comparisons based on those shops, it is expensive, but still cheaper than Apple (Australia) online. The same case with Singapore, consumers can get their ipods from Sim Lim which is relatively cheaper than Apple (Singapore) online.</p>
              <p>**I am only looking at ipod nanos, not all the ipods.</p>
              <p>Australia is not a free port like Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>frankly to earn 112k( 4yr) doesnt need 7-8 year to earn ah. if u r good enough. maybe 1.5yr you can get that kind of salary in singapore. i think there are more oppt in sg than ade. However in career, hardwork and luck do play part.</p>

              <p>400k for a landed property, yes that true, unless you pay by cash. if u take loan for a 9% interest? u better do the maths before u buy one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its true, electronics items are cheaper in aust than sg, as far as i know. car is cheaper, petrol is cheaper, groceries i think the same or cheaper unless u buy chinese groceries such as rice, century egg and etc.</p>

              <p>at 249 AUD, it works out to 215 USD, which is still more than 199, you were getting exchange rates from the fellow at the mama shop ? or you were comparing 4 gigs and 8 gigs models ? ....</p>

              <p>after tax, u will get around 25- 30 K. dont state directly from job ads. Also depends on which state u working in. I think WA, are short of labour, so expect more. They advertise as 50K is the salary given without tax. Btw if u are just starting dont expect to get a lot of money but fairly fair amount by aussie standards</p>
