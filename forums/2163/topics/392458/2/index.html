              <p>Lost: Kohl's is so-so. Make sure you scrutinize the fabric quality. Twice now I've had to return blouses because a hole developed in the fabric weave. If you can find a Sears Outlet, that's where we've just started carrying discontinued Lands' End clothes and accessories. You can get a tee for just $5, business shirts for $12 and more. I just transferred from the outlet and it's a lucky thing because I just couldn't resist the great buys. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>80F!!!! wat you folks just went from winter to summer!</p>
              <p>we've got quite a bit of rain past 2 days....my freaking basement is soaking wet despite the seriously overworked sump pump. most part of my town and many of the houses are below the water table so the basements are prone to flooding.</p>
              <p>eeeks...i absolutely hate cold, dark and wet basements. &amp; i've to do my laundry down there *sob* can't believe many of the stupid houses here are close to if not over a million dollars....i won't even pay a couple hundred thous for a house with flooded basement!!!! arghhh</p>
              <p>the men's shirts at kohls (their housebrand) aren't too bad actually. and for $4.20 each...i really won't complain much at all. even the most crap shirts with tissue-paper thin material at SG Giants are like SGD10!</p>
              <p>lands end/LLbean of course good but usually not cheap. i've a LLbean outlet near my place and i did buy quite a lot of stuffs (esp shoes) from there. absolutely great quality but not so fashionable.</p>
              <p>hey that's an interesting site. what business is that? like etsy type? i'm shopping like crazy at etsy these days....  jetta: are you on etsy? share with us some of your creations! =)</p>

              <p>Nah, I'm not on etsy. People there are sneaky enough to copy your designs to call their own. After all the hard work I've put into my creations, no thanks. I'd much rather continue selling at craft fairs.</p>
              <p>Yes, Lands' End isn't cheap but their stuff is guaranteed. Period. I have returned stuff three years after purchase with no problems. Inventory at the Sears outlet is fantastic, with prices even more fantastic. We're not talking seconds, or overruns, just stuff from the previous season.</p>
              <p>Save all your Kohl's receipts, is all I can say. I'm a receipt saver. lol</p>
              <p>As for the weather, our winters are mild. I think our coldest days are balmy to you folks to the north of us. Don't forget flood insurance. Mucho importante!</p>
