              <p>If only I had a yard. All I have is a 12x15 concrete patio and all I can do is plant in containers. Wish I had your pretty yard. So what are you going to plant this year? I have decided to go the drought tolerate route, choosing only native CA plants because of our never ending drought conditions.</p>
              <p>Speaking of the weather, anyone here getting the deluge of flood water? I see scary pictures on tv. First the heavy snow, now flooding. Poor things.</p>
              <p>I was laughing at what you said about people here bragging about how little they paid for stuff. So true! *raises hand*.</p>

              <p>wah lao...the sump pump was acting all weird yesterday (it's supposed to start and stop periodically when the water level rises but yesterday, it just remained on the start mode and didn't stop) and this morning when i went to check...the pipe was spitting water everywhere...good gawd....one side of the basement had water everywhere. so we took some fabric/tape/ropes and secured the leaking pipe...it's better now but still leaking a little. will have to talk to my landlord about it when she comes. heard the plumbing here costs big bucks. good too that the rain has stopped...otherwise i think the sump pump is gonna blow and we'll be swimming in the basement!</p>
              <p>ya la....the house generally is okay....can't expect much from an antique house (more than 100yrs old). just the basement is gross. yup my rental contract ends june...we'll be away for 2 months and then we'll either start renting again in september or MAYBE we'll have our own place then. once summer is over...there'll be tonnes of summer home rentals to choose from at very affordable rents...so guess we need not worry about finding a rental place too.</p>
              <p>the properties are indeed moving here (or at least the good ones are) prob 'cos everyone is rushing for the april deadline for housing grant. we are looking for something with a bit more space....so movements for that category houses' seem to be very sluggish so we're in no big rush.</p>
              <p>and we are not looking to buy where i'm currently renting 'cos of the wet basements issues and high prices...we're looking further north of our current place. i hate water accumulation anywhere near the house/in the house....so i'm hoping to find some place near the coast but with elevation such that i don't get flood problems.. so flood insurance not necessary but i might be hit with wind insurance especially at the higher elevations. we get winds of 55-60mph quite often.</p>

              <p>Nah, I'm not on etsy. People there are sneaky enough to copy your designs to call their own. After all the hard work I've put into my creations, no thanks. I'd much rather continue selling at craft fairs.</p>
              <p>Yes, Lands' End isn't cheap but their stuff is guaranteed. Period. I have returned stuff three years after purchase with no problems. Inventory at the Sears outlet is fantastic, with prices even more fantastic. We're not talking seconds, or overruns, just stuff from the previous season.</p>
              <p>Save all your Kohl's receipts, is all I can say. I'm a receipt saver. lol</p>
              <p>As for the weather, our winters are mild. I think our coldest days are balmy to you folks to the north of us. Don't forget flood insurance. Mucho importante!</p>

              <p><br>ya...i like the return policy here - "no questions asked". singapore is still way behind in this aspect. some shops in SG are already practising it...but so far, maximum is up to a month for return. good for impulsive shopper like me. once buyer's remorse sets in after i reach home...at least i can still return it f i want to. i keep most of my receipts too as i tally all my spendings on my debit card regularly.</p>
              <p>tell me about jo-ann. i ordered stuffs like weeks and weeks ago and only rec'd it (minus various stuffs that suddenly became out-of-stock but still selling online!) yesterday. think i'll have to go to the store to get some padding material for my laptop/netbook cases that i'm gonna make. but everytime i go there...i'd end up buying more than i ever need.  wish there's a jo-ann very near my place....the sewing section at michael's sucks...the last time i went there for a couple of things like zipper, chalk, bias tape....all weren't available....bleahh</p>

              <p>Michael's isn't known for fabrics. Sidenote: Did you know that if you "forget" to bring your Michael's coupon, they'll jot your name down in a little book and give you the discount?</p>
              <p>Have you googled fabric stores in your location? Many fabric stores here have gone bust leaving us with just a handful of fabrics stores. Quilting is big here so many of the said stores cater towards that hobby which means fabric is expensive. Expect to find prices close to $10 a yard at quilting stores.

              <p>That remins me of something I did as a juvenile, maybe 12 yrs old. Me and some friends needed to purchase a baseball at Woolworths. There were 2 types available; the expensive one and the cheaper one.The price was on the box. Of course we had to examine them both to see what the difference was and we 'accidentally' put them in the wrong box when finished then purchased the 'cheaper' one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>I still lose sleep over that.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
