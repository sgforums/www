              <p><br>I had been doing that since '89, when I came stateside to study. After I started working here, I had to furnish documentary proof of my employment status with every annual EP renewal. Even after I had informed the SAF of my PR status and requested 3-year validity periods on my EPs, they still issued them with annual expirations.</p>
              <p>I can't remember the exact time frame, but I actually went without renewing my EP for a couple of years because I outright forgot. I did not travel to Singapore during these two years and, surprisingly, the SAF did not send any renewal reminders either to me or my parents in Singapore. When I finally did renew it, they did not give me any trouble.</p>

              <p>Nope. The SAF (surprisingly) did not give me grief when I finally got round to renewing the EP after letting it lapse for two years, and on my subsequent trip back to SG, no questions were asked at the airport.</p>

              <p>Take a look at the USCIS website <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=ae853ad15c673210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ae853ad15c673210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD">here</a> about "green card" application requirements and procedures.</p>
              <p>There is no requirement by the USCIS for green card applicants to relinquish their existing residency/citizenship statuses. Your spouse should still be able to maintain his SPR status after he gets his green card, and I doubt he's under any obligation to inform the SG government about the green card.</p>
              <p>Don't know if you can maintain property and other investments in SG if you're no longer citizens or PRs of that country--perhaps someone else can chime in.</p>
              <p>You can withdraw your CPF monies if you renounce your SG citizenship, but I doubt the CPF board will be constantly hounding and reminding you to do so.</p>

              <p><br>The Singapore gabrament does not need to know about your having acquired US citizenship, and the USCIS does not inform them of your new status.</p>
              <p>And in case you're wondering, the US <em>implicitly</em> recognizes dual-citizenship as it does not require renunciation of your previous one as a prerequisite for naturalization, despite what the Oath of Allegiance that you take at your naturalization ceremony says.</p>

              <p>The Singapore gabrament <em>currently</em> does not allow dual citizenship, but I have read and heard of rumours that they might allow it sometime in the near future to slow the outflow of emigrating Singaporeans.<br><br>If you keep your Singapore issued documents (passport, IC, exit permit, etc.) current, I seriously doubt the Singapore government would know <em>or care</em> about your acquisition of US citizenship. You would, of course, have to use your US passport for travel to Singapore as you would no longer have your green card for re-entry into the US as a PR, and I don't think having "Singapore" listed as your country of birth on your US passport would raise any red flags or subject you to additional scrutiny.<br><br>If the Singapore gabrament is alerted to your dual-citizenship by your doing something silly (like using your US passport to leave the US and then, inadvertently or otherwise, handing your Singapore passport to the immigration officer upon arrival at Changi Airport), you can always claim that you're making the trip there to renounce your Singapore citizenship.</p>

              <p>So for the dual-citizenship crowd, they will actually use the US passport to both leave US and enter SG when they travel between the countries....</p>

              <p>I am wondering with the biometrics and so on, the 'system' should be able to read my fingerprint etc and determine that I (entering as a US citizen) is actually also a SG citizen....</p>

              <p>anyway... wondering whether anyone actually really tried it (and will admit it here).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh yeah... when you 'renew' your SG passport, there is a need to sign a declaration that I am not a citizen of any other country.... wife just renewed her passport and we read the clause... doesn't apply to us now but might apply to us in the future.</p>

              <p>Many countries that allow dual citizenship will require citizens to use that country's passport when entering or leaving the country.  These includes the US and Australia.  I believe Singapore actually may have a similar law.  (The exception to this rule is the UK, which actually does not insist that its citizens enter and leave on a UK passport)..</p>

              <p>That might work if countries A and B both recognize dual citizenship.</p>
              <p>However, if you leave the US using your US passport and enter Singapore with your Singapore passport, the lack of an electronic "exit stamp" on your Singapore passport indicating your departure from the US might raise a red flag with Singapore Immigration and subject you to additional and unwanted scrutiny.</p>
