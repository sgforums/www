              <p>err this is silly. Why the hell do u want to study at anywhere cos its glamourous and prestigious!? Not like its some finishing school for ladies!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure how my studies in Australia changed me. I think for one thing, it made me far more independent since I lived more or less alone. Made me more assertive in making friends, and appreciate them more. Made me closer to my parents, who weren't there, but showed support from here. And other friends too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Learnt how to be alone and not feel lonely. :)</p>
              <p>I think studying overseas is a good opportunity to understand yourself and your limits and then push them in the comfort of unfamiliar and new friends who would not discourage you when you want to try something new, and who haven't yet 'label' you as any 'type'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, I have also seen too many people foul it up due to their lack of self restraint when given the sudden freedom.</p>

Students from Malaysia, Indonesia and China were not that much happier, according to the study. Overall, 67 per cent of female and 62 per cent of male international students said they experienced 'periods of loneliness and isolation' Down Under. Some of the young men and women polled said they felt like they were in 'a very strange place' and likened their experience to being 'lost in a jungle'.

              <p> So yeah. if ordinary mortals. aka Singaporeans cannot even adapt to uni life in Australia, how more can they adapt to settling down in Australia?</p>
              <p> Fundamentally, Sg students need to open up, be less culturally eccentric and for God's sake, go mingle with the Angmors and not merely mingle with ur pathetic villagers aka the SG students' Union.</p>

              <p>lots if you think about it. Like it was said before, it is how  you see everything. either your cup is half empty or half full. If you are already there, make the most of the situation and your circumstances. Why must Singaporeans always equate being able to do things with money. Sure it helps, but one can be creative.</p>

              <p><br>Whoa, ease up there, wolf.  That's a lot of asusmptions you're making.</p>
              <p>First, as Breyton has noted, money's not the deciding factor.  Hell, I got around all right on a budget over seven years that I saw other Singaporean students spend in less than three.  I bought a car for $1500 and it got me around good for four years - who needs gobs of money when you know how to spend it right?  I agree with Breyton - you can either sit around and moan about not having enough money no matter how much you have, or you can grow up and deal with what you've got.</p>
              <p>Second, that "I have no life because I have to study" story just doesn't cut it.  In my Honours year, I was a full-time student, worked the maximum 20 hours allowed every week, did an internship, tutored other students, was part of the student union and still managed to have a social life.  At the end of that, I got into a class of 12 postgrads out of 1200 applicants.  Where there's a will, there's relatives ..., whoops, there's a way. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>There's only two things in life - results and excuses.  Those who don't choose results only have themselves to blame, not money, not time, not ANYTHING.</p>

              <p>Second, that "I have no life because I have to study" story just doesn't cut it.  In my Honours year, I was a full-time student, worked the maximum 20 hours allowed every week, did an internship, tutored other students, was part of the student union and still managed to have a social life.  At the end of that, I got into a class of 12 postgrads out of 1200 applicants.  Where there's a will, there's relatives ..., whoops, there's a way. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>There's only two things in life - results and excuses.  Those who don't choose results only have themselves to blame, not money, not time, not ANYTHING.</p>

              <p>You wanna ease up there, sport?  Go check your facts and see what the average Singaporean student's budget is before you start with the attitude.  If you think it's less than the $700 (yes, seven <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hundred</span> - I didn't miss a zero) a month I ran on, you're dreaming - I WORKED for everything else, instead of kicking back and crying about how unfair life is.   Keep the pontifications about being "better off" to yourself because it smells like an excuse to me.</p>
              <p>Beg?  Rob?  Ever heard of working, or are you really that useless? 
                      Since I got myself set up here 14 years ago, I've never been unemployed
                      for more than 48 hours at a stretch so, yes, people only have themselves to blame if they have no money here.  Hell, you want to talk about having no money?  Look at students here from countries like Nepal, which limit the amount of money that can be remitted out of the country.  These students just shrug and get on with finding jobs, unlike other whingers who make excuses that robbing and begging are the only courses of action open to them.</p>
              <p>Have you actually been here, much less studied here?  Do you have any firsthand experience with what goes on with Singaporean students here?  Can you put forward any Singaporean students in Australia who lived on less than $700 a month? Or are you just making things up?</p>
              <p>Even more fundamentally, the issue here is that Singaporean students feel friendless and isolated.  Do you have to buy your friends?  If you do, I really pity you.  Tell me, how much does it cost to talk to someone you meet?</p>
              <p>If you want to be one of life's natural losers, knock yourself out making excuses for being too much of a coward to take any opportunities that come your way.  Just don't try taking it up with people who would rather do something with their lives - it'll make you even smaller than you already are.</p>

              <p>Did you not read what Ged did? He worked, had fun and still did well. I worked while I was studying, and earned my keep and I know many others who were in the same situation. I think you should ease up like Gedenken suggested. The bottom line is your life is what YOU make of it, not someone else.</p>
              <p>I sense you are very frustrated, how come? What's eating at you?</p>
              <p>Just curious, so who do you blame when you have no money?</p>

              <p>i am so motivated to hear from forumites having a never say die attitude over in australia. I am too not from a well to do family but i am planning to study there after my NS. I do not care how difficult or challenging it is going to take for even if i have to work for 2 years to save up i will do so too.</p>
              <p>oh i heard from friends over there if you do not have another life other than studying over there, its kinda wasted. I agree on that point too even though initially i thought you shouldn't waste hard earned money by having fun over there. It is like one must have a fair share of hardwork+fun over there to make things memorable and bring back an exclusive experience. =)</p>

              <p>Good call, bas.  Going overseas to study is as much a coming-of-age experience as NS is.  Both put you out of your comfort zone and create situations in which you can really grow.  One of the lofty ideals behind hiring graduates is that they are supposed to bring a fresh perspective to their jobs, and having been exposed to different cultures (and by extension, different ways of looking at and doing things), this is ideally where an overseas education would provide you with even more of an advantage.  If you go overseas and learn to look at things from a different cultural perspective, that's an additional bit in your intellectual toolkit that you can take along anywhere you go.</p>
              <p>That said, as glad as I am to be away from Singapore, one thing I will say in favour of having grown up in Singapore is that learning to grow up without a safety net was a good formative experience.  Right from the word go, Singaporeans were expected to take care of their own business - if you fell behind, you were on your own.  It builds the resilience you will need if you're going to push yourself out of your comfort zone and still perform.</p>

              <p>Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that these are things that you won't learn in NS.  I've experienced weather in ROC that matched the worst that metropolitan Melbourne could throw at me, going from being a schoolkid to being in a platoon with guys from all walks of life and mission planning all came with the NS territory.</p>
              <p>The two experiences are different, but some of the same lessons can be learnt in both environments to varying degrees.</p>

              <p>Throughout my 11 academic years in the US, I met only 3 Singaporeans. And all by chance. Yes that's right, only 3. And I assure you this is not some rural college out in the mid-east either. The rather good thing is I managed to meet a lot of folks from various ethnic backgrounds and enjoyed a spectrum of cuisine from almost all over the world.  The downside of course is I tend to forget how to the much beloved Singlish is spoken. I have not read news about SG for the last 5 years. Only started posting here since late last year. And this Feb I went back to SG, I had to use a freaking map. And oh, I called jelly as jello. And when I joked about the TPS report, my old SG pals stared at me. Yep.</p>
              <p>But this aside, studying overseas is definitely more than spending time in classrooms and traveling only when you head back to SG. It's about self-exploration as well. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for most pple and don't waste it. Yes, I studied engineering but I ventured into western art history, US 20th century history, history of jazz music and surprisingly foreign films analysis (I helped run a film society in my undergrad years). I spent a number of summers at national parks as well.</p>

              <p>But there is one thing they cant beat singaporeans in. Singaporeans are good terms with the whites coz they know we are also from a developed nation..They tend to treat us with respect.</p>
