              <p>See I have a very different perspective compared to most of you. Home is where I feel I belong, so I feel very at home when I'm in London. Indeed, I always feel somewhat out of place when I return for the holidays; the 1st few days back in Singapore is guarenteed to see me in a blue funk, if not an inexplicible rage. If I were to go on memories then Singapore has nothing going for me anyways, because all my memories about the place are bad, despite the fact that only 20% of my life's been spent in London.</p>
              <p>The1st day I arrived in London, I already felt at home, and not lonely at all. The people here were very warm, welcoming, friendly, and made an attempt at breaking the ice. It's probably a cultural thing, because in my past experience, Singaporeans in the same situation would keep to themselves, which could be why most typical Sinaporeans would feel lonely when they go overseas. Personally within a couple weeks I was already well integrated with the locals and certainly having a ball.</p>
              <p>Of course not to detract or criticise any of you, but how one's overseas experience is, depends on perhaps 3 things ultimately:</p>
              <p>1) The culture of the place u're going to.</p>
              <p>2) What sort of personality and person you are in general with regards to your feelings about Singapore.</p>
              <p>3) Whether your departure from Singapore was willing, or due to circumstances.</p>
              <p>I can say that personally, seeing myself as being Singaporean by birth only, and a rather unfortunate circumstance at that, I do not have any problems leaving it behind for a place that is much better and suits me more, nor do I have any problems mixing in with my adoptive home and it's people.</p>

              <p>Strange you mentioned how warm the Brits in London are because I had quite a few Filipino nurses tell me that they felt more welcome and at home in the UK than they do here.  At least, when they were new in their workplaces in the UK, their British colleagues took time to chat with them, tell them about the neighbourhood, and a few even got taken around on outings and drives!  But when they arrived here to work, they found the Aussie nurses more standoffish, mostly not interested in  you at all, and forget about them taking their time off to bring you around.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I've never been to the UK so I can't comment but it's indeed telling to hear from that many people, all with positive experiences with the UK. </p>
              <p>Hmm... come to think of it, the few close colleagues I do have happen to be Brits!  They are the ones who tend not to judge us because of the colour of our skin and they will laugh along with me and we can talk freely about anything... food, men, dating, sex, money, family life, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  Of course I do have a few Aussie friends as well but in general, I have found it easier to relate to the British, compared to the 'purebred' Caucasian Aussies.</p>
              <p>All said, I'm not exactly keen to return to Singapore.  I do miss my close friends and my family, and of course the food.  But the weather sucks, the crowds suck, the waiting and queuing and fighting to get on board public transport suck, and most importantly, the lack of respect for employees in the workplace and the high cost of living just royally suck.</p>
              <p>I am proud to be a Singaporean... but strangely, my pride burns the strongest when I'm offshore!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>actually, when you first move, no matter how many people or who
              you are around, there will be days when you will just feel
              lonely.<br> it's not a matter of making friends etc...you can still feel lonely
              when you're around hundreds of people or when you have a million
              things going on.</p>
              <p>but it's good to have someone to talk to on days like that. be
              it a family member, an old friend 'from home' or someone who will
              hopefully understand your situation...</p>
              <p>there are some people who move and really NEVER make any friends
              in the' new' country. but that's usually because they don't
              socialize in any way at all. if you move and get a job or attend
              school, chances are, you'll make friends anyhow. esp good if you at
              least somewhat know someone there already. like...a friend's friend
              or something...</p>
              <p>of course there are other reasons for not having friends. lousy
              personality, mental disorders of various sorts, i-hate-people, just
              pure bad luck....</p>

              <p>I think the Singaporean students (and other foreign students) are pretty lucky because there are so many Singaporeans studying here at any one time in any university that they are able to herd together and go places, do things, talk Singlish together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>At times, I feel displaced, but the feeling is increasingly dissipating simply because I've made new friends, I've settled in, and I've grown to love Melbourne.  It helps that I chose to move out of Singapore and that this move is the ultimation of several years of careful strategic planning and mucho painful sacrifice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  I finally feel blissful and content most days.  I've always felt angstsy and sorta simmering-angry all the time in Singapore.  Maybe, I truly hate the rat race, and more than that, I hated the kind of working life that we all had to endure - long hours at work, unreasonable treatment and demands you can't quite complain about cause nobody cares cause everyone else is deep in their own shithole anyways, and then coming home from work to a pile of bills and thinking that you're really no better than a slaving buffalo and it's a really sad hand-to-mouth existence with no time to stop and smell any (trampled) roses.  I say trampled because there are simply too many heads per sq m on the entire bloody island for the poor roses to thrive nicely.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Sure, there are moments of loneliness, moments of longing for my friends and family back home, but everyday I spend at home is a peaceful, happy day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">  It's sooo important too because if you're happy with your home, you have a restful respite and solitude that kinda balances you out.  That, and the icing on the cake is the awesome fact that I have so many days off per week that anytime I feel work is starting to be too much to handle, I have a day or two off and then when I return to work, I feel recharged and ready to face whatever challenges I have to endure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>
              <p>I feel back in SG, unless I marry rich, I will never be able to have the kind of life I want - equal parts work and equal parts play.  Here, I'm still not reach but hey, I'm already living the life I want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The way I see it, if one is prepare to accept changes and
              take the initiative to break the ice with the fellow next to you, no one should
              really have problem socialising with the locals.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Talking about feeling displaced, about 4 years, I went to an
              interview in a mining town. The town is in the middle of woop woop with a total
              population of 4000-5000. 40 percent of the town shares the same family name. As
              I drove past town, the local were staring at me without flinching. It was as if
              they have not seen a Singaporean before. In the local pub, their mentality of Chinese
              is that all Chinese knows kungfu. I though it was hilarious. I actually end up
              taking that job.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Most Aussie activities revolve around beers. At the end of the
              working day, most miners would sit around the pub having a couple of beers
              before dinner. It is usually the only social activity after work with the
              exception of perving at the new nurse or the few female truck drivers on site.
              It is pathetic. Ratio of male to female should be close to 15:1. You can either
              choose to socializes with your co-workers or go to bed. Work is considered
              entertaining this way.</p>

              <p>oh ice shack for sure ! ain't going to get my balls

              <p>yeah ontario is not the best place to fish really. driving to
              manitoba is a good 2 days ! we were suppose to do a road trip out
              east to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. i'm sure we can fish over
              there. </p>

              <p>early winter ? ... the ice's probably not even thick enough yet .... I still have an ice shack I share with a friend in pluto ... but I dont' suppose you'd want to go to toon town to get it .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>nova scotia ? ... perhaps you should ask small noodle about the place... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>gosh I miss the big trout and walleyes .....</p>
