              <p>Now in OC California.</p>
              <p>Delayed at Beijing Airport due to Mechanical fault.</p>
              <p>Beijing airport, looks big, but they dont allow us to travel between terminals, so I spent over $300 shopping.  I only realised how expensive everything was when I sat down for a beer at a pub restaurant.</p>
              <p>Did the calculation and realised that my beer cost $5/- and the panini sandwich with one slice of lettuce, 3 pieces of bacon cost $30........</p>
              <p>And I didnt realise the milk scare from china was so bad, the 5 boxes of expensive chocolates from China looks about to go into a trashbin.</p>
              <p>4 boxees of majong shaped chocolates &amp; 1 box of chinese opera mask shaped chocolates...</p>
              <p>My lips went dry during the flight and no amount of lipbalm is saving me now. Trying to drink plenty of water now.</p>
              <p>The last leg of the flight, I was trapped at the window seat with a china mummy &amp; two daughters.  The kids are very quiet and shy, and the mother did have some hard time trying to hold her elder daughter to sleep.  The gal threw up and I helped with containing her vomit and helped the mother to clean her up.</p>
              <p>It was not a comfortable journey since I was trapped at the seat for most part of that journey.</p>

              <p>That is the reason I <em>always</em> select an aisle seat on long-haul flights. You might have to get out of your seat every so often to let the passenger beside you in and out, but that's a small price to pay for easy access to the restroom and the "unlimited" leg and elbow room on the aisle side of the seat.</p>

              I dont know.....I always liked window seat cos I can see the landing and the takeoffs.
              
              Plus the window is good enough for a rolled up blanket or a small pillow to rest on.
              
              I forgot to mention, the china lady behind me proped her feet on my armrest.  Thankfully, her feet didnt smell.  I seem to always get feet persons to me or behind me.
              
              But 23 hours encased in a hiking boots  made my own feet stinks when I got on the family sports van and took off my shoes......I am going to get some shoe spray the moment I can leave the house.
              
              Nephew seems to hae stomach flu that is going around his school, so he has to be kept home with mummy &amp; auntie.
              
              Neice is chattering and she can get away with murder once she turns her voice and character on me. We were watching 'Wallie' in the sports van and the kids were surprising me constanty with their chatter.
              
              The house's bunny is now so fat and big, its almost the size of a small pig......I cant stop thinking of it as suitable for stew.

              Bought also some socks to sleep in and 3 long sleeve t-shirts for the trip.

              <p>You're not going to need all that winter gear if you're only visiting Vancouver, BC. It's only going to be in the 30s and 40s during the time you've indicated you'll be there.</p>

              Well my flights leave USA from LAX, so I guess I will still have to go back California; at leas tot hug my nephew &amp; neice goodbye.
              
              The boy was so sweet, and the girl was teh-ing my feet off.  Kids talking at 2 &amp; 4 years old is real interesting.
              
              I went for another round of shopping nearby at Roncho Santa Magarita Town Centre.  Bought a Hello Kitty Padded Jacket at Ross.  I figure Beijing might just need a HK Padded Jacket.  And I bought more sleepwear with fleece pants.
              
              But today at California Adventure Park, I was walking around with a light jacket on my arms despite the gloomy sky.  Even after getting soaked at a water ride, it still was too warm for me.  I see angmos wearing padded jackets and long sleeve, but my body temp wont go down!

              <p>Finally snowed!!!!</p>
              <p>Am now at Whistler Mountain Canada.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tried skiing yesterday and ended up with serious crimped toes cos the boots are too small or too narrow.  I have small feet but with wide toes.  Then there was those various strange blue blacks on both my knees and inner calfs.</p>
              <p>I just realised that some creep made me a mod of the CNB forum and is so very angry now.  Either its the heat at this village centre internet station or I am really REALLY pissed off.</p>
              <p>I didnt have any laptop with me and is relying on internet cafes, to become someone with not my knowledge or even approvals from my superiors really cheesed me off bigtime.</p>
              <p>The snow was fantastic though, I think I will go out and get myself drowned by sonowflakes and have another steak shrimp combo with another bottle of really nice canadian wine!</p>

              <p>So glad you're here now. I had fun with you both too. Let's do it again when she gets back to this part of CA?</p>

              <p>The traffic was bad since it was raining, it's smooth but everyone was just driving too slow. I guess Singaporean are good at driving in the rain... ha ha!!! Anyway, I took my time driving (55-60mph) back to OC to drop VK. We left about 1.45pm and arrive her home by 3.30pm</p>
              <p>The worse part of the drive is from OC to LA... it was heavy traffic on 5N (0-10mph) bumper to bumper... from where VK is to juction of 57, it's too like 1.5hrs (left at 4.30pm) and I had to detour to a Shell station and look for the ladies (had a glass of water before I left VK's place). Then from there to home took me another 1.5hrs (left at 6.10pm) and 5N (0-20mph) was still so bad all the way... it was only at 605N (50-65mph) that traffic was much better. The best was 10W, you can speed all you like... hee hee, by the time I reached home, it was 7.30pm.</p>
              <p>I caught the cold now... the weather is crazy...</p>
              <p>Well, I hope I can meet you again either in SD or if you can make it to SF... as I'm trying to see if I can join her to SF too. It would be fun to have a group of ladies travelling together. I miss the clam chower in the sourdough bread. Been craving for that for the last 2 years... ha ha</p>
