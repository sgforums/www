              <p>Dear friends.......I am stranded in California now till Feb 09.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The flight changes took forever!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I sky dived today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jumped out of a plane tandem with a group of nurse trainees (5 of them).  all of us jumped tandem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manz.....the feeling is indescib-able!  The initiation feeling of dropping from the plane and like no gravity nearly give me a panic attack!  Thankfully, the flying down and then parachute opening float down was gentle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didnt do any muscle warm up before the flight, so therefore I sucked at landing.....where we are to land on our butt.  My left heel hit the wet muddy grass at the landing site and bend the whole left knee into me  Thankfully there was no rocks to seriously dislocate that knee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now......to see whether I will scream again in sleep.  Gen will remember that if I get a scare. I scream in my sleep.  I still feel the initial heart pumping scrare when i physically was out of the plane...and the instructor behind me was somehow loose from my body harness.......</p>

              <p>Foot is a size 35, or a 5.5 depending on country its in.  Realised that my foot is small enough for big kids shoes but its wider at the toes instead of longer.</p>
              <p>The colour is a solid bright red from Sally Hanson.  In Singapore, it will be viewed too tacky.</p>

              <p>Err....been sticking at home, doing laundry for the family, clearing the leftovers in the fridge and packing.</p>
              <p>My sister just commented today.  That before I came to USA, I was grumbling about everything I have to give away. </p>
              <p>The last time I was in USA, I returned to Singapore with 4 big luggage of stuffs.  And this trip to USA, I again have to grumble and junk or give away all my stuffs because the flat is sold.</p>
              <p>Now that I am in USA, I buy four luggage worth of stuffs to bring home to Singapore again......</p>
              <p>And oh....today:</p>
              <p>Woke up when my sister tells me the cleaners are here.  Moved my luggages off the floor onto the bed so the cleaner can vacumn the floors.</p>
              <p>Went out with my sister to Irvine Spectrum Centre to look for two jelly bean dispensers.  Found them but they are not what my sis wanted.</p>
              <p>Went to Walmart, to buy pet rabbit straws and feed.  I bought another small maglite to go with my Leatherman.  The bigger surefire is a replacement for batons, since I long time never weild a baton.</p>
              <p>Went to Trader Joes to do grocery shopping with my sis, I am getting old, couldnt find the sparkling juices.  Was asking for Iced Wine but directed to Riesling.</p>
              <p>Then come home, do laundry, simple lah....just sort colours, put in washing machine, take the previous load into the dryer.  And at the same time, pick out the dusty slippers and shoes of my sis's family and gives them a wash.  Most of them  can see can junk totally, but the crocs, I try to save.</p>
              <p>Then I help pulled out the toys bins in the family van and my sister sort thru them to remove toys that is no longer relevant to the kids.</p>
              <p>Thats about it.</p>

              <p>Well can't really commend about it other than Trader Joe.  But first maybe a few places u might want to visit within day trip. - First McDonald Stand. Griffin Park, Riley Farm - Belmont. and BBQ, Wrightwood to see the San Andreas fault line..n ski.... San Pedro Ports O Call.  </p>
              <p>I shall share what i think is a really good buy in trader joe. I think they have some money for value in terms of wine. But if you want to have alternate selection go to World Market cost plus.</p>
              <p>Start with the sweets stuff in trader joe </p>
              <p>Belgium Chocolate with Almond in 1 lbs bar, Truffle is pretty good and decent price. Actually Apple Pie is really good home made. The nuts and mix are healthy n great choice.</p>
              <p>Snack. - The Ridge cut potatoes are really goods but quite expensive.</p>
              <p>I usually get Cheese and Wine. (can't bit the price between $1.99 - $3.99 a bottle)</p>

              <p>I do love Trader Joes.</p>
              <p>Their Mango Granola Cereals are great as toppings for ice cream and yogurt. </p>
              <p>Am a fan of their packets of dried cranberries, trail mixes, yogurt, jams, real vanilla pastes and oh....their beef patties.</p>
              <p>My sister has the following as staples in the fridge:</p>
              <p>frozen crab cakes, frozen breaded fish fillets,  milk, eggs, sparkling juice, plain juice, vegies, fruits &amp; meat.</p>
              <p>And I was just out of the shower and munching on a really good not so sweet two layer carrot cake with cream cheese.</p>
              <p>Their trays of balavas is also fantastic!</p>

              <p>Trader Joe sell the Frozen Wild Salmon. Their Salmon are only thaw once rather than twice compared to other grocery stores. As they are packed in Alaska and not China.</p>
              <p>These time of the year is Seafood season so Crab its better off to get it from Chinese grocery.</p>

              <p>I need to gripe a bit.</p>
              <p>That USPS supposedly 23kg boxes arrived at the house today.  Its so small for big items!  One winter padded jacket couldnt be squeezed in!</p>
              <p>And its too big for like a t-shirt and a travel coffee mug!</p>
              <p>In the end, I was repackaging some things into old cardboard boxes that came with some stuffs.  Then wrapping them in the brown papers that I found inside those boxes, orginally used as stuffings.</p>

              <p>I forgot to update.</p>
              <p>Am now in Houston Texas.  Was suppose to return to OC California on Monday, but the kids morning nanny didnt show up and the night nanny has to return home.</p>
              <p>And the mummy was sick, and the papa was needed at the office.</p>
              <p>In the end, they move my flight to next monday and I stayed to help with the kids and do the cooking.</p>
              <p>This morning, I made Porridge for the sick mummy, fried gluten free bread with bacon &amp; sunny side up eggs for the rest.</p>
              <p>Then I burnt my left finger on that heavy metal frying pan making the breakfast snack for the papa.  He requested for fried gluten free bread, topped with turkey bacon and mozerella cheese.</p>
              <p>I unfortunately, add on some fried sliced tomatoes and grated some cheese on top.{freshly grated hor} (I dont recognise which is the morzerella cheese.)</p>
              <p>Am now in my guest bedroom, typing on the laptop and a small ziplop bag of ice to try to numb the burnt finger pain...</p>
