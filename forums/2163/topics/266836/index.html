Have ask one of the colleague there to help me remove the side door panel and remove the damaged assembly. Yes u are right, there is one detachable connector that connects the  mirror to the car. Reason I remove the door panel is because I cant access to the connector and the connector was attached to the side door....Could be fact that its an american car that y I have to make this hassle. Is not easy to remove for the first time but once remove, its very easy. Have to becareful not to damaged the clips cos its make of plastics. Maybe it will be better if I remove and take a picture so story telling will be much more easier...hehe<br><br>Btw I have already ordered the mirror assembly and it cost me 60 bucks with the heater option......Learnt my lesson now...have to drive with my eyes open next time...haha<br><br>Finally thks skid, MG, and fatum for the help, first time accident, thats y I so kan cheong.
