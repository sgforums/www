            <div class='col-md body'>Please, please let your son be Australian.<br><br>The main and most important reason is NS. When he turns 18, he will thank you for doing this. The 2 years wasted doing NS is something he can't get back. Even if rich and famous still must do, whereas you have a chance to let your son not waste 2 years of his life.<br><br>Second reason is uni fees. This is much further down the track but as aussie citizen, he'll be entitled to greatly reduced uni fees in australia if he chooses to study there. International student = about A$24k per year whereas Australian citizen = about A$6k per year with option of gahmen low interest longterm loan. Over a 3 year degree thats saving about A$54k, not to be sneezed at lah.<br><br>Also important is to not let anyone pressure you and your wife one way or another. This decision will affect your son in the LONG TERM so please think carefully about what is in his best interest in the long term. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Aeris</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, we Singaporeans are pragmatic people.<br><br>My advice is based on the assumption that either you or your spouse already have PR and are on the path to gaining Australian citizenship.<br><br>TS, get Australian citizenship for your son. By birth, he is already a Singaporean national if you register his birth with the Embassy.This will lead to two choices eventually.<br><br>Should you have already registered his birth, when he turns 16.5, he will have to come back and register for NS and report back when he turns 18, which would be after high school. This is because you cannot legally surrender your citizenship unless you are above the age of 21, to the best of my knowledge.<br><br>If you have not registered his birth, it's simpler. He'll be an Australian citizen. I have heard of tales (not too certain though) where our statutory boards have managed to get hold of information that you have a child, and perhaps when you visit SG in the interim, they might be able to cross-link that data and subsequently list your son as a Singaporean citizen. This might complicate things, so it is best not to inform or do anything that might lead to the ICA or MINDEF to know that you have a son etc..<br><br>The issue here is whether you want your son to have a choice when he turns 18. Personally I would want my son to have that privilege that I didn't have.It's better to come to Singapore after 25, and gain PR here. What to do..we are pragmatic by nature aren't we.<br><br>Do take professional advice from lawyers as well, because this is just my own view.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>autumncs has a very valid point.  I am a S'porean in US for 17 years.  Daughter is 2 yr old.  You really hv to ask yourself what you want to do in future (do you really really want to stay in Aussie for good?)<br><br>I don't get to go home to Spore very frequently but I still struggle to give my baby a Spore citizenship when she turned 8 months, and that's becos I want to go back home eventually and want my daughter to grow up a sporean like I do.<br><br>My wife is indonesian and becos I don't stay in spore for more than 1 month every time I went home, she never had a chance to even get her Spore PR.<br><br>My suggestion:  (assuming you wanna stay in OZ for jobs after study) bite the bullet and go thru some more years with hardship so you may bond w ur child.  Borrow money from mother/father/relative so when all these hardship is over, start paying back.  Apply for you son a spore citizenship (if OZ allow) until he's 18/21 and let him decide later.  Ask yourself the most important question:  what are the most important thing in ur life?  Money?  Child?  Job?  Good education for child? etc and list them in order and make the most imprtant decisions in hyour life with little or no regrets.</div>
