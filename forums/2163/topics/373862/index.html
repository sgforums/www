              <p>just a bit of background... i have been living overseas for the last 17 years......</p>
              <p>if i include all the cities where i have lived for at least 6 months or more.... than i think i have lived in 9 cities so far during my time abroad</p>
              <p>perhaps feeling a bit tired from a nomadic lifestyle... recently i have been wondering if i should go back to SG for good... not that i have any job offers nor am i actively looking for jobs in SG, but just a thought that i should call an end to my time abroad....</p>
              <p>all this while i have kept in touch with SG, and of course i know that SG has changed a lot since the time i left</p>
              <p>just wondering if anyone have any opinions or similar experience? would you go back if you have been away for a long time?</p>

              <p>Important questions you should be asking yourself.</p>
              <p>1) Do you have any $$$$ readily available to root yourself into Singapore again.</p>
              <p>2) Do you have any family, a bedroom readily available to house you when you return to Singapore.</p>
              <p>3) Is there any CPF you can use to minimise your cash expenditure should you return to Singapore for the roof over your head issue.</p>
              <p>3a) Or if you are sick.</p>
              <p>3b) Or if you wish to utilise the the CPF to take on some courses to make you more relevant to local job market?</p>
              <p>4) National service?</p>
              <p>5) Bringing your dependants over</p>
              <p>6) What exactly is your plans, that may be relevant to 3b.</p>
              <p>7) With current job market issues and relevance of your current skills.  How long you can survive not in a job yet having expenses?</p>

              <p>But how much can your friends and relatives entertain you?  They have their lives to lead too.</p>
              <p>And how sure are you that people will not want to fleece you for what you have, thinking you have been living overseas, and thus very rich?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">many thanks, viciouskitty74! those are good practical questions that i believe i need to ask myself seriously….. in general, i think <span> </span>cash flow should not be a problem as i have been fortunate to earn and save enough all these years… so i believe i can take my time to find a place to stay</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">and as for looking for a job, i guess before i return, i should try to check for possible opportunities first……</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">bring dependents over? i really don’t know… guess i do need to check with those immigration guys</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">but you are right about CPF … which i have virtually zero since i hardly ever work in SG….. i will need time to build up retirement savings and also make sure i don’t deplete my existing foreign savings</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">hmm.. why should my friends and relatives fleece me, if they are my true friends and relatives? and its not like i need them to entertain me…. if its entertainment, then i dare say there is much better entertainment overseas and i don’t think that is the real reason to return to SG</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">so this got me thinking more, and i think the reason for thinking about going back is not about $ or entertainment, or even because of friends and relatives in SG…. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">automator, i think i know what you mean...i remember when i first lived abroad, i thought the feeling was liberating…. somehow the people seem more open, more interesting….. somehow the experiences seem so enjoyable, and the way of life seem so refreshing… even though not everything is great overseas, even though there are some aspects of life which are not as convenient as in SG, and even though there are challenging and difficult times overseas as well…. but i think somehow when you are abroad, you feel more compelled to try to make things works, you feel more motivated to try your best since you are the foreigner minority, and you feel more willing to adapt and to make do sometimes…. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">perhaps the real reason for thinking about going back SG is simply because of origin… like what seyKai seem to day..... yes, i suppose i could technically live and retire and die abroad…. but somehow there is always that feeling that i might return to the place of origin someday…. angel3070 says that SG is now like a foreign country and there are <span> </span>many foreigners, but i believe those foreigners in SG are also thinking like me…. they may not entirely want to stay forever, and will think about going back to their countries one day… so i guess that is the same reason why i am thinking about going back SG…. <span> </span>i wonder if other SG people overseas have this same thoughts?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>

              <p>Tell you the real situation now in singapore:</p>
              <p>the government brings in foreigners who ask for very low salary to come and compete with singaporeans. So if you come back now to singapore to work, you will be working long hours with low salary and you have to compete against these cheap foreign labour.</p>
              <p>You might not even be able to get a job because these foreigners are so cheap to employ and companies all chose to employ them instead.</p>
              <p>Of course, you can ask for a low salary but your salary will not be enough for you to spend.</p>
              <p>Costs are rising in singapore but salary is being cut.</p>

              <p>Seriously, if I managed to get a foot hold in another better foreign country, I would definitely not consider moving back to Singapore. If I really do miss Singapore (because I spent my childhood years here), I would come back to visit as a tourist, definitely NOT coming back as a citizen again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

No places to go on weekends. Nevertheless, its a safe country I think if compared to other countries. Mayb u should treat it as a holiday destination instead of a place u can call home cos I dun have the homely feel anymore. Its overcrowded with PRCs and filipinos.</p></div>

              <p>I agree that SG is not the same place as it was 17 years ago. It sucks that the govt is letting so many foreigners in to replace SG workers. I would say maybe fo work in China or HK or Taiwan and become an expat, you'll probably get special treatment.</p>
