              <p>Really?  Any specific cases you care to name?  It may be Wharton, but in postgrad we had quite a few students come over from American universities who washed out, and besides, business schools these days seem to be untelevised versions of The Apprentice, with a marking system that can be described as subjective at best.</p>
              <p>Now sure, I've seen rare instances of students from med school or other disciplines where marks aren't awarded on a "depending on your perspective" basis, who do party and still get the marks, but they're very few and very far between.  All things being equal, the party animals scrape by with the bare minimum.</p>

              <p>Well, UPenn has always been known as the ivy that does a lot of partying. However, I must say there are 2 kinds of party animals. One will be those who came into the school as a legacy. These kind usually barely pass, daddy and mummy will then send a lawyer to school. The second type are just damn bloody smart people who pick things up easily, but they mug like crazy too. </p>

              <p>Really?  OK, what do you understand of American culture?  Given your trembling grasp of things so far, your view of America promises to be a hoot.</p>
              <p>If you ventured out of SoCal and went around the states, how many states would you be able to find friends with whom you could stay?  Without thinking too hard about it, I've got Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia and DC.  Do you think this would have been possible if I had pissed off my contacts in these states?</p>
              <p>The fact that you're perceiving this as my "thrashing people" shows in itself that despite all of your *ahem* "social networking", you have no clue and you don't understand how Americans can deal with, if not appreciate, cutting the bullshit and geeting to the bottom line.  Or have you just been doing the typical Asian student bullshit thing and hanging around with other students from your home town?</p>
