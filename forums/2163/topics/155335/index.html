            <div class='col-md body'>MONEY<br><br>The Brits have peculiar words for many things. Money is referred to as<br>"goolies" in slang, so you should for instance say "I'd love to come to the<br>pub but I haven't got any goolies." "Quid" is the modern word for what was<br>once called a "shilling" the equivalent of seventeen cents American.<br><br>MAKING FRIENDS<br><br>If you are fond of someone, you should tell him he is a great "tosser" - he<br>will be touched. The English are a notoriously tactile, demonstrative<br>people, and if you want to fit in you should hold hands with your<br>acquaintances and tossers when you walk down the street.<br><br>CUSTOMS<br><br>Since their Labour government whole-heartedly embraced full union with<br>Europe the Brits have been attempting to adopt certain continental customs,<br>such as the large midday meal followed by a two or three hour siesta, which<br>they call a "wnak." As this is still a fairly new practice in Britain it is<br>not uncommon for people to over sleep (alarm clocks, alas, do not work there<br>due to the magnetic pull from Greenwich). If you are late for supper, simply<br>apologise and explain that you were having a wnak - everyone will understand<br>and forgive you.<br><br>RELAXING<br><br>One of the most delightful ways to spend an afternoon in Oxford or Cambridge<br>is gliding gently down the river in one of their flat-bottomed boats, which<br>you propel using a long pole. This is known as "cottaging." Many of the<br>boats (called "yer-i-nals") are privately owned by the colleges, but there<br>are some places that rent them to the public by the hour. Just tell a<br>professor or policeman that you are interested in doing some cottaging and<br>would like to know where the public yerinals are. The poles must be treated<br>with vegetable oil to protect them from the water, so it's a good idea to<br>buy a can of Mazola and have it on you when you ask directions to the<br>yerinals. That way people will know you are an experienced cottager.<br><br>FOOD AND WINE<br><br>British cuisine enjoys a well-deserved reputation as the most sublime<br>gastronomic pleasure available to man. Thanks to today's robust dollar,the<br>American traveller can easily afford to dine out several times a week (rest<br>assured that a British meal is worth interrupting your afternoon * for).<br>Few foreigners are aware that there are several grades of meat in the UK.<br>The best cuts of meat, like the best bottles of gin, bear Her Majesty's<br>seal, called the British Seal of Excellence (BSE). When you go to a fine<br>restaurant, tell your waiter you want BSE beef and won't settle for anything<br>less. If he balks at your request, custom dictates that you jerk your head<br>imperiously back and forth while rolling your eyes to show him who is boss.<br>Once the waiter realises you are a person of discriminating taste, he may<br>offer to let you peruse the restaurant's list of exquisite British wines. If<br>he does not, you should order one anyway. The best wine grapes grow on the<br>steep, chalky hillsides of Yorkshire and East Anglia try an Ely '84 or Ripon<br>'88 for a rare treat indeed. When the bill for your meal comes it will show<br>a suggested amount. Pay whatever you think is fair, unless you plan to dine<br>there again, in which case you should simply walk out; the restaurant host<br>will understand that he should run a tab for you.<br><br>TRANSPORTATION<br><br>London costs two pounds, no matter how far you travel. If a taxi driver<br>tries to over charge you, you should yell "I think not, you charlatan!" then<br>grab the nearest policeman (bobby) and have the driver disciplined. It is<br>rarely necessary to take a taxi, though, since bus drivers are required to<br>make detours at patrons' requests. Just board any bus, pay your fare of<br>thruppence (the heavy gold-coloured coins are "pence"), and state your<br>destination clearly to the driver, e.g.: "Please take me to British<br>Library." A driver will frequently try to have a bit of harmless fun by<br>pretending he doesn't go to your requested destination. Ignore him, as he is<br>only teasing the American tourist (little does he know you're not so<br>ignorant!). For those travelling on a shoestringbudget, the London Tube may<br>be the most economical way to get about, especially if you are a woman.<br>Chivalry is alive and well in Britain, and ladies still travel for free on<br>the Tube. Simply take some tokens from the baskets at the base of the<br>escalators or on the platforms; you will find one near any of the<br>state-sponsored Tube musicians. Once on the platform, though, beware!<br>Approaching trains sometimes disturb the large Gappe bats that roost in the<br>tunnels. The Gappes were smuggled into London in the early 19th century by<br>French saboteurs and have proved impossible to exterminate. The announcement<br>"Mind the Gappe!" is a signal that you should grab your hair and look<br>towards the ceiling. Very few people have ever been killed by Gappes,<br>though, and they are considered only a minor drawback to an otherwise<br>excellent means of transportation.<br><br>AIRPORTS<br><br>One final note: for preferential treatment when you arrive at Heathrow<br>airport, announce that you are a member of Shin Fane (an International<br>Jewish peace organisation - the shin" stands for "shalom"). As savvy<br>travellers know, this little white lie will assure you priority treatment as<br>you make your way through customs.<br><br>Safe travels and Bon Voyage!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
