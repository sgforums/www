(this chap speaks and writes superb, albeit American accented English btw... )<br><br>and ... their mandarin was almost non-existent ! ... so, he was asking, what do we speak in Singapore then ? ...<br><br>me: "Errrrrrrmmm ..... let me tell you about this thing called Singlish .... "<br><br>but it sounded lame to me even so ....<br><br>that got me thinking .... do you think the English level of some Singaporeans is below par ?

            <div class='col-md body'>well i say we are only bi sub-lingual,most of us know only enough of both language to be able to have basic usage of them.Most of us (if chinese)also tend to be better in english than chinese especially in spoken and written form.<br><br>I notice that almost all chinese i met in life cannot speak entirely in mandarin if required (not for planned speeches),with most needing to sub in english words for phases they do not know what it actually is in mandarin.You will not see this in china or taiwan.Also the chinese writting ability of the chinese in singapore almost go down the drain once we leave school since there is almost on chance to practice writting those words that are individual symbol themselves and there are over 5000+ of such symbol to be remembered,far too much to remember for the average guy if we do not practice writting it.Sadly to say i fall under this catergory too,i can speak inperfect mandarin and is almost left with no written chinese letter ability from years of neglect in writting them<br><br>As for english,most of us who are in the mid twenties up have being taught a incorrect form of speaking in our younger days,we are not taught the correct form of phonetic pronunciation so most of the "english" that we speak(if we did not went for proper courses in phonetic to correct it) is incomprehensible to those who speak english natively.Well i am still not sure if the proper spoken form is now taught but there maybe a suspect in the written form,seeing how people are so used to sms language form,i can't stand this kinda sms language myself least say people who uses english as their sole language.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from st forum.<br><br>Many Singaporeans aren't good enough in one language, let alone be bilingual. Rethink teaching methods in schools<br><br>The letter 'Humour in Speak Mandarin campaign helps to drive home message' by Miss Pearl Lam Hui Chern (ST Online Forum, Feb 3) leads me to wonder if Singaporeans, particularly the government, would benefit from rethinking the issue of language teaching and learning in our schools.<br><br>It is a fact that campaigns are successful only to the extent that they may help to raise awareness, but only skin-deep awareness, on any issue. Beyond this, very little in concrete terms is achieved.<br><br>It is humorous to think that making things 'funny' would help in any substantive way to make learning Mandarin easier. Would listening to more jokes make one a better joker?<br><br>Instead, we - Singaporeans and the government - should ponder whether or not at issue is a more fundamental problem - that the average Singaporean is basically quite poor at mastering a language, any language.<br><br>Is it the education system or is it in our genes? Some of these issues should preoccupy the minds of our researchers.<br><br>Just look at the extent to which Singlish is used in everday life instead of proper English. Remember the Speak Proper English Campaign headed by an Oxford scholar not too long ago?<br><br>It says to me that a significant proportion of Singaporean adults and students is simply not equipped to communicate properly, be it in English or Mandarin.<br><br>The truth is, far too many Singaporeans are not even effectively mono-lingual. So wouldn't it be asking a bit too much to expect them to be good, or even just adequate, in yet another language when they are already having a hard time learning one?<br><br>Lum Yew Wai<br></div>
