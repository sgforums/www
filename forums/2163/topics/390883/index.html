              <p>I had been to Lijiang in China. It is a place where most of the minorities stay. The place is very beautiful and slow pace. Very suitable for retirement. The minorities are able to speak mandarin, thus no problems in communications.</p>
              <p>Lijiang is near Shangri-La. Shangri-La is so beautiful that many westeners settled down there by marrying the locals. I also visited the town where the westeners stay. I am still too young to retire but hope to retire in places like Shangri-La when the times come.</p>

              <p>I am living in Japan. If you are one of those who get a hard on from watching japanese porn or spent a few days in Tokyo and are amazed of how well-dressed the jap gals are, you're in for a rude shock.</p>
              <p>First off, Japanese hate Chinese. They like Koreans more but still a large portion dislike Koreans. This is because of the korean dramas shown on japanese TVs have won some japs over. But if you're Chinese, forget about it. There are many mainland chinese, thai and phillipinos working in the sleazy side of japan. They earn a living from massaging and milking japanese cocks. That's daily life for them.</p>
              <p>Japan's winter can be brutal especially in February. But at least, japanese girls are much nicer and definitely better looking than our local girls. Our local girls are too defensive and caustic. Jap gals are the opposite. They always try to please their men. LOL!</p>
              <p>Porn is everywhere in Japan. You can go into any kombini and grab one of dozens of porn mags. Japan is good if you don't like the racial and religious bullshit that goes on in Singapore. Japanese minds are not sexually nor religiously repressed. You should come over.</p>
              <p>Cost of living is high and many japs are struggling but they don't show it. Japs are also rough people. If you think they are polite, again, you're the typical idiot that I know. They are polite in work but they are not nice people. Also, most KOreans are racists. I like living in japan because it is a good place for single men who dont like to get married and it is also very clean but very expensive. I also like japan as it is not a religious society like singapore.</p>
