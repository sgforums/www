              <p>How are you guys going to celebrate the big day? Have you bought your pressies for loved ones yet? </p>
              <p>Although I've bought the bulk of it, I'm lying in wait for retailers to slash prices even more, to make up for all those years of being gouged. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>We are lucky enough to be able to shop the military exchange. We pay no sales tax there which is so nice and prices are generally lower than off-base. They are continually getting better about giving us a better selection of goods and services. We have 5 bases nearby, all within a 30 min drive. The farthest one, about a 50 min drive, would be Camp Pendleton which we have yet to visit. </p>

              <p>i shopped online quite abit for pressies....'cos online prices seem much better...and everything is done at the click of the mouse...how convenient is that!</p>
              <p>i've already mailed numerous packages home to our families...but postage is f***ing expensive. so...for my gal friends back home that i'm buying pressies for....i've gotten mostly girly fashion accessories i.e. earrings, bracelets 'cos those are small/light...so not too expensive to mail =)</p>
              <p>i might custom print some posters (with some photos that i had taken at their workplace) &amp; put them in frames for my hubby's colleagues as x'mas pressies...and prob also bake some stuffs i.e. cookies/cakes to give away</p>
              <p>for my neighbour who's a huge bird lover...think i'd DIY some bird seed wreaths that she can hang outside her house...sew a little stuffed toy for her pet parrot...and get her a giftcard from her favorite store.</p>
              <p>was thinking of buying a fake x'mas tree but it'd be too leychey to lug it around with us if we have to move next year. so i'm going to DIY my own x'mas tree and decos too =)</p>

              <p>holy crap!!!!  u gals are putting me to shame.  :oops:  well, we stopped gift exchange here.  okay okay....cheap cheap cheap.  so, i've only got 2 immediate family members.  one asked for cash 'cos he is not about to get stuff just for the sake of the festive.  he only wanna buy things which he really wants....and that may be available any time of the year.  practical 20 year old eh?</p>

              <p>When I say I've already bought the bulk of pressies, I forgot to add that all pressies for relatives up north were bought and delivered this past August when we drove up for a visit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> They know not to expect any parcels from us this Christmas. </p>
              <p>So all we had to buy for were the kids. I gave one out early, thanks to Sears. There was a lawsuit and I got my cut two weeks ago and donated it right back since it was a Sears gift card. </p>
              <p>Our Christmas tradition is to buy each other ornaments. One has to shop early for the best selection but Hallmark always puts out new designs so I always have to stop back in and check. </p>
              <p>Streamie, put you to shame? How about this? I have yet to put up my tree and that has never happened before. I keep saying I'll do it tomorrow but...</p>

                      is it specific to a particular paper?</p>
              <p>i only have the 50% on 1 item coupons from michael's..they
                      usually give those out when you buy stuffs. so i save the coupon

              <p>Michael's always has an insert in the Sunday papers. Usually just one 40% off coupon that lasts a week. Sometimes there are more. You can also use Joann coupons at Michaels if they carry the same items. Check with your local store. Here's a tip as well. You can tell the store (Michael's) that you forgot your coupon. They pull out a book and jot your name and digits down and voila!</p>
              <p>But but but, I know that if you buy the Sunday papers off the stand/store, you won't find certain flyers like Michael's and Joann's.</p>
              <p>Went to the mall today (Dec 14). I was so surprised at the lack of a crowd. Suprised but happy because it made my task that much easier. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> I love Brookstone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
