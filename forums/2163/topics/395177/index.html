              <p>He is one of the worse or maybe the worse singaporean u will ever come across.</p>
              <p>why?</p>
              <p>he tends to :</p>
              <p>1)eat up his own fellow sngaporeans and australians most of the time</p>
              <p>2)sound badly like he demands to be respected which he would get none from australia nor from singapore as he doesnt earn it!</p>
              <p>3)DOWNRIGHT ARROGANT even though he doesnt own any company registered in his name and werks for KFC</p>
              <p>4)has a mindset worse than a butcher in a blood flooded kill floor at an abbatoir (ive worked there as a tech personnel and they are much kinder and polite despite killing 1000 cows daily)</p>
              <p>Please keep away from Gedakan.....he is awfully butt ugly!</p>

              <p>that explains why he hates everyone mostly including himself.</p>
              <p>man,,that company who got him in mu8st be heck of a stupid!!</p>
              <p>think i will try melbourne on my next to do list as they already got nutcases like him in a job there.he should be technically be murdered by now.</p>
              <p>i dont like stupid people too...especially if they are stuck in singapore earnin worse than cleaners salary but unlike him.....i do have compassion.</p>
              <p>he has much to learn from his STUPIDITY.and having it in australia will only shorten his life.</p>
              <p>almost everyone here in sgforum is stupid.:)lol</p>

              <p>Case of melbourne specimen case study 3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as i have observed he seems to be insulting unlucky folks all the time just to vent out pent up anger.</p>
              <p>he must hate himself for what they are doing to him.</p>
              <p>i have never seen in any multi billion dollar or million dollar factory where they have any management yelling at anyone.this brings to the conclusion that he was most likely abused at work mentally from his higher management.</p>
              <p>i have also observed that he knows almost nothing in the world of engineering from way he tries to piece together engineering to all forms of loosely coined engineering terms.this would bring me where he would be on sales or management.but then he could be in IT.chances are that he could be in the sales side in hardware tech side where brutes frequent.</p>
              <p>his work as it is obvious abuses him as the way he exhibits his lack of humanity as exhibited in forum.perhaps he has lost his humanity after working in oz .his estimated time of exposure to abuse is estimated to be between 5 ~7 years.</p>
              <p>Family coerhesion seems to be non-existent and it looks as if he was orphaned from birth or given away.there are orphans who behave in more refined ways.it is such that he was never given any care or knows none of it.he might even be confused from way it goes if exposed to his parents.</p>
              <p>work was not given to any length of description in oz as it appears he might distance himself far away from it like a disease.</p>
              <p>experience he has in spore industries might be limited and the experience he gained would be very much likened to unstable.</p>
              <p>his character and outlook in life might be one of those who fear death itself and would sacrifice his siblings and parents in order that he survive.why is he so afraid of death that he has a small gun in his old av picture.</p>
              <p>is ged a product of melbourne or a product of his manifestations?</p>
              <p>it could be a result of both from case 1 and case 2 in melbourne.</p>
              <p>is it a good idea to enter melbourne knowing they abused ged,,,and with ged not being strong succumbs to his inner demons.....</p>
              <p>as in precious cases , both singaporeans had tough time in melbourne and one eventually died while the other tried all means to secure a job in melbourne.their skill levels though were not estabilished in singapore were also not suitable for the jobs in melbourne for unknown purposes.</p>
              <p>is melbourne a place where its supposed to be as advertised by job agents or is it some elaborate ploy?if it werent so...how does it explain the uneventful case of 2 and 3?why did they find it hard to get jobs and when they did get jobs case 3 was turned almost insane as a result of work factors.i am pretty sure melbourne might not be the right place.</p>
