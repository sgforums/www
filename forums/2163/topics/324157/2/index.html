              <p>I am also planning to be relocating to Sydney in end'09 too. Now trying to do homework on housing, jobs..etc.</p>
              <p>Well Mid, my advice is not to start any big movement of bulky personal items yet. Settle down before you make the decision on shipping your TV, sofa etc. Its a bit of a culture shock initially for S'porean to relocate. Some just can't get over the differences is lifestyle and culture shock...(well just watch out for the drunks)</p>
              <p>I suggest you get a course in TAFE before trying out for Plumber or Electrician. Its not the same content as those offered in ITE here.(being a plumber also cross my mind too...haha..i hear they pay a ton for plumber service there..\o/ )</p>
              <p>Anyway, have fun..ps..admin &amp; clerks are paid about 60K annual (b4 tax),accountants 120k .. i am sure we will find a job..finally a 9 to 5 job :DDDD</p>
              <p>be positive!</p>

              <p>I've tried renting out my home while I was in USA/Thailand 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>But this time, I am selling because I needed a strong back up of cash to ensure that I will be welcomed &amp; comfortable anywhere.</p>
              <p>Sg not like US or Oz where the rental is taken care of by the Agencies.  There will always be issues which will require your personal attendance in sg to clear.  Have your parents involved with the rental of you flat and I wish you good luck.</p>

              <p>i leave in 4 months. i guess what you bring over depends on whether you are alone or you have a family in tow. if you are alone, it is better to travel `light', i guess.</p>
              <p>for me, my family is going, so i will get a 20 footer to pack my things in. i reckon if i sell my stuff here, i.e. bicycles, books, microwave, lcd tv, shelves, tables, etc., it will fetch pittance and i have to fork out considerable monies to get the furnitures and essentials up again. i am also pretty attched to my belongings, so I prefer not to dispose them unless unncessary. i am leaving the fridge and washing machine behind though. i was told the config for fridge space down under is different so, it's better to buy there. also, for washer, u need one with a dryer too for winter.  </p>
              <p>as for my current place here, i will weigh the option of renting or selling. if i sell, most probably the bulk will go back to CPF. if i rent, i can use some of that to defray my costs when there. i also plan to continue the education endowment i am paying for my kids here.</p>
              <p>getting a job is still the biggest concern. m trying to get a transfer there but i am planning for the worst case scenario. having said that, based on my initial calculations on living cost for my family, i can probably last about 4-5 years there without much worries about monies. after that, if i am still jobless, then i think i got problem  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>regardless, i think my life will definitely be better, judging from the frens i have been in contact with.</p>

              <p>looks like you have plan it out pretty well. Good Luck.</p>
              <p>Btw if you are planning not coming back to SG ever. go to CPF board and withdraw all your CFP. (condition is that you cannot work in SG anymore unless you top up your CPF again) - i checked..you can do that..no point letting all those money sit there..</p>

              <p>my warp thinking is to let the cpf money sits there first. when i am older and need it, and indeed i am not coming back to singapore for good, then i will withdraw.</p>
              <p>singapore gahmen has a long memory, i don't want to give them a reason to corner me unnecessary. so far, i live without really giving a hoot of my cpf money, so i think i can still remain so for the time being.</p>

I wouldn't give a hoot about what the gahmen thinks (i am just a small fly for them to care, based on 1000 ppl leaving a yr, i am just a 0.1% fly hehe) .if my CPF saving can give me a nice return in OZ that can sustain my stay there so much the better..Also if worst comes, i just top back the money in CPF.

              <p>now, can you withdraw just like that? i don't think so. i believe you need to renounce your citizenship b4 you can take the monies out of the cpf.</p>
              <p>and to take up aussie, i think you need 3 yrs, rite?</p>

              <p>Ya its true. you need to give up citizenship or PR. if you have either. But it only takes 3 weeks to process and get your money.</p>

              <p>Sorry about my harshness.</p>
              <p>As a sister, I have more then my fair share of my baby brother punking out on these overseas issues.</p>
              <p>Here's one example of a conversation that totally got to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me: Why dont we try, maybe give about $100 a month into mom's account from now on.</p>
              <p>Ss: I am a housewife, where to get $$$?  besides baby brother is responsible for her since she sold her flat to finance his overseas studies.</p>
              <p>Bro: I am a student now.  Where got $$$, when I return after getting the degree, whcih none of you sisters can ver get.  I can 'guang zhong yeow zhu'  brings honour to the family and let mom live inluxury in condos.</p>
              <p>..........</p>
              <p>todate.  that 'guan zhong yeow zhu' fella since 2004 still has mother living in a rented hdb room in punggol.</p>

              <p>"well every house has a difficult sutra"</p>
              <p>In my case, they are more worry about practical reasons and $$$ is not an issue.</p>
              <p>My sis is afraid that she cannot cope if she's alone taking care of mom who is suffering from some depression and from her angle, i am selfish son/bro who abandon the aging mom and expect the sister to take care of dear mother.</p>
              <p>I cannot fault her for such reasoning which I might feel the same if the table is turned</p>
              <p>Other things I dont worry much, but this one weighs heavily on me.</p>

              <p>Things was really bad when I was left alone with my mother.</p>
              <p>There was some talk that her misbahaving is probably due to menopause and I tolerated as much as I could.</p>
              <p>It was so bad, that when my sister request for my mothers aid in USA, thus taking my mother off my hands for 3 months at a stretch, it was a godsend.</p>
              <p>Maybe you might consider sharing your mother between Oz and sg and discussing with your sis on it?  It helps to assure your sister that you both work out a timetable after you settled in Oz.</p>
              <p>Your mom may benefit from a change in enviornment as well as some hope that she &amp; your sis is losing you forever.</p>

              <p><br>I still say your sister has a reason to be insecure.</p>
              <p>Your mother, like all mothers used to living in Singapore, will never agree to move over with you.</p>
              <p>But 3 months out of a year, she will not mind going there for a 'holiday'.</p>
              <p>When you have kids, then you can most likely have her stay about 6 months to a year there.</p>
              <p>Give your sis some time.  She will drop by for holidays eventually. Especially if you are buying the air ticks.</p>
              <p>Heck, I steadfastly refused to go overseas about 8 years back.  But now i am uprooting myself, so never say never.</p>
