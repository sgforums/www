              <p>I am also planning to be relocating to Sydney in end'09 too. Now trying to do homework on housing, jobs..etc.</p>
              <p>Well Mid, my advice is not to start any big movement of bulky personal items yet. Settle down before you make the decision on shipping your TV, sofa etc. Its a bit of a culture shock initially for S'porean to relocate. Some just can't get over the differences is lifestyle and culture shock...(well just watch out for the drunks)</p>
              <p>I suggest you get a course in TAFE before trying out for Plumber or Electrician. Its not the same content as those offered in ITE here.(being a plumber also cross my mind too...haha..i hear they pay a ton for plumber service there..\o/ )</p>
              <p>Anyway, have fun..ps..admin &amp; clerks are paid about 60K annual (b4 tax),accountants 120k .. i am sure we will find a job..finally a 9 to 5 job :DDDD</p>
              <p>be positive!</p>

              <p>Admin &amp; clerks get 60k per year?? That's like wishful thinking. A graduate doing administrative duties will maybe get that annual income in a few years, but def not non-grad admin staff and clerks. 120k for accountants also apply only to those established professionals with years of experiences. Just don't want your hopes raised too high. It's one thing to think positive, another to be self-deceiving.</p>

              <p><br>yup..indeed. but thing is...given that the sg banks are under super high scrutiny and that everything is highly controlled &amp; regulated by MAS..such that the banks are highly conservative in their investments/loans...the risks of bank failures should be lower in singapore...than in other countries. even if anything were to happen to sg banks...the govt is likely to step in to ensure that there won't be mass panic &amp; hardship.</p>

              <p><br>im not sure about the state of rental market now but when i was looking for rentals last year, the viewing time is usually at 11-12noon on sat only! and we have about 5-10 couples moving like conveyor belts thru the rental property. although the rent could be $350per week, some might want to up the ante to secure the rental. plus a background check and some misc stuffs.</p>
              <p>i didnt succeed in getting the 1st unit that i chose, in fact, i have to view at least 20+ units and submit more than 8 applications before i managed to secure one.</p>
              <p>so it is ideal that u have a car and a GPS to travel around, this is not like SG; come out from bus stop and walk to the rental. No! the whole place is damn huge and wide! it will be best to have someone there to show you around initially.</p>
