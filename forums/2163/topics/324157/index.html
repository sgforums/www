              <p>Babe, forget about personal belongings, household items &amp; barang barang.</p>
              <p>Just bring along your BC, passport, educational certs, licences &amp; whatever letters that certifies you to live in Oz.</p>
              <p>Personal belongings wise, your favourite pyjamas, undies, jeans, shoes (if you have small feet), a laptop with wireless function that has a different power cable for use in Ozzie &amp; a nokia mobile phone. junk the power cables cos Oz is different socket and voltage.</p>
              <p>garage sale the rest and convert your CDs into MP3. donate the books to the national library but keep those limited edition ones.</p>
              <p>If the family is going with you, bring along your mother's favourite wok, bamboosteamer, a noodle sieve (that one is so hard to find...those that can stand at the side of the pot kind) &amp; a food counter net (its opens like an umbrella to keep flies off the food.)</p>

              <p>lol ok thanks kitty...I got the idea...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most likely I will swap my new appliances and furnitures with my mom's since I am planning to rent out my flat anyway.</p>
              <p>Talking abt flats, I think its better for you to rent your flat out instead of selling until you are truly settled in your new home and will not come back.</p>

              <p>wah, excitement excitement~~~~</p>
              <p>congratz on your impending move.  you must be excited and perhaps some mixed feelings too?  anyways, you never know till you try and since the opportunity has presented itself, go for it and with an open mind.  that way, the odd times when you feel "what the heck am i doing here?" may not feel so bad.</p>
              <p>sorry, can't offer you much as i am up at the opposite end of the pole.  north pole?  kekekeke</p>
              <p>but my experiences?  i don't ship big items.  besides, the furnitures in sg is not suitable in canada 'cos of our weather and harsh winter.  the wood cracks.  you start with your basic necessity and as you live there and get the hang of things, you slowly add on.</p>
              <p>as for courses, if your financial position allows you to, why don't you take up courses in sydney instead.  that way, you can show prospective employers that you have had some form of eduction in the country.  also, it can serve as an eye opener to an aussie experience.  the people, the lifestyle, some networking with college mates.....just a start.  anyways, just my thoughts.</p>
              <p>good luck with everything and come back here often to chat.  in the initial months, you may need some kinda support when things ain't going the way you thought it should.  anyways, again, just my 2-cents worth!</p>
              <p>all the very best! :)</p>

              <p>dude, somethings you jump, some things you don't ......</p>
              <p>you know, it's not too late to start job hunting now at least .... it's not unheard of to already have a job lined up before making the leap you know ...  ........</p>
              <p>settle your job and housing first, before you even cross over, that's what I think you should do .....</p>
              <p>also .... make sure you are aware of the flipside of migration first .... people who've migrated, especially relatives, would never tell you the bad stuff .... they'll only tell you the fairy tales ... so make sure you know the full picture first before making the leap .... don't get suckered in by a 2 weeks holiday or the quantas ads ....</p>

              <p>Thanks for all your comments and advice, keep them coming.</p>
              <p>I will be staying with my auntie for a while until I get my own place. So the only main concern will be getting a job.</p>
              <p>Have spoken to the immigration agencies as well as the Australian High Commission people and they commented that it is much better for me to look for a job when I am physically there. I think as long as I am willing to work from the bottom with the right attitude and realistic expectations, I should be able to land something, even if it is dish washer or fruit picker. Once I have my feet firmly on the ground then can I move on to something better.</p>
              <p>In addition, I am trying to work out all the possible flipsides and have a plan to deal with them accordingly. Come to the worst, I can always come back thats why I rather rent my flat out instead of selling it at this point in time.</p>

              <p>Hi Mid</p>
              <p>Maybe b4 you take an ITE course, check out TAFE in Oz for apprenticeship. Not sure how it exactly works, but this will give u the certification if you want to work as an electrician, plumber. I am assuming u have a PR, so easier for u to look for jobs as most employers will state 'Full working rights'.</p>

              <p>wah lau eh.........THAT's a lot of money leh!!!!  why don't you rent out your flat furnished?</p>
              <p>i tink it best for you to land in oz, check it out, settle a little bit liao, get the hang of how "things" work, then decide if u wanna ship your stuff?  there will be teething probs and you don't wanna be shouldered with moving your barang barangs around until you are kinda settled in?</p>
              <p>well, i packed up and leave sg and landed in canada without a job.  but with a combination of many factors, like my residency status, my education and *ahem* my sweet personality, i found a decent job within a month of landing.</p>
              <p>so, really, everyone's situation is going to be different.  u just got to try to know.  some make it, some don't.  some persevere, some quit.  some have happy/successful stories, some have bad experiences.  therefore, go with an open mind and then take it from there.</p>
              <p>we can plan all we want but certain things are beyond our control.  like someone like to say "the best plan in the world will not work if it is not God's plan".  i was giving myself about 2 years to experience Canada.  the initial road wasn't easy, not the finances but other stuff.  but I persevered and look, i've been here 2 decades.  i won't say life is better, it's just no comparison.  i'll just say it's different.  and it all depends on individual, what they perceive "living" to be.</p>
              <p>i applaud your courage to move out of your comfort box to experience something different.  whether you have good or bad experience, it will still be an experience.  and we will/do learn something out of it.</p>
              <p>good luck! :)</p>
