              <p>The hot springs are also very famous, best time to go would be
              in the morning, like 8:30am or 9am, it would only take you 1 hour's
              time at most. And I believe they provide beverage, towels and
              massage as a package. :)</p>

              <p>Are you referring to the pachinko machines? No, thanks. This vacation is already costing me an arm and a leg, and I sure don't want to flush additional money down the drain gambling at the pachinko parlours.</p>
              <p>I think we've included a couple of visits to hot springs in our itinerary.</p>

              <p>Believe it or not, I finished packing for the trip over the weekend. Since I'm only going to be bringing light summer clothing there and plan on hitting a laundromat about halfway through the trip, I managed to pack all my clothes into a 22" carry-on rollaway. My electronic gear (including my netbook PC) will be in a laptop backpack.</p>

              <p>We'll be hitting 6 cities during the 2 weeks that we'll be in Japan, and will consequently be spending a lot of time on the trains. We've printed out the train schedules from Hyperdia.net and have taken note of which <em>Shinkansens</em> to ride to get to our destinations in the shortest amount of time.</p>
              <p><em>Edited to add</em>: 4 more days! </p>

              <p>Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for those excellent suggestions, especially the one about which sushi stores to patronize at the Tsukiji Fish Market. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>We'll be hitting 6 cities during the 2 weeks that we'll be in Japan, and will consequently be spending a lot of time on the trains. We've printed out the train schedules from Hyperdia.net and have taken note of which <em>Shinkansens</em> to ride to get to our destinations in the shortest amount of time.</p>

              <p>further to add... las train from Shin Osaka bac to Tokyo[Hikari] is approx 2000 hrs...<br>Dun worry abt the train stations, its in English and user friendly... its the exits you need to worry coz there are too many!<br>In tokyo station, there is shopping at the platforms before you exit...<br>In Tokyo, take train alite at Harajuku to walk down to Omotesando[dun bother to the the subway line] walk in around the small lanes, nt the main road, you will find all sorts of unique shops<br>Yurakucho station has a new shopping complex and near there, there are name yakitori shops...<br>if you have time go to Odaiba Bay...<br>You need electronics, go to Yodabashi at either Osaka or Akihabara...<br>Underneath JR Osaka, there is a long underground shopping for you to venture...<br> </p>

              <p>Hey, long time no hear from you, dude. Hope all is well! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>Thanks for the suggestion on how to eat on the cheap in Japan. Our rather hectic schedule there would probably require us to do just what you've suggested, in the interest of expediency; we'll probably also be hitting the <em>konbinis</em> on more than a few occasions for quick and inexpensive meals on the go. However, this trip is as much about sampling Japanese cuisine as taking in the sights, so we've budgeted time and money for some slightly more elaborate meals.</p>
              <p>Roppongi isn't on our list of places to visit in Tokyo, as we're not really into the nightclub scene. We'll probably be spending quite a bit of time in Akihabara, and from what I gather, you <em>do</em> want to wander into the back alleys there as they are crowded with street vendors hawking all manner of electronic gear!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Somehow, I don't think I'll come across any gunstores in Japan...</p>

              <p>BTW, Ropponggi Hills and Midtown is a nice area to visit in Tokyo, and there's a building there that overlooks the Tokyo Tower.</p>
