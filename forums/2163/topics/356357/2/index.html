              <p>Expouding on Codexboy's definition, another definition would be development or improvement of the mind by education or training.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;">So my question to the threadsetter would be that, what is the rationale being this question? If it’s a question posed out of true curiosity, I would agree that Singaporeans are not very cultured. An overwhelming majority of the people I know would not think twice about blowing money on shopping or on mainstream entertainment as compared to just forking out a few bucks on museum entry in sg.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana;">However, if the question is meant as a jibe.. I feel that we should just save our time instead of judging people on how they choose to spend their money.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">But thinking of the reasons as to why sg-reans are ‘uncultured’, I feel that there are 3 reasons</span></p>
              <ol style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">We are VERY practical people (Why spend 10bucks on museum entry and there’s nothing tangible to show for it?) </span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Singaporeans have not had as much exposure to the fine arts since it has been an aspect that has only til recently, been neglected. </span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Some people may just NOT appreciate the arts like how I wouldn’t appreciate the Jurong Bird Park very much</span></li>

              <p>ok. for people who like museums, go for it. those who don't shouldn't. Who set the rules that people have to visit museums? spend the time you have doing things you like... you like shopping, go for it. you like concerts, go listen. you like museum, go visit. you like farms go and visit. visiting museums when you don't like it is just being childish.</p>

                                      Please do not embarass yourself, at least go look up the definition
                                      of cultured first..."</p>
              <p>My my, I must have touched a nerve in codexboy's subconsicous for you to want to inflict a personal insult. However, I see no need for me to stoop to that level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"a typical singaporean only comment negatively about a typical
                                      singaporean, this sux that sux...."</p>
              <p>Of course it takes a Singaporean to criticise Singaporean behaviour. It doesn't carry much weight for a person of another nationality to do so. Instead of taking an immediate defensive position to this thread, it might be more constructive to reflect on this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, opinions are just that, everybody has one. I'll be the first to admit that I am far from what I consider to be cultured, and in my past, I have been guilty of what I describe. The point is that I am aware of this now, and this has brought my attention to the disparity between the level of cultural development, on a broad sense, with people of other developed contries. When I travel to Japan, it is clearly evident that the level of cultural development in their general population far surpasses that of Singapore. Further examples of being cultured would be graciousness, civic mindedness, appreciation of the arts, to name a few. However, I do see small improvements in Singapore over the years, and this trend will only hopefully continue.</p>

              <p>Huhhh...it seems like most Singaporeans living in Singapore
              share a common trait.</p>
              <p>I've had conversations with friends and family who go on
              vacations to great places in Europe and here in the US, and most of
              them spend the majority of their time shopping. One friend told me
              he "visited" Rome on a vacation, but actually spent the whole time
              at an outlet mall 4 hours outside the city. Can you believe it?</p>
              <p>Ask any Singaporean about their vacations, in terms of museums
              they visited or sites they saw, and they will mostly tell you more
              about where you can find the best deals on shopping.</p>
              <p>It's a pretty embarassing fact when you tell this to people of
              other nationalities (especially non-Asians). Maybe we've just
              developed so quickly economically that our cultural development
              hasn't had time to catch up.</p>
              <p>I live about 45 minutes away from a pretty big outlet mall, and
              I joke to my wife that whenever we make our annual visit, we can
              hear the Singaporean before we see them because they're the ones
              going "cheap ah! cheap ah!".</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To be fair, when foreigners come over to Singapore - they do their fair bit of shopping as well.</p>
              <p>In addition, there's no harm in shopping overseas - who's to say that appreciating foreign fashions is any less cultural than visiting museums or piazzas. Frankly, having visited many European cities - honest to heart - I love classical cities, but sometimes I feel like the museums are just placed there just so tourists have something to do. Going shopping may actually allow you to mingle with the authentic local culture. You get a sense of what the locals eat, shop etc. That ain't so bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Plus, you assume that people on vacation should visit cities for their culture. But why should that be the case? You can visit cities for their culture, for their shopping, for whatever reason you want. Why should culture be a priori? Besides, this may not be their first trips to that city. For instance, when I next visit NYC, sure I will probably go to the Met again, but you can be certain I will cutting down a lot on the more touristy supposedly cultural stuff and heading to the outlet malls maybe, or just shopping down Fifth. Open your eyes to see and honestly its how you define culture - cos it's pretty much everywhere.</p>
              <p>Too quick to judge perhaps?</p>
