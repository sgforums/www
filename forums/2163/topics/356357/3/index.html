              <p>Sorry to wander off topic but I wanted to say that if anything can entice me to watch Teochew Opera would be if it was Phantom of the Opera - Teochew style! that would be something yeah?</p>
              <p>Anyway, with regard to the topic - methinks that a big part boils down to what conotates cultures isn't it? I don't think museums, art galleries, theatres etc are the defining aspect of a nation's culture. Personally, I think food is a culture as well. I mean, while our hawker centres may not be haute cuisine, they are quite a genuine aspect of Singaporean life.</p>
              <p>I mean I do hope one day Singaporeans will pick up some passion for the arts - so we might actually have a self sustaining Esplanade for once! - but I can totally see why if this passion fails to gather steam. it's not Singaporeans are uncultured - it's just that we exhibit our culture in other ways. Everyday culture to me, is a culture too! Heaven forbid we try to foster "an appreciation for the arts" by forcing it through the school syllabus!ARGH.</p>
              <p>You know what - if our culture is haute couture instead of la haute culture, I'm totally fine with it. :)</p>

              <p>i think generalization is useful most of the time. If you generalize "all pretty girls are bimbo", and you treat them like bimbo, you will be right 90% of the time. makes life easier to handle.</p>

              <p>Teochew opera is about 500 yrs old.  i think the language, its culture is dying. So not sure you could revived it with Phantom.</p>

              <p>Do you then have an issue with people who make going to visit museums and attractions the only thing? I mean the argument easily swings that way you see. i know friends who go on insane whirlwind tours of the European cities and its - Place. Photo. Group Photo. Another Photo. Next Place. Photo. Group Photo. Next Place. Photo.....you get the idea. What do they remember of the cities, I ask them? Nothing. We have 5 gb of photos, want to have a look? Visiting museums do not mean cultural interaction.</p>
              <p>For my part, I have a slacker (perhaps more SIngaporean way) of approach cities maybe - I sit in cafes a lot; I don't visit every attraction and I do a lot of aimless wander in bazaars and along the high streets. Time wasting? Maybe .Am I missing out on the culture? Perhaps. But I'm there to relax and soak in the place - if shopping is the way to do that - it's should nt be that big an issue.</p>

              <p>Coming back to the topic of Singaporeans being uncultured, it's
              not a valid question given the range of backgrounds in question -
              you're always going to get people who appreciate Cellini, Magritte
              and Frank Lloyd Wright, and those who don't, regardless of what
              country you look at.</p>

              <p>Those are some amazing photos, Gedanken (German?). Sehr wunderschön. And you are quite right - I can't fathom why Cellini's statues are so celebrated, but Magritte (assuming you are talking about Rene Magritte of course) is my favourite surrealist artist. :)</p>

              <p>Well, can can agree that if someone visits museums and other attractions instead of just hitting the outlet mall on a vacation overseas, that's surely more to take in of the culture, so the argument doesn't really swing both ways.</p>
              <p>Hey, sitting around in cafes is a great way to take in the sights and people watch. I usually go colloquial on a destination to get the best feel for the culture, especially the food.</p>
              <p>So, to keep this in perspective once again, my tirade's mainly aimed at the outlet mall lemmings.</p>

              <p>Thanks, Boomslang!  Yup, those shots were taken last July - there's more on Shoot On Sight (<a href="/forums/3078">click here</a>).</p>
              <p>I did some post-processing, pretty much just exposure compensation, white balance and sharpening.  The St Mark's photo was taken with a circular polariser, and that really brought out the colour of the sky.</p>

              <p>Cellini's good, but Rodin's always had more of an impact on me.  As for Magritte, is there any Magritte? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> Seeing the real thing in MOMA NY (as well as a stack of Lichtensteins, Miros, Klees and  Hoppers) was simply breathtaking.</p>
