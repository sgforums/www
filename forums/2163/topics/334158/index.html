              <p>Thats nice to read......about not wanting parents to buy cars for your own convenience in Perth.</p>
              <p>My dear....everywhere is dangerous. </p>
              <p>If you are not certain about the trains, move in groups of friends/classmates &amp; be home a sensible time.</p>
              <p>You can also get to know your room mates better and share a vehicle when you get the licence.</p>
              <p>Except for in Singapore, you shouldnt be rollablading, walking or cycling alone. </p>
              <p>If its just for transporting you one person, I would suggest a motorcycle &amp; licence but you dont have to follow my suggestion.</p>

              I'll be doing postgrad there and it seems that most classes are in the evenings. I'm picking further up North because of family and my bf and me love the newer towns. We dont want to be too near to downtown too. Would love to buy a car but with job uncertainty, it may not be a wise choice right now. Might consider one after bf gets a job there.
              
              I heard that classes are around 5 to 8pm. So I'm thinking I will be near Perth station at around 9pm? It's near Northbridge so I'm a little worried. But I guess I need to go an experience it to be sure about the safety.

              <p>You certainly do meet some 'characters' at perth city train station and in the trains after the evening rush hour, say after 8pm. But hey! They are everywhere. It's certainly not fair to say the caucasians target asians either, as it may go either way. Rule of thumb is to think and act smart to be safe and be aware of your surroundings.</p>

              <p>Its not just the white people there who get rowdy in OZ. I think some Asian groups have to take the blame too. I was in Northbridge and I remember a pub/club just beside a club called the CHURCH. That club has a big sign that says "No Asians allowed". When I first saw that, I was appalled. How could such discrimination exists until my OZ frens told me that that particular club always had problems with drunk Burmese and Vietnamese and starting fights. And after a while since they almost all look the same, they just ban all Asian looking people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think Australia is a beautiful place with beautiful people except when they become drunk haha (not all lah haha). They will call you names, they will think that all chinese or asian looking chicks are call girls. But generally, I realise if you are in well-litted places and you ignore them, you are pretty safe.</p>

              <p>Its not just the white people there who get rowdy in OZ. I think some Asian groups have to take the blame too. I was in Northbridge and I remember a pub/club just beside a club called the CHURCH. That club has a big sign that says "No Asians allowed". When I first saw that, I was appalled. How could such discrimination exists until my OZ frens told me that that particular club always had problems with drunk Burmese and Vietnamese and starting fights. And after a while since they almost all look the same, they just ban all Asian looking people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I think Australia is a beautiful place with beautiful people except when they become drunk haha (not all lah haha). They will call you names, they will think that all chinese or asian looking chicks are call girls. But generally, I realise if you are in well-litted places and you ignore them, you are pretty safe.</p>

              <p><br>Perfect! Thank you for the advice. Haha it seems drinking is in the white people's culture. :p Well we'll get a car when things are a little more stable, hopefully within a month. Will try out the route a few times in the evenings to make sure too. :)</p>

              Yup. UWA. I am thinking about insurance, petrol, road tax, etc. I'm not working so every few hundreds makes a difference. I estimated around $300 a month for all that. That is my main concern. :D
              
              I probably won't be going out at night anyway. I'm a homely person mostly. So is my OH.
