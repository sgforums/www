            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>SINGAPORE: Just how valuable is an overseas Singaporean to the country?<br><br>That was the crux of the sentiment during the question-and-answer session at the Overseas Singapore Club Forum.<br><br>It was a quiet start to the forum as 60 Singaporeans living overseas re-acquainted themselves with the latest developments in the country.<br><br>But the feedback came fast after that.<br><br>Chief among the issues raised was how overseas Singaporeans could remain connected if simple connection issues could not be resolved.<br><br>Many spoke of difficulties registering with embassies and remaining updated by government agencies.<br><br>Lee Ying Zheng said: "It's a common practice among government agencies that once we don't live in Singapore, they don't want to communicate with us overseas. They say I cannot mail you letters overseas Â– is this (due to) postage reason or something? I don't know. So we are being cut off from communication with agencies. I consider this strange. Do you consider me a citizen or not? I'm not sure. (But when) it comes to income tax, you know how to go after me."<br><br>Ho Geok Choo, Chairperson and Speaker, Overseas Singapore Club Forum, said: "As far as the embassies are concerned, it's probably a matter of prioritising what has got to be done first, given their limited resources. I am not speaking on their behalf but this is my quick response and certainly your feedback is very good for us."<br><br>A man who left Singapore for the US made an impassioned plea for help for SMEs.<br><br>Charlie Giang said: "At the age of 35, I packed my bags with $20,000 in my bank account and brought it to the US. I just went with one Singaporean trait and that was to 'cheong' Â– which means to go after something. I left this country because opportunities were slim."<br><br>Other concerns were about integrating Singapore students who could not afford international schools back into the system.<br><br>And there was laughter too, underlying the issues.<br><br>Mr Lee recounted an incident when he asked his Singapore embassy on their plan for an evacuation drill in the event of a crisis.<br><br>He said: "When I got a response from the embassy, they said, 'Sorry, it's a secret'. I said, 'What? Evacuation plan is a secret?' They said, 'Yes, we are not supposed to tell you'. I said, 'What kind of evacuation plan is this?'."<br><br>The forum is a biennial event and this is the seventh in the series.</blockquote>Oi you all.. come back. Dun forget to pay income tax ok!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
