              <p>Heading back to do NS huh? Wow, that's a big step after having lived away from SG all this time. I wonder what will happen to your US passport since Sg doesn't allow dual citizenships?</p>
              <p>Anyway, when are you heading back?</p>

                  don't mind my saying this but if you've rarely been here to see how things are done and going by how i saw the rest of the "foreign boys" did, its unlikely you'll enjoy your first few months. 
                  
                  the few i saw had a habbit of questioning their superior on "human rights" especially one who felt being punished for doing something wrong was against his "human rights" which naturally led to more punishment.
                  so unless you plan to do really well in whatever you're going to do in singapore whether army or civilian its best to keep a low profile. high profile ones tend to get targeted.
              
              
              why would you want to keep sg citizenship if you have to serve ns anyway?

              its not so much about obeying the officers but avoiding them enough so someone else gets the orders instead of you.
              
              no, i don't mean human rights are bull crap, i meant there's a time and a place for everything, you don't talk back and argue about human rights with someone who outranks you, just like you don't talk back to your superior at work if you want to keep your job.

              <p>I hope you are comming back and staying with family.  Preferably one with a decent washing machine.  You might want to consider sponsoring that family with a dryer for days when you need your laundry back in a hurry.  (Heck I have a brother and he did his NS.)</p>

              <p>thats putting a lot of responsibilities on you.</p>
              <p>People are leaving sg for universities &amp; such, your family is expecting you to go back sg to do your universities?  (doiing that entails having to to do NS.)</p>
              <p>Its up to you seriously.  And your parents shouldnt have that sort of expectation. </p>
              <p>USA &amp; Singapore arent that much different in terms of expenses.  You might want to check thru your local collages to find out which is more cheaper.</p>
              <p>USA, you get your driving licence faster and schools easier.</p>
              <p>I've known folks that completed their NS and then give up their sg citizenship, because they felt they are better off elsewhere.</p>

              <p>could you not retained your citizen and go back to work and come back to the US for holidays. I know American stayed in SG for more than 26 yrs and they told me returning to US is like coming back for holidays. They eventually returned to florida to retired.</p>
              <p>Additional passport helps if u need to move unexpectedly.</p>
