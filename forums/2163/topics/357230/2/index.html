              <p>i guess MA apartment are old so they should be GAS. When u move into apartment most likely you have to apply for GAS. So the Gas company will send someone to light the pilot on the heater and Oven so not to worry they will teach you.</p>
              <p>What do i look for when i check out apartments?</p>
              <p>Facilities mgt if they are professional or sloppy...see if apartment are well maintained, any working crew on site working. Any 24 hours emergency on maintainance. It speak volume on security as well. Most apt does not have 24 hour security guards.</p>
              <p>i do not recomend staying off Turnpike (in ur case) or next to freeway.</p>
              <p>Sunlight direction this actually affect your apt temperature. It helps if it get too cold.</p>
              <p>traffic......this is not easy but if you can stay against the traffic to work than your commuting time is reduce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ADD up : when i move to my apartment i bought a new filter for the heater to avoid Carbon monoxide.</p>

              <p>i guess MA apartment are old so they should be GAS. When u move into apartment most likely you have to apply for GAS. So the Gas company will send someone to light the pilot on the heater and Oven so not to worry they will teach you.</p>
              <p>ADD up : when i move to my apartment i bought a new filter for the heater to avoid Carbon monoxide.</p>

              <p>If they are paying for the electric.. then I recommend using electric space heaters :P</p>
              <p>Usage depends very much on how warm you want.. how big the heating area. How well insulated are the walls. And how much winter clothes you want to wear while in your home.</p>
              <p>Oil heating prices are tied to crude oil prices. So it will fluctuate like the prices in gas stations.</p>

              <p>fireplace is very inefficient way of heating a home lor.</p>
              <p>But the location for that ranch home is probably in rural area hor... so every month have to have a oil truck come and top up the tank lah.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. all heating methods have it's short comings lah.</p>
              <p>Even electric heating also will have problem when they experience rolling blackouts.</p>
              <p>It's always  best to have a alternative heating .. just in case.</p>

              <p>I haven't been to the US since I was in elementary school, so basically all I can give you is some tips on American language.</p>
              <p>Dozen = 12</p>
              <p>Also, "drink driving" as it's known here is known as "drunk driving", DUI (driving under the influence), or DWI (driving while intoxicated).</p>
              <p>Plus, I'm sure you know that many words have an American spelling. For example: color, favorite, criticize, realize, center, theater, ton, etc.</p>
              <p>Also, an "inch" is roughly 2.5 cm. A "foot" is roughly 30 inches. A "yard" is roughly a meter. A "mile" is roughly 1.6 km.</p>
              <p>LOL, I don't know if any of that helps.</p>
              <p>Another thing: if you want to use your Singapore cell phone in the US, you have to sign up with either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile. Sprint and Verizon use a different technology (CDMA) while AT&amp;T and T-Mo use the same as Singapore (GSM).</p>

              <p>You can ask an agent to let you look at the rental hot sheet. That's what I did when I moved here.</p>
              <p>Typically you should only use one agent. Just because this agent will get paid for his/her efforts.</p>
