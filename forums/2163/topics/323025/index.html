              <p>Hmm.....sorry about your predicament.  Honestly, only you can answer that question.  People adjust differently to similar situations.</p>
              <p>I have lived in a town with a population of 6,000 and it wasn't easy.  I spent three miserable years there.  In fact, if I can rewrite part of my life?  I will rewrite this part.</p>
              <p>Actually, hard to comment.  You have to consider your relationship with your fiance.  Your age, your career.  What is important to you and what you are willing to put up with.  But even one gets tired after a compromise.  So, either you give it a shot and take it from there.  See how it work out and if it doesn't then take the next step?</p>
              <p>If you are going to marry your fiance then I guess you will have no choice but to relocate, right?  Anyways, good luck with your decision.  Sometimes, there is no right or wrong 'cos what is right today may be wrong tomorrow.  Go with your priorities given the current situation and then let God show you the rest.</p>
              <p>God Bless!</p>

              <p>would this be like the question of who would you saved first? your boyfriends or father when you find yourself drown in a deep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I away sees this as a maturity question rather than a issue of parents. Because everyone has parent too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to settle permanently needs a different mind set.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But ask yourself can you not travel back to SG periodically it is not like SG is a banned state. Since you are only staying in the West coast is only A380 away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Leaving old friends and make new ones and open life to new possibilities for young people. You have your partner think about what is important for the 2 of you together.</p>

              <p>Sometimes it might be worth it to give it a try. It is better than looking back, and regret for not giving the US a shot. I was in the same situation as you a few years back. Hubby hated the weather in S'pore, thus I stayed on in Melbourne after my studies. Looking back, I have no regrets, enjoyed my stay here, though felt homesick at times. I have learned a new perspective towards life, and many life experiences here that are valuable.</p>
              <p>Now, I am moving back to S'pore for family commitments. At different points of life, one will have to make the decision that is most appropriate for the situation. I will not said it is the best decision, but rather what you alone (not others) feel is appropriate.</p>
              <p>And, you mentioned that you had stayed there and like it, so it will be easier for you to adapt. And when homesickness kicks in, there is the phone and webcam. And very importantly, at least to me, Prima instant packets for cravings of S'porean food.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Thank you, all, for such valuable advice.  It is good to hear of the experience of others before coming to a decision. I agree that ultimately, it is the life experience.

              <p>Hi Starry</p>
              <p>I think more or less you know where to go at this stage. Dun worried too much abt. family commitments now. Cross the bridge when you come to it. My dad was diagnosed with cancer 2 years back, last stage. He is gone now.The company that I work for was understanding and allowed leave of absence for an indefinite time when I wanted to resign to go back S'pore last year. Bro's company offered the same. All dad's children were with him for a few months before he was gone</p>
              <p>One of the reason I am going back is because I would like to spend more time with mum as my younger bro is goin to NS. And the other bro might be posted to UK for work. Another reason is 'cos I would like to do something more meaningful for myself.</p>
              <p>Hubby in fact encourages me to move back for a while. He has been pyscho to adapt to S'pore food and weather (he goes to S'pore twice a year, cheap food, good transport, Funan Centre, Sim Lim). He loves these. He will relocate to S'pore once he completes his commitments here.</p>
              <p>We do not have any kids. And if we do, hubby agrees with me that kids must be educated in S'pore. Hubby has been brainwashed...hehehe<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>I have heard of some instances of racism in WA, but I dun think its the norm. And if you do meet racists, just ignore these morons. VK is right. Go with an open mindset that it will be a new experience and opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. Most of my close friends in Mel are non-Singaporeans. Contrary to beliefs that Arabs are closed up and fierce to outsiders, I have met some in Mel who are generous, and help and protect you like you are one of theirs.</p>
              <p>It will be a new chapter. Normally those who are disappointed are those who go with the mentality "the grass is greener on the other side". Every country is unique in its own way. Enjoy yourself when u r there. Life is too short and unpredictable.</p>

              <p> I had to move and it was hard. It's been 15 years and I'm still adjusting. Which part of Oregon are you thinking of moving to? I've been there on day trips many many years ago (my hubby's from WA state). Best thing about OR is the 0% sales tax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>On a serious note, it has been a tough journey for me. Since we were military and had to relocate every 3 years from country to country. We're finally retired and living stateside and I'm still adjusting.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you have more personal questions, feel free to PM me?</p>
