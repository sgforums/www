              <p><br>hi starry, check ur PM. Just heard from frens that some ex-colleagues were axed over these 2 weeks. Might be a slowdown of the economy. Even in Oz with so many unions, 'redundant' staff can still be unceromoniously escorted to the door without much notice. Sad.</p>
              <p>I will not exactly view marketing as an industry. Rather it is more of which industry that you are in marketing. I will try to answer as best as I can...not an expert.</p>

              <p>Hmm.....sorry about your predicament.  Honestly, only you can answer that question.  People adjust differently to similar situations.</p>
              <p>I have lived in a town with a population of 6,000 and it wasn't easy.  I spent three miserable years there.  In fact, if I can rewrite part of my life?  I will rewrite this part.</p>
              <p>Actually, hard to comment.  You have to consider your relationship with your fiance.  Your age, your career.  What is important to you and what you are willing to put up with.  But even one gets tired after a compromise.  So, either you give it a shot and take it from there.  See how it work out and if it doesn't then take the next step?</p>
              <p>If you are going to marry your fiance then I guess you will have no choice but to relocate, right?  Anyways, good luck with your decision.  Sometimes, there is no right or wrong 'cos what is right today may be wrong tomorrow.  Go with your priorities given the current situation and then let God show you the rest.</p>

              <p>I flew on NWA's A330 from Seattle to Narita, and then from Narita to Singapore. The in-flight meals were borderline nauseous. The cattle-class seats on their A330s were about as uncomfortable as they come, with little to no lower back support and an intrusion in the footwell under the seat ahead that skews your feet to the left. Seat width was also sorely lacking. Even though I had an aisle seat, I spent most of the 12-hour Seattle-to-Narita leg standing at the rear of the plane as the seat was literally giving me back pain.</p>
              <p>I am not looking forward to the return trip, which will also be on A330s. I miss the old 747-400s that used to fly the route.</p>

              Either you break up or move to the USA, that is the case for you. You are determine enough to get an American boyfriend, you should be courageous enough to move to his country.
              
              I got a friend in your shoes. She dumped her Singkie boyfren to marry this USA guy and got pregnant pretty quickly. After staying in USA for 2 months, she came back alone because she was lonely there. I feel that she is a coward. She makes her decision and could not handle the consequences.
              
              Her mother is very anxious to ship her back to USA because very soon her stomach will be too big to sit in an aeroplane. Her mother felt very embarassed for her daughter's decision, because she felt for her husband and in-laws there in the USA who has been very kind to her daughter.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>there are always sacrifices to be made. i think no one will really look forward to leaving their lives/work/families behind and to move to a totally unfamiliar place. ultimately...it all boils down to what really matters. if your family, life in singapore is more important than your bf/hubby...and your bf/hubby cannot acommodate your wish to stay put, then you've no choice but to let him go. but if you do decide to go...you really have to make an attempt to make things work despite the initial difficulties...and make the best out of your life over there. i'm sure there are many things to look forward to in whatever country you are going...so focus on those rather than harp on how much you hate to leave singapore.</p></div>

              <p>A young g/.f of mine is facing similar problems.</p>
              <p>Her fiance is japanese.  She is Singaporean.</p>
              <p>She is close to her family members in sg, and really dont want to leave.</p>
              <p>Her main problem is actually finaces.  Her future hubby has not really talk with her about how he is going to provide for her in Japan.</p>
              <p>And her concern is whether there may be enough allowances for her to send $$$ home for her parents while she is away in Japan.</p>
              <p>She felt that her hub is too stingy and may not help her parents.  And for her to quit her job, cut off her earning power and relying on her hub.</p>
              <p>In chinese, she kinda dont want to see his face to lead her life.  And she have not got assurance that he is willing to bear her burden. </p>

              <p>if they haven't even discussed these issues or aren't comfortable yet to discuss these....then they are probably not ready for marriage yet.</p>
              <p>you don't wait till after marriage to discuss these issues....by then, it'd be too late if they find that they can't see eye to eye.</p>
              <p>i thot that in japan...the regular practice is for the wives to hold the purse strings...while the husbands are only given allowances =P</p>
