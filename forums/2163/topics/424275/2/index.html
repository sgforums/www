              <p>That Paul MacDonald guy, gave me a headache while watching him prance around. His performance was less than so-so, imho. I think they are praising him for performances past, not last night's. The two newbies must learn not to judge on sentimentalism, agree? </p>

              <p>luckily ah thia got the message.  last nite she was smiling a lot more if not all nite.  i am glad for that 'cos she has the voice.  hopes she goes far.</p>
              <p>aiyoh....our dear simon.  we have so much faith in him, in his judgement but sekali, this morning, i read this headline, he liked that simi rebecca black's song titled friday.  aiyoh eh ah.  that song was deemed the "worst song ever". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>okay week 3.....ah jetta dear....gotta give it to your casey.  he was the best performer last nite (IMHO).  much as ah thia has the voice, sadly she has ZERO personality. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif">   even ah james didn't even blow me away.  it was just alright.  agrees with the judges that simi stefano and pia ah?  got voice/power but no stage presence.  technically strong but performance wise, not great.  one must not only be able to sing but also to entertain.  both scored ZERO in that department.  paying too much attention to technique liao.  i don't feel their deliverance.  none moved me last nite. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>true enough that ah thia bottom 3.  if she doesn't show some personality, soon she will be shown the exit.  i tot stefano was to go, my jaw dropped when i heard casey's name announced.</p>
              <p>anyways, i loved last nite's show.  first we got stevie wonder performing and then what a treat!!!!  a birthday celeb for my steven tyler!!!!!  and then later, my dear hulk hogan appeared!!!!!  oh what a nite.  everyone i like....stevie, steven and hulk.  after that i imitated him and put my hand to my ear.  kekekeke</p>

              <p>did u catch it last nite?  again, it was just alright for me.  besides, elton's songs ain't easy to sing.  my favourite moment was when my dear steven tyler teased lauren that if she continues to sing like that, she will be able to afford the rest of the dress.  i tot that was so cheeky of him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  and my fav performance of the nite was from thia.  again, she has zero personality.  that simi naima has more personality than thia although thia has the better voice.  but i was moved by thia's deliverance last nite.  i tot she was going to cry singing and relating the lyrics to her brother.</p>
              <p>i wonder why they tink kao pei kao bu is the way to singing.  most importantly is pleasing to the ear and can touch/move your listeners.  haiz.....  all these kpkb gives me a headache. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  are u guessing who will be called out tonight?  my guess for bottom 3 is : thia, naima and stefano.  we'll see.  hey lady....stop playing your simi cityville and come back on.   or have u started work liao?   calling calling jetta......<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/phone.png" alt="phone.png"></p>

              <p>I'm here!! Sorry ah, super occupied here. I'm working nights now, dealing with this new store I'm with. Donch laugh hor. Kmart bought Sears and have recently started carrying appliances. They don't advertise it since not all stores carry appliances so traffic is kinda slow. So inbetween manning the appliances dept, I take care of two other departments. While at Sears, I mostly stayed in my dept but now, I do sooo much walking. Ouch! Good thing I only work 20 hours a week. </p>
              <p>And yes, I'm a Cityville freak. Can't explain it, just love the game. You wanna be my neighbour? *nudge nudge wink wink*</p>
              <p>Aside from that, I'm trying to get my latest project underway. We are trying to build a short wall along the right side of the house. One advantage of living here is the accessibility of cheap labour. Heng ah. Imagine paying $12/hr for manual labour? </p>
              <p>K. Now on to AI business:</p>
              <p>I hated that Ah Ma's (Naima) raggae version *ptui!* I'm beyond glad that she's gone. However, I'm sad that Thia's gone. That one has such a good voice but like you said, the personality of a rock. That Paul and his flowered suit should go. I don't think you can whisper your way to the top. I think we should all just not waste anymore time and just get to the top 4.  Let Casey, Pia, Haley and James just duke it out. What do you think? lol</p>

              <p>u r such an expert.  i dislike learning about appliances.  i have very basic needs.  i tink any electronic or electrical stuff i have are base models. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif">  so, u work a few departments eh?  well, such is the norm here too.  i see this lady manning the deli and then i had to wait for her to get my grilled stuff.  this is like your what?  west coast biggy is superstore?  mine is sobey's.  walking is good, my lady.  it's exercise and work both rolled into one.  better than me sitting on my behind all day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif">  i hope i don't get that "spread" otherwise i will have to resort to that stair climbing stuff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  so lucky, work 20 hours nia.  i hope i work 20 hours too.  but for now, i have to take to the grind until no more tuition fees to pay. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/star.png" alt="star.png"></p>
              <p>wow....it's only spring and you are having your home improvement underway?  good for you!  why the short wall if i may ask?  show pic?  for me, i am eagerly awaiting my siblings visit.  counting days.</p>
              <p>sorry, the above should have been at the spring crapbox...kekeke  ok, back to AI.  i hear you.  big mistake for naima.  that song is just so inappropriate to raggae.  i felt sad that thia's gone too but i know it's gonna be soon 'cos really, she's not shining and doing injustice to her beautiful and powerful voice.  eww....how come u picked haley?  ah steven said she sings sexy!!!!  tsk tsk....  what about lauren?</p>
              <p>oh, any comment about james' pepsi moment blurt?  i got a tweet that he caused an uproar in the tweet community.  heh heh....talk about paul.  did u hear steven asking paul if he watered his jacket 'cos there appeared to be more flowers/bloom.  funny lah, this tyler guy.  sexy crazy!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>

              <p>ok, week of top 9.  well, hmm, so close....their performance.  tough call which to name out.  my favourite of the nite was james' rendition of "while my guitar gently weeps" written by george harrison.  i love that song and i love how james sang it.  lyrics while simple has depth.  james delivered with the right emotion and what an ending.  i gave a shout on his last note!  love it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"></p>

              <p>Re: J Lo. I just don't see it leh. To me gorgeous is Halle Berry. J Lo in my eyes is okay only. Steven and J Lo are so grey with their comments. Where is Simon and his bucket of cold water?</p>
              <p>My oh my! Is America deaf? Stefano's in and Pia's out?!? What the?!?!? She's not my favourite so like you, not too bothered. Either way, I don't see her as the ultimate winner so it's a sooner or later kinda thing.</p>
              <p>So let's not waste time and just get to the top 3? lol</p>

              <p>i was with u before....didn't really pay attention to j lo.  but i guess as i get to see her weekly and twice a week for that matter, her looks kinda grows on me eh?  it's like frequent association generate some sentiments eh?  it actually could go either way.  good feelings or ill feelings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">   and hey, did u hear/read?  she's voted the most beautiful woman on people's mag.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/rose.png" alt="rose.png">  i am with you.  halle berry is gorgeous. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>exactly!!!!  much as i like steven tyler.....he is too kind.  but he sees talent.  look it.  he gave casey a standing o last nite.  while i am not exactly a fan, i agree that casey is talented and creative.  that kind of jazz number, i wanna be comfortably seated at a club, have a drink, enjoy the music, ambience and company. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/cocktail.png" alt="cocktail.png"></p>
              <p>ok, back to top 8.  hmm.....yet again, my fav performance of the nite goes to james durbin.  i was rocking with him man!!!!  after his performance, i gave him a standing o from my living room. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">  i mean seriously!!!!  james rocks!!!!!  i honestly hopes he wins.</p>
              <p>paul is still prancing.  i wish u do something different.  it's getting a bit tiring on the eyes.  cool suit tho'.  the producer actually said lauren sings the climb better than miley?  aww....c'mon.  not really.  if i have my way, i tink lauren needs to be bottom 3 tonight.  haley was alright.  some pitch prob and with her moving about the stage, i tot she exhaust her stamina somewhere.  jacob was okay.  thank goodness he didn't go over the top.  just right.  scotty.....he is ready to cut an album....a country album that is.  stefano.....actually when he sings, he does move me but i can't say he has that it factor.   my prediction for bottom 3?  haley, stefano and paul.</p>
              <p>over to you, lady! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/phone.png" alt="phone.png">  oh btw, your top 3? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/note.png" alt="note.png"></p>

              <p>My top 3? Casey, James and ..... I don't know. I can't stand country music. The way McCreery sings out of one side of his mouth is irritating. So is singing into the mic at a tilt. Irritates! lol.</p>
              <p>I am so glad that Paul is gone. He wasn't singing anymore. More like rapping. haha. I'm giggling at the thought of you giving James a standing o in your living room. Too funny! I hear that Casey and Haley are a couple. They are so cute. :) The dress she wore on results night made me think of a plastic surgeon's pre-surgery outlines. :P</p>
              <p>J Lo most beautiful? Puh-lease. When I hear the new judges' critique, I always go, "are we watching the same show?" I know I'm not deaf. And where does Steven buy his "blouses?" Nordstrom's old lady department? Sorry, couldn't resist. :P</p>

              <p>aww....jetta....my first thought was with you.  i tot scotty was to go 'cos the top 6 week, his performance was weak.  although jacob tends to go over the top but this week he kept it simple.  i tot lauren did a weak rendition too.  i honestly don't know what the judges are listening to.</p>
              <p>funny the way u described how scotty sings.  exactly!!!!  he must tink it cool but like u said, it is irritating.  almost like a smug.</p>
              <p>yup, i read and heard it too that casey n haley are a couple.  i honestly do not like anyone except james.  so james it will be for me....to win.  sorry casey's out.  he is indeed talented and creative.  as a performance for a show i tot what he did on wednesday was cool but still, not my preferred cup of tea.  for james, i didn't give a standing O but i clapped.</p>
              <p>funny lah you....steven's blouses from old lady department?????  nice wor.  he is hot and sexy lah!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>so, r u serious?  u not watching anymore?  how about dancing with the stars?  i am rooting for hines.  go hines go~~~~  go james go~~~~  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/beer.png" alt="beer.png"></p>
