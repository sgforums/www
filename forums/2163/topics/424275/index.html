              <p>Re: Steven Tyler. Before he appeared on the show, I had a skewed image of him. From reading Rolling Stone and the like. He's quite funny, spontaneous and a good sport going by what I've seen so far. </p>
              <p>What did you think of that karaoke host guy? He has talent but I think what he did during the group round sabotaged his image with viewers. Personally, that was it for me. I disliked him after that. </p>

              <p>his history book is colourful (who am i to say what's good or bad eh?) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> but his charisma shines during AI.  the netizens are saying AI is still watchable because of steven tyler and i totally agree.  i saw clips of his fenway park concert.....(true blue bostonian...he wore red sox jersey....hehehehe).  i mean at 62???  he still has it......<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Your James didn't scream too much tonight. Surprise, surprise. Not bad, I thought.</p>
              <p>Thia got short changed by her reviews. She has such control and range, I just loved it.</p>
              <p>Casey gave a good performance, what did you think of it?</p>
              <p>Ashton was terrible, Neima and Karen too. I was wondering, if the judges were watching the same show. They gave good reviews!</p>
              <p>Hayley's yodelling was interesting.</p>
              <p>Jacob didn't transition well into the chorus.</p>

              <p>oh wow....you ARE fast!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  it was a disappointing nite for me.  i was not blown away by any performance at all.</p>
              <p>yeah....james didn't scream too much.  there were some pitch problems but he sang the best last nite.  yeah, surprisingly, he has a nice tone without screaming too.  yup, thia got short changed but you know what?  she has the voice but no presence.  her first part was awesome but when the band came in, it was all so wrong.  it sounded off-key.  i suspect the contestants couldn't hear themselves (no ear piece) 'cos that lusk guy and that simi neima ah?  both had the same problem too.</p>
              <p>casey?  he was alright for me.  i mean he can sing but ....... i get the feeling he was trying to imitate joe cocker.  he should just do his thing like our country scotty.  ashton seems to have gotten the message since she didn't get voted in by the american public.  she toned down a few notches.  being overly confident is like being complacent.</p>
              <p>i know.  i was exclaiming "what are you judges listening?"  i mean if they continue to be mr and miss nice guy/gal, the contestants ain't gonna improve and tinks too highly of themselves.....which is far from.  but i believe steve got the the message.  i went to kaypoh at the AI site and many netizens while love him said he was not judging at all.  everything seems beautiful to his ears.  so he did give some real critic last nite.  in that arena, i miss simon cowell who tells it like it is.</p>
              <p>when that haley was singing, i was thinking, simon will say "this is so old fashion".  but at least we are hearing randy echoing "boring"....borrowed from simon's past years comment.  but i must admit haley's performance while old fashion was interesting.  it gave a different flavour.  i must also admit that the rap by neima was not bad...for the umbrella song.  but she sang badly.  like i said, it's like she couldn't hear herself.</p>
              <p>jacob aka lusk guy should have just kept it simple.  he went over the top so when the chorus came in, he was so out of place.  except for that one note....that high note, the whole performance was wasted.</p>
              <p>hey, you didn't mention the paul guy.  the chap who sounded like rod stewart.  know what?  he actually has a very nice sexy rasp voice but he also blew it in the second half of his song.  and for goodness sake....stop trotting around the stage.  wasted energy.</p>
              <p>over to you, my friend.  and yeah....looks like we are the only two here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
