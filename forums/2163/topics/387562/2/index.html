              <p>Woohoo! Just finished e-filing my federal and state taxes this evening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>This year, I finally broke down and used TurboTax for the very first time to prepare the returns. It was a fairly painless affair, the only hitch being my having to take some time to research the cost basis for some very old mutual funds I had sold last year.</p>
              <p>That's a great weight off my shoulders, with the returns  out of the way. Now I can begin planning my next Japan trip in earnest...</p>

              <p>hey...can i check with you guys....i know that we are supposed to declare foreign source income....but do we need to declare whatever we earned prior to arriving in the states? officially....our resident status only commence after our arrival right? so if we arrive in US in Sep 2009, can we treat our tax obligation only from Sep-Dec 2009?</p>
              <p>thing is...our singapore income is much higher than US income. even with the tax credit for taxes paid overseas....i'm worried that we might be hit with additional US tax on our singapore income. don't think we'll like that at all.</p>

              <p><br>actually my lease is ending jun 2010 (30 day advance notice for renewal). so we are just starting early (kiasu instinct still ingrained in us!). think we've more or less got the area all figured out...and have already shortlisted a few towns and specific vicinity to focus our search in.</p>
              <p>there are 2 great options right now...and we are telling ourselves not to fall in love but to let the numbers justify our purchase. we'll still wait awhile before deciding on it...and if the houses are gone by then, we are ok with it as i'm quite sure there'll always be other houses available. it'd definitely be after april 2010 before we seriously consider making a move.</p>
              <p>do you at least get the $6500 tax credit?</p>

              <p>Hahaha! Are you getting a sizable refund? We're getting about the same amount back, which is interesting since my small biz operated on a loss. Oh and did I tell you? I'm back at Sears doing the same old tango. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Gratz on heading to Sakura country again. The hubster put in an application for a job on one of the bases there, so we may just say the same one day.</p>
              <p>While you're there this time, do the onsen thing? I remember you couldn't on your last visit since it was summertime. The one I used to visit is called Yunessen.</p>

              <p>If you're going to ask a financial institution for a loan, credit history will come into play, I beg to differ. These days institutions are more stringent with qualifying candidates. You need time on your side for your credit rating to get established an improve in scores. Just continue to be responsible with your bills, etc and be patient.</p>

              <p>did i mention that i bought a very very basic sewing machine -brother ls2125? got it for a fairly decent price at Job Lot...didn't want to spend too much lest i get tired of it after awhile. i've been going to jo-ann's for fabrics...and recently, i found that Job Lot is selling lots of beautiful upholstery fabrics at fantastic prices (i.e. $5 for 3yards)!</p>

              <p>Sears employee discounts aren't that generous, sad to say. Just a whole whopping 10%. I'm not a Sears shopper, preferring the military bases, Best Buy and Target instead. </p>
              <p>Gratz on your sewing machine. Awesome prices on fabrics. Nice! I have enough fabric to last me a very very long time. Hence I've resolved not to add to my stash until I've whittled down my pile. I still participate in craft fairs, just the bigger ones. Have one which I'm organizing mid March. It'll be fun.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, it is. I hadn't been doing a good job of keeping the withholding information on my W-4 in line with my financial situation, and ended up having <em>waaay</em> too much withheld from my paychecks for federal and state taxes. To the tune of nearly $8000 too much in '09, in fact.</p>
              <p>And since I'm not too keen on the idea of giving the  government an interest-free loan, I've since adjusted the figures on my W-4 significantly downward.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
