              <p>Keep on searching. Google individuals, call CPA companies... In the meantime, get all your figures in order. Catalog your receipts, etc, to make things easier when you find a CPA.</p>

              <p>we can file 1040/1040NR as "dual status aliens" for 2009 but no real benefit in doing that in my opinion 'cos there aren't additional tax credits for dual status and we'd have to declare foreign source income for the period we are resident aliens (despite foreign tax deductible/other qualifying credits for the residency period but prob still not worthwhile in our case).</p>

              <p>can't use 1040NR-EZ  'cos must input IRA and moving

              <p>we can file 1040/1040NR as "dual status aliens" for 2009 but no
              real benefit in doing that in my opinion 'cos there aren't
              additional tax credits for dual status and we'd have to declare
              foreign source income for the period we are resident aliens
              (despite foreign tax deductible/other qualifying credits for the
              residency period but prob still not worthwhile in our
              case).</p>
              <p>does it sound about right?</p>
              <p>do you still remember which form/status you folks filed in
              your first year if you only arrived after mid-year?</p>

              <p>i prob can...but 'cos i've to re-route the tax forms to the W7 unit first...and then it'd take them up to 10weeks to give me an ITIN...that will definitely delay my hubby's submission (we don't wish to pay for late penalty).</p>
              <p>i suppose i can file for an extension but that's another extra step....OR i can always just do my W7 next year and then spouse and i can file jointly as resident aliens for 2010.</p>
              <p>apart from credit card applications...does the ITIN benefit me in any other way? do i need an ITIN to buy a house? i can always get the bank to give me a letter to apply for ITIN later when i go and open my next interest-yielding bank account?</p>
              <p>till i file the tax....it'd still be hanging over my head.....and i still have our singapore taxes to tackle....good gawd! i'd be having LOADS OF FUN with my 2 big boxes of SG receipts *faint*</p>

              <p>Just file for an extension. </p>
              <p>Your ITIN is mucho importante. It's a passport to getting an SSN, down the road. And remember, each time you apply for credit, it stays on your credit report f--o-r-e-v-e-r. Once you've been here a year, order a copy of your credit report and see what your credit score is. You'll have to pay about $15 to get your credit score. www.annualcreditreport.com</p>
              <p>So take this lull to gather all your receipts, get all your expenses broken down into relevant categories, etc. Once you're done, you'll breathe easier. Good luck.</p>

              <p>i just have to vent...i'm almost done with both federal and state tax filing. unfortunately...i'm unable to get an ITIN 'cos i'm not filing (&amp; cannot file) federal tax.</p>
              <p>but i need an ID for state filing. so i called state rev dept &amp; IRS...and the conversations went something like this:</p>
              <p>me (to state rev dept) : i don't have SSN or ITIN which is required in state tax return form</p>
              <p>state customer svc guy: oh you need an ID...please call IRS (can't wait for me to hang up)</p>
              <p>---------------------------------</p>
              <p>me (to IRS) : i need to obtain ITIN for state tax filing but i'm not filing federal tax</p>
              <p>IRS customer svc gal:  oh, you can only apply for ITIN if you file federal tax</p>
              <p>me (to IRS) : can i file a zero return for federal tax and apply for ITIN</p>
              <p>IRS customer svc gal: no..that's a fraudulent submission.</p>
              <p>(then proceeds to make me answer 101 questions before telling me....)</p>
              <p>IRS customer svc gal: sorry, you cannot apply for ITIN. please call your state tax dept</p>
              <p>--------------------------------</p>
              <p>me (to state rev dept) : IRS will not give me an ITIN and i don't have SSN....what should i indicate as ID on the state tax form?</p>
              <p>state customer svc: huh?? ermmmmm.......(left me on the phone for good 10min or so)</p>
              <p>state customer svc: then you file state return as "married filing separate return"</p>
              <p>me (to state rev dept) : okkkkaayyy....but for "married filing separate return"...it is indicated on the form to "ENTER SPOUSE'S SOC. SEC NUMBER IN THE APPROPRIATE SPACE ABOVE"!!!!</p>

              <p>thanks....just venting...no biggie</p>
              <p>i've already been to the SSA in person. they'd never be able to issue me a SSN unless my VISA status changes.</p>
              <p>and i'll only be able to apply for ITIN when we file for 2010 tax.</p>
              <p>so...no solution for state tax filing...i'm just gonna write them a note. at least we don't owe the state any money.</p>
