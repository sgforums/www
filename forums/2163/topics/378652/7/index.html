              <p>The only damage, if you can call it this was a leak in the solar tube we had installed last spring. I was surprised but I'm not happy that the installer will be by tomorrow to take a peek. It's supposed to rain again tomorrow but it's dry today so it would be best if he popped in today.</p>

              <p>I just realised that the the system that drenched us here is the
              same system wrecking havoc where you're at. I'm wondering, with the
              blizzard conditions, your boss hasn't declared a snow

              <p>I still cannot fathom why one would put up with living in such bleak winter conditions. I'm not brave enough. Hats off to you. San Diego winters are plenty cold enough for this poor soul. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>As for us, we are drying out. However, with our aging water pipes we have a hugh gusher in the city. Hugh! We are expecting another weather system sometime Friday or so. I have a slight problem though. The solartube that we had installed has now sprung a leak. I have a flat roof and I hope that water hasn't pooled too badly up there. The original installer's coming first thing in the AM and I'm hoping for the best. </p>
