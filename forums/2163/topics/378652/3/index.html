              <p>The buildup is cumulative, especially if the house is all sealed up in winter with no means of venting the CO to the outside. Here in the upper midwest, never a winter passes without news of some family succumbing to CO poisoning due to a leaky furnace exhaust or a gas stove that was left lit overnight.</p>
              <p>But all this is quite irrelevant as LIT has an electric stove (though the furnace and water heater could still potentially be a source of CO contamination).</p>

              <p>still good to know...i'll check on that.</p>
              <p>we actually purchased the car online when we were still in
              singapore...thinking that there won't be sales tax. but when the
              car was paid and delivered, we were still slapped with additional
              amount for sales tax</p>

              <p>Sales tax is imposed where the product is picked up/delivered. So let's say you decide to buy a dishwasher and go to a county with a lower sales tax. If you pick it up from the store, you'd pay the lower sales tax. If you have it delivered to a location with a higher tax rate, you pay that higher tax. I found this out from my year of selling appliances at Sears. </p>

              <p><br> that is amazing!</p>
              <p>i'm also trying to do little things to keep the bills low...</p>
              <p>like wearing more layers when indoor so that i don't have to
              turn on the heating unless absolutely necessary...</p>
              <p>change less often (eeeks!)...'cos my laundry load has been huge
              (using much water/electricity) 'cos i've been wearing so many
              layers of clothes...and changing them everyday...figure i need only
              to change the layer in contact with body daily and not the other
              layers...</p>
              <p>i'll have to figure out what to do with the drafty
              windows...i've already put up the storm windows and i think they
              help a little...i saw those fabric tapes that you can stick on the
              windows to prevent air from seeping through...maybe plastic sheet
              over some of the windows? AC?</p>
              <p>i just bought 2 single electric blanket at a sale...think those
              could come in handy...</p>
              <p>i'm a little scared to see my electric/gas bill for next month
              =(</p>

              <p>The cold seeps through windows, mostly. You can help minimize this by putting up black out drapes. These are drapes with two layers ie, the fabric and the black out fabric. You can also make your own. If you have a window a/c, the cold will seep through the unit and the opening. You can buy an a/c cover from Sears.</p>
              <p>Electric blankets are the best. We use those too. Get those with dual control so you both can pick your own temp settings. They are a little expensive though. Walmart has good prices on those. Buy yours early because they go fast!</p>
              <p>To save a little more $, hang your clothes as soon as you pull them out of the dryer. This way you won't have to expend the energy on pressing.</p>

              <p>great tips!</p>
              <p>i've bought 1 a/c cover...will try putting it up to see if it works...if it does, maybe i'll get more for all the other units...hopefully, my landlord will reimburse me</p>
              <p>for the electric blankies....'cos my spouse and i take heat/cold quite differently....we bought 2 single-size blankets...we figure that way, we each can choose our own temperature and there need not be a tug-of-blanket... </p>

              <p>Yeah, I'll be sure to shoot you a PM the next time I'm up in your neck of the woods. I was just kidding about the SG restaurant actually. I like the local cuisine, and was taken to a place called Bonfire's in Eagan, and they have pretty good walleye.</p>
              <p>Nope, haven't had a chance to do the Mall of America yet. I hear they've got some pretty good deals now with the economy in the toilet. Is it really bigger than the Vatican?</p>
