              <p><br>and the basement is moist/wet too with a small drainage all around...there's a sump pump that makes funny noises. is it common to have water in the basement or only when the water table is very high? i've seen houses with finished basements...are they prone to moisture?</p>
              <p>at least i can access the basement from inside the house....i hate those that you can only get in through a bulkhead from outside. i mean...how do you bring your heap of laundry out and down the bulkhead in the thick of the winter? or do people stop washing clothes in winter??!!!</p>
              <p>haven't explored the insulation options. need to go down to lowe/home depot one of these days. i do have some aircon covers that look like large kitchen mittens....do they really work?</p>
              <p>just bought some antifreeze stuff to spread on my patio 'cos the snow/ice made it really slippery...almost killed myself the other day if i hadn't grabbed on to the stairs railing.</p>

              <p>i'm feeling sorry for the little animals as it's getting cold....so i dropped little chopped pieces of corn all over my backyard last evening...and this morning i looked...all gone! there must be a hell lot of night activities.....</p>

              <p>Don't you just hate that? So Cal is waking up to lots of damage from that winter storm that came from Canada. Power outages, downed trees, etc. All from one solid day of rain and super gusty winds. We are drying out today, just in time for part two tomorrow. </p>

              <p><br> and the basement is moist/wet too with a small drainage all
              around...there's a sump pump that makes funny noises. is it common
              to have water in the basement or only when the water table is very
              high? i've seen houses with finished basements...are they prone to
              moisture?</p>
              <p>at least i can access the basement from inside the house....i
              hate those that you can only get in through a bulkhead from
              outside. i mean...how do you bring your heap of laundry
              out and down the bulkhead in the thick of the winter? or do people
              stop washing clothes in winter??!!!</p>
              <p>haven't explored the insulation options. need to go down to
              lowe/home depot one of these days. i do have some aircon covers
              that look like large kitchen mittens....do they really work?</p>
              <p>just bought some antifreeze stuff to spread on my patio 'cos the
              snow/ice made it really slippery...almost killed myself the other
              day if i hadn't grabbed on to the stairs railing.</p>
              <p>yup...and it's not even winter yet......what have i gotten
              myself into???!!...hahahahaha</p>
              <p>i'm feeling sorry for the little animals as it's getting
              cold....so i dropped little chopped pieces of corn all over my
              backyard last evening...and this morning i looked...all gone! there
              must be a hell lot of night activities.....</p>

              <p>Re: AC covers. Yes you should put them over your ac. Remember that the very vents that allow for air to be pushed into your home are the very same that allow for air to seep in from outside. So absolutely cover the unit. Check the seal around the unit, which you're at it. If it was a self-install, many people skip the insulation part. </p>
              <p>The way you describe your basement reminds me of Home Alone. lol. Sorry!</p>

              <p>The biggest source of heat loss in a house are the windows and doors, especially in older houses that do not have upgraded windows installed.</p>
              <p>During the first winter after I moved into my new house back in '96, my monthly gas (heating) bill was averaging nearly $200 per month. A good friend then suggested putting up <a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/WindowInsulatorKits/Products/">plastic window insulation film</a> on my windows and patio doors as a way of limiting heat loss. I did this the following winter and saw my heating bill drop to around $120 per month. At the end of the winter, you just pull the film and tape off. Needless to say,  I was sold, and have been using the film every winter since then.</p>
              <p>Mounting the film takes a bit of time, but it's relatively easy to do and yields significant savings in your energy bills. You might want to give this a try.</p>
