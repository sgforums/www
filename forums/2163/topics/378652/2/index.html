              <p>Some newer cars sold in the US come equipped with Daytime Running Lights (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_running_lights">DRL</a>) that illuminate automatically when the engine is operating.

              <p>Just keep in mind that when the DRLs are operating, <em>only the front lights are illuminated</em>, and usually at reduced intensity. When you drive at night, you still have to switch the headlights on to get full intensity <em>and</em> activate the taillights.</p>

              <p>YES!! i just bought a whole lot of asian pastes/spices online which includes tomyum soup and curries. ohhhh, i think those will be perfect for the autumn/winter cold.</p>

              <p><strong>If you are using a gas stove to do as Arapahoe suggests, please be aware that there is the danger of carbon monoxide (CO) accumulating to dangerous levels in your house.</strong></p>
              <p>CO is odorless and colorless, and unless you have a functioning CO detector in your  residence, you will not be able to detect it until you are overcome by it. The danger of CO buildup is greater in the winter months as most people have the doors and windows closed to prevent heat loss, trapping any accumulated CO in house.</p>

              <p>The insidious cold air just lurves to seep in anywhere it can. Here are some easy tips that may help? Shut all room doors inside the house to contain the heat. If your electric outlets have no insulation pads, you can get some at Home Depot or Lowes for next to nothing. While you're at it, check and see if your front door has a good seal. If not, you can get weather stripping for next to nothing, also at HD. I hope your place has the newer dual pane vinyl windows. If not, check for air leaks too. </p>
              <p>If you're a Costco member, you can get a heat lamp for cheap. I lurve heat lamps. HTHs. </p>

              <p>thanks for the advice. luckily for us, tjhe stove is an electric one.</p>
              <p>but i'd still need to be cautious of this CO poisoning 'cos the house uses gas heating right? would i be able to buy an affordable CO detector from Home Depot or something that i can install on my own or does such gadget cost an arm/leg?</p>

              <p><br>I'm pretty sure building codes in your neck of the woods mandate the installation of smoke detectors in residential dwellings, and I seem to recall that these same codes also require carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in <em>newer</em> houses and apartments. Your house might therefore already have a CO detector.</p>
              <p>Some smoke and CO detectors (usually the ones mounted high on the wall or on the ceiling) are similar in size and shape, so you'll have to look real closely at the label on the housing to determine what it is. There are also CO detectors that plug into a standard wall outlet. If your house doesn't already have a CO detector, it's usually a good idea to have one installed. They generally go for upwards of $20 at home improvement places like the Home Despot, Lowes, Menards, etc.</p>

              <p>No, you can't claim for ALL types of sales tax. Disclaimer, check with your state's rules and regs. Since you'll be filing your taxes for the first time next year, it would help if you sought the services of a CPA to help you understand and complete your first filing? My CPA here charges me by the hour and I can deduct his services from the following year's tax filing.</p>
              <p>You can also deduct part of the cost of certain medicines and medical supplies, doctors' bills, dental bills, donations you make to charities... again, check with your state's local tax rules.

              <p>The buildup is cumulative, especially if the house is all sealed up in winter with no means of venting the CO to the outside. Here in the upper midwest, never a winter passes without news of some family succumbing to CO poisoning due to a leaky furnace exhaust or a gas stove that was left lit overnight.</p>
              <p>But all this is quite irrelevant as LIT has an electric stove (though the furnace and water heater could still potentially be a source of CO contamination).</p>
