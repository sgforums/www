              <p>I'm thinking of migrating "back" to Melbourne too.  I'm in SG now, but I was transferred to Sydney 3 years ago to work for my company's regional HQ.  Was there for 2 years, but moved back due to some unforeseen circumstances.  </p>
              <p>While I was there, I had a chance to stay in Melbourne for abt 2 weeks in addition to the business trips that I take there every once in a while.  I really like Melbourne.. much more than Sydney.  It's a lot more "organized", i.e. the city planning was actually done right.  More importantly, I feel a lot less like the Asian outsider..... not in the office, but in general.</p>
              <p>I'm looking for suggestions on where the best suburb to live in Melbourne if anyone can help.  I've learned my lessons from Sydney where I lived far away from any SG food, and Asian community in general... hehehe... I'm not looking for a gazillion dollar homes next to the Yarra or anything like that. A simple townhouse, or just a small-medium sized home is fine. </p>

              <p>If you're looking for suburbs with Asian communities and food, three placesthat come to mind are Hawthorn, Doncaster and Box Hill.  Of the three, Box Hill's probably the cheapest.  Still and all, you're presently probably not going to find anything on the sunny side of 500K.</p>

              <p>melbourne sounds like another cesspit swimming with more nasty people and violent criminals.if i wanted these kinda people around me i wouldnt need to go back to singapore or to some maximum security prison.......just looking at some people here who hail from melbourne irks me! only people in melbourne seem to be their equivalent of the wealthy fried kuay teow stall owner , nightclub bouncers or the successful conman.</p>
              <p>so far i have only seen more shit coming outa from melbourne from sgforum ,local newspapers and radio news apart from it being rated as one of the liveable cities in the world.</p>
              <p>they must have rated it by the amount of beautiful strippers in one area alone.maybe i should go check out melbourne when i go there for a holiday.</p>

              <p>I'm thinking of migrating "back" to Melbourne too.  I'm in SG now, but I was transferred to Sydney 3 years ago to work for my company's regional HQ.  Was there for 2 years, but moved back due to some unforeseen circumstances.  </p>
              <p>While I was there, I had a chance to stay in Melbourne for abt 2 weeks in addition to the business trips that I take there every once in a while.  I really like Melbourne.. much more than Sydney.  It's a lot more "organized", i.e. the city planning was actually done right.  More importantly, I feel a lot less like the Asian outsider..... not in the office, but in general.</p>
              <p>I'm looking for suggestions on where the best suburb to live in Melbourne if anyone can help.  I've learned my lessons from Sydney where I lived far away from any SG food, and Asian community in general... hehehe... I'm not looking for a gazillion dollar homes next to the Yarra or anything like that. A simple townhouse, or just a small-medium sized home is fine. </p>
              <p>Any suggestion is much appreciated.</p>

              <p>BBKen, I reply to your thread on the same topic. I didn't know you are bringing your family.</p>
              <p>Those surburbs you mentioned are not suitable for Asian kids - they will feel very out of place there unless your kids are very independent.</p>
              <p>You are better off finding some surburbs with more Asians - where Asians cluster, there are always good primary schools since Asians place high priority on education. There are also different Asian surburbs - stick to the ones with Singapores/Malaysians/Hong Kongers and you will be alright.   </p>
              <p>Suggest you do research on the schools first, then decide the surburb to stay. The trade off is that most of them are far from the city ( Melb uni) so you will need to stay near a train station or drive.</p>

              <p>@honeymouse, I agree with you on the integration part into Australian society. In fact I find that Sporeans and Malaysians are the most cosmopolitan, i.e they easily adapt with Aussies unlike other Asians e.g mainland Chinese. This is partly due to the proficiently of English and the famliarity of Western cultures of Sporeans and Malaysians.</p>
              <p>However in the case of BBKen, he is bringing his child to study in primary school here.  My advice for him to send his child to a more 'Asian' school ( which  is usually near an surburb with populated by Asians) is based on the following:</p>
              <p>1. It will be a culture shock for the child coming from the Spore education system and jumping straight into the Australian system. Having Asian peers as classmates will help the assimilation.</p>
              <p>2. He can easily find good primary state schools  near Asian surburbs. He will have to stay in the school zone to qualify for entry into those schools.</p>
              <p>So it consideration for his child's education that I recommend that he stay in or near an Asian surburb. It does not mean that he should only mix with Asians. In fact I encourage everyone who comes to Australia to mix with the Aussies and enjoy their culture.</p>

              <p>If your son is going to study here... then it really depends on which school he goes to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once that is decided then decide on suburb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carlton is a good suburb next to the city however it is pricey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Preston is to the north..... asian community..... but I don't really like it. I think it should still be safe but it depends what you're comparing it to. I wouldn't choose Preston.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Northcote no idea....honeymouse any idea?</p>
