              <p>i'm not sure abt australian immigration law but i guess it should be pretty much the same as canada. if the child is given birth, he/she will most likely be given citizenship but that doesn't automatically give the parents status in the country.</p>
              <p>there was a family from chile last year that got sent back to their country because their social visa expired and the child that was born in canada remain in canada with a relative of the family. parents are still not allowed into the country.</p>
              <p>even if your friend does decide to give birth in aus, when is she going ? most airlines doesn't allow a woman who is 2 months before labour to fly.. i might be wrong.</p>

              <p>Thanks Ben1406 for your reply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She is a filipino. She is flying in 2 weeks time and she said EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. She is working in Singapore and her husband is a Singaporean. Both of them are not Australia PRs. EDD will be end of May 08. They will fly there and stay until birthing.</p>
              <p>I am not so sure if her girl(she is having a baby girl) will be granted aus citizenship. Like you said, I don't think the parents will become Aus citizenship too.</p>
              <p>As for the child cannot be fly back with parents, does it means my friend might have problem bringing her girl back to Singapore? I know her intention is to make sure her daughter can be a aussie because she intends to move there in 2012.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please Advice.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>medical fees may be an issue too.  i don't know about australia but here in canada?  medical fees for non-pr/citizen is very high.</p>
              <p>i mean this "tactic" has been used and i am sure the government has smarten up and cover their loop holes.</p>
              <p>i suggest that your friend check the australian web site.  if they have the same rules like we have here in canada?  your friend and her hubby will have to be leave the country after visa expiration.  the baby will then be left alone in australia.  are they willing to part with the baby?</p>

              <p>IF they are heading back to Sg, where they will remain until 2012, then in order for the baby to remain in Sg, it should have Sg citizenship.</p>
              <p>You can always revoke it when the time comes to assume Aussie PR. In the meantime, ask your friend to inquire about getting the baby Aussie PR or citizenship? Sidenote: In the US, as long as the baby is born here, it'll have US citizenship, no matter what the status of the parents are. So maybe the Aussies have the same practise? JMHO. As long as the child has a Singaporean father, it can assume Sg citizenship.</p>
              <p>Oh and if she intends to fly, if she's at least 7 months along, she won't be able to fly. As long as she's pregnant, she has to have a doctor's note to clear the airlines of any potential lawsuits.</p>

              <p>Here is the Official stance: The child is an Australian citizen only if the conditions below are met.</p>
              <p>At birth – only if the parent is a permanent resident for the purposes of the Act; or has a Centrelink certificate; or held a<br>special purpose visa (SPV) on the basis of the parent’s status as airline crew member or airline positioning crew member and they were ordinarily resident in Australia.</p>
              <p><br>10th birthday – only if the child was ordinarily resident in Australia since their birth in Australia</p>
              <p>This is taken from the The Citizenship Act 1948. So if you friend is going back to Singapore, the child will be considered Singaporean. Since they also do not have PR's in Austraila, it will be a no go for Australian Citizenship.</p>
              <p>Have to say to that I agree with Fatum and Jetta, TS should tell her friend have more pride.</p>

              <p>Like Ben said, she git her PR in Aus? What is the point because if she does not stay in Aus a total of 3 out of the next 5 years, she won't be eligible to be considered a PR.</p>

              <p>Thanks a lot for all inputs. I just text my friend, to double check "if everything is fine?" At the same time, mentioned about the citizenship thingy.</p>
              <p>My friend told me she got her PR status few months back. Got doctor's clearance to fly already. So her baby girl will be a Aus PR <strong>for sure</strong>. *rolling eyes*</p>

              <p>Story of my ah sir &amp; grandchild.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His son was working in UK Britain for a short stint, send my our lovely Singapore Navy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The wife was preggers and felt that she would be too lonely in Singapore, so she flew over to UK Britain to keep her hub company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the son finished his work and has to returned to Sg, the wife was certified not able to fly due to her weak body and might lose the baby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So son stayed, took a couple of months of no pay leave and struggled to maintain wife and himself in expensive UK.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ah sir had to periodically TT over $$$$ (3k per 2 weeks) to keep his son and daughter in law comfy in UK.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Baby was finally born, registered as a Singapore citizen thru the Singapore consulate and the happy family flew home to sg at the tune of $40k including medical &amp; hospital stays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pregnant females are irrationals.  I put all paws up to agree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Give birth in sg cost maybe 10k max.</p>

              <p>Since both mum and dad are not Australian Citizenship/PR, the baby will not automatically become a citizen.  If the kid stays here, then he/she will be "naturalised" when he/she turns 10.</p>
              <p>I believe you can still get Singaporean citizenship even the baby is born overseas since at least one parent is a Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Hope it helps.</p>
