              <p>the replies are correct! no point u go all the way there just to get a aussie degree.aussie degree be it monash or RMIT are not really recognised as compared to a degree from england whichis 2 years even with all the crap.did u enquire about the cost of a degree from england? the way the aussies are giving u treatment you might as well be studying in the usa.</p>
              <p>how can australian which has a backward engineeering compare their education to the US of A.</p>
              <p>Most people who graduate from engineering from australia end up wearing jeans when they come back to werk in singapore.some never passed or were just given a just passed degree.</p>
              <p>i suggest if u want an australian degree then its only meant for future immigration purpose as the australian government  loook at a correspondence course as worthless.but maybe you could get a job in singapore after a correspondence degree.</p>
              <p>the people in australia sellin their degree courses are just simply tryin to get the richest student....they dun want a guy who stops payin their course fee after 2 years...if possible they would even like people to pay their fees for at least 5 years.its an industry here.....for a country that is backward in technology.</p>
              <p>i have personally seen for myself that secondary 2 equivalent australians in oz not being able to spell and make a correct english sentence .all full of grammer and  spelling mistakes.and they were throwing their books all over the strees at the start of the school holidays.</p>
              <p>you might as well go buy yer degree and do drugs in australia if u intend to go study there.</p>
              <p>most of the education system  would be classed as inferior if u take a closer look. but they do have good salemen and gals dressed in bikinis and suits.</p>
              <p>u ask them engineers about engineering ...they would buy them off the internet.....</p>
              <p>u ask them about broadband they will tell you it will be completed by 2018.</p>
              <p>u ask them anything.....they will want all your money.</p>
              <p>i suggest to take a correspondence course or go for another strategy using usa or europe.</p>
