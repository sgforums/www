              <p>The best places to get a really cheap 2nd hand car, not minding the model, or quality are the university student notice boards, students stick their adverts up telling you whats for sale, give them a call. Things range from room rentals, furniture, and of course cars.</p>
              <p>Usually, the graduating students are really desperate to get rid of their rides, and its a good chance to bargain real low with them. One of my friend couldn't get rid of his old ford laser and had to abandon it by the side of the road, his tires needed replacement anyway.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The normal prices I seen for such advertised cars range from AUD$300 to AUD$5000.</p>
              <p>When I was there sometime in 2003, the price of 1 litre of coca cola costs more than 1 litre of petrol. I don't think as of 2009, the price of cola is still as expensive.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Perhaps you can try googling for pump prices there. Don't bother with diesel there, its really more expensive than petrol.</p>
              <p>Their toyota corollas there are not made in Japan, they are made locally for the local market and come in the hatchback with a slightly more powerful engine (they need it coz of their terrain). So higher capacity engines usually equate to higher fuel consumption. Manual drives are still quite popular there, and a whole lot cheaper too.</p>

              <p>Cars dont have $300 to $5000 in aus. That type of car, they sell you either w/o door or w/o engine, or either that, sibei jia sai- run for 1 day and can throw away.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> (maybe 4-5k one have, but at least 10+years old and 200k+ on the odometer) .</p>
              <p>My sch friend bought his 2nd hand mazda mx5 , about 8 years old, costs already $11k +.</p>
              <p>Aiyoh. dont say, im driving currently the jeep cherokee 6 years old one already costs $15k to buy.</p>
              <p>But ya. you're right about the toyota corolla part. Btw, TS, if you want to buy a car,</p>
              <p>very important---</p>
              <p>have good contacts, cause if you do, you 101% wont get scammed. Careful, for example, here in syd there's loads of cars for sale at Parrammatta, but 40% of them are small business conmen.</p>
              <p>Buy from established companies, eg. Australian Fleet Car Sales, ya. they do quality check and all sorts. So 100% worth your $$ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
