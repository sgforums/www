Heat of this magnitude is a physical force; it literally drains your energy and makes you short of breath from doing even simple things outdoors. The short walk across the parking lot after work to get to the bus stop became an endurance test as the sun-baked blacktop had absorbed the heat of the day and was literally too hot to walk on. A number of parked motorcycles had fallen over as their kickstands had sunk into the softened asphalt surface.<br><br>The bus was blessedly air-conditioned, but when I got into my car at the park-&amp;-ride lot (after opening both doors and letting it 'cool down'), I reached for the seat belt and promptly burned the tip of my finger on the metal tongue of the belt buckle.<br><br>And the irony of this whole situation? Seven months from now, when it's -15Â°F outside with 20" of snow on the ground, I'll be wishing for the weather we're having now.</div>
