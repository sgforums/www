              <p>which part of Canada are you at ? Nova Scotia ? Guess it's very different from your part of canada. My mp here is Chinese, Olivia Chow.. Jack Layton's wife. So you don't really need to be 'white' here. </p>

              <p>they are proud of being multicultural.. i don't really feel any racism here though. you get it from the bums once in a while, but then again they are bums so who really cares what they have to say. </p>
              <p>hmmm... yeah, toronto does have a huge non white's here. but 80% of my friends are white and 20% latin americans and asians. </p>
