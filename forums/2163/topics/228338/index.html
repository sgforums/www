            <div class='col-md body'>So, what do you guys think, especially as Singaporeans, current or former, living overseas for extended period of time ? ...<br><br>but first, take a look at something that I've rooted out on the internet<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">From qbuster<br>I have visited Singapore many times. Most Singaporeans are okay, particularly those that have accepted their lot in life.<br><br>However, there is a small minority that has a superior-inferior complex. These are the ones with some education and have a very western-minded view.<br><br>While they may speak decent English, it is not good enough to be global English that everyone understands (think ABC news network English).<br><br>So they speak a very clipped form of English that is neither EU nor North American, nor is it Chinglish. Your famous SPG-Isabella X/Tan is a good example for that accent.<br><br>We have a few Singaporeans here ... and they do not assimilate well. Not "white/black" enough to be North American, or Chinese enough to be accepted by those from Hong Kong, they tend to be drawn towards the Chinese mainlanders and Taiwanese (since Mandarin is a common denominator).<br><br>They can't seem to get along with the Malaysians nor Indonesians.<br><br>They feel superior to their fellow international students and are often bad-mouthing them, yet they feel they cannot measure up (i.e. inferior) to the native North Americans (whites, blacks, asians).<br><br>My most humourous experience was a student picking up black-speak and trying to dress like they are from the slums of inner cities.<br><br>It is actually hard to teach these kids. They are very bright with facts and numbers, but when asked to articulate their own ideas they struggle.<br><br>They also feel the need to show up the classmates, and are not very good team players. There is this inherent competitiveness, which is pervasive.<br><br>When I have met up with a few of my former students in my trips through Asia, they are very hospitable and always welcomed me to a huge meal and banquet.<br><br>Surprisingly they never fail to tell me how much the meals are or how important they are in society - I do have a few former students who are policy advisors to the government.<br><br>And they like to reminisce yet they aren't much to reminisce about as they often do not participate in campus life and if they did, they would with their own types.<br><br>Love it when they asked about their "favourite" football team, when in fact they care less about football.<br><br>Most talk to me as though Singapore is a regional and global powerhouse, when in reality it is not very significant.<br><br>I love our few discusssions on Singapore's policies on Iraq and Afghanistan and how they are affecting Bush's popularity.<br><br>As far as I know, there are no Singaporean soldiers serving in either of these countries.<br>So, yeah ... I tend to agree. Singaporeans do have a poorly placed sense of importance that seemed innate to the Singaporean psyche.<br>Sorry for the blunt assessment.</span><br><br>it came from here<br><a href="http://www.littlespeck.com/informed/2006/CInformed-061228.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlespeck.com/informed/2006/CInformed-061228.htm</a><br><br>Perhaps some of us are  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ing now as we read through the list, certainly, there are some points that I know I'm personally guilty of ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> )<br><br>but do you agree that Singaporeans do not assimilate well ? that we're caught between the east and west, a vague sense of malaise that only Singaporeans, uniquely sandwiched between the orient and the occident, can experience ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do tend to talk Singapore up quite a bit to friends here, mainly because I'm proud of my country.<br><br>Its quite a love-hate relationship, lots to love but lots to hate. All in all, its the place where I want to bring up my kids in the future, and thats saying a lot.<br><br>All Singapore needs is a tad more civil liberties and perhaps lighten up on the deterrent style penalties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the international student friends of mine are actually malaysians because I myself don't really fancy mixing with some (not all)  of the Singaporean international students. They come across as arrogant and boorish know-it-alls but when you take them down , they turn defensive.<br><br>I remember when I was in University . We had a Singaporean majority in a scholarship ceremony . So the chancellor said wow that's alot of Singaporeans , and you could hear the crowd go yay . Then he said coming in second majority are the Malaysians , now I noticed some of the Singaporean students started BOOing. How stupid is that? I clapped for the malaysians and I sat with my malaysian friends.<br><br>The Malaysian High Commission consul had actually sent a representative proudly to watch their Malaysian students collect the prizes. So it gets more embarassing. My malaysian friend brought me to meet the representative - very nice malay lady. She and I chatted . She had the grace not to point out the booing. And then she asked me what I thought of Malaysia which I replied all neighbours and that I am happy that Malaysians are doing well too. This lady actually said she was cheering for Singapore as well and mentioned that it was good Singaporeans are also doing well overseas. I nearly sunk into embarassment at the thought of what the some of those Singaporean morons did when they booed those malaysian students who worked hard and did well in the same examinations they did.<br><br>As for more examples of the ugly Singaporean students ( I have encountered more of those), they are arrogant and regularly boast that their parents are rich and they can afford alot of things etc etc. But really ...if your daddy and mommy is so rich ...ask them to send you to Oxford , Cambridge or Harvard . And why the hell are you renting if you are so rich?<br><br>The good Singaporean students are usually the quiet polite ones who make an effort to get to know people outside their circle or the very enthusiatic ones who like to know everyone . They do talk about Singapore proudly but in a very neutral manner which is TOTALLY UNLIKE some UGLY ONES  who goes like " Singapore is no.1 in this and that and we are MORE efficient than the aussies" . Why come to Australia if you think it sucks? Well that doesn't earn much favours in broadening experiences and friendship circles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was at an international seminar last year and I thought to myself...hey today sure got Singaporeans one lah.....so I went on a lookout and soon enough sported a few potential kiasu people lining up for food.As I got near I noticed one lady who looked like a eurasian speaking fluent Singlish,I went over and ask her if she was from Singapore , she said no I am achilly from Costa Rica???So i scratched my head and ask her how come she sounded like a Singaporean and she was quick to  introduce me to two chinese ladies sitting on the same table with her.According to her they have been friends for like 30 years and apparently one of them is her English Teacher.......HANCHUR LAH LIKE THAT!!!</div>

I'd been there before and was usually the only Asian customer, so it surprised me that evening to see a table occupied by about 10 other Asians. They were several tables from us, but there was no mistaking the <span style="font-style: italic;">lah</span>s and <span style="font-style: italic;">alamak</span>s that peppered their conversations. They were also, unfortunately, talking rather loudly and seemingly annoying the other diners around them.<br><br>I managed to flag the group down as they were leaving; it turned out they were Singaporean and Malaysian students studying at the U of M, and they had decided to venture a little farther out from campus that evening to find food.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is there a need to be Â“hereÂ” or Â“thereÂ”? In terms of our accent? The main point of language is communication.<br><br>Some people naturally speak more precise English while others do not; itÂ’s a matter of the individualÂ’s skill level in that particular language.<br><br>Of course unless the speaker is actively trying to imitate another accent (and I donÂ’t mean your humorous Crocodile Hunter impersonations) just because he thinks it superior to the way he would normally speakÂ… that is another issue altogether.<br><br>But some locals really speak rather good English, even beyond the usual standards our garÂ’men recommends. Is it neither here nor there for them?<br></div>
