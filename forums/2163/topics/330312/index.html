              <p>i was at work.  heard it on my desk radio.  the whole office sprung to action.  hook up television to keep track 'cos we are the risk/security backbone of the bank.  the bank's new york offices were evacuated.  i tink the bank also lost some employees. :(</p>
              <p>it sent chills to my spine watching it on television.  i remembered it to be a sad and shocking day.</p>

              <p>Still remember that morning. I was in the office when my friend Dave phoned and told me to log on to CNN.com, which was carrying live reports of what (then) appeared to be an accident involving an airliner colliding with one of the Twin Towers in NYC.</p>
              <p>I had the CNN.com window up on my monitor and was doing work in another window, when CNN flashed news that another airliner had collided with the other tower.</p>
              <p>At the precise instant, I recall mentally switching gears from, "That's a pretty horrible accident. I wonder what caused it?" to, "How is this country going to respond to this obvious act of terrorism and how will it change the way we go about our daily lives?"</p>
              <p>Our department heads obviously deemed the events important enough to open up a couple of conference halls and broadcast the live feed from CNN on the projectors located therein. Very little work got done that day as everyone had jammed into both halls to watch the live reports coming from New York. It was very quiet and somber in there... up until the first tower collapsed, when a few obviously distressed female colleagues broke down.</p>
              <p>After news of the other two crashes came through, we were ordered to evacuate the building immediately, as it was feared that the terrorists might have been targetting government facilities throughout the US.</p>

              <p>I was at my fren's house...at first I thot it was some action packed movie on till her dad clarified. It was horrifying. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect something like that to happen. It was almost surreal watching it on screen.</p>
              <p>It really changes many things...and travel to the US was no longer a breeze. The whole world seems to take on a paranoid nature, and greatly affects how things operates. The world economy went into shambles and chaos over nite. Many companies went bellyunder with many job losses. Up to today, people still get paranoid, and are highly suspicious 'cos of Terrorism. Travelling also take on a whole new dimension.</p>
              <p>It had an especially great impact on my life, as I had to give up my plans to go NYU for further studies in 2002, and head downunder to give my parents peace of mind. Unforseen event not of my own making actually disrupt my original plans.</p>
              <p>Haiz...better to live to the fullest day by day than to plan too far ahead as some things are not within our control.</p>
