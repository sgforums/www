            <div class='col-md body'>18th June 2007 8:15AM<br><br>A HUGE manhunt is under way for a gunman who killed one person and injured two others in the heart of Melbourne's CBD this morning.<br><br>Much of the centre of Melbourne is in lockdown as police search for the gunman who fled on foot east of the city after the shooting.<br><br>Eyewitnesses saw the man drag a woman out of a cab on the corner of Flinders Lane and William Stree in the city just after 8am.<br><br>Two bystanders apparently came to help the woman, only for the aggressor to pull a handgun and shoot all three.<br><br>A police spokesman said a male had died in the shooting and a man and a woman had been taken to hospital.<br><br>Ambulance officers have placed a sheet over a body at the scene of the shooting, near the corner of Flinders Lane and William Street.<br><br>Cherie Harding, a worker in the Rialto building opposite the shooting scene, said several of her colleagues heard up to four shots.<br><br>Ms Harding said she saw ambulances at the scene and stretchers being used to transport patients.<br><br>Â“There are a few people here who heard them (gunshots),Â” she said.<br><br>Police said they were now searching for the gunman in Melbourne's city district.<br><br>Ambulance spokesman James Howe earlier told of paramedics trying to resuscitate a critically injured victim at the scene.<br><br>He believed the gunshot wounds were in the victims' upper bodies.<br><br>Melbourne's city centre was in shutdown as police searched the area for the gunman, with offices sealed off and people kept away from nearby workplaces.<br><br>Witness Carly, who is in the Rialto building on Collins Street, said people in her building had been told not to move.<br><br>Â“We've just been told that none of our people who are waiting downstairs to come upstairs can come up,Â” Carly told 3AW.<br><br>Â“They've blocked off all the access to the floors in our building because they're still looking for the shooter.<br><br>Â“We're not allowed to go anywhere and no-one is allowed to come up into the building.Â”<br><br>Carly said she had heard six or seven shots about 8.15am, coming from the corner of Flinders Lane and William Street.<br><br>Police Inspector Glenn Weir asked people in the area not to panic.<br><br>Â“There is an extensive search underway to try and find the offender at the moment,Â” Insp Weir said.<br>Â“There are numerous police attending to the search within the vicinity of the incident and there is a large cordon and containment operation underway as we speak.<br><br>Â“We are just asking the public not to panic and assist police if requested and if you have no business being in the vicinity of Flinders Lane and William Street please keep out of the area.Â”<br><br>The gunman is described as wearing black jeans and a denim jacket, with short light brown hair.<br><br>Inspector Weir said it appeared the gunman knew the victims.<br><br>Â“There is no suggestion this is a random act - it appears there was a relation with the gunman and the victims, so we are asking people not to panic,Â” he told ABC radio.<br><br>Malcolm Bates, a witness, said before the shooting broke out the gunman grabbed a woman by the neck as she sat in a taxi, and tried to get into the vehicle.<br><br>Â“The lady got away and he turned and shot three people basically point blank,Â” Mr Bates said. Â“I was right across the road.Â”<br><br>He told ABC radio the gunman then ran down Flinders Lane toward the city centre.<br><br>He said the whole scenario took no longer than Â“the wink of an eyeÂ”.<br><br>Police wearing bullet-proof vests were scouring the area, and police helicopters hovered overhead.<br><br>Insp Weir said the last confirmed sighting of the gunman was east of the shooting scene, on Flinders Lane.<br><br>The Victoria Police homicide squad this morning took over the investigation as the police Special Operations Group joined the search for the gunman.<br><br>Police have blocked off a number of city streets until further notice and have also begun evacuating some buildings.<br><br>Police said a handgun had been found a short time ago at a Melbourne city construction site near where the three people were shot.<br><br>The gun was found at the construction site on the corner of Flinders and Queens streets they said, but had yet to confirm if it was the one used in the shooting spree.<br><br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au" rel="nofollow">www.theaustralian.news.com.au</a><br><br><img src="http://img264.imageshack.us/img264/6366/melbournejh2.jpg"><br><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/1600/melbqt2.jpg"><br><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/3792/melbbbly4.jpg"><br><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/7251/cbdgu0.jpg"><br><img src="http://img264.imageshack.us/img264/5668/cbd2cu5.jpg"><br><img src="http://img177.imageshack.us/img177/7626/cbd3jw3.jpg"></div>

Once we get an opportunity to speak to them, we'll then do that," Det-Insp Clark said.<br><br>Police did not know whether the two women knew each other or whether one was the gunman's girlfriend.<br><br>Interstate authorities have been given information about the suspect, who was last seen on Flinders Lane.<br><br>"It's the No.1 investigation at the moment and we've got plenty of resources dedicated to finding this man," Det-Insp Clark said.<br><br>Video Video: Gunman on the loose | Weapon found<br>Feedback Nearby?: Send us pictures or tips by email or MMS<br>Related story More information can be found at the Herald Sun website<br><br>Distraught family<br><br>The distressed family of the shot woman expressed their horror and sorrow for the other victims.<br><br>The woman's mother, who rushed to her daughter's hospital bedside, offered her sympathy to the dead man's family.<br><br>"My daughter is up there fighting for her life," she said.<br><br>"I just feel so sorry for the other family."<br><br>The family would not comment on the woman's links to the gunman.  It is believed she had recently moved to Sydney and worked in tourism.<br><br>A News.com.au reader said the gun was found later at a nearby contruction site.  Police were "fairly confident" it was the weapon used.  A worker at the site said a coat was also found there.<br><br>Lockdown<br><br>City buildings was in virtual lockdown this morning with thousands of people being told to remain where they were while the manhunt was on.<br><br>The landmark Rialto Tower was briefly evacuated amid suspicion the gunman had fled inside, sparking a floor-by-floor search.<br><br>Rialto managing director John Apps said the search came up empty-handed and that the gunman was then rumoured to have been seen running down St Kilda Road.<br><br>The crime scene near Flinders Lane remained closed, but Flinders Street had reopened to traffic.<br><br>The gunman was described as being about 30, about 183cm tall, wearing black jeans, a denim jacket, and with short brown hair.<br><br>Some Telstra staff who work in the Rialto Building had been been offered counselling.<br><br>The nearby AXA building was also locked down and customers and staff at a nearby cafe were told to remain inside.<br><br><a href="http://www.news.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.com.au/</a></blockquote>I have to say..

            <div class='col-md body'>Didn't figure it would take long.  Shortly before the shooting, the female victim and the shooter had an altercation at a King Street bar.  According to the news reports, the victim was a stripper from Spearmint Rhino who had started putting on a show for her boss at the bar.  The shooter came along and grabbed her by the hair, and at that point a patron at the bar stepped in and broke it up.<br><br>It looks like the victim knew the shooter, so I expect that either she or someone who knew her fingered Hudson as the shooter.</div>
