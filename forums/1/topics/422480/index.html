              <br> By Dr. Mahathir Mohamad
              <br> <a href="http://chedet.co.cc/chedetblog/2011/02/hard-truths.html#more">http://chedet.co.cc/chedetblog/2011/02/hard-truths.html#more</a> <br> <br> 1. A new book on Lee Kuan Yew has appeared with the title "Lee Kuan Yew -
               Hard Truths To Keep Singapore Going." It is a collection of 16 
              interviews with Lee Kuan Yew by Singapore journalists.
              <br> <br> 2. What is the hard truth which will keep Singapore going? It is, 
              according to Lee Kuan Yew the vulnerability of Singapore. Without saying
               so in so many words, Lee Kuan Yew believes that the island's neighbours
               would war against it if it has no military capacity to defend itself. 
              The United Nations would not help Singapore in the event of such an 
              attack.
              <br> <br> 3. Even America would not defend Singapore despite the Security 
              Framework Agreement. America went to the aid of Kuwait because of oil, 
              but Singapore's problem is water.
              <br> <br> 4. Kuan Yew blamed me for stopping sand supply from Malaysia. I was 
              quoted as saying, "Even at their present size they are trouble, you let 
              them grow some more they will be more trouble." Rhetorically he then 
              asked the journalist present, "We've got friendly neighbours? Grow up."
              <br> <br> 5. I may have said that, though I cannot remember. But is that an indication that we intend to invade Singapore?
              <br> <br> 6. Singapore had been taking large quantities of sand from the sea-bed 
              east of Johore and also in the Strait of Malacca. As a result the coast 
              has been eroded in places. Taking one billion cubic meters more of sand 
              in these seas would cause serious erosion.
              <br> <br> 7. In addition the fish-breeding ground will be destroyed and this will affect Malaysian fishermen.
              <br> <br> 8. As to the trouble caused by Singapore; in the 22 years of my 
              premiership I was not able to resolve any of the problems with 
              Singapore. These are the Central Provident Fund, the railway land, the 
              operation of the Malayan Railway in Singapore and the water price. 
              Additionally the reclamation in the Tebrau Strait was affecting the deep
               water shipping lane for ships to and from Pasir Gudang Port. The only 
              problem solved was the unilateral decision of Malaysia to give up the 
              naval base in Woodlands after Singapore kept raising the lease payments.
               Malaysia did not ask for even a single cent as compensation for the 
              facilities it has installed at the base.
              <br> <br> 9. As for Singapore's military planes flying over Malaysian air space, 
              Malaysia had the right to disallow such flights for many reasons. 
              Singapore would certainly not like to have Malaysian military planes 
              flying over Singapore.
              <br> <br> 10. When we wanted to build a bridge to replace the congested causeway Singapore was not forthcoming.
              <br> <br> 11. All this while Malaysia had been supplying raw water at 3 sen per 
              thousand gallons. Even to Melaka, Johore is paid 30 cent per thousand 
              gallons. Negotiations to raised the price of water failed repeatedly. 
              The first agreement will end this year. We will continue to supply raw 
              water at 3 sen per thousand gallons until 2061 under the second 
              agreement.
              <br> <br> 12. Yes, we buy treated water at a subsidised price of 50 cent per 
              thousand gallons. We are willing to forego the supply and treat our 
              water ourselves.
              <br> <br> 13. It was Malaysia which suggested that both countries submit claims to
               Pulau Batu Puteh to the international court. The court decided that the
               rock belongs to Singapore even though it is nearer Malaysia. But two 
              other rocks further from Malaysia but nearer Singapore were awarded to 
              Malaysia.
              <br> <br> 14. Malaysia's willingness to go to the International Court is hardly in
               keeping with a country which harbours the intention to invade 
              Singapore.
              <br> <br> 15. Kuan Yew cried when Singapore left Malaysia. We thought that it was 
              the separation which had saddened him. But now he tells us that it was 
              because "I left behind tens of thousands of people who had joined our 
              rallies". Kuan Yew might remember that despite the huge crowds attending
               the PAP rallies, the party won only one seat.
              <br> <br> 16. The PAP supporters immediately formed the DAP to fight the cause 
              promoted by the PAP after the separation. The DAP is alive and well 
              today in Malaysia. In fact it now rules Penang state.
              <br> <br> 17. But the rump UMNO left in Singapore could not survive in the hostile
               atmosphere created by the PAP Government. For that matter no other 
              political party has been allowed to function properly in Singapore.
              <br> <br> 18. Kuan Yew claims all these opposition people are duds and must not be
               allowed to rule Singapore or even to be in the opposition. This is a 
              frank admission that he determines who should represent the people of 
              Singapore, not the people themselves as in a democracy. If there is any 
              more proof needed that Singapore is a totalitarian state, this admission
               by Kuan Yew confirms it.
              <br> <br> 19. Now Kuan Yew is urging Muslims not to hold to the teachings of Islam
               too strictly. Most Muslims are in breach in their practice of Islam. 
              But it is not for others to tell the Muslims that they should renege on 
              their practice of Islam to facilitate integration in Singapore. In 
              Malaysia we try to live with our differences. Our integration is not 
              perfect because we are sensitive to the sensitivities of our people. We 
              do not ask people to forsake their religious practices so we can 
              integrate.
              <br> <br> 20. Malaysia has no intention to attack Singapore even if it is 
              militarily weak. Even in my time there was no such intention. In fact we
               wanted to continue to supply Singapore with water, but at a fair price.
               I don't think my successors harbour any intention to do harm to 
              Singapore. <strong>These are the hard truths.</strong> Competition in trade and shipping 
              does not mean war, or a threat of war.
              <br> <br> 21. But one thing is certain: if Singapore treats Malaysia and Indonesia
               as its enemies then you must expect them to prepare for their defence. 
              Even if it may not lead to war there will be tension and there will be 
              an arms race. And much money will be wasted.
              <br> <br> 22. It would be far better if Mr Lee, the Minister Mentor of Singapore 
              stop thinking about being vulnerable and that its neighbours harbour the
               intention to invade it. As with Pulau Batu Puteh, Sipadan and Ligitan 
              our preference is for negotiation, arbitration or an international 
              court's decision.
              <br> <br> 23. Remember Malaysia gave up Singapore peacefully. We did not try to use force to keep Singapore or to suppress its people.</span></p>
