But anyway, that's beside the point....<br><br>In such instances such you've mentioned where BOTH parties or MORE are involved in a FLAMING in thread... The topic can be closed as it no longer serve its purpose...<br><br>But in other instances where other forumites still wanna carry on with a proper discussion... And have the thread ruined by  some nicks just created for the sake of FLAMING.... MEANINGLESS flaming... You get the picture...?<br><br>However, I do agree with you that the responsibility of that function might be too high for moderators to bear... Perhaps we should have it in the hands of the administrator instead and have the moderators lodge the complain if it's really necessary then...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
