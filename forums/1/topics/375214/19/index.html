              <p>David and I are different people, but your comments are funny in the sense that it's ironic and contradicting. I'll leave it to yourself to figure out why. If you don't, it doesn't matter as well. At least not to me.</p>
              <p>I'm not treating this like customer service, at least not they way you guys seem to think so. Don't get misled by earlier comments by others. I don't even treat customer service like that in the first place, unlike others who think that customer service deserves to get abused and abusing them is their right.</p>
              <p>Neither do I expect comments here to really change anything, be it by me or yourself or anyone else. More than anything, it has more to do with other factors. Never did I say I expect things to change or this forum would crash if certain changes were not made, so while I see you feel strongly about your words and what you said to me, sadly it's just not applicable.</p>
