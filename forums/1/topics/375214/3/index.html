              <p>No, actually, I don't know that the owner is seldom around. And by email, I actually meant use the contact form from this page: http://sgforums.com/info</p>
              <p>I assume that when I submit a query through a contact us form that it will be read. It's ridiculous to expect me to know that SGForums ignores contact us messages.</p>
              <p>And you are an idiot for your last sentence, that there's no point in me making a fuss when I send something to the wrong place. How the fuck did I send my message to the wrong place? The form I used CLEARLY said "contact us". Even if SGForums has a warped definition of "contact us", the least they could do was reply telling me where I should actually be contacting them.</p>

              <p>Make a police report against who, exactly? The people who contacted my phone contacted me in thinking that I posted the ad. They're not in the wrong.

              <p>Lastly, the fact that multiple people here are confused about who I should have contacted proves that this is not my fault, but the lack of organization on SGForums' part.</p>
              <p>Again, how am I supposed to know that I shouldn't contact SGForums through their "contact us" form?! Once again shows how retarded this place is.</p>

              <p>How about getting a life and stop being such a bitch? Seriously, I can imagine you, an overweight person, sitting at home trolling SGForums for hours on end looking for someone to attack.</p>
              <p>And FYI, I'm only rude to those who are rude to me first. You, for example, are a fucking asshole, and I'm only saying that because you were rude to me first. Therefore, I'm not going to bother being nice to you, since you are too screwed up in the brain to realize how unbelievably retarded you are.</p>

              <p><br> actually u can contact the police, let them know that your number
              is been abused and see what they can do about it.</p>
              <p>maybe the police will contact SG forums and ask thme to remove
              the thread or maybe they will investigate and track the prankster ?
              it is a cyber crime if i am not wrong.</p>

              <p>Look da-vid, if you can take a look at which sub-forum that
              particular thread is posted under, give a pm to any of the
              appointed moderator for that particular sub-forum. They have the
              power to at least edit the thread to cross out your
              number.</p>
              <p>You obviously let your anger get to your head. If you haven't
              been an ass right from the beginning of this thread, you would have
              at least got a decent answer sooner than this. Now that you've
              created such a big hoo-haa here, I'm not sure if your number will
              ever get removed even if you now already know what to do. You
              should have given your actions a thought before you made your
              move.</p>
              <p>Good luck on getting your number removed, ass.</p>

              <p>Firstly, did you not read anything that I said? I sent two messages to whoever the hell answers the contact us form, if anyone even answers it at all. I didn't get a single reply. Nothing.</p>
              <p>Secondly, is this really how SGForums is run? Ignore inappropriate or rule-breaking posts if they affect people who you don't like? If my number isn't removed due to the fact that you think I'm an ass, then once again my suspicions of this forum sucking are confirmed.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for the info. Now I know I can pretend to be anyone and post their number asking for sex on this forum, meanwhile the person whose number I posted receives tons of offers for sex and is struggling to learn how the fuck to receive a reply from someone.</p>
              <p>You are clearly missing the point of my thread; I am fucking frustrated because your contact form doesn't work. If I'm unable to contact the administrators of a website, I assume, reasonably, that it's a stupid website. And this site is fucking stupid. When I'm attempting to deal with a stupid website or person, I'm going to be an ass.</p>
              <p>Lastly, everyone here for some mysterious reason assumes that I understand exactly how this forum works. If a forum doesn't even allow you to contact the admin(s) with ease, no, I won't understand how it works. I don't even know who the admins are. There is no way to report a post, there is no moderator list, and the contact form doesn't work. How can you expect me to not a) be frustrated and b) think this forum is fucking retarded?</p>
