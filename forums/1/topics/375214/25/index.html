              <p><br> Huh??? You see no reason for him to lie. So that's why
              you would believe him wholeheartedly and fervently, defending
              his actions and displaying your displeasure of the admin just
              because of his case?</p>
              <p>You tell me if that's logical.</p>

              <p>About being logical, like I said I think there's a misunderstanding somewhere.</p>
              <p>I am not about to go into specific examples, maybe not now. But what I feel towards admin is not based on this thread alone or anything within just this year alone.</p>
              <p>She has so often been so readily to close certain threads when she doesn't want people to continue to discussing in that thread, or when queries are answered, yet at other times she deliberately leaves a thread open so that people in support of her or her agenda can continue to lamblast a specific individual in the thread. Whether or not that person is in the right or wrong, whether the person's complaints are valid or not, whether it helps anyone if the thread is kept open.</p>
