              <p>It is amazing how threads and topics about friends of the admin
                      can get deleted or shifted quickly, yet such things involving
                      personal info does not get acted upon promptly even after
                      notification via open forum.</p>
              <p>And the admin can even add sarcastic remarks and all.</p>
              <p>This double standard is amazing and shows how arbitary the role
                      of admin is within sgforums.</p>
              <p>It does not matter whether you like him or not, whether the
                      person is your friend or not, but policy should be applied
                      uniformly and not so based on a whim or your fancies.</p>
              
              <p>And usually once objective is met, complaint is settled or
                      whatever, thread is closed as "case closed" or whatever. Yet in
                      this case topic is allowed to continue.</p>
              <p>Oversight? Or just arbitary judgement to allow people to
                      lamblast somebody who has said negative things about sgforums, be
                      it he is right or wrong about his comments.</p>

              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A 19 year old polytechnic student with the name of âChristineâ has posted messages on ST707 and sgaids to âsellâ herself in order to raise money for her motherâs medical treatment.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Christine" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/christine100.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="127"></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>[Christine's photo posted on ST707 portal]</em></p>
              <p>She claimed that her mother was terminally ill and in need of âa lot of moneyâ.</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><em>[The advertisement is posted on 22 August 2009 on ST 701]</em></p>
              <p>Describing herself as a âcute local Singapore poly girlâ offering âfreelance serviceâ, Christine wrote that she is also looking for a âsugardaddyâ below the age of 40 to support her family while providing âfreelance serviceâ in the meantime.</p>
              <p>The news was reported widely in the Straits Times, local Chinese tabloids as well as the Malaysian papers The Star and Sin Chew Daily.</p>
              <p>âFreelance serviceâ is an euphemism for self-prostitution which is technically not illegal in Singapore. However, open advertising for sexual services and touting for customers in the public are against the law.</p>
              <p>Christine had uploaded three scantily-clad pictures of herself on her blog. In the pictures, Christine was half-naked, wearing only a lacy black G-string.</p>
              <p>There was a separate link to more âracy picturesâ on the blog where one had to pay to view the site. Her handphone number is also provided. However, it is not known if the advertisement is a hoax or a spam linked to a pornographic site.</p>
              <p>Due to the current economic crisis, there is a rising number of young Singapore girls including undergraduates who have to resort to âfreelance servicesâ to earn a living to support their studies or families.
