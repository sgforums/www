Yes, I am being an ass in this thread. As I explained before, it's because this forum has frustrated the hell out of me.

              <p>Firstly, did you not read anything that I said? I sent two messages to whoever the hell answers the contact us form, if anyone even answers it at all. I didn't get a single reply. Nothing.</p>
              <p>Secondly, is this really how SGForums is run? Ignore inappropriate or rule-breaking posts if they affect people who you don't like? If my number isn't removed due to the fact that you think I'm an ass, then once again my suspicions of this forum sucking are confirmed.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for the info. Now I know I can pretend to be anyone and post their number asking for sex on this forum, meanwhile the person whose number I posted receives tons of offers for sex and is struggling to learn how the fuck to receive a reply from someone.</p>
              <p>You are clearly missing the point of my thread; I am fucking frustrated because your contact form doesn't work. If I'm unable to contact the administrators of a website, I assume, reasonably, that it's a stupid website. And this site is fucking stupid. When I'm attempting to deal with a stupid website or person, I'm going to be an ass.</p>
              <p>Lastly, everyone here for some mysterious reason assumes that I understand exactly how this forum works. If a forum doesn't even allow you to contact the admin(s) with ease, no, I won't understand how it works. I don't even know who the admins are. There is no way to report a post, there is no moderator list, and the contact form doesn't work. How can you expect me to not a) be frustrated and b) think this forum is fucking retarded?</p>

              <p>Yes, you are fustrated that your pleas sent through the "Contact Us" form was somehow neglected. And yes, you clearly don't know how sgForums work. But have you given it a thought that when you didn't receive a reply through that form, you should have opened a thread and <em>ask</em> for further help from everyone, and <strong>not</strong> make a point and then scold everyone here?</p>
              <p>We users don't know you wrote your pleas through the "Contact Us" form, and when you didn't get an answer, you start a thread to scold every single one of us here? You start down this path with this kind of attitude, you should know that now your problem will further not be resolved easily.</p>

              <p>Yes, you are fustrated that your pleas sent through

              clearly don't know how sgForums work. But have you given it a
              thought that when you didn't receive a reply through that
              form, you should have opened a thread and <em>ask</em> for further
              help from everyone, and <strong>not</strong> make a point and
              then scold everyone here?</p>
              <p>We users don't know you wrote your pleas through the "Contact
              Us" form, and when you didn't get an answer, you start a thread to
              scold every single one of us here? You start down this path with
              this kind of attitude, you should know that now your
              problem will further not be resolved easily.</p>

              <p>People could have properly replied offering to help, too, but instead said "fuck you." Besides the swearing, I honestly don't find my original post to be abnormally rude for someone who is frustrated.</p>

              <p>One more thing; I can't seem to search for members using the
              search tool. There are three options: posts, topics, and forums. No
              "members" though.</p>
