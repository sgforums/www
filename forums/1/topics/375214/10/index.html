              <p>If SGForums removed my post within a reasonable time, I would not think this place sucks. Likewise, if a person calls me once and I tell them that I didn't make the post, they will stop calling.

              <p>There are two definitions of "objective." In the post you
              quoted, I was using it to mean "purpose" or "goal." A moderator
