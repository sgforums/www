ANYWAY, ANY MODERATOR WHO CAN GIVE ME EXPLANATION cuz i don't feel like replying to bunch of shallow idiots.<br><br>Bye.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DRAGG..you are just a cheap populist tryin' to earn some points <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , u had your five minutes. So be happy. Now leave this board if this' bothering you so much.There's so many other placeees where you can annoy and abuse.Why did u stuck on here?<br>Well I'm not desperate to post my picture on here, also I'm not interested in watchin' nor sharing pictures of some girlies or japanese funny (to me lookin' funny) models. I really don't have to look for girls online.I have gf, and I'm very happy with her.<br>I tested my profile, I posted picture of Jay Chou...funny that profile has been accepted after only 2 hrs, when changed pic to mine..was disapproved.<br>Reasons? Well or my face is so ugly that system is gettin' crazy and rejectin' me in convulsions, b) I'm too handsome and reactions are the same, B) my picture got secred code plugged in and spittin' at ppl from the computrer monitors... These 3 reasons..doesn't seem right to me..so what's the point??<br>..hmm really, system must have nobel prize since its so intelligent to remove porn from this site...p.eni.s and v.a.gina detector boundled..lol. I don't get it why you all so much into kick one's ass instead of tryin' to find explanation.<br>Funny, cuz "thanks" to this fuss I found many friends here...and now seriously don't see the point of hangin' here any longer.<br>Guys wake up we have 21st century, and such "harmles" text like by dragg about ang mohs discriminating asians..sigh..u sure u want me to continue? I never ever discriminated anyone. Rised between many races, and cultures. And I still hate hypocrisy...<br>I'm not the first time in asia I'd spend here bigger part of my life..but here..it was the worst experience I ever had. Congrats.</div>
