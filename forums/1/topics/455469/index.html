              <p class="MsoNormal">We have much to think about and to consider in transferring
              our locations. It might be from work or residence. How it will affect your time
              or lifestyle where you’re<span>  </span>to be
              now.<span>  </span>Being with your family and friends,
              transport needs to work or home will bring new set up and a brand new
              adjustments.<span>  </span>But to start with, is how
              to transfer your personal and home belongings.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">First of all, we should take the consideration of the
              location. What type of building are you staying for the moment or the place to
              transfer, whether it is an HDB, Condominium or landed house. From there we can
              we imagine what we have to consider starting with the timing of move in or out.
              There are some condo building which has a vertical limit at the parking areas
              and we need to check what size of the vehicle we need to send and/or how things
              to be brought out of the building like using the lift or by stairs. Timing is
              really important especially with the condominium policies that they mostly
              allow moving in and out from their building within office hours that the
              tenants has usually got conflicts due to their job schedules. Most importantly
              is you need to secure a permit from the building management especially to the
              condominiums for move in or out or else, no moving will happen.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Secondly, we should see and assess our things or items to be
              transported. Of course, we need to take or choose the way we can transport<span>  </span>things in a less stress or the easiest way to
              transfer. After packing all your items, transporting and unpacking and
              arranging all your items is really tiring besides from adjusting to the new
              environment and to new house mates. Thus, in this case, registered movers have
              thought of how to help you in moving according to your needs. Provision of
              packers, movers and and even with the packing items and materials (like carton
              boxes, wraps, tapes. etc.)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Thirdly, is the Budget. This where we make varieties of
              inquiries to differentiate and seek the mover where our budget will fit in and
              and provide our considerations and needs. There are movers that provides per
              trip or per per hour rate, some are with distances and others may count the
              value per items. Different strokes for different folks will work for different
              kinds of movers.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Whatever you may call it like removal, moving, relocation,
              house transfer, etc.,<span>  </span>we want to give
              our best to give the most convenient and easy moving.<span>  </span><a href="http://mover101.blogspot.com/p/van-lorry-removal-service.html">Mover_101 is your best choice to move to a new start!!!</a></p>
