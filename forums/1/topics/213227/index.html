            <div class='col-md body'>Our group is embarking on a project to enhance the current solutions and measures that the Singapore government has come up with in ensuring the success of the anti-smoking campaign and coming up with complementary measures in which Singapore government can adapt to further improve and maintain the anti-smoking campaign.<br>Hence, we have come up with a few new ideas to further develop on old practices:<br><br>1) Provision of subsidies and medisave<br>We can provide subsidies or allow the use of medisave for medical screenings on an annual basis for smokers who have quit smoking. The presence of subsidies and medisave scheme can be used to settle medical bills and thereby keeping medical services affordable for all, thereby encouraging smokers to quit smoking<br><br>2) Reduction of cigarettes<br>We can request for lesser cigarettes per pack by reducing it from its original 20 to 10 or its original 10 to 5 pieces per pack but the original price of the cigarette pack remains. this makes cigarettes more expensive to purchase and hence appears unattractive to the buyer.<br><br>3) Printings of warnings on smoking<br>There can be printing of some health problems related to smoking such as obesity, heart diseases and even lung cancer on the back of purchase receipts from supermarkets, bus tickets, receipts from EZ-link top-up machines or even on plastic carriers. This increases public awareness on the dangers of smoking.<br><br>4) Anti-smoking month<br>"Anti-Smoking MonthÂ” can be introduced in which the prices of cigarettes during this month are raised. In addition, smokers will be given free Nicotine Replacement Therapy products (i.e. gums, patches and inhalers) for every pack of cigarettes purchased to discourage smoking as they act as substitutes for cigarettes. Companies are also encouraged to provide such therapeutic products to employees who smoke to encourage them to quit smoking.<br><br>5) Smoke detectors<br>Modified smoke detectors can be introduced in areas under ban such as bus interchanges to detect smokers. The detector works in a way that when there is smoke the detector will trigger. Once triggered, it sends a signal to the control station, which then authorizes the arrest of the offender, or administration of a fine. However, the smoker might have moved elsewhere, thus eluding the officers. To overcome this, we can install an alarm in the area which will be triggered off when the modified smoke detector is activated. With this alarm, the public can help by arresting the smoker. Monetary rewards and plaques can also be awarded to the public who help to arrest smokers. This will discourage smokers from smoking in non-smoking areas such as bus stops and hawker centers.<br><br>We would like to hear your comments on these ideas that we have introduced. Additional suggestions would be most valued. Thank you.<br></div>
