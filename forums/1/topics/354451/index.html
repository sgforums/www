            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, im 19, and i recieved news that i had been kicked out of my poly this morning. This is only my year 1 and i didn't treasure my chance in this poly until too late. I would give anything to be accepted back again, but i guess its hopeless now. Im scared of army and the working world, and my future seems bleak. Im wondering if it is possible to continue my studies at another poly maybe after my army or something. Also, i heard that those who were kicked out by thier poly will not be able to enter another poly or change course anymore. I cant face my mother, cos our family is not well to do, and she is paying for my poly fees with her CPF. I feel so guilty towards her now. Im thinking of saving up during my army and getting a bank loan after that to maybe start a business or something. Please advice me if you can. Thanks!</p></div>

              <p>BTW what you did then kana kick out? Do anything? Hmm first your princple will talk talk with you. see see your parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your parents come in to talk good words for you and think they will allow condition allowing you to continue your study. If you no improve in attitude and study. Think end of the term you will End of poly life lor. Then your other option is find other poly to accept you in.</p>

              <p>Is not a parents meeting session la. You failed nia. the most you retake the course again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then your mentor will talk to you for this. Don't panick at the moment, important is talk to mentor see what he can do for you. As long as there is no official letter that you are expel from school, your still got chance to work out something la. Worst come to worst as your parents to talk to principle for mercy lor.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>woah thanks for the comforting words. im training to get pass my coming drums auditons, and im doing backup vocals currently. But i dont think these things could possibly carry me and feed me all my life. cos it dosen't pays money. im trying to think out of the rules set by this life now, that there are things that i can do even if i dont have qualifications and all that.</p></div>

              <p>Haiz... gone la you.. 19 years old still dont know how to think.. you think poly really easy meh.. dont have to study for the exams... you know how to do.. means what? How much of the paper can you do?? if you think you did enough to pass... and that the paper is easy.. other peopl will also find the paper easy.. and if they work harder than you.. they will get better grades.. so in the end your finding of the paper being easy and you know how to do will still cause you to have a C or D grade because your classmates found the paper easier than you found it and did more than you do... Couple this to the fact that you miss CAs and tests.. then no wonder your grades so jialat...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Attendance also important.. haizx... you really destroyed ya mother's hope and everything... If i am your parents, I would be damn disappointed. They pinned their hopes on you and yet you flunked and get kicked out in the first year. Imagine, how would you feel if its ya son that gets kick out?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now you regret also no use... too much damage done... You should have wised up earlier, and why are you still poly year 1 at 19 years old?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now what you have to do is talk to your school.. tell them you really regretted, talk to the counsellors they will help you. Get ya mother to know of the fact and have her to go with you to school to explain and beg for a second chance. Let them see that you really will change and you are really regretting all that has happen. They might just let ya go back to school. Wise up and stop playing a fool now, you are turning adult soon and yet you still cannot think properly..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If cannot, you got ITE, apply for those NITEC or wat courses and work hard from there... If not you go army... go army and sign on.. Sign your live to SAF. This is the best option for you. Since you have already wasted so much of your life and you cannot go far with an o level cert.. signing on with SAF seems to be the best way out for you. Sign as officer (which i doubt you can) or as a specialist, then you slowly work your way up to warrant officer which can take up to 10 years.... but then you would be earning big bucks, given the fact that you have screwed up 19 years of life. This way, you can still let your mother be proud of you and let her live happily ever after.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go sign on.... you got no other choice...</p>

              <p>This should be in AA and not here...</p>
              <p>With just an O levels qualification, i don't really think he can even sign on army and even if he can, the promotion rates are super slow and is not worth it at all.</p>
              <p>Try to appeal to your poly and beg for another chance. Whether or not they allow, at least you tried. If not then you'll have to try to apply to another poly but you will have to clear NS first since you are 20 next year and you cannot defer NS once you reach 20.</p>
              <p>Do not worry so much about NS. If you have queries, just drop by the SAF forums and we'll answer your queries. Just do some reading on your own first cos alot of common information has already been posted there and sometimes we do get sick of repeating the answers to frequently ask questions.</p>
              <p>You already screwed up so now all you can do is try to remedy it. Being afraid and not trying will not help you at all. Starting a business is not easy and unless you really have confidence that you can do it and more importantly do it well, getting a bank loan might bring u more trouble in future if your business fails. Its best to try again and at least get a diploma.</p>
