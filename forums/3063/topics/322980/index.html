              <p>With Euro 2008 closing in fast, clubs are already busy planning their shopping lists for the new season.</p>
              <p>Speculation has been rife since the season ended over who will end up
              where after the tournament, with some big names possibly moving for big
              money once everything in Austria &amp; Switzerland is sealed. Here's a
              breakdown of some of the major transfer talk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ARSENAL</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=359&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/359.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann (Stuttgart) will return to
              Germany after making his final appearance at the Emirates. Mathieu
              Flamini (AC Milan) has already agreed to move to Italy, while Alexander
              Hleb (Inter) is mulling over a transfer after growing tired of London
              life. Gilberto Silva (Juventus) and English defender Justin Hoyte
              (Everton) could also move on.</p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Samir Nasri (Marseille) looks set to join in a
              £12million deal, with talk of the 'next Zidane' ready to sign after the
              Euros. Kolo's brother Yaya Toure (Barcelona) could also fill the gap in
              midfield left by Flamini, while David Villa (Valencia) has expressed
              his interest in working under Arsene Wenger. Alberto Aquilani (AS Roma)
              and Hatem Ben Arfa (Lyon) have also been linked, alongside Mouhamadou
              Dabo (St Etienne). 17-year-old starlet Aaron Ramsey (Cardiff) could
              agree a deal but may choose Man Utd.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>ASTON VILLA</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=362&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/362.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> The talk of the summer has been around captain Gareth
              Barry's imminent departure to Liverpool, but that should be about it
              for Martin O'Neill's men. Striker Luke Moore (West Brom) has already
              moved for £3.5million, while Olof Mellberg (Juventus) has been out of
              the door for some time. Shaun Maloney (Celtic) has been linked with a
              move, but his agent says he's going nowhere.</p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong>Scott Carson (Liverpool) would cost around £10million,
              but is surely keen to arrive at the club where he spent all of last
              season on loan. American Brad Guzan (Chivas) could be an able, and
              cheaper, replacement. Steven Sidwell (Chelsea) could take a pay cut to
              play regular football again, while Peter Crouch (Liverpool) may be
              tagged onto the end of Barry's transfer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>BLACKBURN</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=365&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/365.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Roque Santa Cruz (Man City) could follow Mark Hughes
              out of the club, while David Bentley (Liverpool) is another looking
              like he should be playing in Europe. Morten Gamst Pedersen (Tottenham
              Hotspur) may put his bad form behind him if anyone is willing to take a
              chance and Jason Roberts (Derby) looks set to drop to the Championship
              in order to get some regular games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Dependent on who the club bring in as manager, Rovers
              have been linked with Albert Riera (Espanyol) to freshen up the squad.
              Michael Kightly (Wolves) would be a good addition if Bentley decides to
              leave, while Rovers may also consider a bid for Nicky Shorey (Reading)
              and Jonathan Greening (West Brom).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>BOLTON </strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=358&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/358.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Ivan Campo, Stelios Giannakopoulos and Andranik
              Teymourian have all been released and Jussi Jaaskelainen (Newcastle)
              may follow. El-Hadji Diouf (West Ham) has already claimed that he'll be
              on his way to a bigger club, while captain Kevin Nolan (Everton)
              continues to be linked with a move. Tal Ben-Haim (Chelsea) could return
              to his former employers, after failing to make the grade in West London.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> With money to spend, Zoltan Gera (WBA) would give
              Bolton some much needed creativity. Paul Robinson (Spurs) would be a
              good buy in his bid to get back into the England fold and there could
              be some lower profiles in the form of Scott Dann (Coventry) or Owain
              Fon Williams (Crewe). Miguel Veloso (Sporting) has also been
              ludicrously linked and may turn down Man Utd and Arsenal to go the
              Reebok, but don't hold your breath.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>CHELSEA </strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=363&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/363.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Didier Drogba (Inter) is almost sure to follow Jose
              Mourinho to Italy, although less assured is the future of Frank Lampard
              (Inter) who may also fancy a trip abroad. A summer clear-out looks set
              to rid the club of the likes of Shaun Wright-Phillips (Man City), Wayne
              Bridge (Newcastle), Steven Sidwell (Aston Villa), Andriy Shevchenko (AC
              Milan) and Tal Ben-Haim (Bolton).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Right-back Bosingwa (Porto) has signed on already and
              could find himself next to some others stars this summer. Robinho's
              (Real Madrid) future is unclear, while one of Samuel Eto'o (Barcelona),
              Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Inter Milan) or David Villa (Valencia) may be
              bought to fill the gap left by Drogba. £70million is ready to be spent,
              so expect a number of high-profile new arrivals at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>EVERTON </strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=368&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/368.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Striker Andrew Johnson (West Ham) has been linked with
              a move away from the club despite signing a new deal; Lee Carsley
              (Birmingham) has been allowed to go and Mikel Arteta (Atletico) could
              also return to Spain after failing to get into the squad for Euro 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong>Steven Pienaar (Dortmund) has signed on the dotted
              line. Out-of-favour right-back Justin Hoyte (Arsenal) has been a target
              for a while and should be allowed to move on. Up front, Moyes could go
              for a double swoop for Jo (CSKA) and Dudu Cearense (CSKA) to liven up
              their attack, while Michael Bradley (Heerenveen) or Kim Kallstrom
              (Lyon) could tighten up the midfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>FULHAM</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=370&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/370.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> USA striker Brian McBride (Chicago Fire) has chosen to
              return to his homeland, Steven Davis (Rangers) made a big impression
              north of the border and could choose to stay at Ibrox if a deal can be
              agreed. Carlos Bocanegra has been let go and David Healy (Hull) is
              another who may decide his future lies elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Mark Schwarzer (Boro) is the first signing. Roy
              Hodgson has the chance to make his mark on the squad after keeping them
              in the top flight. Expect a number of his former players, and
              ex-Cottager Steve Finnan (Liverpool) to head to the club over the
              summer. Finland defender Sami Hyypia (Liverpool) could arrive and
              Daniel Cousin's (Rangers) stalled move could also be resurrected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>HULL CITY</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=306&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/306.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Michael Bridges (Oldham) should be the first out of
              the door after a loan spell to Sydney FC. With a new striker they can
              afford to lose him, but the club will be fighting tooth and nail to
              keep highly rated goalkeeper Boaz Myhill (Aston Villa) who is
              attracting attention from other Premier League sides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Promotion brings a lot of money, but only expect Hull
              to sign a few players this summer in their bid to stay up. David Healy
              (Fulham) and David Nugent (Portsmouth) would provide the goals,
              alongside Dean Windass of course, and if they can find £5million then
              Man Utd's Frazier Campbell is theirs for good. Italy's faded star
              Christian Vieri (Fiorentina) could also give the fans something to
              cheer about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>LIVERPOOL</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=364&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/364.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Peter Crouch (Portsmouth) may get bored of life in
              Fernando Torres' shadow and leave, with Scott Carson (Aston Villa) and
              John Arne-Riise (Newcastle) also tired of playing second-fiddle. The
              sale of Xabi Alonso (Juventus) could balance the books slightly, while
              Harry Kewell (New York) and Steve Finnan (Fulham) may also make way for
              new arrivals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Gareth Barry (Aston Villa) is high on Rafa's wanted
              list but would cost more than the £10million already offered. Swiss
              defender Philipp Degen (Dortmund) arrives on a free, while one of
              Florent Malouda (Chelsea), David Bentley (Blackburn), Albert Rieira
              (Espanyol) or Ricardo Quaresma (Porto) should be recruited to sure up
              the Reds' attacking options on the wing. Left-back Andrea Dossena
              (Udinese) could also be another defensive buy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>MAN CITY</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=382&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/382.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> The entire squad? Who knows, or could even guess? Dr
              Thaksin has his plans for the squad, and they may not feature star
              defender Richard Dunne (Spurs), Michael Johnson (Arsenal) or Steven
              Ireland (Sunderland). Losing Micah Richards (Chelsea) or Joe Hart
              (Spurs) could spell the end of City's chances of success, but their
              replacements could be interesting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Ronaldinho (Barcelona) heads the list and City might
              move heaven and earth to get him. Jo (CSKA) may be another Brazilian to
              land in Manchester, while Diego (Werder Bremen) and Edu (Valencia)
              complete the South American list. Andrey Arshavin (Zenit) would be a
              good buy, as would Aiden McGeady (Celtic); but City really need more
              defensive strength and are struggling to attract big-name players in
              that department.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p><strong>MAN UTD</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=360&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/360.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Very few departures are needed from a side who won the
              double in 2007/08, but a side of United's stature will always be linked
              with moves. Ronaldo (Real Madrid) fills papers, but more likely to
              leave Old Trafford are Jonny Evans (Sunderland), Louis Saha (West Ham)
              and Mikael Silvestre (Bordeaux) who didn't get much of a chance last
              season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> The versatile Miguel Veloso (Sporting) continues to
              be linked, but United really only need a central striker. Any one of
              Dimitar Berbatov (Spurs), Klass-Jan Huntelaar (Ajax), Karim Benzema
              (Lyon) or Luis Fabiano (Sevilla) would represent good business for the
              club, while if they could persuade defender Micah Richards (Man City)
              to swap blue for red, their chances of another title would increase
              rapidly. 17-year-old starlet Aaron Ramsey (Cardiff) could agree a deal
              and is certainly one for the future.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Fabio Rochemback (Sporting Lisbon) will leave, along
              with Mark Schwarzer (Fulham) and George Boateng (Celtic). Boro will do
              well to keep hold of Stewart Downing (Liverpool) and should also look
              to tie David Wheater (Spurs) down to a new long-term deal, to ward off
              any interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Having spent £12million on record-signing Alves last
              year, Boro may reign in the spending this summer. Links with Jimmy
              Bullard (Fulham), Steven Sidwell (Chelsea) and Marcos Senna
              (Villarreal) persist while Paul Robinson (Spurs) and Wayne Hennessey
              (Wolves) could prove the answer to their goalkeeping conundrum.</p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Emre (Fenerbahce) has agreed a deal to return to
              Turkey, while Stephen Carr (West Ham) is another to have lost his place
              and may search elsewhere for regular football. Charles N'Zogbia
              (Arsenal) has said he wants to leave and could be let go, along with
              Mark Viduka (Portsmouth) and Alan Smith (Rangers).</p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Turkish playmaker Arda Turan (Galatasary) looks set
              to join the Keegan revolution for around £4million, although Carlos
              Cuellar (Rangers) has turned down the chance to play in the Premier
              League. Swiss starlet Eren Derdiyok (FC Basel) could arrive if he plays
              well at Euro 2008, but more likely arrivals are in defence: either
              Michael Dawson (Tottenham) or Richard Dunne (Man City) would do well at
              St James's.</p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Niko Kranjcar (Arsenal) has pedged he'll stay for a
              little longer, but Sol Campbell (Villarreal) seems keen on a move
              abroad. More abroad than Portsmouth anyway. David Nugent (Ipswich) has
              not impressed and should move on, while Pedro Mendes (Aston Villa)
              might also seek employment elsewhere.</p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong>Harry is on a high after their FA Cup win and will
              almost certainly buy British this summer. Five arrivals are expected,
              in no particular order, he'd love them to be Richard Dunne (Man City),
              Shaun Wright-Phillips (Chelsea), Peter Crouch (Liverpool), Ishmael
              Miller (West Brom) and Jimmy Bullard (Fulham). If that fails, maybe
              Younes Kaboul (Tottenham) or John Mensah will be recruited instead.</p>

              <p><strong>STOKE CITY</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=336&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/i/clubhouse/badges/336.gif" alt="" align="right"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Tony Pulis has released the injured Dominic Matteo,
              goalkeeper Russell Hoult, and reserve duo Marlon Broomes and Robert
              Garrett. Striker Mamady Sidibe (Cardiff) played a key role in their
              promotion but could be on his way, although there should be few others
              leaving the club.</p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Premier League newboys Stoke could sign Carlo Nash
              (Wigan), Chris Riggott (Middlesbrough) and Marlon Harewood (Aston
              Villa) who have good experience of the top flight. The likes of
              Ibrahima Sonko (Reading), Lee McCulloch (Rangers) and David Nugent
              (Portsmouth) are the types of player Stoke could do with to stay up,
              but will they be tempted by the prospect of a relegation scrap?</p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> The sale of Michael Chopra (Cardiff City) could bring
              in some transfer funds, while Roy Keane may also look to get Andy Cole
              (Burnley) and Dwight Yorke (Sydney) off his wage bill. Liam Miller
              (Toronto) has failed to impress and may also be on the way, while
              interest in star striker Kenwyne Jones (Liverpool) has died down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong>Stephen Hunt (Reading) is first on the list after a
              £5million bid was tabled last year. More ex-Man Utd or Irish
              internationals could come in the form of Richard Dunne (Man City),
              Jonny Evans (Man United) or Stephen Ireland (Man City). Quinton Fortune
              (Western Province United) may link up again with Keane and the Black
              Cats have more money in the bank to improve their squad.</p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Dimitar Berbatov (Man Utd) continues to be talked
              about, but defensive misfit Younes Kaboul (Portsmouth) is surely on his
              way. Paul Robinson (Bolton) will be replaced, alongside defenders
              Ricardo Rocha (Benfica) and Lee Young-Pyo (PSV). Michael Dawson
              (Newcastle) will not be enamoured by Juande Ramos' pursuit of other
              centre halves and could be another to move on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Ramos will be keen to make his mark and has already
              bought Croatian star Luka Modric (Dinamo Zagreb) for £16.5million and
              youngster John Bostock (Crystal Palace). Others on the Spaniard's list
              are Carlos Kameni (Espanyol), Samuel Eto'o (Barcelona) and Diego Capel
              (Sevilla). A likely arrival before Euro 2008 is Mexican youngster
              Giovani dos Santos (Barcelona) and, depending on their managerial
              situation, maybe even Richard Dunne (Man City).</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Ishmael Miller (Portsmouth) is attracting attention
              after some eye-catching displays in the FA Cup, while the veteran,
              free-scoring, Kevin Phillips (Stoke) may also be jettisoned now that
              the club are riding high in the top flight. Zoltan Gera (Aston Villa)
              carries a decent price tag, as does the hirsute Jonathan Greening
              (Rangers), but both are vital to the Baggies' chances of survival next
              season and shouldn't be cashed in.</p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> £3.5million on Luke Moore (Aston Villa) started the
              summer off well, and there will be a few more arrivals before the sun
              sets on the transfer market. Kim Do-Heon (Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma) and
              Roman Bednar (Hearts) have also signed, and there should be a new
              goalkeeper arriving to challenge Dean Kiely. Jesper Christiansen
              (Copenhagen) has been scouted.</p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> Anton Ferdinand (Spurs) looks to head the queue and
              has apparently been placed on the transfer list after a number of high
              profile controversies last season. The Hammers may also let Freddie
              Ljungberg go after offering him £3million to tear up his contract and
              will probably be forced to consider any bids upwards of £12million for
              their star striker Dean Ashton (Man Utd).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> With Reading's demise, the club are sure to bid for
              left-back Nicky Shorey. El-Hadji Diouf (Bolton) and Louis Saha (Man
              Utd) could do a similar job as Craig Bellamy, so the Hammers will
              probably turn their attentions to pacey winger Giles Barnes (Derby) and
              Michael Kightly (Wolves). A defender or two might come in handy too,
              step forward Richard Dunne (Man City) and Steven Taylor (Newcastle).</p>

              <p><strong>Outgoing:</strong> The Latics are due a reshuffle with Steve Bruce keen
              to make his mark on the squad. Keeping hold of Antonio Valencia
              (Liverpool) and Wilson Palacios (Man Utd) will be key, but the club may
              have a tougher time convincing Paul Scharner (Fulham) to stay. Dave
              Cotterill (Sheffield United) will, however, be let go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Incoming: </strong> Sokratis Papastathopoulos (AEK) could arrive to
              bolster the defence, while David Suazo (Inter) may choose the JJB over
              life on the bench in Milan. Of the lot, Oliver Kapo (Birmingham) and
              Fabrice Muamba seem to be a priority and they'll have an easier task
              after the Blues were relegated. Amr Zaki (Al-Zamalek) has already
              agreed a £4million deal.</p>
