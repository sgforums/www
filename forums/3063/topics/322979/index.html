              <p>Luiz Felipe Scolari completes his journey from Brazil to the Bridge this week.</p>
              <p>Officially, he starts work on July 1 though, with the appointment of a
              goalkeeping coach, the arrivals have already begun. They won't end
              there. For the former Portugal manager, the rewards are high, but so
              are the demands. 
              Here are 10 issues for Scolari to address, though at least one will take 11 months to achieve:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Change formation</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Avram Grant was unable to wean Chelsea away from Jose Mourinho's 4-3-3
              system, a formidable defensive construct that was built with Claude
              Makelele, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba in mind. It brought the best
              from all three, but it rarely delivered the football Roman Abramovich
              imagined. 
              With the futures of each of the trio Mourinho favoured in doubt, this
              could present the ideal time to reconfigure the team, based around
              Scolari's preferred personnel. A change of tactics, whether to 4-4-2 or
              4-2-3-1, may bring the different mindset Chelsea require.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Resolve the Ballack-Lampard situation</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reluctant as many are to acknowledge it, Frank Lampard is a modern
              great at Chelsea, combining phenomenal fitness with a remarkable goal
              return. Yet, despite his achievements, he appears disconcerted by being
              paired with similar players. 
              Michael Ballack, meanwhile, has demonstrated in Euro 2008 that he is
              among the most authoritative midfielders in Europe and capable of being
              just as prolific. 
              It is notable that both appear to display their finest form when the
              other is absent and, when they do play, Ballack can unselfishly adopt
              the more defensive role, but it negates some of his strengths to keep
              the German so far from goal. Mourinho's desire for a reunion with
              Lampard could allow Ballack the freedom to run the midfield and free up
              a place for a creator alongside the German and Michael Essien.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Deal with Drogba</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Few inflict damage quite like Didier Drogba. As Chelsea can testify
              after the Champions League final, however, Drogba can be destructive,
              but is quite capable of self-destructing. 
              The 30-goal forward of the 2006-7 season was unrivalled as an attacking
              menace, the brooding moaner last year exhausted Grant's patience. It is
              a question of attitude, not ability. Scolari must make a rapid decision
              if one of Mourinho's devotees will shape up, or whether he should be
              shipped out. But if Drogba departs, radical surgery is required to the
              attack</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sign a striker (or two)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take away Drogba, who may leave anyway, and Chelsea's attack compares
              unfavourably with those of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal.
              The self-pitying, ineffectual Nicolas Anelka jeopardised his future at
              Stamford Bridge in the Champions League final, just as the petulant
              Drogba did, while Andriy Shevchenko no longer merits preferential
              treatment and Claudio Pizarro is best forgotten. 
              Amid talk of Samuel Eto'o, Dimitar Berbatov and David Villa, there is a
              case for purchasing a partnership; Abramovich's dream of a high-scoring
              side is unlikely to be realised by Shevchenko and Pizarro.</p>
              <p><strong>Find a fantasy player (or two)</strong></p>
              <p>Since Damien Duff and Arjen Robben exited, only Joe Cole meets that
              description. Of the wingers who - given the physicality of the midfield
              - appeared the designated flair players, Shaun Wright-Phillips has
              flattered to deceive, Salomon Kalou is more of a striker and Florent
              Malouda has been utterly uninspired.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's players have commanded enviable salaries, but lacked the
              stardust sprinkled by Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas for their
              rivals. It explains the apparent interest in Kaka, Robinho, Lionel
              Messi, Andrei Arshavin, Franck Ribery and Deco because, whether in a
              more central role or on the flanks, more invention is required, and not
              just to satisfy the owner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Keep Carvalho</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>John Terry has the 'Mr Chelsea' image, but he isn't the best defender
              in blue. Ricardo Carvalho, quicker, smoother and capable of covering
              for his more vocal colleague, is. As Alex, another dominant defender
              who could benefit from an extra yard of pace, is effectively Terry's
              understudy, Chelsea can cope without their captain without too much
              disruption. 
              Carvalho's absences are altogether more problematic and his future is
              more uncertain. It is no coincidence that Chelsea didn't lose with him
              in the side until the Carling Cup final last season. Among the best
              defenders at Euro 2008, Carvalho's admiration for his former Portugal
              manager bodes well for Scolari.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dispense with the deadwood</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two seasons ago, Chelsea's squad was too small. Last year, it was
              bloated by the presence of players who weren't quite good enough.
              Resolving the futures of Steve Sidwell, Tal Ben Haim and Pizarro is
              hardly the top priority, but the manager would be better off with 22
              players who all enjoy his confidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Quieten the competing factions</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea is a unique club, and that is not meant as a compliment.
              Together with Abramovich, Scolari is the most important figure, yet his
              position is clouded by the presence of Peter Kenyon. And Bruce Buck.
              And Eugene Tenenbaum. And Frank Arnesen. And Piet de Visser. And Pini
              Zahivi. And a group of opinionated experienced players. All jostle for
              position; all can undermine the manager.</p>
              <p>Avram Grant often appeared at the mercy of the unaccountable advisors,
              vast numbers of powerbrokers and the idiosyncratic owner. None appear
              to accept blame for setbacks, but they presumably dispense it in the
              direction of the manager. Scolari - somehow - has to ensure as little
              is heard from them as possible, and that one, single, strong voice
              emanates from Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Impress the neutrals</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The brand of football Chelsea played for much of last season earned
              results, brought criticism and helped forge a siege mentality. No
              matter how often they insisted it was attractive, too few agreed for
              Grant's liking. A surfeit of money and a shortage of style meant that,
              for once, Manchester United attracted support from neutrals in the
              title race and the Champions League final. 
              For the global ambitions of Abramovich and Kenyon to be satisfied,
              Chelsea need to be a more entertaining product (and some, at least, are
              thinking in such businesslike vocabulary). Adding to their fanbase,
              particularly worldwide, requires fantasy football, not hard-fought 1-0
              wins.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Win the Champions League</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems as simple as that.</p>
