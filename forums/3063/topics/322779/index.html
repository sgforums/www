              <p>Robinho could be Luiz Felipe Scolari's next recruit after the Real
                      Madrid forward's agent claimed he had met Chelsea sporting director
                      Frank Arnesen to discuss a move to Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td>   </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Former Brazil coach Scolari made his first move as Chelsea manager on
                      Monday by signing Deco from Barcelona and could return to La Liga for
                      his second, according to Robinho's representative Vagner Ribeiro.
                      Ribeiro is determined to get the best move for the Real Madrid
                      winger and claims he is better than Manchester United star Cristiano
                      Ronaldo, who has been targeted by the Spanish champions.
                      'It's true that Chelsea are interested in signing Robinho,' Ribeiro told
                      Spanish sports daily <em>AS</em>.
                      'They have been after him for a while and there has been much more contact
                      since Scolari became the new Chelsea coach.
                      'I met with (Frank) Arnesen in London and he confirmed to me that Chelsea
                      wanted my player for next season.'
                      Ribeiro believes Real are undervaluing Robinho and not treating him as he well
                      as he deserves.
                      The Spanish league champions are reportedly keen to offload the player to free
                      up some cash to buy Ronaldo, but Ribeiro insists his client is as good as, if
                      not better than, the Portugal international.
                      'Neither Robinho nor I like the fact that Real Madrid can use him as part
                      exchange in their bid to sign Cristiano Ronaldo,' he continued.
                      'We don't like this attitude and we want Madrid to start valuing Robinho
                      because at the moment they're not.
                      'Robinho is as good a player as Cristiano Ronaldo or better. The difference is
                      that Cristiano Ronaldo reached the Champions League final and Robinho didn't.
                      'But if Robinho had won such a title he would be at the same level as
                      Cristiano.'
                      Robinho played an important role in Madrid's league success last season -
                      scoring 11 goals in 32 games - and enjoyed his best campaign since joining the
                      club in 2005.
                      Ribeiro claims the 24-year-old is not keen to leave the Bernabeu but that he
                      would seriously consider doing so if Madrid continue to undervalue him.
                      'Robinho's priority is to continue at Real Madrid,' he added. 'But he cannot
                      stay in a place in which they don't recognise his talent and at the moment Real
                      Madrid are not doing that and I'm not talking about money.
                      'I'm referring to the fact that they are undervaluing him in comparison to
                      Cristiano Ronaldo.'</p>

              <p>I'm so excited about Chelsea next year, best if Robinho can come!</p>
