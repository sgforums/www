              <p>Luiz Felipe Scolari insists that both Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba have a
              future with him at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The new Chelsea coach was quick to reject suggestions that Lampard would be
              sold to Inter Milan and that Ivory Coast striker Drogba was bound for their
              Serie A rivals AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Scolari was officially unveiled by Chelsea at Cobham's Hilton Hotel today and
              immediately warned the rest of Europe that his top players were staying put.
              Chelsea had earlier announced that they had rejected an approach for Lampard
              from Inter Milan and declared that he was not for sale.</p>
              <p>Scolari underlined their stance by claiming that Lampard had already told him
              that he wants to stay for more than the one remaining year of his current
              contract.
              'I met Frank Lampard yesterday and I spoke to him,' said Scolari. 'I like
              him too much as a player and as a person.
              'I asked him if he wanted to stay at Chelsea, not only for this season but for
              more time.</p>
              <p>'<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He told me after 15 minutes that he wants to stay and he wants to play for
              Chelsea for many years</strong></span>.
              'I am very happy because I think Chelsea needs Lampard and he likes Chelsea.
              Now it's a minimum of questions to solve it. I think Lampard is with us for more
              time than one year.
              '<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Drogba is part of my plans 100%. No, 200%. I like him. Last season or two
              years ago I voted him one of the best players in the world. I think two or three
              years ago I chose John Terry. Now they are with me. I am happy.</strong></span></p>
              <p>'I spoke to Drogba because he arrived in our (training) base. He has a little
              problem with his knee. I spoke to him about how many times he needs normal
              training (but) I saw him happy.'</p>
              <p>And while Terry's captaincy may be under threat at international level under
              Fabio Capello, as far as the new Chelsea coach is concerned, t<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>he defender will
              retain the armband at Stamford Bridge.
              'I like him as a captain, I like him as a player,' said Scolari. 'I like him
              as a leader. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Yesterday he came to my room and said 'I am John Terry'. I replied
              'I know you' and we spoke.
              'The captain is John Terry and second captain is Lampard. But we want more
              captains inside the team.'</p>
              <p>Although Scolari insisted that two of his top players were not for sale, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the
              Brazilian was not as forthcoming about any more new arrivals</strong></span>.
              'I don't know now how many changes I need because I need to watch training, I
              need to know the players,' he added: 'When you are on the outside you have one
              idea - when you are inside the group you need to know the group, the characters,
              the qualities.</p>
              <p>'After this it's possible to say how many changes I want or we need or don't
              need.'
              Scolari looked refreshed after the rigours of his unsuccessful Euro 2008
              campaign with Portugal and spoke in English for the majority of his first media
              conference.
              The man who once famously ruled himself out of the running to manage England
              says the opportunity to manage Chelsea was a challenge he could not resist.</p>
              <p>'It's a new challenge in my life,' added Scolari. 'It's a different
              challenge. I don't think in my life I have had one opportunity like Chelsea have
              given to me now.
              'When I accepted this invitation I was thinking about my life as a coach and I
              think it's the right time.'
              He spurned the England post due to concerns about the intense media pressure
              but now he is confident he can cope with all the added expectations of managing
              a club like Chelsea.</p>
              <p>'Look, the pressure from media is around the world,' he added. 'If you are
              the coach in Brazil - wow, you know what pressure is. I think I am prepared.
              It's the first time for me in England but I haven't had a problem with the media
              during my life. I don't think I have a problem with it.'
              The 59-year-old also declared himself unafraid of getting the sack if he should
              end his first year without a trophy.</p>
              <p>Former coach Avram Grant finished runner-up to Manchester United in both the
              domestic top flight and the Champions League and Scolari is realistic enough to
              know that delivering silverware is crucial.
              'I think all the coaches in the world need to win,' said Scolari.</p>
              <p>'One or
              two or three competitions. All coaches. I am now in one of the big clubs in the
              world and for sure I need to win a competition. If I don't win it's the same for
              any coach.
              'If it's possible and we try to play beautiful football. But sometimes if you
              want to win some games you don't play beautiful.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'Sure I want both - to win and play beautiful. Sometimes it's impossible.
              'I think we have to think and to value all the competitions we participate in.
              After that we try to follow our own way to try to win as much as we can. I'm not
              going to give a priority to any of the competitions. All of them will be
              important.'</strong></span></p>
