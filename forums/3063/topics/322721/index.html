              <p><span><span>Chelsea Football Club is delighted to confirm the signing of Deco from FC Barcelona.<br><br>The
              Portuguese midfielder becomes our first signing under Luiz Felipe
              Scolari since the Brazilian's appointment as manager on June 11.<br><br></span></span><span><span>Deco,
              who won the Champions League and UEFA Cup with FC Porto, spoke to
              Chelsea TV after officially signing and said: 'It is good for me to be
              here and first of all I am very happy to be here.'<br><br></span></span><span><span>The
              former Barcelona player has further Champions League success as one of
              his main ambitions with Chelsea and, after playing in Euro 2008
              alongside a strong Chelsea contingent, now feels the time was right to
              join his former national coach in west London.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'I
              am sure I have come at the right time to do great things and be able to
              help Chelsea go back to the way it was and come back to being the first
              one, not only in England but also to win the Champions League that has
              been their dream for so long,' said Deco.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'The
              Premier League is a great league and it is getting better and you can
              see that with the Champions League Final, where you had two English
              teams.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'It is great
              that we have so many great players here at Chelsea and it is great that
              there is the competition which is healthy for everybody and this just
              makes the team better.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'To have great players in any position of the club just enhances the club.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'I know it is a new challenge but I am looking forward to it. <br><br></span></span><span><span>'I
              know I need a little bit of time to adapt bit but I am sure I will
              adapt quite well and quite fast and do my best for the team.'<br><br></span></span><span><span>Deco's
              recent stint in Euro 2008, alongside fellow Blues such as Ricardo
              Carvalho, helped the World Cup semi-finalist decide to join Chelsea.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'I
              always speak with my team mates when we are together with the national
              team and they have always told me how great Chelsea is and how great it
              is to play for this team. <br><br></span></span><span><span>'But
              the interest for me came about before we were in the Euros, I said to
              them that's great for you and Chelsea must be a great place to work
              with and obviously now I am very happy to be here.'<br><br></span></span><span><span>Winning
              the Champions League with FC Porto is one of Deco's greatest
              achievements, but he feels that now is the time to gain further victory
              in Europe's elite competition with his new club.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'It was a great moment for me to win the Champions League and it was great for the team to win the Champions League.<br><br></span></span><span><span>'I
              know it is very important to Chelsea and I am sure it is going to be
              great for me to win the Champions League again with Chelsea,' added
              Deco.</span></span></p>
