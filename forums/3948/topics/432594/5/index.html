              <p>Yeh dude, very closely related. And well, amongst the chinese language, history and culture, these 3 categories, I'm strongly interested in the former two. Wonder what would have happened had I pursued it back then. Then again, some years later in 2004, read in ST that there are actually singaporeans who study this in China. There were features and interviews with them.</p>

              <p><br>Ok, I was looking for some information on the Austronesian languages today and happen to read something that relates the role of Archaeology and Linguistics closely. I quote here to show you:</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">(pg 740, Prehistoric Inferences From Subgrouping, Austronesian Languages)</span></em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The view, current from roughly 1965 to 1975, that Melanesia is the area of greatest linguistic diversity in Austronesian and that the Austronesian homeland therefore must have been in Melanesia has been shown to be inconsistent both with the comparative method of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>linguistics</strong></span> and with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>archaeological</strong></span> indications that Austronesian speakers entered the western Pacific from island Southeast Asia about 2000 BC. It has accordingly been abandoned by virtually all scholars.</p>
              <p>Both <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>linguistic</strong></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>archaeological</strong></span> evidence point to an initial dispersal of Austronesian languages from Taiwan several centuries after Neolithic settlers introduced grain agriculture, pottery making, and domesticated animals to the island from the adjacent mainland of China about 4000 BC. By perhaps 3500 BC, populations bearing a clear cultural resemblance to those in Taiwan had begun to appear in the northern Philippines, and within a millennium similar material traces appear throughout Indonesia. The linguistic evidence suggests a steady southward and eastward movement, with Austronesian speakers moving around the northern coast of New Guinea into the western Pacific about 2000 BC. From the region of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago settlers fanned out very rapidly, crossing the sea with highly seaworthy outrigger canoes. In Oceania the dispersal of Austronesian-speaking peoples is most closely associated <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>archaeologically</strong></span> with the distribution of Lapita pottery. Because the earliest Lapita sites in Fiji and western Polynesian are only three or four centuries younger than the earliest dated Lapita site in western Melanesia, the colonization of Melanesia as far as Fiji appears to have been accomplished within 15 or 20 generations. There is a puzzling thousand-year gap before the settlement of central and eastern Polynesia, with Hawaii being settled only within the past 1,500-1,700 years and New Zealand within roughly the past millennium.</p>
              <p>The settlement history of Micronesia is more complex: Palau and the Mariana Islands were settled by two migrations which were distinct from that associated with Lapita pottery. Most of the low coral atolls of the Caroline Islands were settled by 2000 BP, but some radiocarbon dates from the Marshall Islands suggest that Austronesian speakers may have reached the atolls of Micronesia not long after the settlement of Fiji and western Polynesia.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lin Wan Jing (1998) is a local educator from NUS (reflected in the article), later he moved on to NTU/NIE and since last year he seemed to have left for some other places.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In this article, he mentions about the intensifying differentiation of local Singapore Mandarin Chinese (<em>referred to as </em>SMC<em> below</em>) and how language users of SMC holds emotionally contrasting views towards SMC. He gives an overview of how to analyse the situation using an objective approach and provides detailed examples of SMC usage.</p>

                      Hom come to mind.</p>
              <p>The singaporean accented chinese doesn't sound very good either,
                      though I admit that's our way of life. Mediacorp personalities like
                      æŒ¯å®¹ and è°¢éŸµä»ª are those whom we can learn from. Not sounding too much
                      like the åŒ—äº¬ accent and still sgaporean. æ�Žå›½ç…Œï¼Œ his standard of
                      mandarin used is quite good but he carries a heavy ç¦�å»º accent. If
                      you look at variety shows from taiwan and china, one will realise
                      that their level of mandarin used is much higher. And I wonder why
                      Singapore, despite our modern education system has lagged behind?
                      This one, fcukpap will have a lot to say hahahaha.</p>
              <p>Oh not forgetting, as we all know.... éƒ­äº® is very good. Saw him
                      do an intro ad for "Tour with celebrities", I observed how he
                      introduced China. Words like å±±çŽ¯æ°´ç»• (a place of mountains and water),
                      ä½•ä¹�è€Œä¸�ä¸º ï¼ˆmeans why not?) struck me. There's always this touch of
                      finesse about his speech.</p>
              <p>The variety shows from taiwan and china, from the hosts to the
                      guests..... there will always be idioms peppered into their
                      conversations. It's natural for them.</p>

              <p>That was an intense read! My personal observation would say she's 90% accurate; quite a well researched piece of analysis. I would also think that there's no way our mandarin should be like Beijing's. We have too much influence from at least 6-7 languages (if we include dialects). And the difference can be telling when I speak to my China friends.</p>
              <p>Give you one example: For percentage, we say å…«ä»™çŽ‡ but for them, they say ç™¾åˆ†æ¯”ã€‚I think we can be flexible here. Can't expect to use China mandarin when conversing with local Singaporeans and while with China friends, we adapt their style.</p>
              <p>In a way, I would rather be practising my mandarin with them than with our fellow countrymen. The standard is higher and there's no mixture of rojak haha. There are many many words and idioms that I cannot use when speaking with fellow Sgporeans, my mum included; and she's chinese educated.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have saved these two articles for future reference. My only hope for Singapore mandarin is that the usage of English, Hokkien etc in Mandarin would be minimised as the years go by but I highly doubt so. I don't think the edcuators at MOE are doing anything about it, at least not on a macro scale.</p>

              <p><img src="http://pacling.anu.edu.au/covers/602.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="528"></p>
              <p>It again links the importance of Archaeology and Historical Linguistics to prove your point,  through the discovery of the Proto-Austronesian root words - *kuden, *SadiRi, *busuR, *panaq, *bubu, and *tulani / *tulaNi  matching with the current archaeological research that the "Lapita" people passed through New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago before spreading into the rest of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5.11.3.1  Historical linguistics and archaeology</strong></span></em></p>
              <p>    Linguistics and archaeology had little contact in the first half of the twentieth century, but since the 1970s many scholars in both disciplines have come to see the benefits of interdisciplinary cooperation. This is reflected in such collaborative volumes as the June, 1976 number of <em>World Archaeology</em>, devoted to the topic 'archaeology and linguistics', the influential and provocative book <em>Archaeology and language: the puzzle of Indo-European origins</em> (Renfrew 1987), the multi-volume proceedings of a 1994 conference on <em>Archaeology and Language</em> (eg. Blench and Spriggs 1997), the two-volume <em>Time depth in historical linguistics</em> hosted by the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge (Renfrew, McMahon and Trask 2000), and in <em>Hawaiki, Ancestral Polynesia</em> (Kirch and Green 2001), a book written by two of the most prominent Pacific archaeologists, but guided in its approach by the cultural riches of POLLEX, the Proto Polynesian lexicon initiated by Walsh and Biggs (1966) and expanded and refined continuously over the past 40 years. Not all archaeologists have shared this vision, and some have reacted almost with territorial defensiveness. Nonetheless it seems fair to say that a working relationship has arisen between historical linguists and archaeologists that is likely to continue into the future to the benefit of both disciplines.<br>    Given the material with which archaeologists normally work, it is natural that the culture historical contributions of linguistics that would be of greatest interest to scholars in this field are those relating to material culture. The following are a few examples that serve to illustrate how linguistic evidence may corroborate, complement or contradict the archaeological record:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Pottery</em></span></p>
              <p>    Pottery is one of the mainstays of Neolithic archaeology for obvious reasons: it is often abundant, and is durable under highly variable soil conditions. PAN *kuden 'clay cooking pot' can be reconstructed on the basis of cognates distributed from eastern Taiwan to Fiji. A sample cognate distribution includes Vakon Amis <em>kuren</em>, Hununoo <em>kurun</em>, Maranao<em> koden</em>, Kelabit <em>kuden</em>, Toba Batak<em> hudon</em>, Kuruti <em>kur</em>, Likum <em>kuh</em>, Lindrow <em>kun</em>, Nauna <em>kul, </em>Motu<em> uro</em>, Fijian <em>kuro</em>, and Tongan <em>kulo</em> (lost in Tonga and then reacquired from Fiji), all of which refer to clay cooking pots in general. The archaeological record shows pottery of a distinctive decorative style and set of cultural associations turning up suddenly in the western Pacific around 3400-3500 BP (Kirch 2009:91). This 'Lapita ware' almost certainly was a continuation of the tradition of pottery-making that can be traced back to PAN via the cognate distribution given here, although the linguistic evidence permits no more detail than the reconstructed meaning 'clay cooking pot' in association with the form *kude.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pile dwellings</span></em></p>
              <p>    With reference to PAN society Blust (1976b:36) suggested that 'Dwelling units were evidently raised on posts.' The basis for this inference was a cognate set that reflects PAN *SadiRi 'housepost', seen in e.g. Nataoran Amis <em>salili </em>'houspost', Ilokano <em>adigi</em>, Tagalog <em>haligi</em> 'post, pillar', Tiruray <em>liley</em> 'the main posts in house constructions', Uma Juman Kayan <em>jihi',</em> Mukah Melanau <em>dii</em>, Ma'anyan <em>ari</em>, Malagasy <em>andry</em>, Mentawai <em>arigi</em>, Manggarai <em>siri</em>, Atoni<em> ni, </em>Leti <em>riri</em>, Yamdena <em>diri</em>, Asilulu<em> lili</em>, Numfor <em>rir</em>, Manam <em>ariri</em>, Numbami<em> alili,</em> Lau <em>lili</em> 'house post'. Wherever sufficient material is available regarding house types reflexes of *SadiRi refer to the main house posts, which normally support the entire structure two meters or more above the level of the ground. In the better-known parts of the Pacific, such as Polynesia, houses are built directly on the ground, and for Pacific archaeologists with a Polynesian focus there thus was little expectation of finding evidence that early Lapita-associated dwellings were raised on piles. Nonetheless, Kirch (1997:171ff) was able to provide archaeological confirmation of this linguistic inference during a 1985 excavation of waterlogged house sites at Talepakemalai in the Mussau Islands north of New Ireland, dated to about 3,500 BP, and hence near the beginning of the Lapita colonisation of the western Pacific. The inference that PAN speakers used pile dwellings, and that this house type continued in use as early AN speakers expanded out into the Pacific implies that ladders were used to enter the dwellings. Reflexes of PMP *haRezan 'notched log ladder' are distributed from northern Luzon to south Halmahera, where they are associated with pile dwellings that are entered vertically from the ground. Reflexes of this term are unknown in Formosan and Oceanic languages. In Taiwan this is because pile dwellings are uncommon. In the Pacific, on the other hand, it may be because pile dwellings are normally built in shallow lagoon waters, and entered by a gradually sloping plank walkway that connects them to the beach terrace (cf. Kirch 1997:174 for a Mussau example). This is consistent with POC *tete 'ladder, bridge', a term that can be reconstructed for PMP (*taytay) only in the meaning 'bamboo suspension bridge', suggesting that in Proto Oceanic the earlier meaning was extended to rickety plank walkways for entering pile dwellings because of the similarity in general structure between these and traditional suspension bridges.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The bow</span></em></p>
              <p>    Linguistic evidence allows us to attribute both pottery and pile dwellings to speakers of PAN, and to infer that these cultural attributes were carried into the Pacific as part of the AN expansion out of insular Southeast Asia. In both cases archaeological corroboration is available (for decades with regard to pottery, much more recently with regard to pile dwellings). For some other features of material culture the linguistic evidence continues to stand alone, and the chances of archaeological corroboration are slim. It is cases such as these that show with greatest clarity the need to combine linguistic evidence with archaeological evidence in order to 'round out' the picture of the life of prehistoric communities, since perishable referents are rarely preserved in archaeological sites, and when they are preserved they tend to be of certain types (large or stationary objects such as beached canoes, or the posts of pile dwellings).<br>    In addition to practicing agriculture and collecting wild plants PAN speakers hunted game, and perhaps fought with the bow and arrow. Two terms are particularly important in this complex: *busuR 'bow' and *panaq 'flight of an arrow'. The first of these is reflected from northern Taiwan to Vanuatu, as seen in Mayrinax Atayal <em>buh-in-ug</em>, Bunun<em> busul</em>, Thao <em>futulh</em>, Casiguran Dumagat, Tagalog <em>busog</em>, Malay <em>busor</em>, Yamdena<em> busir</em>, Asilulu<em> ha-husul</em>, Paulohi<em> husule</em>, Buli<em> pusi</em>, Mota<em> us</em>, Peterara<em> usu</em>, Wailengi<em> fuhu</em> 'bow and arrow'. In insular Southeast Asia reflexes of this form can usually be glossed 'hunting bow', but in the Pacific there was little to hunt, and the bow either became an instrument of warfare (as in Vanuatu), or atrophied to a toy (as in Polynesia). What is important in this comparison is the clear evidence it provides that the 'Lapita people', as they are known to Pacific archaeologists, were armed with bow and arrow as they sailed into the western Pacific in their single-outrigger canoes to settle new lands on the margins of territory that had been discovered at least 40,000 years earlier by ancestral Papuans.<br>    The reconstruction of PAN *busuR and the study of its reflexes permits another useful inference. Hunting with bow and arrow is not practical in dense jungle, where the profusion of vegetation increases the risk of deflecting an arrow in its flight. For this reason the bow disappeared over much of Borneo, even though the hunting of wild pigs and sambhur deer was an important part of traditional Dayak cultures. Here, in parts of Sulawesi, and in a few other areas, the bow was replaced by the blowpipe, since the smaller dart can more easily be directed at a target in thick foliage without high risk of deflection. Reflexes of *sumpit 'blowpipe' are unknown in Taiwan, but are distributed from the central Philippines to western Indonesia and parts of the Lesser Sundas. In general this correlates with an increasingly tropical environment, and suggest that the blowpipe may have been invented as a supplement to the bow as AN speakers moved into areas with denser jungle cover.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The *bubu fish trap</span></em></p>
              <p>    Traditional AN-speaking societies hunted and fished using a wide variety of methods. In addition to the bow and arrow, the blowpipe, and fishing by line and hook, a number of different types of traps were used in hunting for protein foods. One of the most widespread and common of these is a conical wickerwork cage trap about one meter in length with a mouth of converging bamboo splints that can be pressed open by an entering fish seeking the bait inside, but cannot be pressed open from within. Very similar forms of this trap are found over much of the AN-speaking world. Since closely similar traps are also found in some other parts of the world a consideration of the distributional evidence alone does not rule out the possibility of independent invention. Here linguistic evidence plays a crucial role, as almost all AN-speaking groups that use this type of trap call it by a reflex of PAN *bubu: Kavalan <em>bubu</em>, Amis <em>folo</em>, Tagalog<em> bubo, </em>Kelabit <em>bubuh</em>, Bintulu<em> buvew</em>, Malagasy<em> vovo</em>, Malay <em>bubu, </em>Javanese <em>wuwu</em>, Makasarese <em>buwu,</em> Palauan<em> bub, </em>Savu <em>wuwu, </em>Roti<em> bufu,</em> Yamdena<em> bubu,</em> Asilulu<em> huhu</em>, Lou <em>pup</em>, Raluana <em>vup</em>, Manam<em> u</em>, Arosi<em> huhu</em>, Pohnpeian<em> uu,</em> Chuukese<em> wuu,</em> Fijian<em> vuvu</em>.<br>    Given this cognate distribution there is no question that PAN speakers made and used this type of trap, and that some of their descendents took it with them into the Pacific as far as Polynesia (although surprisingly, given its stability in other parts of the AN world, it appears to be called by a number of lexical innovation in Polynesia). Like the bow, it is unlikely that direct archaeological evidence of the *bubu fish trap will ever be found in early settlement contexts, but in view of the linguistic evidence such documentation, while welcome, would clearly be redundant.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The bamboo nose flute</span></em></p>
              <p>    In some cases the linguistic evidence for an item of prehistoric material culture is tenous, but undeniable. Words for the traditional bamboo nose flute are somewhat variable in shape, but clearly point to the use of this musical instrument by speakers of PAN, and to its transport into the Pacific at least as far as Fiji. This is seen in Kavalan <em>tulani</em>, Ilokano<em> tulali</em>, Toba Batak <em>tulila</em>, Bare'e <em>tuyali</em>, Tae' <em>tulali</em>, Fijian <em>dulali</em>. The Kavalan word points to PAN *tulani or *tulaNi, and all other forms to PMP *tulali (with irregular *n/N &gt; *l), if vocalic metathesis is assumed in Toba Batak <em>tulila</em>. Some dictionaries gloss this only as 'flute'. Where more information is available it appears as 'nose flute', and where maximal information is available it becomes clear that it is a bamboo nose flute. Fijian <em>dulali</em> is the only known reflex in any Oceanic language, but it alone provides unmistakeable evidence that the 'Lapita peoples' who left an archaeologically highly visible trail of pottery sherds in their colonisation of the Pacific also played the bamboo nose flute.</p>

              <p>That was an intense read! My personal observation would say
              she's 90% accurate; quite a well researched piece of analysis. I
              would also think that there's no way our mandarin should be like
              Beijing's. We have too much influence from at least 6-7 languages
              (if we include dialects). And the difference can be telling when I
              speak to my China friends.</p>
              <p>Give you one example: For percentage, we say å…«ä»™çŽ‡ but for them,
              they say ç™¾åˆ†æ¯”ã€‚I think we can be flexible here. Can't expect to use
              China mandarin when conversing with local Singaporeans and while
              with China friends, we adapt their style.</p>
              <p>In a way, I would rather be practising my mandarin with them
              than with our fellow countrymen. The standard is higher and there's
              no mixture of rojak haha. There are many many words and idioms that
              I cannot use when speaking with fellow Sgporeans, my mum included;
              and she's chinese educated.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have saved these two articles for future reference. My
              only hope for Singapore mandarin is that the usage of English,
              Hokkien etc in Mandarin would be minimised as the years go by but I
              highly doubt so. I don't think the edcuators at MOE are doing
              anything about it, at least not on a macro scale.</p>

              <p>What other words found in bahasa? I can only think of taoge which is bean sprouts. And in Indonesia, their restaurants (need not be Chinese) will surely have the word "ca" on their menu; which means "fried" in hokkien.</p>
