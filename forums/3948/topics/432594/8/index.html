              <p>ok, if you wan to know henghwa again den lemme know.  i can
              explain and show it's relationship between putien and xianyou,
               and explain and show the henghua cluster is different from
              it's southern (the hokkien) and northern (the hockchew) neighbours,
              and their historical relation and exact points of language contacts
              that result in modern henghua.  The henghwa in singapore is
              buey-zhun already, mixed with hokkien rojak, when you mentioned
              your in-laws mix with hokkien terms,  they could be mixing
              hokkien terms too.   Because the deep-level relationship
              between the henghwa language and the hokkien language is not
              obvious one;  one has to go into deep-level phonology to
              unearth their relationship,  so anything superficial which
              they seem alike,  is attributed to borrowing from hokkien</p>
              <p>Now that you have pointed out "<strong>warna</strong>" means
              "the local peoples / the coloured peoples",  I have realized

                   this goes to show that, some chinese loanwords in bahasa has

              <p>Hmm....I can name a few. In fact, my wife didn't even know so many of the bahasa words were hokkien until I met her.</p>
              <p>Eg:</p>
              <p>cat - æ¼† (paint)</p>
              <p>kemocing - feather duster</p>
              <p>leci - lychee</p>
              <p>pangsit - æ°´é¥º</p>
              <p>kahwin - ç»“å©š</p>
              <p>tongkat - æ¡�å¹²</p>
              <p>warna - The Indo locals</p>
              <p>In fact, may of their dishes start with the words "ca"...you know like ca kangkung, ca bihun....which means "fried" in hokkien and my wife and bro-in-law do not even know it. Words like "swike" for frogs and "tauge" for bean sprouts etc.</p>
              <p>I didn't know kelenteng (temple) is actually hokkien. And they say "manteng" for weddings.</p>
              <p>And most Chinese in java use a lot of javanese words in their language....so I think they've also lost track of what's hokkien and what's not. My wife's cousin is getting married tomorrow and he's never had a chinese name until he did the invitation card! Kind of sad but what to do......</p>

              <p>Hmm....I can name a few. In fact, my wife didn't even know so
              many of the bahasa words were hokkien until I met her.</p>
              <p>Eg:</p>
              <p>cat - æ¼† (paint)</p>
              <p>kemocing - feather duster</p>
              <p>leci - lychee</p>
              <p>pangsit - æ°´é¥º</p>
              <p>kahwin - ç»“å©š</p>
              <p>tongkat - æ¡�å¹²</p>
              <p>warna - The Indo locals</p>
              <p>In fact, may of their dishes start with the words "ca"...you
              know like ca kangkung, ca bihun....which means "fried" in hokkien
              and my wife and bro-in-law do not even know it. Words like "swike"
              for frogs and "tauge" for bean sprouts etc.</p>
              <p>I didn't know kelenteng (temple) is actually hokkien. And they
              say "manteng" for weddings.</p>
              <p>And most Chinese in java use a lot of javanese words in their
              language....so I think they've also lost track of what's hokkien
              and what's not. My wife's cousin is getting married tomorrow and
              he's never had a chinese name until he did the invitation card!
              Kind of sad but what to do......</p>

              <p>eh eh,  kahwin and tongkat are <strong>real</strong> bahasa words,   which were borrowed into hokkien and subsequently written as äº¤å§» and æ¡�è‘›ã€‚</p>
              <p>ya, ca is ç‚’ ma,  stir-fry</p>
              <p>then wat is "manteng" ?   loanword or bahasa word?   if loanword, u guess wat characters?</p>
              <p>Yep, the last paragraph is true,  I met before Indonesian Chinese who is called just "Vivi" (even without surnames),  "Fenny"  ,  no chinese names,   later they resurrect their Chinese names after they came to Singapore</p>

              <p>The main gist of the Chinglish article,  talks about the non-Northern traits of Singapore Mandarin Chinese as opposed to the more Northerly traits of Mainland China Mandarin Chinese,   being   <strong>1)</strong> Topicalization  <strong>2)</strong> Topicalization markers  <strong>3)</strong> the VO structure  <strong>4) </strong>Emphasis of subject instead of topic</p>

              <p>The other 2 articles,  no comment ?</p>
              <p>I got some observations.</p>
              <p>I took ã€�æ¼¢èªžæ–¹è¨€å°�å�°å°¼åŸŽå¸‚ä¸­æ–‡å��çš„å½±éŸ¿ã€‘ (named as article "<strong>A</strong>") andã€�å�°å°¼è�¯äººçš„èªžè¨€ç‹€æ³�ã€‘ (named as article "<strong>B</strong>") and did a comparison.  Did you notice in article "<strong>A</strong>" where is shows <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> is named after Cantonese naming conventions, meaning most of the first inhabitants in <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> were the Cantonese, but in article "<strong>B</strong>", <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> is said to be populated mainly by the Fujian (Hokkien) and Fuqing (Hockchia) people,  so now,  <strong>a)</strong> are the Cantonese reduced to a minority after the Hokkiens and Hockchias overwhelmed them,   or <strong>b)</strong> they left <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> totally without a trace after they have founded the city ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>And,</strong></span></em></p>
              <p>In article "<strong>B</strong>",  on page 162,  it mentioned that in <strong>1930</strong>, the Hakkas in the Outer provinces were around <strong>125,000</strong>, and the Hakkas in Java (and Madura) were around <strong>75,000</strong>.</p>
              <p>This matches the census done by <em>Volkstelling, 1930:104, Table 21</em>,  which showed that in <strong>1930</strong>, the Hakkas in the Outer provinces were <strong>125,548</strong>,  and the Hakkas in Java (and Madura) were <strong>75,188</strong>.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the data is gathered from the <em>Volkstelling</em> census.</p>
              <p>Now, comes the next line, it mentioned that in <strong>1930</strong>, the Hakkas in è¥¿åŠ è£�æ›¼ä¸¹ were around <strong>38,000</strong>.</p>
              <p>In the census done by <em>Volkstelling</em>,<em>1930:104, Table 21,</em> it also showed that in <strong>1930</strong>, the Hakkas in Borneo (which is = è¥¿åŠ è£�æ›¼ä¸¹) were <strong>39,125</strong>.</p>
              <p>Apprently, this piece of data should be gathered from the <em>Volkstelling</em> census too.</p>
              <p>But the last sentence, <strong>“</strong>ä½”è�¯äººç¸½äººå�£<strong>66,000</strong>äººçš„<strong>57%”</strong>ã€‚There is no where in the <em>Volkstelling</em> census that I can find a figure near to <strong>66,000</strong>, as the <em>Volkstelling</em> census showed that the total number of people in Borneo then was <strong>91,320</strong>.  If going by the <em>Volkstelling</em> census, the number of Hakkas on Borneo in <strong>1930</strong> should have been <strong>43%</strong>.</p>
              <p>This led me think differently with respect to the opinion in the last second section "äº”ã€�é–©å�—èªžèˆ‡å�°å°¼èªžçš„äº’å‹•" that the Hakkas are supposedly more numerous than the Hokkiens but contributed negligible loanwords into Bahasa.  In the first place, research has shown the earlier and the longer the immigrants are, the loanwords would have reached the recipient language first.  It would have much less to do with a subsequent bigger but later wave of immigration from a new dialect group.</p>

              <p>then wat is "manteng" ?   loanword or bahasa word?  
              if loanword, u guess wat characters?</p>
              <p>Yep, the last paragraph is true,  I met before Indonesian
              Chinese who is called just "Vivi" (even without surnames),
               "Fenny"  ,  no chinese names,   later they
              resurrect their Chinese names after they came to Singapore</p>

              <p>Kahwin is from ç»“å©šï¼ŸNo? Tongkat is bahasa? Haha confused liao.</p>
              <p>Not sure about manteng....could be manten too.....oh just remembered another word....potehi (figurine puppets show). I just watched one not too long ago in the local temple. And the temple has quite a bit of history. There's this plaque which was endorsed by a Qing dynasty official and shipped over. Then there are tiger footprints in the temple which are still around even today. Okok, before i drift into no man's land...will stop here lol.</p>

              <p>The other 2 articles,  no comment ?</p>
              <p>I got some observations.</p>
              <p>I took ã€�æ¼¢èªžæ–¹è¨€å°�å�°å°¼åŸŽå¸‚ä¸­æ–‡å��çš„å½±éŸ¿ã€‘ (named as article "<strong>A</strong>")
              andã€�å�°å°¼è�¯äººçš„èªžè¨€ç‹€æ³�ã€‘ (named as article "<strong>B</strong>") and did a
              comparison.  Did you notice in article "<strong>A</strong>"
              where is shows <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> is named after
              Cantonese naming conventions, meaning most of the first inhabitants
              in <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> were the Cantonese, but in
              article "<strong>B</strong>", <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> is
              said to be populated mainly by the Fujian (Hokkien) and Fuqing
              (Hockchia) people,  so now,  <strong>a)</strong> are the
              Cantonese reduced to a minority after the Hokkiens and Hockchias
              overwhelmed them,   or <strong>b)</strong> they left
              <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> totally without a trace after they
              have founded the city ?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>And,</strong></span></em></p>
              <p>In article "<strong>B</strong>",  on page 162,  it
              mentioned that in <strong>1930</strong>, the Hakkas in the Outer
              provinces were around <strong>125,000</strong>, and the Hakkas
              in Java (and Madura) were around <strong>75,000</strong>.</p>
              <p>This matches the census done by <em>Volkstelling, 1930:104,
              Table 21</em>,  which showed that in <strong>1930</strong>,
              the Hakkas in the Outer provinces were <strong>125,548</strong>,
               and the Hakkas in Java (and Madura) were
              <strong>75,188</strong>.</p>
              <p>Apparently, the data is gathered from the
              <em>Volkstelling</em> census.</p>
              <p>Now, comes the next line, it mentioned that in
              <strong>1930</strong>, the Hakkas in è¥¿åŠ è£�æ›¼ä¸¹ were around
              <strong>38,000</strong>.</p>
              <p>In the census done by <em>Volkstelling</em>,<em>1930:104, Table
              21,</em> it also showed that in <strong>1930</strong>, the
              Hakkas in Borneo (which is = è¥¿åŠ è£�æ›¼ä¸¹) were
              <strong>39,125</strong>.</p>
              <p>Apprently, this piece of data should be gathered from
              the <em>Volkstelling</em> census too.</p>
              <p>But the last sentence,
              <strong>“</strong>ä½”è�¯äººç¸½äººå�£<strong>66,000</strong>äººçš„<strong>57%”</strong>ã€‚There
              is no where in the <em>Volkstelling</em> census that I
              can find a figure near to <strong>66,000</strong>, as
              the <em>Volkstelling</em> census showed that the total
              number of people in Borneo then was <strong>91,320</strong>.
               If going by the <em>Volkstelling</em> census, the
              number of Hakkas on Borneo in <strong>1930</strong> should
              have been <strong>43%</strong>.</p>
              <p>This led me think differently with respect to the opinion in the
              last second section "äº”ã€�é–©å�—èªžèˆ‡å�°å°¼èªžçš„äº’å‹•" that the Hakkas are supposedly
              more numerous than the Hokkiens but contributed negligible
              loanwords into Bahasa.  In the first place, research has shown
              the earlier and the longer the immigrants are, the loanwords would
              have reached the recipient language first.  It would have much
              less to do with a subsequent bigger but later wave of immigration
              from a new dialect group.</p>

              <p>The yogya theory I can't be sure.....but æ—¥å–� really does sound like the cantonese version of yogya. Cantonese in central java is new to me...I thought this place is a hokkien dominated area.
