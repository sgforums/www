            <div class='col-md body'>Research centre name - Environmental Engineering Research Centre (EERC)<br><br>Projects undertaken:<br>Â•	Membrane technology adapted from mangroves root<br>Â•	Solid waste to Bio gas Technology<br>Â•	Bioremediation Technology adapted from tree root system<br>Â•	Biomass to Energy Technology<br>Â•	Conversion of plastic to oil using Pyrolysis Technology<br><br>In here, I will be elaborating on the membrane technology, conversion of plastic to oil using Pyrolysis technology and Solid waste to Biogas technology, Bioremediation technology and biomass to energy technology.<br><br><strong>Membrane technology</strong><br>This technology was adapted from mangrove roots. In mangrove roots, there is a special membrane to filter away the salt from salt water.<br><br>The cost of water per cubic meter in Singapore is $1.17. It is very expensive to desalinate water and we have four source of water generally. The four taps of water are from precipitation of rain, import from Malaysia, seawater and NEWater. Water, as we know, is precious.<br><br>The current practice is to discharge wastewater into the sea. Water is taken from the sea for desalination purpose. This is highly not energy efficient because by doing so, much useful energy is lost in the process.<br><br>In addition, desalination process uses a lot of heat energy to separate excess minerals from water. Desalination plants get their energy from power stations that in turn get the electricity from burning of fossil fuel.<br><br>As we know, burning of fossil fuel to produce energy will result in emission of harmful waste gases and huge amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This effect will cause global warming.<br><br>With the adaptation of mangrove membrane technology, the energy used to create potable water will drastically reduce.  This not only saves cost, but it also save our Planet Earth. On a huge scale, it will reduce the global warming effect if this technology were used worldwide. In my own humble opinion, I feel that in the long future, there will be better innovative technology that will further address our todayÂ’s problem in respect to global warming.<br><br><strong>Bioremediation Technology</strong><br>This technology is use on soil pollution. As it was not feasible and practical to remove the whole volume of soil, EERC and NTU develop this Bioremediation technology.<br><br>The use of tree root system can to help convert toxic substance and help release as harmful carbon dioxide in the soil.<br><br><strong>Pyrolysis technology</strong><br>Converting plastic into oil, Pyrolysis technology was developed in cooperation between EERC and NTU helps to reduce the earth pollutions effect. This technology is extremely useful in reducing the EarthÂ’s pollution. Due of the nature of plastic, it is generally classified under the non-biodegradable section. Buried underground, these plastic cannot be degrade into their simplest form.<br><br>It a very concerning issue here because I believe that everyone should do his or her part to help reduce the EarthÂ’s pollutions.<br><br><strong>Solid waste to biogas technology</strong><br>The use of solid waste conversion to biogas technology is very vital. Compost, fertilizer and methane gases are useful product from the conversion.<br><br>If we can tap into the sustainable energy from solid waste and make it to be the one of the material to create biogas, we can reduce the use of energy from fossil fuel. The can help reduced the amount of harmful gas released into the atmosphere.<br><br>Methane, which is the biogas produced are the clean energy produced by this new technology.<br><br><strong>Biomass to Energy Technology</strong><br>Food, paper, plastic generated in high amount in Singapore each day. These green waste have the potential ability to convert into new sustainable energy.<br><br>EERC is creating this technology to which will produce bio Hydrogen and Bio fuel from solid organic waste using HASL-II technology.<br><br>He briefs us on three parts in energy resource management.<br>Â•	Integration<br>Â•	Diversification<br>Â•	Decentralization<br><br><strong>Integration</strong><br>In todayÂ’s whole we are using up a lot of energy and these are the breakdown of the source of energy:<br><br>Here are the source of energy we are getting from.<br>Â•	38% oil<br>Â•	25% coal<br>Â•	23% gas<br>Â•	14% others<br>Â•<br>The professor encourages use to create new source of energy and on the other hand, we should converse our precious energy.<br><br><strong>Diversification</strong>Professor said that we should diversify our source of energy. Such that energy are never negligible.<br><br><strong>Decentralization</strong><br>We should never stick to fossil fuel, but also learnt to accept Bio fuel such as bio-hydrogen, bio-ethanol and bio- diesel.<br><br>3. <strong>Technology using termites </strong><br>The technology requires the use of termites to feed on the woody waste to produce bio-ethanol. Associate Professor Wang says that microbe living in the gut of termites has potent enzymes able to efficiently and cost effectively transform woody wastes into sugar for ethanol production.<br></div>
