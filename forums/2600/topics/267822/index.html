            <div class='col-md body'>Marine Conservation.<br>Guest Speaker: Ms Kelly Ong from underwater world<br><br>The three marine animals that will be harmed by global warming mentioned by Ms Kelly Ong are Polar bears, Penguin and Marine Turtles.<br><br><strong>Polar Bears</strong><br>Polar bears, a semi-aquatic marine animal, are one of the many animals that will be the victim of global warming. The death of Polar bears has shed us light on what happened to them. The field scientists from the Antarctica have reporting this never-been-seen-before phenomenon on polar bears. The bears are literally swimming for catch their preys.<br><br>Bear used to hunt their prey near the edge of the ice, but today they will have to swim in order to catch their. Due to the rapid rate of ice cap melting today, polar bears are having a lack of hunting ground. Because of that, bears are getting thinner and thinner.<br><br>As we know polar bearsÂ’ fur is design for adaptation of the cold weather, it was not design for heat insulting at below zero degree Celsius cold water. Nowadays polar bears are facing a huge crisis for drowning.<br><br>The general rise of temperature on Earth due to global warming have caused ice cap and sheet to melt, which means polar bears have less hunting ground to catch their prey.<br><br><strong>Penguin</strong><br>In the recent years, penguin populations have they population decrease linked to climate change. As global warming affects the Earth, it affects the cold regions too. The warmer air and sea temperature have caused the shrinking level of ice. This results in lack of food source for the penguin that feed on the krill.<br><br>In addition, of that, the shrinking of sea ice has also caused a decrease in both krill and algae population. Krill feeds on algae that found on the sea ice.<br><br>This are the main concerning reason that could explain why the decrease in penguin overall population.<br><br><strong>Marine Turtle</strong><br>The global warming has caused an increase in the temperature that caused the ice cap and ice sheets to melt resulting in an increase of sea level each year. The increase of sea level will destroy low-lying beaches. This will result in less nesting areas of the turtle to lay their eggs and hence affect the population of the marine turtle.<br><br>Global warming also affects the ultimate male to female ration because of the temperature. As what I have elaborate in question two, there are strong link between effects of global warming to the marine turtle population.<br><br>Temperature has a direct effect on marine turtle population.<br><br>Marine turtles actually have many offspring but on contrary, they have very little survivors. As what Ms Kelly Ong has told us, the temperature can determine the sex of the marine turtles. A cooler temperature produces male turtles while a warmer temperature produces female turtles.<br><br>The impact of global warming have caused a general increase of temperature, which means that there will be more females turtles because of the warmer temperature condition.<br><br>When there are more females, it seriously affected the male to female ratios. When there are many female turtles and are lack of male turtles in the ecosystem, the population of marine turtle will be severely affected because there will not be enough male turtle for reproduction.<br><br><strong>Ocean acidification</strong><br>It is the decrease of pH of the Earth's Ocean. At the rate of current carbon dioxide emission, there will be an adverse impact to the ocean environment.<br><br>When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms a carbonic acid. It causes a change in ocean pH balance. The ocean pH will be decrease due to the increasing amount of carbonic acid in ocean.<br><br>A decrease of pH in ocean would means coral reef, plankton and organism whose skeleton made of calcium carbonate may be particularly affected. This threatens to endanger the lives of marine organisms, suffering from the effects of increase in acidity in the ocean.<br><br><strong>Coral bleaching</strong><br>It is the loss of color of the coral due to the loss of Zooxanthellae in the algae found the tissues. Zooxanthellae or called Â“zookÂ” give the coral its particular coloration. When under stress the corals will expel Zooxanthellae, which will lead to lighter or completely white appearance.<br><br>Global warming which cause the temperature of the water to increase can be one of the factors causing stress to the coral. When there is a reduced amount of zooplankton due to over fishing, it will result in starvation of corals.<br><br>It has huge impact on the marine food chain because many survivors of marine lives depend on the plankton that is at the bottom of the food chain. Food chain is a link, when the bottom ones get affect; it will also affect the ones from the top.<br><br><strong>Career as a Marine Biologist</strong><br><br>The job scope for a marine biologist in underwater world will include daily husbandry and provide fish diet and treatment. Marine biologist will be also be doing research, design for exhibits, and organize breeding programs. As a marine biologist, they are also required to conduct dive programs.<br><br>In order to become a marine biologist with the underwater world, one needs to hold at least a Degree in veterinary, marine biology or a bio-related course. He or she must be also dive certified and physically fit. One must also have knowledge in basic water chemistry. Having prior knowledge in aquarium keeping animal husbandry will give applicants an edge when they apply for this post. The most important thing is to have aptitude passion for fishes and marine mammals.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My part as an individual to reduce global warming</strong><br>I take public transport (Bus and MRT) to school everyday. Taking public transport will greatly help reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases from the exhaust pipe. Imagine this; if everyone were to take cars and motorcycle to a destination, the road will be full of vehicles that emit carbon dioxide and other green house gases.<br><br>As an individual, I can also educate my fellow friends about the issue on global warming when chances arise. I, myself can be a role model promoting the awareness of the current global warming phenomenon.<br><br>In daily life, I will switch of lights when there is no one in the room. This will reduce the use of energy that at the other end reduced the emission of carbon dioxide and harmful gases from the power stations. As we know, power station uses fossil fuel to generate electricity. One personÂ’s act does not affect the whole system, but if everyone is will to reduce the energy wastage, I believe the result will be more promising.<br><br>We should also reduce the amount of plastic bags used, and instead of normal plastics bag, we should use recyclable bags. Plastic bags made from one of the fraction of petroleum, if we can reduce the usage of plastic bag, we can indirectly help reduce global warming.<br><br><strong>Coastal development </strong><br>We can suggest to the relevant authority to set up an exhibit to promote awareness of the harm of coastal development brought to the marine environment. A part of promoting awareness, we can also organize talks to let public know the cons of coastal development.<br><br>Although coastal development can bring in income for the particular country, on the other hand, it has to risk losing precious reefs and marine lives. It is a loss of national natural heritage.<br><br><strong>Over fishing</strong><br>One can do nothing much about over fishing. However, I can suggest to the relevant authority to reduce the quota for fishing which are on the verge of endangerment. This severely affects the whole food chain and web of marine life and environment.  Over fishing have cause as much as 70% loss of population of fish in certain country.<br><br>If we do not stop this, we will loss our precious fish one day. Our marine ecosystem will be at risk too.<br><br><strong>Ocean pollution</strong><br>There are many causes of ocean pollution such as oil spill and littering into the sea. This greatly affects the marine environment and organism living in the water.<br><br>We need to educate the crews of the ships how to handle oil spill during an emergency. If a team of skilled and experience crew can contain an oil spill at the fastest possible time, less marine lives will be affected. That is why I feel that adequate training for the crews is very important when such incident occurs.<br><br>People often throw unwanted items into the sea; this will harm the marine animals. One example will be plastic bag. Many marine animals found dead on seashore with plastic bags on them. The cause of death is suffocation!<br><br>When I see people littering into to the sea or at seashore, I will my part to educate them the danger of littering that they are harming the marine life and environment.<br></div>
