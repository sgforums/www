              <p>It is reported in the channelnewsasia website thatÂ The Subordinate Courts have set up two centres to help those who are not represented by lawyers to find out more about court processes and procedures.</p>

              <p>It is just a copy and paste from the channelnewsasia website.</p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Subordinate Courts have set up two centres to help those who are not represented by lawyers to find out more about court processes and procedures. <br><br>For some, the legal system is complicated and confusing, and many end up representing themselves in court because they are unable or unwilling to pay for a lawyer. <br><br>They account for one-third of criminal cases and more than 90 per cent of cases heard in the family courts. <br><br>Recognising this, the courts have set up two centres with resources such as legal clinics run by volunteer lawyers. <br><br>A facility known as the Helping to Empower Litigants-in-Person (HELP) Centre begins operating on Friday at the Subordinates Court. Another HELP Centre also opened its doors at the Juvenile and Family Court Building. <br><br>The centres are fully manned by experienced members of the court staff. The centres are also equipped with facilities such as educational videos and Internet access to better serve the public. <br><br>Members of the public may get help in layman terms on how the legal system operates, but staff will not give legal advice. <br><br>Speaking at this year's Subordinate Courts Workplan Seminar, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong said the Law Society and the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore are looking into providing free legal advice at the HELP Centres starting next month. <br><br>Chief Justice Chan said the launch of the HELP Centres is part of the Subordinate Courts' plan to ensure that those in need of legal services are not shut out due to factors such as ignorance and poverty. <br><br>A new court will come into operation on March 1 to hear cases under the current Mental Capacity Act. The Mental Capacity Court will have the power to make decisions on behalf of a person who lacks mental capacity. <br><br>It may also appoint a deputy to make decisions on the person's behalf. <br>Chief Justice Chan said the Civil Justice Division also seeks to streamline processes to better serve the public. <br><br>Under the Act, Singaporeans may appoint a person to manage their affairs should they lose the mental capacity to do so. <br><br>Parents with intellectually disabled children may also appoint a court deputy to ensure that their children's care is arranged should the parents die or lose their mental faculties. The court will be able to hear on such cases. <br><br>The courts will encourage a shift towards Alternative Dispute Resolution as the first stop. <br><br>A larger pool of lawyers, known as Associate Mediators, has been developed to help expand the mediation services available at the Subordinate Courts. <br><br>The Division will also roll out a protocol for personal injury cases to expedite the claim procedure for such cases. It will introduce a guide that will provide information on the range of damages which may be awarded. <br><br>Aside from ensuring easy access to justice, the courts also need to ensure that resources are well-allocated. <br><br>One problem it currently faces is that four in 10 criminal cases do not go to trial even after trial dates have been fixed. This is due to either the accused pleaded guilty, or the cases were withdrawn. <br><br>It is a serious concern for the courts, says the Chief Justice, because it means a waste of trial dates for other cases waiting to be heard. <br><br>Hence, the courts are exploring the idea of plea bargaining, where parties need not go to trial at all. <br><br>Until this happens, a senior District Judge will mediate between the prosecution and defence under a pilot scheme. <br><br>Chief Justice Chan notes that this is a policy issue, and needs further discussion with the Public Prosecutor. But pending a decision on plea bargaining, he will introduce a voluntary criminal case resolution programme for public prosecutors. This allows a senior District Judge to act as a neutral mediator between the Prosecutor and Defence. <br><br>Another strain on resources arises from the increasing number of Magistrate's Complaints lodged with the Subordinate Courts. <br><br>Between 2005 and 2009, the number has risen from 3,193 to 4,569. <br><br>Chief Justice Chan says these complaints were often made "for the wrong reasons" - sometimes to air grievances, or to "put the fear of criminal proceedings on the other party to settle the dispute". <br><br>The courts will be discussing with the Public Prosecutor how to tackle the problem better. <br><br></span></p>
