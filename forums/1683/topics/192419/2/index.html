A maiden (seeker) wants to be married. She is confused and she ask some people who are married (Church leaders, witnesses) what being married is like.

It is therefore obvious that John 3:5 was referring to water baptism alone, rather than natural birth and being born again.<br><br>Furthermore, Jesus and the disciples went to the countryside to baptise afterwards.<br><br>Jesus even subjected Himself to Baptism, even though He did not need it. And God was pleased. When He was baptized, the heavens are opened and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove.</div></blockquote>Then why didn't Jesus said so? Why did Jesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can't see the Kingdom of God?" Why didn't Jesus say unless one is baptised?</div>
