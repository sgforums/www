            <div class='col-md body'><br>by Father David Daly, LC<br><br><strong>Luke 7:11-17</strong><br><br>Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him. As he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his motherÂ´s only son, and she was a widow; and with her was a large crowd from the town. When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, "Do not weep." Then he came forward and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, "Young man, I say to you, rise!" The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother. Fear seized all of them; and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has risen among us!" and "God has looked favorably on his people!" This word about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.<br><br><strong><br>Introductory Prayer</strong>: Lord Jesus, I come to you today to participate in your resurrection! In this Valley of Tears, I need you to give me life as you did to the widow of NainÂ’s son. Grant me this grace today!<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>: Lord, grant me the grace of a profound hope in you.<br><br><strong>1. The Widow of Nain.</strong> The widow may have caused Jesus to think of his own mother, Mary, and the trauma that she would experience at his death. Jesus showed compassion to this widow, the mother of an only son, just as he would later show his own mother when he visited her after his resurrection from the dead. This scene is an invitation to contemplate ChristÂ’s compassion.<br><br><strong>2. Â“Do Not Weep.Â” </strong>Jesus consoles the widow of Nain with these words. So too he wants to console and encourage us in our daily lives. How many times we need to hear him! How often we weep, complaining and despairing over so many little problems of each day! Imagine what would it be like if we listened to Jesus in these moments and lived our Â“crossÂ” united to him. He invites us to do just that.<br><br><strong>3. Â“I Say to You, Rise</strong>.Â” What magnificent words! As St Peter once said to Jesus: Â“You have the words of eternal life.Â” Jesus rises from the dead in the Gospel and he wants to do the same in my life today. Apply these words to yourself and remember ChristÂ’s power. With him you can do all things!<br><br><strong><br>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord Jesus, I thank you for this time of prayer. I commit myself to you more firmly today. Help me to accept the cross with faith so that I can join in your resurrection. I believe that you will increase my hope in you today.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I resolve to remember these words of Christ today in the face of the great or small difficulties that arise.<br></div>
