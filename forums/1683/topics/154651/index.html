            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">Post Abortion Distress Syndrome  or Post-Abortion Grief</span></span></strong><br><br>By E. Joanne Angelo<br><img src="http://www.entertainmail.net/uploads/avatars/sadgirl.jpg"><br>Every woman who subjects herself to an induced abortion suffers the death<br>of her own child. She is at risk not only for the surgical and medical<br>complications of abortion &amp; uterine rupture, sepsis, infertility, increased<br>incidence of cancer. She is also at high risk for pathological grief, which<br>often brings with it severe and long-lasting negative sequelae for herself,<br>her partner, her surviving children and the whole of society. Grief<br>following a death in the family is a universally accepted experience. A<br>period of mourning following the loss of a loved one is a normal<br>expectation in every culture. It is also generally understood that if this<br>mourning process is blocked or impacted, there will be negative<br>consequences. Shakespeare, in his tragedy Macbeth, says, "Give sorrow<br>words, the grief that does not speak knits up the o'erwrought heart and<br>bids it break" (Act IV, scene 3). Yet a mother's grief after an induced<br>abortion has heretofore seldom been acknowledged.<br><br>The death of a child is perhaps the most difficult loss to mournÃ‘even the<br>death of a premature baby, a stillborn child, or a miscarriage. The medical<br>literature in recent years has increasingly acknowledged the significance<br>of perinatal loss for parents. Obstetrical journals describe "perinatal<br>grief teams" consisting of nurses, doctors, social workers, clergy and<br>volunteers who help parents cope with the loss of children who die in<br>neonatal intensive care units. Parents are encouraged to name and hold<br>their dead baby, and to take photographs. Religious services assist them in<br>their mourning, and they are encouraged to bury the child with their loved<br>ones in a family grave which they can visit as often as they wish.<br><br>Abortion, whether spontaneous or induced, is part of the same continuum of<br>perinatal grief. However, grief after elective abortion is uniquely<br>poignant because it is largely hidden. There are no provisions made to<br>assist the post-abortion woman in her grievingÃ‘she has no child to hold, no<br>photographs, no wake or funeral, and no grave to visit. After an elective<br>abortion, a woman typically finds herself alone to cope not only with the<br>loss of the child she will never know, but also with her personal<br>responsibility in the child's death with its ensuing guilt and shame. She<br>may have difficulty understanding her ambivalent feelingsÃ‘on the one hand,<br>relief (often very temporary) that she is no longer pregnant, and, on the<br>other hand, a profound sense of loss and emptiness. In her book, The<br>Anatomy of Bereavement, Beverley Raphael explains, "A woman may have<br>required a high level of defensive denial of her tender feelings for the<br>baby to allow her to make the decision for termination. This denial often<br>carries her through the procedure and hours afterward, so that she seems<br>cheerful, accepting but unwilling to talk at the time when supportive<br>counseling may be offered by the clinic."2 This may explain why research<br>into psychiatric sequelae of abortion in the immediate post-abortion period<br>often yields negative results.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>The Emotional Effects</strong></span></span><br><br>In the weeks and months after the abortion, feelings of sadness and guilt<br>often threaten to overwhelm the post-abortion woman, yet society offers her<br>no assistance in mourningÃ‘she is expected to be grateful that "her problem<br>is solved" and to "get on with her life" as though nothing significant had<br>happened. At the same time, pain and bleeding remind her of the assault on<br>her body, the sudden endocrine changes cause her to become emotionally<br>labile or unstable. She is poignantly aware of the date her child would<br>have been born. Reminders threaten her defensive denial and repression all<br>too frequently: anniversaries of her abortion, other children of the age<br>her child would have been, Mother's Day, the omni-present abortion debate<br>in the media, a visit to the gynecologist, the sound of the suction machine<br>at the dentist's office, or the sound of a vacuum cleaner at home, a baby<br>in a television ad, a new pregnancy, a death in the family, a film<br>depicting prenatal development or abortion, or a pro-life homily. Any of<br>these may trigger a sudden flood of grief, guilt, anger and even despair,<br>which in turn, calls forth even more intense defensive responses.<br><br>The post-abortion woman's attempts to comply with society's expectations<br>that she proceed with her life as though she had undergone an innocuous<br>procedure are bought at great personal expense. She may turn to alcohol or<br>drugs to get to sleep at night or to deaden the pain of the intrusive<br>thoughts, which haunt her day and night, "I killed my baby! I killed my<br>baby! I don't deserve to live!" Flashbacks to the abortion procedure may<br>occur at any time. She may throw herself into intense activityÃ‘work, study,<br>or recreation, or attempt to deal with her feelings of loneliness and<br>emptiness by binge eating alternating with purging or anorexia, or by<br>intense efforts to repair intimate relationships or develop new ones<br>inappropriately, becoming sexually promiscuous, risking sexually<br>transmitted diseases, and repeating pregnancy and abortion. Complaints of<br>vague abdominal pain or pain on sexual intercourse may cause her to seek<br>medical treatment from one physician after another unsuccessfully, and the<br>very examinations to which she is subjected may cause flashbacks to the<br>abortion experience. Her life spirals downward as her general health,<br>personal relationships and job performance become more and more impaired.<br><br>Discouragement, despair, clinical depression and suicide attempts often<br>follow.3 Typically, in presenting symptoms over a period of many years, she<br>is treated by numerous physicians and mental health professionals without<br>ever receiving help for the root cause of her problems, her abortion or<br>abortions. Psychiatric textbooks subsume all of the above symptoms under<br>the diagnosis of a Pathological Grief Reaction.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>                Effects On Marriage And Subsequent Children</strong></span></span><br><img src="http://www.4girls.gov/mind/depression.jpg"><br>Short-term research into the psychiatric sequelae of abortion fails to<br>document its devastating long-term negative effects on women and on their<br>forming and sustaining stable spousal relationships, and of caring<br>appropriately for subsequent children. They may have difficulty bonding<br>with a new baby, or, conversely, become overprotective and inappropriately<br>attached to the next child who bears the burden of replacing the aborted<br>baby. These children are often referred to child psychiatrists because of<br>separation anxiety, or because they are judged to be at risk for physical<br>abuse. Couples may be treated for infertility or dysfunctional marriages,<br>which stem from a previous abortion or abortions. Substance abuse,<br>"burnout" on the job, psycho-somatic symptoms, eating disorders, chronic<br>depression and suicide attempts which routinely bring women into<br>psychiatric care can often be traced to an abortion experience several<br>years before through a careful and complete history.<br><img src="http://images.google.com.sg/images?q=tbn:i3YFxH0kqhsJ:www.pcbproductions.com/julia/photos/August/2002/sad_girl.jpg"><br>In addition to immediate intervention for the presenting problem,<br>successful treatment of women who have suffered the tragedy of abortion<br>requires that the underlying traumatic loss be acknowledged and<br>appropriately grieved. Psychotherapy involves facilitating the work of<br>mourning which has been so long delayed. Within a therapeutic relationship,<br>the woman is encouraged to share her traumatic loss and to acknowledge her<br>role in it. She is helped to share the mental image she has formed of her<br>child &amp; often one of a baby being torn to pieces or crying out in pain. As<br>the grief work proceeds, her image is transformed into a less disturbing<br>picture of her child at peace. She may name the child and arrange for a<br>religious service to be performed for him or her. She accepts God's<br>forgiveness and may be able to forgive herself and ask forgiveness of her<br>child. Eventually she is able to put the child to rest in her mind. Only<br>then is she free to resume her life productivelyÃ‘to make new relationships<br>or repair old ones, to work, to play, and to be creative once again.4<br><br>With 30 million abortions in this country since Roe v. Wade, and the<br>continuing rate of 1.5 million abortions per year, we can no longer deny<br>the public health significance of their psychological and psychophysical<br>sequelae. Epidemiological studies are urgently needed which are<br>statistically sound and which follow women and men for at least ten years<br>postabortion. However, it is axiomatic that the best treatment for any<br>epidemic is primary prevention. Abortion is an elective surgical procedure<br>performed on healthy women (pregnancy is not a disease). The immediate<br>abolition of elective abortion would eradicate the iatrogenic epidemic of<br>post-abortion pathology and would serve the best interests of women and<br>society. In Evangelium Vitae (no. 99) John Paul II spells out the pastoral<br>approach of the church:<br><br>The wound in your heart may not yet have healed. Certainly what happened<br>was and remains terribly wrong. But do not give in to discouragement and do<br>not lose hope. Try rather to understand what happened and face it honestly.<br><br>If you have not already done so, give yourself over with humility and trust<br>to repentance. The Father of mercies is ready to give you his forgiveness<br>and his peace in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. You will come to<br>understand that nothing is definitely lost and you will also be able to ask<br>forgiveness from your child, who is now living in the Lord. With the<br>friendly and expert help and advice of other people, and as a result of<br>your own painful experience, you can be among the most eloquent defenders<br>of everyone's right to life.<br><br>Notes<br><br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Women Should Be Told of Abortion Risks</strong></span></span><br>by Dr. Steve Calvin<br><br><img src="http://images1.clinicaltools.com/images/depclinic/sad-woman.jpg"><br>[Pro-Life Infonet Note:  Steve Calvin, of Minneapolis, is a physician.]<br><br>As we approach the 29th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, it was instructive to<br>read excerpts from Justice Harry Blackmun's majority opinion that were<br>recently reprinted on these pages. In January 1973 I was a college<br>freshman premed major who thought that the decision legalizing abortion<br>made sense. Today I am a physician specializing in maternal-fetal medicine<br>who believes that the opinion was, at best, a judicial, medical and moral<br>mistake.<br><br>Even so, my reading of Blackmun's arguments left me with some room for<br>optimism. He acknowledged that there are compelling interests which<br>justify some regulation of what has become a virtually unrestricted right<br>to abortion. The compelling interests are the health of the pregnant<br>woman, and the fetus potential for survival outside the womb. My optimism<br>is based on compelling new medical considerations.<br><br>The health argument over this issue has always involved risk calculations.<br>It is frequently pointed out that abortion in the first trimester is three<br>times safer for a woman (but not the fetus) than a full-term pregnancy.<br>Risks of abortion do not, however, end with the procedure. In their<br>decisionmaking process women should have the right to know about long-term<br>risks.<br><br>What has changed since 1973 is the understanding of some of the medical<br>consequences of abortion. The two most important are the likelihood of<br>links between abortion and breast cancer and between abortion and<br>premature deliveries in subsequent pregnancies. The media and medical<br>establishment have responded to these possibilities with either<br>embarrassed silence or vehement denials.<br><br>It is widely known that full-term pregnancy followed by breast-feeding<br>decreases the long-term risk for breast cancer. It makes biological sense<br>that there is danger in abortion's interruption of the normal breast<br>changes of pregnancy. Unlike most other cancers, the incidence of breast<br>cancer has risen since 1973. Most worrisome is the fact that the women who<br>chose abortion in the 1970s and 1980s are now entering the postmenopausal<br>years -- when the risk of breast cancer is highest.<br><br>Originally skeptical of the proposed link between abortion and breast<br>cancer, I read the medical literature as well as the arguments pro and<br>con. I have concluded that a causal connection is likely. The highest risk<br>seems to be for young women who have a family history of breast cancer --<br>and young women are the group most frequently offered abortion as a tragic<br>but risk-free option.<br><br>Young women contemplating abortion should also know about a study<br>published in the October 2001 issue of the British Journal of OB/GYN. An<br>evaluation of more than 12,000 French women showed that one abortion<br>increased the risk for subsequent preterm delivery by 40 percent and that<br>two or more abortions increased the risk by 90 percent. Abortion is<br>offered to women as a way to plan parenthood. To be completely informed,<br>they should also be told that abortion will increase their future chances<br>of delivering a baby who will have to fight his or her way through the<br>complications of prematurity.<br><br>And, speaking of prematurity, since 1973 the gestational age of viability<br>has undergone dramatic change. Justice Blackmun was told that few babies<br>below 29 weeks survived. In 2002, babies at 23 and 24 weeks frequently<br>survive. The dramatic medical progress in the care of tiny preemies makes<br>it clear that unrestricted abortion is an anachronism begging for<br>revision.<br><br>My willingness to discuss this information is not a condemnation of women<br>who have chosen abortion in the past. Their decisions were made with the<br>only information that they had available. Those who deserve criticism are<br>those whose proabortion ideology drives them to ignore the risks of<br>abortion and to block any efforts to provide women the information they<br>need to make a truly informed decision.<br><br>During the 2001 legislative session one legislator theatrically derided<br>the Woman's Right to Know bill as the "Women are Stupid bill." It got some<br>laughs at the time, but in this year's session prochoice legislators and<br>Gov. Jesse Ventura should honestly examine both the evidence and their<br>consciences. If they do, they will see that Justice Blackmun's compelling<br>interests have arrived and they will support informed consent for this<br>very serious medical procedure.<br><br></div>
