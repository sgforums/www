            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>Regnum Christi</strong></span></span><br><strong>August 21, 2005</strong><br><br><strong>Matthew 16:13-20</strong><br><br>Jesus went into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>: Lord, I come to you again in prayer. Even though I cannot see you, I know through faith that you are present in my life. I hope in your promise to be with me. I love you, and I know you love me. Accept this prayer as a token of my love. Help me to know you for who you really are and understand the spiritual truths you present to me in the Gospel.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>: Lord Jesus, grant me an experiential knowledge of you.<br><br>1. <strong>Many People Say Many Things</strong>. When Jesus asks his disciples, Â“Who do people say the Son of Man is?Â” he receives many answers. Everyone has their own opinion. Perhaps they are satisfied that their opinions are correct and so have stopped seeking; perhaps they are too lazy to pursue the truth any deeper. It is easy to say something, to throw out an answer, to draw a superficial conclusion. I must be careful not to come to a hurried conclusion or be satisfied with what might only be apparently true. Many people say many things about Christ. I must have the tenacity to pursue the profound truth about who he is.<br><br>2. <strong>How Did Peter Know</strong>?  How did Peter know that Christ was the Messiah, the Son of the living God? Peter does not say, Â“The heavenly Father told me that you are the Messiah.Â” He is probably not even aware that the Father has been working in him. Peter has been traveling with Christ, hearing him speak and seeing him work miracles. He has reflected on all this and begins to perceive that Christ is much more than just a brilliant teacher. Peter begins to see Christ for who he truly is. In the same way God works in my mind and heart, helping me to see clearly the truth of supernatural things. I may not even be aware that the heavenly Father is present, but when I sincerely strive to know Christ and am open to the action of GodÂ’s grace in my soul, I too come to know Christ for who he really is.<br><br>3. <strong>Responsibility</strong>. PeterÂ’s openness to the action of GodÂ’s grace, and his recognition of Christ as God, brings with it a responsibility Â– Peter is given the keys of the Kingdom. He is given the task of shepherding and building up the Church. Like Peter my recognition of Christ comes with a responsibility. God gives me the gift of faith and along with it a responsibility to spread his Gospel. I must take this responsibility seriously. I need to make sure that the good news of the kingdom is proclaimed to all mankind.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord, you know my weakness and the difficulties I have in prayer. Please help me to delve deep into the truth about who you are. Help me not to be satisfied with simply having some vague idea. I want to know you intimately the same way St Peter and many holy saints have known you. Grant me this grace not just for my sake but also for the sake of all those souls with whom I will come into contact.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I will make a special effort in prayer to come to know Christ better.<br><br></div>
