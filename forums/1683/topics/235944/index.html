Father U. M. Lang of the London Oratory has done that conversation a good service with his book, Turning Towards the Lord: Orientation in Liturgical Prayer (Ignatius Press).<br><br><a href="http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/15857" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicexchange.com/node/15857</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Los Angeles, Feb 13, 2007 / 09:06 am (CNA).- The company that produced The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is planning to adapt C.S. LewisÂ’ The Screwtape Letters into a major motion picture that will open in theaters nationwide in early 2008.<br><br>This is the second effort of Walden Media to bring C.S. Lewis to the big screen, following the very successful Narnia. The company also plans to release the sequel to Narnia, Prince Caspian, sometime next year.<br><br>First published in 1942, The Screwtape Letters features a series of letters between senior demon, Screwtape, and his wannabe diabolical nephew, Wormwood. As a mentor, Screwtape advises Wormwood on how to undermine the faith and promote sin to an earthly man known only as Â“the Patient.Â”<br><br>Like The Chronicles of Narnia, which grossed $744 million worldwide, The Screwtape Letters will be shot as a live-action movie.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TREVISO, Italy, JAN. 29, 2007 (Zenit.org).- The modern Catholic world suffers from three main weaknesses, says the secretary of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.<br><br>According to Bishop Giampaolo Crepaldi, Catholics during the last decades have shown the following weak points: the promotion of the notion of secularism as neutrality, thus weakening its identity; an inability to understand that the issues of life and bioethics are also social and political issues; and the failure to promote the Church's social doctrine in a systematic and comprehensive manner.<br><br>The Vatican official opened a recent seminar on "The Common Good and the Social Doctrine of the Church from the Second Vatican Council to Benedict XVI."<br><br>"We have all endured many difficult periods in our recent history," said Bishop Crepaldi at the Jan. 20 seminar, sponsored by the Italian episcopal conference. "We have not always succeeded, despite the careful guidance of the magisterium, in resisting leaps forward, partisan interpretations and the weakening of our identity.<br><br>"A theology of the separation between faith and politics has been alternating with a theology of direct engagement, while, at the same time and almost undetected, a culture of agnosticism and relativism was advancing, becoming imposing and almost dictatorial, striking the very heart of the Christian message and radically hindering its reception."<br><br>Bishop Crepaldi contended: "Once we lose sight of the fact that man is 'capax veritatis,' it is impossible to think that he can be 'capax Dei.'"<br><br>According to the prelate, the current Catholic challenge is to reflect in depth on "our own roots because the anthropological question has now become the social question."<br><br>"We will not be able to make a valid contribution to the common good," he said, "unless we expand the culture of life, from bioethics and beyond bioethics, and succeed in making it a true social and political culture."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tne end of freedom of conscience for Catholics in the UK.  Tyranny happens even in a democracy.<br><br>----------<br>London, Jan. 30, 2007 (CWNews.com) - EnglandÂ’s leading Catholic prelate has said that the government is creating a Â“new moralityÂ” with policies requiring equal treatment for same-sex couples in adoption services.<br><br>Cardinal Cormac Murphy-OÂ’Connor of Westminster told the BBC that Â“we are having a new norm for what marriage is,Â” with the introduction of the Equality Act, which bans discrimination in adoption referrals. The cardinal had sought unsuccessfully to persuade the government that Church-run agencies should be exempt from the policy.<br><br>Cardinal Murphy-OÂ’Connor said that he was still hopeful that Catholic agencies would be able to continue their adoption services, despite the conflict between the new policy and Church teachings. He did not directly oppose the Equality Act, saying: Â“The government has a right to legislate and homosexual couples are also able to adopt in other agencies but we want to hold onto this principle."<br><br>Under a Â“compromiseÂ” agreement worked out by Prime Minister Blair and his cabinet, Catholic agencies will have 21 months to bring their procedures into line with the anti-discrimination policy. Ruth Kelly, the Secretary for Communities, hailed that agreement as Â“a breakthrough that should be welcomed by everyone.Â”<br><br>Kelly, who will be responsible for implementing the anti-discrimination policy, had lobbied vigorously for an exemption for Catholic agencies-- leading some critics to say that she should be required to step down because she is committed to upholding the principles of Catholicism. But Kelly has said that she will carry out her duties under the new law.<br><br>The 21-month period before full implementation of the policy, Kelly said, should give Church agencies Â“time to adaptÂ” to the anti-discrimination rules. It is not clear, however, how Catholic institutions could adapt their policies to allow adoptions by same-sex couples-- which the Vatican has described as a form of child abuse.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Nazi idea of 'life unfit for life' is still around, this time in the United Nations.<br><br>-------------<br><strong>Vatican reemphasizes opposition to U.N. document promoting abortion of babies with disabilities</strong><br><br>Vatican City, Feb 1, 2007 (CNA).- The Press Office of the Holy See re-released today a speech given by Archbishop Celestino Migliore to the United Nations in mid-December. The speech by the Holy SeeÂ’s Permanent Observer to the U.N. in New York declares the VaticanÂ’s refusal to sign a document which claims to support the rights of individuals with disabilities, but includes a provision supporting the abortion of babies, including those with disabilities.<br><br>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was initially protested by Archbishop Migliore on December 13th, 2006 is due to be signed by member States on March 30.<br><br>In a note accompanying the talk, the archbishop recalls that, "since the beginning of work in July 2002, the Holy See has participated actively in the preparation of the document, collaborating in the insertion of explicit references to respect for the right to life and the recognition of the role of the family in the lives of disabled people. Nonetheless, in the final stage of the work, unacceptable references to 'reproductive health' have been introduced into articles 23 and 25 and, for that reason, the Holy See has decided not to adhere to the new convention."<br><br>In his English-language talk, Archbishop Migliore highlighted how "the Holy See has consistently called for disabled individuals to be completely and compassionately integrated into society, convinced that they possess full and inalienable human rights."<br><br>With reference to article 23 of the convention, he indicated that his delegation "interprets all the terms and phrases regarding family planning services, regulation of fertility and marriage in article 23, as well as the word 'gender,' as it did in its reservations and statements of interpretation at the Cairo and Beijing International Conferences," held respectively 1994 and 1995.<br><br>"Finally, and most importantly, regarding article 25 on health, and specifically the reference to sexual and reproductive health, the Holy See understands access to reproductive health as being a holistic concept that does not consider abortion or access to abortion as a dimension of those terms. ... We opposed the inclusion of such a phrase in this article, because in some countries reproductive health services include abortion, thus denying the inherent right to life of every human being, also affirmed by article 10 of the Convention. It is surely tragic that ... the same Convention created to protect persons with disabilities from all discrimination in the exercise of their rights, may be used to deny the very basic right to life of disabled unborn persons.<br><br>"For this reason," he concluded, "and despite the many helpful articles this convention contains, the Holy See is unable to sign it."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New York, Feb 26, 2007 / 07:13 am (CNA).- An Israeli archeologist says a new documentary film, which claims that a burial cave uncovered 27 years ago in Talpiot, Jerusalem, is the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth and his family, is just hype.<br><br>Professor Amos Kloner, the internationally renowned archeologist who revealed the findings of the dig 10 years ago, criticized the filmmakers' marketing strategy and said it is not based on proof, reported the Jerusalem Post.<br><br>Kloner said a similar film was released 11 years ago, and the new film, The Lost Tomb of Jesus, is simply a renewed effort to create controversy in order to make a profit.<br><br>Kloner found 10 ossuaries in a cave in 1980 but only released his findings 10 years ago. Nine of the tombs remain. Six bear inscriptions identifying them as those of Jesus, his mother Mary, a second Mary, and relatives Matthew, Josa and Judah.<br><br>The names inscribed on the coffins were very common in the Second Temple era and are not sufficient proof that the cave was the burial site of Jesus' family, Kloner reportedly said. He added that "Jesus son of Joseph" inscriptions had been found on several other ossuaries over the years.<br><br>"There is no likelihood that Jesus and his relatives had a family tomb," Kloner told the Jerusalem Post. "They were a Galilee family with no ties in Jerusalem. The Talpiot tomb belonged to a middle-class family from the 1st century CE [AD]."<br><br>The film took three years to make and it is expected to premiere at a New York press conference today. The filmmaker is Israeli-born, Canadian-based filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici. Award-winning director James Cameron is the projectÂ’s executive producer.<br><br>The Israel Antiquities Authority has loaned out two of the ossuaries, the ones the filmmakers claim belonged to Jesus and Mary Magdalene, for display at Monday's press conference. Kloner reportedly said the IAA was "very foolish" to agree to the loan.<br><br>Â“This has been a three-year journey that seems more incredible than fiction," said Jacobovici in a press release. "The idea of possibly finding the tomb of Jesus and several members of his family, with compelling scientific evidence, is beyond anything I could have imagined."<br><br>"It doesn't get bigger than this," said Cameron in the press statement. "We've done our homework; we've made the case; and now it's time for the debate to begin."<br><br>The film will be broadcast on the international Discovery Channel on March 4, as well as on Britain's Channel 4, CanadaÂ’s VisionTV and IsraelÂ’s Channel 8.</div>
