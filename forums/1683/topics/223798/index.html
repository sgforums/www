The point of not eating meat on Friday is to make a sacrifice in remembrance of Jesus. So actually, this rule can be a very personal thing.<br><br>For crosses, rosaries, crucifixes, and other sacramentals, you can go to Carlo Catholic Society. They are next to Church of St Peter and St Paul. From the Cathedral, cross the junction to the SMU Admin building. Turn left and walk past the NTUC Income building. Just follow the path and you won't miss it.<br><br>God bless.</div>

Using very basic logic, the thing is, unless you can say that you hear God talking to you directly, how do you know that you are going to the right place without the help and guidance of other people?<br><br>Why is not eating meat a strict rule?  We do it out of love of Jesus Christ, in order to remember that He died for us on Good Friday to save us from our sins.<br><br>In any case, whatever god that you have in mind, as far as we Catholics can tell, it is does not one that we worship, because our understanding of God, based on what has been revealed in the Bible, is that faith is both personal and communal.  A belief in a god that is only personal is different business altogether.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>
