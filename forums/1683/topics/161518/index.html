            <div class='col-md body'>sigh... I'm going on trip on Sat... again.  Can't watch.  Otherwise I can comment more.<br><br>I only saw part of it (less than 1/2 hour).  Some findings authenticate the bible stories, but some do not.<br><br>Eg.<br>Findings that agree with the scriptures: The bright shining star that was shining above Bethlehem was the star Jupiter, based on the astrology scientist's studies.  The shining star appeared in 6 BC and this cfm the year of Jesus' birth, which most of us have been thinking is 0 AD or 3 BC.<br><br>Findings that disprove Christians belief: Jesus was born in April, not December.  (I forgot what findings disproved Jesus' birthday being in Dec).  And also the findings disproved the belief on the wise men seeing a newborn Jesus.  The findings said that Jesus was already 8 months old when the wise men saw him.  It also mentioned something about Jesus' birth place not being in a stable or something.<br><br>See lah... I only managed to catch a bit here and there only.  I hope there will be another re-run after Sat.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>That seriously, can impair the work of any seriously self respecting archaeologist<br></blockquote><strong>That is why the narrator never made a definitive conclusion</strong>. He concluded its a strong possibilty<br><br>It can be seen he did extensive research into history, astronomy,etc<br>Also the other evidence he used like the painting in the Cologne cathedral wall depicting St.Helena , the phonican dye used on the garment of the magi,the cranium examination on the skulls from the photograph,etc make it a strong possibility that the skulls are really of the 3 magi.<br><br><blockquote><br>Findings that disprove Christians belief: Jesus was born in April, not December.  (I forgot what findings disproved Jesus' birthday being in Dec).  And also the findings disproved the belief on the wise men seeing a newborn Jesus.<br></blockquote>The Church(Catholic) never claimed He was born on Dec 25, rather the Church uses Dec 25 more for the purposes of having a symbolic celebration of what Christ's birth into the world means.Its just popular(majority) trend to think Christ was born on that day.<br><br>Fr.Richards Ambrose once had a homily on this regarding the common misconception that Christians think we celebrate Christ birth on Dec 25 means that was the day He was born.<br><br><blockquote><br>Was it mentioned in the show that they were not allowed to examine?<br>How come?<br></blockquote>I guess they scared something might happen because its old, the casket hasn't been open for centuries.So for now only the last taken photograph of the skulls will have to do.<br><br></div>
