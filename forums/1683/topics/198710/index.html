            <div class='col-md body'>Living the Rich Life<br>Fr. C.J. McCloskey, III, STD<br><br>1.	Live modestly, given your wealth and position<br><br>Â“Have the mentality of the parents of a poor and large family,Â” as the founder of Opus Dei, Blessed Josemaria Escriva, put it. People should be surprised if they were to learn about the extent of your financial resources. Always look to live at a level a step or two down from your peers. Avoid ostentation, and be the last (not the first) on your block to acquire the latest luxury gadget. Be wary of multiplying your possessions. How many computers, televisions, cars, and so forth, do you really need?  When in doubt downgrade rather than upgrade.<br><br>2.	Give and give generously-now-following the suggestion of Mother Teresa: Â“Give until it hurts.Â”<br><br>Give prudently according to your religious, political, and social goals. Do not generally leave money to foundations, trusting other people to follow your goals, unless you have moral certainty that they will do so, or unless the foundation is set up to liquidate itself quickly, at a fixed time after your death. Follow the ambition of the noted Catholic philanthropist and founder of Legatus, Tom Monaghan, and the late William E. Simon, former Secretary of the Treasury, Â“to die broke.Â” Your bank account should be as close to zero as possible upon your death. The more money you earn, the higher the percentage that should be given away. And just as you try to live below your income level, you should try to give above it. People should be surprised to learn that someone who earns Â“onlyÂ” so much is giving so generously to a good cause.<br><br>3.	Leave very little money to your children.<br><br>DonÂ´t ruin the lives of your children by tempting them not to work as hard as you have. The evidence is quite clear: children who are born into privilege rarely have the opportunity to experience the joy that comes from struggling and winning. Or to put it negatively, if youÂ´re financially set for life when you turn 21, there is an awful temptation to laziness and indulgence. Generally, large inherited wealth creates huge divisions in families with the subsequent familial and personal tragedies: divorces, addictions, suicides.<br><br>4.	Have a big family; you can afford it!<br><br>Having a large number of children around the house will do wonders to ensure that you live with a certain amount of poverty and detachment. Just consider the college payments, for one thing! At the very least, communicate this message loud and clear to your children and grandchildren: that your family takes a generous approach to the acceptance of children. Both Western Europe and the United States and Canada are committing ever more rapid demographic suicides through contraception. The population growth in virtually all of the countries on these continents is well below the replacement rate, in many cases alarmingly so. Regardless of governmental policy, it will be only loving and generous couples who will assure the possibility of a future Â“culture of life.Â”<br><br>5.	Keep in mind that it is part of GodÂ´s plan for most people to live in a family, and to find their joy there.<br><br>As Pope John Paul put it, Â“The future of the Church passes through the family.Â” Individualism and consumerism tend to erode family bonds. Listen to the conversations in your household. They should frequently deal with God, persons, and service, and be positive in tone. Frequent discussion of acquisition reflects a family that lives only for this world, with little thought for the next. Make sure that no one in your family can honestly wear the T shirt that I used to see when I worked as a chaplain on an Ivy League campus, which said, Â“He who dies with the most toys, wins!Â” Life is service, not acquisition. Look to be, not to have.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>6.	Throw out or give away what you donÂ´t need.<br><br>Objects that we own but which we donÂ´t use, over the course of time, begin in a curious way to take possession of us until one day we wake up tied down like Gulliver in the land of the Lilliputians.  Having a relatively few possessions is a fine way to live social justice, as one can readily give them away or sell them and thus convert them into money that can be given to the needy. If you havenÂ´t used something in the last year, you probably donÂ´t need it. Make things last. Remember that attachments to the material things in the world will have eventually to be burnt away in Purgatory if we are to enter into heaven; it is better to gain detachment now rather than later.<br><br>7.	Live order and neatness in the care of material items.<br><br>Happily, increasingly many objects of personal and family use, from cars to shavers, are better made and last longer without repairs. We should take as good care of them as would Jeeves if he were working full time for us.<br><br>8.	Avoid impulse buying, whims, and caprices.<br><br>Much of our market economy is based on efforts to entice us to buy superfluous things, or to buy too much of truly useful things (Super-Size it!), and the marketing moguls are very good at their work.  Look at your closet, clothes drawers, basement, or garage to see the results of impulse shopping. Or for that matter just look at the weight registered on your bathroom scale. Consult with your spouse before making purchases. Review carefully at the end of each month where your money has gone, through a careful examination of your bank and credit card statements. Ask yourself what good you could have done with the money if you had not spent it on yourself.<br><br>9.	Avoid occasions of sin, remote or proximate, in respect to buying and shopping-whether in shopping malls, via catalogues, or on the Internet.<br><br>For some people the temptation comes in computer stores; for others it may be bookshops or golf equipment shops, and for still others virtually any store is enough to make them feel almost powerless, with the credit card seemingly jumping out of the wallet or purse. Stay away from your particular source of temptation toward conspicuous consumption.  The Internet may be the most insidious form of Â“concupiscence of the eyes,Â” and it is a mistake to think that the pornographic sites are the only temptations. A few clicks and your Â“shopping basketÂ” can be filled to overflowing. DonÂ´t create needs for yourself. He has most who needs least. Could you do without?<br><br>10.	Make time for at least one corporal work of mercy each week, alone or with friends or family.<br><br>Â“Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do unto me.Â” This understanding is essential. You and your family may pass weeks or months without being exposed to the real misery of the human condition in our antiseptic society. Paradoxically, in the worldÂ´s most prosperous country, there are more lonely, aged, addicted, imprisoned, exploited, ravaged, and homeless people than in most of the worldÂ´s impoverished countries. These unhappy Americans donÂ´t really need more checks or more government programs. They need your company and your love.<br><br>11.	Follow the Way of the Cross and meditate often on our LordÂ´s passion, death, and resurrection.<br><br>It is there that you will find what counts. All the rest is dross. Measure everything by that standard.  Zacchaeus, the rich man, had to climb up a tree in order to see Jesus clearly. The tree you have get up on is the Cross. The Holy Father tries to make the Way of the Cross, at least briefly, each day. Can you excuse yourself, then, on the grounds that you donÂ´t have time?<br><br>12.	Make poverty, detachment, and generosity a regular topic in your sacramental confession and spiritual direction.<br><br>Let your spiritual advisor be demanding of you in this regard. In order to have Christ fill us up through the sacraments, prayer, and Sacred Scripture, we have continually to be emptying ourselves out in every sense, not only internally but also externally. At the moment of our particular judgment, we will not be Â“naked to our enemies,Â” but transparent to our friend. We need to be completely stripped of anything that is not Christ, so we can receive the reward that awaits us.<br><br>Overcoming the culture of death<br><br>Naturally, all of the steps in this program apply to us all. But the rich, powerful, and influential have a special responsibility to try to struggle with these particular challenges, since they run a greater risk of the loss of their souls, in light of the gifts that have been bestowed upon them for GodÂ´s glory and service to others.<br>Rodney Stark, in his insightful book The Rise of Christianity, points out that-contrary to conventional wisdom and historical analysis-in the first several centuries of Christianity, the Gospel was most successfully preached not to the poor and the outcasts, but rather to the prosperous middle classes and educated upper classes in the cities. As early as the 2nd century there were society matrons and members of the EmperorÂ´s household and high officers of the Roman army who had become Christians. If the vision of John Paul II is to come to pass in this new century, bringing a Â“new springtime of the Church,Â” which over time can help to create a Â“civilization of love and truthÂ” in our society, then the elite must become not only devout and apostolic but also Â“poor in spirit.Â”<br>If you are rich, how should you pursue that end? I have offered some ideas, but you have to answer the question for yourself in the intimacy of your prayer and spiritual direction. However I would make one more suggestion: Seek the intercession of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Â“the Star of the New Evangelization.Â” Maybe she can explain why it is that our consumerist, individualistic, and hedonistic society in North America produces so many unhappy, lonely, violent, and neurotic people, while south of the border in Mexico so many people-poor by our standards-are so happy. She appeared to a humble Indian, not to a rich man. We can ask her intercession to find our happiness in the Cross and Resurrection of her Son, and not in acquisition.<br><br>Father C.J.
