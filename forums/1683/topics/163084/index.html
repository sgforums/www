            <div class='col-md body'>The Holy Rosary is God's gift to mankind. Let us learn more about this devotion.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History of the Holy Rosary</span></strong><br><br>The traditional story of the rosary was that Mary herself appeared to Saint Dominic in the twelfth century. At that time, tradition says she gave him the rosary and promised Dominic that if he spread devotion to the rosary, his religious order would flourish. It is quite true that Dominic was quite devoted to the Blessed Mother, but no one knows for sure if Our Lady herself gave Dominic the rosary. If she did, it is quite certain that she did not give him a rosary that looks like the one we have today.<br><br>Originally the rosary had 150 beads, the same number of psalms in the Bible. In the twelfth century, religious orders recited together the 150 Psalms as a way to mark the hours of the day and the days of the week. Those people who didnÂ’t know how to read wanted to share in this practice, so praying on a string of 150 beads or knots began as a parallel to praying the psalms. It was a way that the illiterate could remember the Lord and his mother throughout the day. The Â“Divine OfficeÂ”; the official prayer of the church; is the recitation of the psalms over a four week period, and is still prayed today.<br><br>This first rosary was prayed as we do today, a person would pass their fingers over each bead and say a prayer, usually the Â“Our FatherÂ”. The Â“Hail MaryÂ” as we know it wasnÂ’t even around at that time.<br><br>The Hail Mary owes its origin to the rosary. When people said the rosary in the twelfth century, GabrielleÂ’s greeting Â“Hail Mary, full or grace, the Lord is with theeÂ” was often said along with the Our Father. Later, ElizabethÂ’s greeting Â”blessed are you among womenÂ” was added. It was not until the sixteenth century that the words Â“Holy Mary., Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our deathÂ” were added.<br><br>Various people have added other things to the rosary over the centuries. In the fifteenth century, a Carthusian monk divided the rosary into fifteen brackets (or decades) and a Dominican assigned mysteries to each of the decades. These mysteries were events in the life of Jesus as written in the gospels. By meditating on these events even the illiterate could know the stories in the Bible. These decades were the same as ours except for the last two Glorious mysteries. In those two, the Coronation and the Assumption together made up the fourteenth decade and the fifteenth decade was the Last Judgment.<br><br>On October 16, 2002, Pope John Paul II, declared that the following year would be the Â“Year of the RosaryÂ”. For the first time in centuries a change was made in the rosary. The Pope added and defined 5 new mysteries that concerned events in the public life of Jesus. These new mysteries were called the Â“Luminous MysteriesÂ” or Â“Mysteries of LightÂ” TodayÂ’s complete rosary is now made up of twenty decades of the Hail Mary, separated by an Our Father and a Glory Be and sometimes the Fatima prayer. Evidence again that the rosary is a living prayer that grows with the church. We usually break the rosary into four sets. The four sets are The Joyful Mysteries, The Sorrowful Mysteries, The Glorious Mysteries, and the Luminous Mysteries. One set is prayed on a rosary that has five decades. Each set is prayed on designated days of the week. There are variations however, and in some countries the rosary may even have different mysteries.<br><br>Despite all the additions and changes, the important core of the rosary has always remained the same. It is a way for GodÂ’s people to make holy the day, and to remember the life of Jesus and his mother. May these humble origins always be with us each time we pray the rosary.<br><br><a href="http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/features/theholyrosary/origins.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/features/theholyrosary/origins.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to pray the Rosary</strong></span><br><br>1. Beginning with the Rosary's Cross: Begin as with all prayers In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. (making the sign of the Cross while doing that)<br><br>2. On the single bead just above the cross, pray the Apostles Creed. This and all prayers of the rosary are meditative prayers<br><br>3. The next cluster of beads are 3 bead, the "Hail Mary" prayer is said on these three beads.  You pray the 3 Hail Marys while meditating on the three divine virtues of faith, hope, and love/charity.<br><br>4. On the next bead, which is a single bead, you announce the first divine mystery of contemplation.  For example, if it were a Monday, you would say the first Joyful Mystery is "The Annunciation", at this point you pray the "Our Father" prayer.<br><br>5. Now this will bring you to the first decade, or set of 10 beads of the Rosary.  You will then pray 10 Hail Marys while contemplating the first mystery, example: The Annunciation.<br><br>6. After the 10th Hail Mary you will have completed the first of 5 decades which make up a Chaplet of the Rosary. You now come to another single bead, at this point, you pray the... Glory be to the Father... then (on the same bead) pray the O My Jesus... then (on the same bead) announce the next or second mystery. For example: if its Monday and your praying the Joyful Mysteries, the second Joyful Mystery is The Visitation.   At this point you pray the Our Father....<br><br>7. You will now come to the second decade or group of 10 beads, you will now pray the 10 Hail Marys while contemplating the appropriate mystery.<br><br>8. You continue to pray the rosary the same way throughout. If your intention is to pray a Chaplet (a single set of mysteries) at the end of the fifth mystery you will come back to the joiner, this is where the decades all join with the lower part of the rosary which contains the cross.  When you come to the joiner, you decide whether or not you wish to say another Chaplet or end.  If you decide to say another Chaplet you simply announce the next mystery and continue. If you wish to end, you simply say the Glory Be To The Father, the O My Jesus, The Our Father and end the rosary with the Hail Holy Queen and the sign of the Cross........<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v281/at0m1c/therosary.jpg"><br><br><a href="http://www.catholic.org/clife/prayers/rosary.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/clife/prayers/rosary.php</a><br><a href="http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/features/theholyrosary/sayingtherosary.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/features/theholyrosary/sayingtherosary.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prayers of the Rosary</strong></span><br><br>THE APOSTLE'S CREED: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried, He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.       THE OUR FATHER:  Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.

Amen.<br><br>THE DOXOLOGY: Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end.  Amen. (this prayer is optional and may be said after all Glory Be to the Fathers.....)<br><br>O my Jesus, have mercy on us. Forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Take all souls into heaven, especially, those most in need of thy mercy. Amen.<br><br>THE HAIL MARY: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

Amen.<br><br>THE SALVE REGINA (Hail Holy Queen):  Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life our sweetness and our hope.  To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary!<br><br>V: Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God<br><br>R: That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.<br><br>LET US PRAY: O God, by the life, death and resurrection of Your only begotten Son, You purchased for us the rewards of eternal life; grant, we beseech You that while meditation on these  mysteries of the Holy rosary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><br>FATIMA PRAYER: Most Holy Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - I adore thee profoundly.  I offer Thee the most precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges and indifferences whereby He is offended.  And through the infinite merits of His Most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg of Thee the conversion of poor sinners.<br><br>"Let this prayer be echoed all over the world." -   Mary<br><br>Fatima Prayer: My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love You.  I beg pardon of You for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope, and do not love You.<br><br>Mary, Queen of the Holy Rosary, pray for us. Mary, Queen of Peace, pray for us. Mary, Our Loving Mother, pray for us.<br><br>MEMORARE: Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary that never was it known that anyone who fled to Your protection, implored Your help, or sought Your intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, we fly to you, O Virgin of virgins, our Mother. To You we come; before You we stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not our petitions, but in Your mercy, hear and answer us.  Amen.<br><br></div>

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the rosary, shall receive signal graces.<br><br>II.   I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the rosary.<br><br>III.  The rosary shall be a powerful armor against hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br><br>IV.   It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the heart of men from the love of the world and its vanities, and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.  Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br><br>V.    The soul which recommend itself to me by the recitation of the rosary, shall not perish.<br><br>VI.   Whoever shall recite the rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not by an unprovided death; if he be just he shall remain in the grace of God, and become worthy of eternal life.<br><br>VII.  Whoever shall have a true devotion for the rosary shall not die without the sacraments of the Church.<br><br>VIII. Those who are faithful to recite the rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death they shall participate in the merits of the saints in paradise.<br><br>IX.   I shall deliver from purgatory those who have been devoted to the rosary.<br><br>X.    The faithful children of the rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in heaven.<br><br>XI.   You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the rosary.<br><br>XII.  All those who propagate the holy rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br><br>XIII. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the rosary shall have for intercessors the entire celestial court during their life and at the hour of death.<br><br>XIV.  All who recite the rosary are my son, and brothers of my only son Jesus Christ<br><br>XV.   Devotion of my rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br><br></div>
