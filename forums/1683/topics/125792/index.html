            <div class='col-md body'>International News Story<br>Pope John Paul II Is Laid to Rest<br><br>VATICAN CITY - Presidents, prime ministers and kings joined pilgrims and prelates in St. Peter's Square on Friday to bid an emotional farewell to Pope John Paul II at a funeral service that drew millions to Rome for the largest gathering of the powerful and the humble in modern times.<br><br><img src="http://www.catholic.org/images/ins_news/2005040931.jpg"><br><span class="small"><br>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, center, blesses the coffin containing the body of Pope John Paul II, during the funeral mass in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, Friday April 8, 2005. </span><br><br>Applause rang out in the wind-whipped square as John Paul's plain cypress coffin, adorned with a cross and an "M" for the Virgin Mary, was brought out from St. Peter's Basilica and placed on a carpet in front of the altar. The book of the Gospel was placed on the coffin and the wind lifted the pages.<br><br>After the Mass ended, bells tolled and 12 pallbearers with white gloves, white ties and tails presented the coffin to the crowd one last time, and then carried it on their shoulders back inside the basilica for burial Â— again to sustained applause from the hundreds of thousands in the square, including dignitaries from more than 80 countries.<br><br>Chants of "Santo! Santo!" Â— urging John Paul to be elevated to sainthood immediately Â— echoed in the square.<br><br>The first non-Italian pope in 455 years was buried at 2:20 p.m. (8:20 a.m. EDT) in the grotto under the basilica, the Vatican said.<br><br>John Paul requested in his last will and testament to be interred "in the bare earth," and he was laid to rest among the pontiffs from centuries past near the tomb traditionally believed to be of the apostle Peter, the first pope.<br><br>His tomb will be covered with a flat stone bearing his name and the dates of his birth and death. Pilgrims will eventually be able to visit.<br><br>The 2 1/2-hour Mass began with the Vatican's Sistine Choir singing the Gregorian chant, "Grant Him Eternal Rest, O Lord." Cardinals wearing white miters walked onto the square, their red vestments blowing in the breeze.<br><br>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, dean of the College of Cardinals, a close confidant of John Paul and a possible successor, presided at the Mass and referred to him as our "late beloved pope" in a homily that traced the pontiff's life from his days as a factory worker in Nazi-occupied Poland to his final days as the head of the world's 1 billion Catholics.<br><br>Interrupted by applause at least 10 times, the usually unflappable German-born Ratzinger choked up as he recalled one of John Paul's last public appearances Â— when he blessed the faithful from his studio window on Easter.<br><br>"We can be sure that our beloved pope is standing today at the window of the father's house, that he sees us and blesses us," he said to applause, even among the prelates, as he pointed up to the third-floor window above the square.<br><br>"Today we bury his remains in the earth as a seed of immortality Â— our hearts are full of sadness, yet at the same time of joyful hope and profound gratitude," Ratzinger said in heavily accented Italian.<br><br>He said John Paul was a "priest to the last" and said he had offered his life for God and his flock "especially amid the sufferings of his final months."<br><br>Ratzinger was interrupted again toward the end of the Mass by several minutes of cheers, rhythmic applause and shouts of "Giovanni Paolo Santo" or "Saint John Paul," from the crowd. The eruption of cheers came right before the Litany of Saints chant, in which the names of the saints are read.<br><br>The Mass ended with everyone standing and singing together: "May the angels accompany you into heaven, may the martyrs welcome you when you arrive, and lead you to Holy Jerusalem."<br><br>At least 300,000 people filled St. Peter's Square and spilled out onto the wide Via della Conciliazione leading toward the Tiber River, but millions of others watched on giant video screens set up across Rome. Banners read "Santo Subito," or "Sainthood Immediately."<br><br>Earlier, groggy pilgrims who had camped out on the cobblestones awoke in their sleeping bags to hordes of the faithful stepping over them as they tried to secure a good spot to view the Mass.<br><br>The square and the boulevard leading to it were a sea of red and white flags waved by pilgrims from John Paul's beloved Poland, many in traditional dress shouting "Polska! Polska!" Pilgrims from other countries raised their national flags in the crowd Â— American, Lebanese, Spanish, Croatian Â— and prayers were read out during the Mass in a host of languages Â— French, Swahili, Portuguese, among others.<br><br>"We just wanted to say goodbye to our father for the last time," said Joanna Zmijewsla, 24, who traveled for 30 hours with her brother from a town near Kielce, Poland, arriving at St. Peter's at 1 a.m. Friday.<br><br>American Archbishop James Harvey, head of papal protocol, greeted dignitaries and religious leaders as they emerged onto the steps of the basilica. Many shook Harvey's hand and offered condolences before mingling and taking their appointed seats.<br><br>Turbans, fezzes, yarmulkes, black lace veils, or mantillas, joined the "zucchettos," or skull caps, of Catholic prelates on the steps of St. Peter's in an extraordinary mix of religious and government leaders from around the world.<br><br>"I'm here because I'm a believer but also to live a moment in history," said Stephan Aubert, wearing a French flag draped over his shoulders.<br><br>Vatican ushers seated dignitaries who were given a chance to view John Paul's body before it was carried out of the basilica Â— where it has lain in state since Monday Â— and into the square.<br><br>Bells tolled as the final leaders took their places on red-cushioned wooden seats. Ten minutes before the scheduled start of the funeral, the U.S. delegation arrived, headed by President Bush, and including his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton.<br><br>President Bush sat on the aisle in the second row, next to his wife, Laura. Beside them were French President Jacques Chirac and his wife, Bernadette. The two presidents shook hands.<br><br>Rome itself was at a standstill. Just after midnight Thursday, a ban took effect on vehicle traffic in the city center. Airspace was closed, and anti-aircraft batteries outside the city were on alert. Naval ships patrolled both the Mediterranean coast and the Tiber River near Vatican City, the tiny sovereign city-state encompassed by the Italian capital.<br><br>Italian authorities took extraordinary precautions to protect the royalty and heads of state or government attending the funeral.<br><br>Elite Carabinieri paramilitary police armed with automatic rifles were stationed at virtually every major intersection in Rome to minimize the threat of a terrorist attack on the more than 80 heads of state and monarchs attending the Mass.<br><br>Combat jets from Italy's air force, joined by an AWACS surveillance plane deployed by NATO, guarded against any strike from above on the leaders and top Roman Catholic prelates assembled on St. Peter's Square. Italian security agencies posted snipers on rooftops, and a navy warship armed with torpedoes cruised the coastline near Rome. Anti-aircraft rocket launchers were placed strategically around the capital.<br><br>Jewish and Muslim leaders were among the dignitaries from more than 80 countries, including the presidents of Syria and Iran, and the king of Jordan.<br><br>The pope's death on Saturday at age 84 has elicited a remarkable outpouring of affection around the world and brought an estimated 4 million people to Rome, doubling its population. Most of the pilgrims, however, can only hope to see the ceremony on giant TV screens that have been erected around the Vatican and in piazzas around Rome.<br><br>In Krakow, Poland, where John Paul studied for the priesthood, about 800,000 people watched the funeral on three TV screens set up in a field. Many had spent the night around bonfires after a Thursday night Mass drew a million people.<br><br>Sirens wailed in Warsaw for three minutes to announce the start of the funeral to the Polish capital. Some 25,000 people packed Pilsudski Square where the pope celebrated Mass during his first visit to his homeland as pope, and another 2,000 gathered in the Old Town in front of St. Ann's Church to watch the funeral on huge screens.<br><br>The faithful gathered in the Philippines, Vietnam and elsewhere to watch the service on television or to pray for John Paul. An overflow crowd of about 7,000 worshippers filled Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.<br><br>Before the Mass, there was an intimate ceremony attended only by high-ranking prelates, who placed a pouch of silver and bronze medals and a scrolled account of his life in his coffin.<br><br>His longtime private secretary, Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, and the master of the liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Piero Marini, placed a white silk veil over the pope's face before the coffin was closed.<br><br>Dziwisz was seen weeping at several occasions during the Mass.<br><br>The Vatican released John Paul's last will and testament on the eve of the funeral. Penned in Polish over 22 years, beginning five months after his election in October 1978, he gave instructions for his burial and also told his private secretary to burn his personal notes upon his death.<br><br>He also suggested he considered resigning in 2000, when his infirmities were already apparent. Revising his will just three days before a historic pilgrimage to the Holy Land, John Paul prayed that God would "help me to recognize up to what point I must continue this service."<br><br>On Thursday, the huge bronze doors of St. Peter's were closed to the public in preparation for the Mass. In four days, some estimates say nearly 2 million pilgrims passed by his bier to pay their last respects.<br><br>Rome groaned under the weight of visitors. Side streets were clogged in a permanent pedestrian rush hour, mostly by kids with backpacks. Tent camps sprang up at the Circus Maximus and elsewhere around the city to take the spillover from hotels. Hawkers jacked up prices of everything from bottled water to papal trinkets.<br></div>

A few people wiped tears from their eyes as the pope's simple wooden casket was shown.<br><br>"I just was moved to see it with other Christians," said 26-year-old Magdalene Pesch. "It's a good devout atmosphere in which to do it."<br><br>The funeral drew millions to Rome for one of the largest religious gatherings of modern times. Presidents, prime ministers and kings joined pilgrims and prelates in St. Peter's Square on Friday to bid farewell to the pope.<br><br>In Chicago, which has one of the largest Polish populations outside of Warsaw, parishioners filled the Five Holy Martyrs Church and mourned the death of a countryman who brought dignity and freedom to their homeland.<br><br>The Polish-born pope made five trips to the United States Â— more than any other pontiff. He celebrated Mass at the church each time he visited Chicago in 1969, 1976 and then as pope in 1979. He last visited the United States in 1999.<br><br>In Los Angeles, dozens watched the services on a large-screen television at Our at Lady of the Bright Mount church, which the pope visited in 1976.<br><br>Stan Czerwinski, 49, and his wife traveled about 50 miles from their home in Camarillo to watch the funeral at the church, which has a mostly Polish congregation.<br><br>"We're sad and we are happy because now we know he is in heaven," Czerwinski said.<br><br>A group of firefighters in Holyoke, Mass., watched in the basement of their brick fire station.<br><br>"John Paul II was not only a strong leader, he was a genuinely good person. He practiced what he preached. And you can see that in the way everybody Â— the whole world Â— has come together today," said Lt. Jeff Przekowpowski.<br><br>About 150 people watched the funeral on two large screens at the National Shrine of the Little Flower Catholic church in Royal Oak, Mich., a suburb of Detroit.<br><br>"At home, it wouldn't be as special, but at church, it would be more special," said 8-year-old McKenna Lynch, who came to church with her mother, Janie.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Vatican Report: Outline of Funeral Rites for Papal Burial<br><br>VATICAN CITY (AP) - The funeral for Pope John Paul II begins Friday with an intimate ceremony attended only by high-ranking prelates, who place a pouch of silver and bronze medals and a scrolled account of his life in his coffin.<br><br><img src="http://www.catholic.org/images/ins_news/2005041821.jpg"><span class="small">Altar boys pray as people watch the funeral of Pope John Paul II on a videoscreen as they take part in an open air mass commemorating Pope John Paul II in Krakow, southern Poland.</span><br><br>Royalty or dignitaries from more than 80 countries wait outside when the private rites begin at 10 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT).<br><br>John Paul's longtime private secretary, Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, and the master of the liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Piero Marini, place a white silk veil over the pope's face before the coffin is closed.<br><br>The funeral Mass, scheduled to last about 2 1/2 hours, is celebrated by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, deacon of the College of Cardinals, and joined by the cardinals and patriarchs of the Eastern Rite Churches, all in red vestments.<br><br>Based on the Vatican's book of liturgical ceremonies, published in 2000, the Mass begins with an introductory hymn, "Eternal Rest Grant Him, O Lord," followed by the singing of Psalm 64 (65) "To You We Owe Our Hymn of Praise, O God of Zion."<br><br>The prayer for the pope is read by a celebrant. Then the following texts are read:<br><br>The First Reading:<br><br>_ Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 10, verses 34-43, known as Peter's Speech.<br><br>_ The Psalm 22 (23), "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want."<br><br>The Second Reading:<br><br>_ Letters of St. Paul to the Philippians, 3:20-4:1, "But our citizenship is in heaven."<br><br>_ John, 6:40, "For this is the will of my father that everyone who sees the son and believes in him may have eternal life."<br><br>_ John, 21:15-19, dialogue between Jesus and Peter, "Follow me."<br><br>The homily follows the reading of the Gospel. The Communion song is Psalm 129 (130), "Out of the depths I cry to you O Lord, Lord hear my voice."<br><br>During the rite of Final Commendation and Farewell, the cardinals approach the coffin and the deacon calls all to prayer with the following words:<br><br>"Dear brothers and sisters let us entrust to the most gentle mercy of God, the soul of our Pope John Paul II. ... May the Blessed Virgin Mary ... intercede with God so that he might show the face of his blessed Son to our Pope, and console the church with the light of the resurrection."<br><br>A choir sings the Litany of the Saints. The names of saints canonized by John Paul II may be added to the long list.<br><br>The patriarchs, the archbishops and the metropolitans of the Eastern Rite churches approach the coffin, pray for the soul of the deceased pope and bless the body with incense.<br><br>Then after a moment of silent prayer, the deacon sprays the body with holy water and blesses it with incense.<br><br>The funeral Mass ends with all standing and together singing: "May the angels accompany you into heaven, may the martyrs welcome you when you arrive, and lead you to Holy Jerusalem."<br><br>Then the prelates leave the altar in procession, bearing the coffin from the basilica down the steps of St. Peter to the Vatican grotto.<br><br>Here the coffin is definitively closed with red bands, sealed with both papal and Vatican seals. The coffin is placed in a second casket of zinc, and within a third of walnut. This outside casket bears the name of the pope, his cross and his papal coat of arms.<br><br>The service is not open to the public, but is witnessed by top Vatican prelates. The camerlengo, or chamberlain, Cardinal Eduardo Martinez Somalo, performs the rite, concluding with the words: "Lord, grant him eternal rest, and may perpetual light shine upon him."<br><br>They then sing the hymn, "Salve Regina."<br></div>
