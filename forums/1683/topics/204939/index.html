(Lk 4: 1-12; Job 1: 6-12)<br><br>"Yes, Lord, now I have everybody captive,<br>(well nearly everybody down there).<br>I set traps, I used the baits of temptation,<br>I know well what each one of them can't resist.<br>I nearly caught them all!" (I Pet 5: 8-9; Eph 6: 10-17)<br><br>"What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.<br>and He was praying to God the Father.<br><br>Satan answered "Oh, I am going to have some fun with them!"<br><br>I'll make them divorce after they have married<br>so the foundation of humanity will never be able to be<br>established<br>"the family" (Mt 19: 4-6; Mal 2: 16)<br><br>I will make them hate each other and abuse each other,<br>make them fall into alcohol and drugs without control. (Rom 13: 12-14)<br><br>I will teach them to make weapons and bombs,<br>so they kill each other<br><br>"I am really going to have fun!"<br><br>"And when you are tired of playing with them, what will you do?"<br>Jesus asked. And continued praying<br><br>"Oh, I will kill them all and their souls will be mine forever"<br>"Lord by all respect, it's their decision" (I Jn 3: 8-10)<br><br>"How much do you want for all of them?" Jesus asked.<br><br>"Oh, you can't want these people. They aren't anything good.<br>Why do you want them if they neither follow you nor love you?<br>Many hate you! I have seen many of them spitting on you, cursing you and even denying you."<br>"What's more, they love me a lot" (Mt 24: 10-13)<br><br>"You don't want these people!!"<br><br>"How much?" Jesus asked again<br><br>Satan looked at him with a nasty face<br><br>"All your tears and all your<br>blood,<br>all the pain of the entire world, all together" (Is 53: 4-10; I Pet 2: 24)<br><br>Jesus said..."DONE"<br><br>"and He paid the price" (II Cor 5: 21)<br><br>How<br>terrible it is that people don't seek for God,<br>and then ask themselves why the world is going to hell!<br><br>How terrible that we seek the newspaper everyday to read tragedies<br><br>and we never seek the Bible<br><br>How insensible it is how everybody wants to go to heaven,<br>thinking they can get there without having to<br>believe,<br>without loving God above all things,<br>or doing what the Bible says...the Laws of God.<br><br>It is terrible how some people can say "I believe in God"<br>but still follow Satan (Who as matter of fact, does fear God)<br>(II Tim 4: 3-4; II Jn 1: 7-11)<br><br>Don't you think it's pathetic how they send<br>each other thousands of jokes by email,<br>so they spread like plagues.<br><br>But when it's about the Lord's messages,<br>we think about it twice before we share them;<br>and we leave the mailboxes of our friends without this message<br><br>Don't you think it is outrageous that the obscene,<br><br>vulgar and crude is allowed freely to pass through the internet<br>that even many people would desire to get into the screen.<br><br>But it is forbidden to speak publicly about Jesus<br>in the schools, places of work<br>self-helping groups, etc... (Acts 4: 19-20)<br><br>Even after knowing what He did for us.<br>Because the Romans didn't kill Him. It was our sin.<br>that we may be forgiven<br>and know Him in His glory with the Father.<br><br>Doesn't it seem incredible to you how somebody can be alight<br>on Sabbath in the Church,<br>worshipping and thanking the Lord for His mercy,<br>for one more day to live etc.<br><br>But during the rest of the week he is an invisible Christian! (II Tim 3: 1-5; Rom 10: 9-13)<br><br>Does this seem just to you?<br><br>Don't let Satan stop you sending this Mail<br>to all your contacts on the Web,<br>It doesn't matter if he tells you that many don't<br>believe this<br>Don't let him get through with his plans!<br><br>Stop worrying what the others may think about you<br>It is time to worry about what "God thinks about you"<br><br>Please brother and sister, pass it on?<br>"I already did it"<br><br>May God bless you always (II Cor 13: 13) </span><br><br>Got this from an email, hope you enjoy it and do the right thing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

What would be the criteria for determining what a 'good person' is?<br><br>If there is heaven, then admission must have some criteria, logically speaking.  It can't be the case that one decides that he/she is 'good enough' and thus gain admission, for otherwise everyone can simply think his way into heaven.  There has to be some external evaluation and judgement.<br><br>Hence the question is whether or not you are able to know with any degree of certainty that your actions have been 'good'.  Since you, like most of us, do not have perfect foresight nor complete control over things in life, your actions, however well intentioned, may have adverse consequence which you fail to foresee.  This again introduces uncertainty about how 'good' one's actions are.  And on the balance, I submit that it is easier to verify the claims of Christ than to know for sure how 'good' one's actions are.<br><br>If there is no heaven, doing good or not would make no difference, since you and the people around you would die in any case.<br><br>2. Central to the Christian position is that the claims made by Jesus are verifiable, and has been done so for 2000 years by different people in different times and places, of different backgrounds, intellect etc.<br><br>If this concerns heaven, and hence eternal joy, whatever effort put in to investigate the claims of Christianity would potentially have a 'return on investment' of inifinity.  So, what's your excuse for not making the effort?<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>
