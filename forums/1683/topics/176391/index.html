In our parish, a new priest wears one as he proceeds down the aisle of the church and during the service, I have never seen this before, only the miter of a bishop. Thank you.<br><br>Maria<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Maria</span><br><br>The hat you describe is called a biretta. Hats are usually worn for three reasons: practicality, fashion, or a symbol of rank. In the case of the biretta, it is a symbol of rank. The biretta that clerics wear today goes back to the fifteenth century. The rank of the cleric is symbolised in the colour of the biretta. Cardinals wear a red biretta, bishops a purple one, and priests a black biretta. Today, the biretta is not commonly worn by clerics below the rank of bishop.<br><br>At one time the biretta was used in the liturgy as well as other functions. Today, the biretta is optional for the celebration or con-celebration of Mass. Many priests no longer use a biretta for that reason. It can be considered a liturgical garment, however, and some priests, like the one in your parish, continue to use them. Priests may also use a black zuchetto, but it is not used by the priest at Mass. A zuchetto is a skullcap. The pope wears a white zuchetto, a cardinal wears a red one, and a bishop wears a purple zuchetto. They were originally worn to keep the head warm.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R<br><br>(Photos of biretta and other hats used by clergy in the post after the next)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope this clears up some misconceptions about the way the Church prays to men and women of God.<br><br><span style="color: green;">22 January 2006<br>3rd Sunday in Ordinary Time</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Can we pray to the saints?</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Padre</span>,<br><br>My mother is 84 years old and has had a great devotion to Padre Pio for about thirty years. She saw him say Mass in Italy and also went to him for confession. Once a month she has a prayer group that says the rosary, has prayers to the Sacred Heart, and prayers of intercession to Padre Pio. This morning the priest in her parish church announced that no one should pray to Padre Pio, only to the Lord. Does this mean that we should not pray to any saints at all? 1 would really appreciate your help with this as it would also help my mother understand.<br><br>Marie A.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Marie</span>,<br><br>The custom of asking saints for help goes back to the very early days of the Church. We have a teaching about the communion of saints and part of our understanding about this is that saints in heaven can help us. Catholics commonly ask the intercession of saints for their needs.<br><br>It is true, however, that we do not pray to the saints in the same way we pray to God. We ask the saints for help, but when we pray to God we also worship and adore God. Only God deserves worship and adoration, so we do not pray to the saints in that manner. Perhaps the priest was trying to clarify what it means to honour the saints and ask for their help. I think it is best to assume that was his intention.<br><br>We have many novenas in honor of various saints, and in all of these novenas we do not worship the saint. Rather, we make petitions, just as you describe your mother is doing, for the saint's intercession. This is a good practice. Your mother and the other members of the prayer group are free to continue it.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R.</div>

Why would people want to kill? They all know that they will go to hell. So why do they want to hurt themselves? Some people think they are hurting other people more than themselves but I think they are hurting themselves more.<br><br>Why<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Why</span>,<br><br>It is possible that some people who kill do not know what they are doing. Many people who kill others think they have good reasons, but they are wrong. We may never take an innocent life. God teaches us that in the fifth commandment. We must respect our own life and the lives of others. Some people do think they are hurting others when they are really hurting themselves. This happens not only with people who kill others, but it also happen with people who do not forgive others. We need to respect others and to do that, we must respect ourselves. We need to forgive others and so we have to forgive ourselves. If we remember that we are all the children of God then we can honor others and see them as brothers and sisters. God has made us all members of his family. Killing one another has no part in being a family. Your question is a sad one, but a wise one. You can remember never to hurt yourself and you will not then hurt others. Forgive others and respect them. You can be an example to all around you.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R.</div>

Could you explain the phrase "lead us not into temptation"? I am sure Jesus would not lead us into temptation; but would you like to explain this to me? Thank you and God bless!<br><br>Joanne White<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Joanne</span>,<br><br>The Catechism of the Catholic Church has a section on this part of the Lord's Prayer/ You can find it in articles 2846-2849. This section of the Catechism acknowledges the difficulty of translating the Greek verb in this part of the prayer. "Lead" is the word chosen, but the meaning of the verb is a request that we not enter into or yield to temptation. The word places the focus on us and our activity. It is a plea that we do nothing to put ourselves in the way of temptation.<br><br>The word "lead" is not meant to imply that Jesus would put us in the occasion of sin. You might think of the phrase "do not let us be led into temptation" at that part of the Our Father. The New Revised Standard Version translation of Matthew 6:13 and Luke 11:4 uses the words, "do not bring us to the time of trial." In the Our Father, we ask God for the grace of pleasing him and for help to stay away from anything that would separate us from him. We do not want to fall into temptation and be separated from God.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

Of course this all hinges on my core "assumption" that the year of crucifixion is known or can be accurately and precisely determined. Thank you for your time in regard to my inquiry.<br><br>Calvin E Kendall, S.RO<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Calvin</span>,<br><br>To this point, the assumption that the year of the crucifixion can be accurately and precisely determined is an uncertain assumption. The Hebrew calendar from this time has not survived intact, and so determining the time of Passover, from which the date can be known, is quite difficult.<br><br>No one has successfully demonstrated that a particular month and day was the date of the crucifixion. There are two commonly proposed dates. The first is April 7, 30 AD, and the second is April 3, 33 AD. Sir Isaac Newton proposed that the date of crucifixion was April 23, 34 AD. As you can see, the scholars cannot agree.<br><br>The exact date of the crucifixion is an intriguing question, but we do not need to know the date in modern terms to know the value of the crucifixion. We are redeemed by the Cross of Christ. The salvation that Christ offers us is ours in spite of our ignorance about the date of the crucifixion. Every time we attend Mass, we have before us the crucifixion in an un-bloody manner. We look to the grace of salvation with gratitude, even as we seek to satisfy our curiosity.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

Thanks.<br><br>Carol<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Carol</span>,<br><br>We generally dispose of palms from the previous Palm Sunday by burning them and using the ashes for Ash Wednesday. Soe parishes will have a short ceremony to burn the palms they have collected or saved from the previous Palm Sunday.<br><br>If you have a practical way of doing this at home, you may burn the palms. You do not need to do anything about the ashes. Otherwise, you may dispose of them in any practical way. Some people bury them. You should dispose of the palms from the previous year, because they are meant to be replaced by newly blessed palms on Palm Sunday.<br><br>Palms and other things such as medals, blessing, scapulars and other articles of devotion are meant to draw us closer to God. They do not bring good luck or wealth or anything of that sort. We should not try to use them in that way. The objects remind us of the goodness of God and the salvation Jesus brings us.

The Gospel of St Luke (Lk 23:42-43) has one of the thieves asking for mercy and Jesus promising him salvation. This "good thief", as he has come to be known, is Dismas. His feast day is on March 25. That date is thought to be the calendar date of the crucifixion, and it is normal to celebrate the feast of a saint on the day of his or her death.<br><br>The other thief is Gestas. He is the one who mocks Jesus from the cross. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke agree that one of the thieves mocked Jesus just as the crowd did. Luke is the only one who indicates that Dismas believed in Jesus and asked for salvation.<br><br>There is a legend that Dismas and Gestas met Jesus before the crucifixion. The legend says that when the Holy Family was fleeing to Egypt, they were attacked by the thieves Dismas and Gestas. Dismas paid Gestas to allow the family to go without trouble.

Thank you very much.<br><br>Mary Kay B.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Mary Kay</span>,<br><br>The Church has transitional deacons, who are men planning to be priests. The Church also has permanent deacons, who are men who do not plan to be priests. All unmarried men who are ordained deacons take a vow of celibacy. This is true whether or not the man later intends to be ordained a priest.<br><br>Married men who are candidates for the permanent diaconate do not take a promise of celibacy, but if, later on, they become free to marry, they may not do so without a dispensation. A married man who wishes to be ordained must have the permission of his wife.<br><br>Celibacy is the normal discipline in the Latin rite for deacons, presbyters and bishops. It is a law of the Church, and exceptions can be made in some circumstances. Sometimes married ministers from other churches wish to serve as priests and are permitted to do so without taking a promise of celibacy.<br><br>In general, a married man may serve as a deacon, but not as a presbyter or bishop. This discipline dates back many centuries. The Church views celibacy as a gift for the sake of service to the people of God.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

Did Jesus "dilute" the wine before it was blessed and shared with the Apostles?<br><br>Karen<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Karen</span>,<br><br>It is possible that the wine used at the last supper was diluted with water. Jewish writings indicate that wine at the time was very strong and was commonly diluted with water. In the Seder ritual the participants drink four cups of wine. They are supposed to drink this wine as free men. Since free men drank their wine diluted, it was common to have wine mixed with water.<br><br>The part of the preparation of gifts where water is mixed with wine may come from this practice. The water and wine symbolise different things for us. The water symbolises humanity and the wine symbolises divinity. Both humanity and divinity are found in Jesus. Jesus saves fallen humanity by divine grace. The water (fallen humanity) is enriched by the wine (divinity) so that we are renewed in Christ and no longer have to live in our sins.<br><br>There is a prater the priest prays while pouring the water into the wine: "By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity." The mixing of water and wine symbolises this prayer.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

She thinks God's just a theory or a rumour. O really believe in God and I feel strongly about him, so I don't know if our friendship will work out if she doesn't believe what I do. Should I stay friends with her, or tell her that I don't want to be friends with her because she doesn't believe what I believe?<br><br>Mary Y<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Mary</span><br><br>Friendships don't need to end because people believe different things. Staying friends may help the other person come to believe. When she sees your good example and how much faith is part of your life, she may begin to ask questions about God. This is your opportunity to remind her about your belief and God's love for all people. Helping another person in this way is something we should try to do.<br><br>It is true that we don't want to continue any associations that would weaken our faith. You say, though, that your belief is strong. If you judge that your faith is not threatened by the unbelief of your friend, you need not end your relationship.<br><br>Since she does not believe though, she may not be the kind of friend who can support you if your faith is challenged. We all have things in our lives that cause us to question our faith. If you believe some good can come from your friendship with this person in any way, you are free to continue it.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

I also recognise thaat there is more than one version of the Act of Contrition, but all forms of prayer focus on sins against God. Wouldn't it be more inclusive to examine how our sin hurt our neighbour and ourselves? Thank you.<br><br>Jim<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Jim</span>,<br><br>Every sin is against God. Most of our sins also hurt other people. When we do not love our neighbour, we sin against God, because Jesus teaches us that we cannot love God unless we love our neighbour. When you examine your conscience, you examine your behaviour towards God and others.<br><br>Our actions toward others reveal our relationship with God. We can say that we love and honour God, but those are just empty words unless we love and honour our neighbour. St John writes, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Those who say, 'I love God', but hate their brothers or sisters are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen."</span> (1 John 4:20)<br><br>We do look at how our sins hurt our neighbour and ourselves, for these are the very sins that hurt God. When we say our act of contrition, we are admitting that our sins, no matter who they hurt, are sins against God. We must keep the commandment to love God and love our neighbour. When we fail, we ask for forgiveness and grace.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

My apologies and here goes:<br><br><span style="color: red;">9 April 2006<br>Passion Sunday</span><br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why does the Mass vary so much? What about the Latin rite?</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Padre,</span><br><br>I have recently moved to Florida. I find Mass here is quite different: there is no 'penitential rite' or prayer to open the Mass; and there are no bells at the consecration. Mass seems to be people sitting in pews and looking at the readers. Where is the Mass of old?<br><br>Secondly, please tell me about the Tridentine rite, and why is it outlawed or forbidden? Thanks.<br><br>Cheryl<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Cheryl,</span><br><br>If you are speaking about Sunday Mass, then there is an option to use the sprinkling rite in place of the act of penitence. This is to recall our baptism. In the General Instructions of the Roman Missal (n. 150), a bell may be rung, according to the local custom, at the consecration. Your parish probably has a different custom from the parish you attended previously. Probably your pastor is used to doing one way of things, and your former pastor did something different.<br><br>The Latin rite, at one time, used texts for the Mass that were approved by the Council of Trent. These texts and instructions on how to celebrate Mass were used until the Second Vatican Council approved different texts. It has come to be known as the Tridentine rite, but is really the old Roman rite as revised by the Council of Trent.<br><br>Usually one needs permission to celebrate the old Roman rite, because the bishops have approved new texts and Mass instructions for use in the Latin rite the world over. It is not forbidden to use the rite, however, because permission has been given to many to celebrate the Tridentine mass.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

How do I know what my vocation is?<br><br>Matthew B<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Matthew,</span><br><br>A vocation is a call from God. There are four vocations that the Church speaks about:<br><br>- Married life is the vocation to show Christ's love for the Church by your love for your spouse.<br>- Single life is a vocation to serve God and the people of god in the daily affairs of life.<br>- Religious life is a call to show the holiness of the Church by your holiness in life.<br>- Priesthood is a call to the ordained ministry where you will celebrate the sacraments and preach the Gospel.<br><br>Sometimes, people also use vocation to mean a job or career they really like. It is important to do something you like, but that is not the same as finding your vocation.<br><br>You find your vocation by prayer, an examination of what you have the talent and ability to do, and by talking to others whom you trust. This process is often called discernment. You know that God is calling you. Through discernment, you understand what God calls you to do.<br><br>The tasks or jobs of life are different ways of ministering to God's people. They can change over time. Vocation is the way God asks us to seek him.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

My father, my brother and I play music for Mass.<br><br>Personally, I have nothing against Catholics or Catholicism. I do disagree with some of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Is it alright that I - knowing and appreciating the meaning of these actions - play music, make the Sign of the Cross, and such?<br><br>As I know that non-Catholics are not supposed to partake in the sacrament, I respect that and do not do so. But what about those other things? Am I wrong in participating in the Mass?<br><br>Respectfully,<br>S.A.M.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear S.A.M.</span><br><br>You and your family are free to participate in Mass. You are correct that non-Catholics do not take communion. The other things you mentioned are quite proper for you to do. I am glad you wish to participate in the Mass in this way.<br><br>There are many things that join all Christians together and only a few things that divide us. We all believe in the truth of the gospel, the power of God's word, God's love for us all, and God's grace to name just a few of the things that unite us. The few things that divide us, though, are significant.<br><br>For many years the Catholic Church has worked with leaders of other churches to try and heal the division among Christians. We are all members of the family of God. We can pray for the day and work for the day when the brothers and sisters of Jesus are united once again. Then, all shall eat at the table of Jesus in the kingdom of heaven. On that day, there will not be labels that divide us, but the one faith which will unite us.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

Because they are married and are one in the eyes of God, what happens to the soul of the woman? Is she guilty of her husbands mortal sin at the time of her death?<br><br>Just Wondering<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Just Wondering</span><br><br>The woman in your example is not guilty of her husband's sin. Death breaks the bond of marriage, but even so one spouse is not guilty of the sins of the other. Spouses must choose to accept the grace of marriage which makes them "one in hope, one in discipline, and one in service" (Cathechism of the Catholic Church, 1642).<br><br>The spouses grow in unity by living their marriage covenant. When they stray from the marriage covenant, they strain the unity of their marriage. The unity of marriage is a call "to grow continually in their communion through day-to-day fidelity to their marriage promise of total mutual self-giving" (Cathchism of the Catholic Church, 1644).<br><br>Spouses can act separately, but they are called to act as one, and they promised each other they would act as one. Each spouse still has radical freedom When they marry, they pledge to use that freedom for the good of the marriage covenant. When one does not, the other spouse is not responsible for the sin. the grace of the sacrament of matrimony makes it possible for them to be one, and they will find greatest happiness in unity.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>

Thanks<br><br>L.J.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear L.J.,</span><br><br>To my knowledge, the Baptists tithe, so you will still have the money issue. I have no idea if their political leanings will be more to your liking.<br><br>I'm sure you are frustrated by the homilies you hear, but I don't think it is wise to leave the Church as a protest. That has happened before, of course, and the protestors began to protest one another and now we have a great many Christian churches, where Jesus founded one Church.<br><br>Politics and religion both inspire strong feelings in people. It is inevitable though that faith and politics should come together. Our religion gives us a moral code. We cannot separate our politics from our morality. The Church is supposed to speak about right and wrong, and we are supposed to apply the teaching to every area of our lives.<br><br>Your pastor may be more insistent than other priests you have known on the issue of politics and religion. Catholics have a responsibility to be good citizens and to follow their consciences when they vote. The Church has the responsibility to help form that conscience. You might tell your pastor how you feel, but he is probably following his own convictions.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</div>
