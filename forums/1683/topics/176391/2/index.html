I don't believe Iw as ever confirmed in grade school or in high school. What is the process if I decide to be confirmed?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Greg L.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Greg,</span><br><br>People are ususally old enough to remember their confirmation, so it could be that you were not confirmed. You can check with the parish you lived in during your school years to be sure. They keep records of confirmations done in the parish. Sometimes confirmation is not thought to be very important, so it is overlooked.<br><br>Confirmation is the final sacrament of initiation. Baptism ushers us into our life with God by giving us new life, confirmation seals us with the spirit so that we can follow Jesus, and Eucharist gives us strength for the journey and keeps us in union with God.<br><br>If you wish to be confirmed, you should begin with your pastor. It is not unusual to have adult confirmations. He can tell you how your particular diocese handles confirmations for adults. There might be a program of adult catechesis for confirmation, to ensure you understand the sacrament and the teachings of the Church.<br><br>Today, we celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit into the lives of the apostles. The Spirit gave them strength for what they had to do. The Spirit will do the same at your confirmation. I encourage you to receive this sacrament.<br><br>The Padre<br>Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>

We know about our world, about ourselves, and about how we are to live on this earth. God tells us about heaven, hell, purgatory, and angels. God did not reveal anything to us about anything else he created. We can speculate about the universe and use science to answer our questions. What we find will always lead us back to God.<br><br>We believe that God is always the same. God loves everything he creates. Whether there are other planets with inhabitants, we do not know. We do know that God revealed himself to us. God sent Jesus to save us. He teaches us how to live. We can wonder and seek answers to other things, but we must still concentrate on the world God has given us.<br><br>Sometimes we think faith and science are enemies. God gives us the minds with which we inquire and the intellect that discovers the wonders of creation. There is no discovery in the universe that will threaten the love God has for us.

When we try to make judgments, we are always making our best guess. We cannot know everything that is in a person's mind and heart. We can look at actions, but there is more to us than the things we do. God knows everything about us. God is never confused.<br><br>God is the only one who knows everything so he is the only one who can judge individuals.<br><br>God does give everyone the grace necessary for salvation. We know that God wants each individual to be saved. Jesus did not come for some of us, he came for all of us. No matter how one is raised, the time comes when one is responsible for ones own choices. Not every child of a terrorist will become a terrorist. God gives everyone a chance.<br><br>God shares with us the mission of Jesus. By our love and example we want to proclaim God's love for all.

Wasn't Jesus' death caused by crucifixion?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">William L.<br><br>Dear William,</span><br><br>I think the passage you are referring to is Acts 13:29, "When they had carried out everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb." There is another reference in Galatians 3:13, "cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree," which quotes Deuteronomy 21:22-23. This reference in Deuteronomy is commonly taken to refer to crucifixion. The practice of crucifixion was cometimes carried out by attaching the person to a tree or a stake.<br><br>The gospels all agree that Jesus was crucified. There are historical sources outside the Bible that establish that the Romans used crucifixion. In both instances, the reference to the tree is made by St Paul. In Galatians 3:1, St Paul refers to Jesus' crucifixion, "It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited as crucified!" St Paul's point in the first 14 verses if Chapter 3, is that Jesus removes the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. The curse was death by crucifixion - being hung on a tree. St Paul was not confused about the way Jesus died; he used this phrase in the presence of those who would know his reference.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</span></div>

I cannot believe this of a kind and loving God. Is the Old Testament inaccurate?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jane S.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Jane,</span><br><br>The Old Testament is accurate, but sometimes our understanding is not. Most of us read a Bible that has been translated into our own language. We understand the words according to the common meaning of our time. We look at the situations and descriptions through the lens of our modern culture. Most of the time, this serves us very well, but not always.<br><br>The Church tells us that we must know what the authors wanted to affirm and what God wanted to reveal, if we want to understand sacred Scripture. Furthermore, the authors speak through their own culture and use words with meanings common to their own time. The Old Testament narates events over many centuries. God was forming his people and always acted in love and concern for them.<br><br>There can be parts of the Old Testament that shock us. We have the full revelation of God, though, in Jesus. The people of the Old Testament were still waiting for the fullness of revelation. We accept the scriptures as the inspired word of God, even when we do not understand some parts, or, when what we read portrays God in a way we do not understand.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph C.Ss.R</span></div>

He surely sems successful with conflicts among different religions, countries and within families. What does it mean that he does not want to establish peace?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">H.R.<br><br>Dear H.R.,</span><br><br>You are refering to Luke 12:51, I imagine. Here is the verse: "Do you think that I have come to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!" It does not mean that Jesus does not desire peace. After all, he is the Prince of Peace.<br><br>The verse refers to the need to make a choice. Some hear the word of God and live by it. Others hear the word of God and reject it. This division can occur even within families.<br><br>The word of God calls for a response. We either live by God's word or we do not. Those who do not live by God's word are divided from those who do. God does not cause people to be divided from one another. The choices we make determine if we live as children of God or not. The conflicts among different religions, countries, and within families is not what God desires.<br><br>We might desire peace with all people but others must share that desire to bring it about.

I thought rosary beads were for praying the rosary.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">William R.<br><br>Dear William,</span><br><br>Rosary beads are indeed for praying the rosary, and not a good luck charm. There are many, however, who do use rosary beads, medals, and pictures for good luck. Some of these people even have devotions to bring them luck. There is no luck, only God and God's provident care.<br><br>Some people have a tendency to try to sign a contract with God. They agree to do things if God will give them a special favour in return. We do good things because they are the right things to do, not because they will bring us good luck.<br><br>We pray in devotion to the saints, asking them to intercede for us. We do so knowing that God will give us what we need. Everyone has things they desire or wishes they want fufilled. God knows if these things will help us. We we need these things, God will provide them. God has never promised to provide all we desire.<br><br>We should use rosary beds for praying, and medals and pictures for devotion. To use them for good luck is superstition. God is not someone to be controlled by ceremonies and rituals. God is one whom we worship in spirit and truth.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</span></div>

It has been some time since I read this and so I have forgotten the reason. I asked my mother-in-law about this (she attended Catholic school for many years) and she has never heard this. Can you tell me if this is true and if so, what the reason behind it may be? Thank you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Colette P.<br><br>Dear Colette,</span><br><br>The practice of using holy water at the door of the church is similar to Jewish practice. At one time, a ceremony of purification was used by the Jews prior to entering the temple. Placing blessed water, that recalls the prufying waters of our baptism, at the door of the church is based on this custom.<br><br>It is true that in the Middle Ages the practice was to use holy water before entering the church and not when leaving. Purification was necessary when entering the church, but was unneccessary when leaving the church since the person has just participated in the Mass. Today, we use it on entering and leacing the church.<br><br>Holy water is frequently used for the blessing of objects and persons. The chief purpose of holy water is to recall our baptism. We are saved by water and the cross - the cross of Jesus which made the water of baptism possible. In some places, it is sitll the custom for a priest to sprinkle the faithful with holy water upon entering the church. The Mass also has a sprinkling rite that can be used on Sunday. Many use it at the doors of their home.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R.</span></div>

Will he do this even after a soul, who has previously received profound graces and consolations falls into mortal sin?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">H.D.<br><br>Dear H.D.,</span><br><br>Jesus will always forgive those who sincerely repent. There are many examples in the Gospel, of Jesus forgiving sins. No matter what sins we commit, God does not stop loving us and wanting us to be joined to him. God is always waiting for us to return to him. when we return with sincerity and sorrow, we are forgiven.<br><br>Jesus gave us a sacrament, reconciliation, so that our sins could be forgiven. Even if our sorrow for sin is because we are afraid of hell, we can still be forgiven when we confess our sins in the sacrament of reconciliation. There is nothing lost that God is not able to restore to us.<br><br>We should receive the sacrament of reconciliation often. We are obligated to receive it when we have commited a mortal sin, but we should try to receive it at other times too. Jesus always gives us grace when we receive a sacrament.<br><br>No one should ever be afraid of going to Jesus to ask forgiveness. The cross reminds us that Jesus will go to any length to purify us from sin and open the gates of heaven. We should trust him and his love for us.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</span></div>

She will be undergoing treatment for the cancer, but I want to help her prepare for the inevitable. My mother is a lapsed Catholic and I want to bring her back into the Church, or at least get her ready for passing. Can you help me?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Pierce B.<br><br>Dear Pierce</span>,<br><br>This must be a very difficult time for your mother, for you and for the rest of your family. I will say a prayer for you, and hope everyone who reads this will offer a prayer for you and your mother.<br><br>If your mother has friends who attend the Catholic Church, you might encourage them to visit. The visit of friends often gives comfort, and is also a gentle reminder of the Church. You might ask her if she would let a priest visit her.<br><br>You can pray for your mother, and pray with her. There are pamphlets and books you can get for those who are preparing for death that might be a comfort to her. Maybe you can read them to her sometimes if she is too tired to read herself.<br><br>I think the most important thing, though, is your presence in her life. She will see your faith and the strength it gives you. This can be a constant reminder that faith can comfort her and prepare her for meeting God.<br><br>Leave prayer books, prayer cards and a rosary within her reach. You might be surprised what she does when you are out of the room.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</span></div>

If someone doesn't know Jesus before they die, how does praying for them after death help? Why do we pray for the dead during funerals and the prayer of the faithful at Mass?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Stephanie<br><br>Dear Stephanie,</span><br><br>Prayers for the dead have a long tradition in the Catholic Church. Catholics believe that at the time of the particular judgement, there are one of three possible outcomes. Those who reject God go to hell. For those who accept God, two possibilities exist. One can go directly to heaven, or one can go to purgatory, and later into heaven.<br><br>Our prayers for the dead are with respect to the people in purgatory. Purgatory is the place where we are punished for our sins. When our sins are forgiven, we still deserve punishment for what we did. This is called the temporal punishment due to sin. Our prayers for the souls in purgatory help to take away the punishment due to sin.<br><br>At the time of death, we really do not know for certain which judgment the person received. If they are in heaven or hell, our prayers for them will not help. If, howver, they are in purgatory, our prayers can help them reach heaven. That is why we pray for the dead. The love we show for the person in praying for him or her helps us and helps them.<br><br>The Padre<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</span></div>

She is getting a divorce and wants to get an annulment, but he says he will not give her one. If she does the paperwork can she still go through with it without his signature?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A Friend<br><br>Dear Friend,</span><br><br>An annulment requires a judicial process in the Church, usually done in the diocese where you live. Your local priest can outline the process for your friend and perhaps help her get started.<br><br>An annulment means that there was no true marriage, although all the children are legitimate. In order to determine if there was a true marriage, the church conducts an investigation of the marriage. This is sometimes done by a questionaire that asks about both general and specific patterns or events before and during the marriage.<br><br>The person who seeks the annulment, in this case your friend, is called the petitioner. The other partner, in this case her husband, is called the respondent. Sometimes it happens, as in this case, when the respondent does not want an annulment. In such cases, the person usually does not co-operate with the process.<br><br>This situation does not make an annulment impossible, it may simply make it more time-consuming and difficult. The best thing to do is speak to a local priest about the situation. He should be able to guide you in the process. this can be a long process that takes a great deal of patience.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Father Joseph Nolen, C.Ss.R</span></div>
