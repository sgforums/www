There are many young men and women today taking up the challenge, tackling the needs of the Church and the world. They are striving not only to give an answer but to be an answer.<br><br>The Second Vatican Council says: "After accepting these charisms, including the more elementary ones, each believer acquires the right and duty to use them in the Church and in the world for the good of men and to build the Church, in the freedom of the Holy Spirit who Â´breathes where He willÂ´ (John 3:8  )." (Decree On The Apostolate Of The Laity Apostolicam Actuositatem, 3). Becoming an international volunteer is one way to commit yourself to "build up the Church", it is an opportunity to fulfill the commission Christ gave his followers before he ascended to the Father: "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation (Mt 28  :19).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://legrc.org/regnum_db/imagenes_db/colaboradores/colabs-02.jpg"><br><span class="small">The Movement continues to grow throughout the United States.</span><br><br><img src="http://legrc.org/regnum_db/imagenes_db/colaboradores/colabs-07.jpg"><br><strong>Who is a Regnum Christi Co-worker?</strong><br>Co-workers are young Regnum Christi members who dedicate two or three years of their lives exclusively to full-time apostolate wherever the Church most needs them, as a particular way to love Christ and bring others to love him more. Each co-worker participates in an apostolate that is both suited to his talents and effective in achieving the goal: to bring Christ to every person, of every age and in every walk of life.<br><br>Co-workers generally live in a Regnum Christi center. There they receive ongoing formation to be ChristÂ’s true apostles, as described below. Prayer and apostolate allow them to receive a genuine and intimate experience of God that will impact the rest of their lives, teaching them to always put God first.<br><br>It takes generosity and sacrifice to live as<br>The Movement continues to grow throughout the United States.<br><br>a co-worker, but it also brings great satisfaction and joy. You try to love God, he challenges you to put your selfishness aside, and he blesses you with happiness in return.<br><br>The coworkerÂ’s spiritual life is focused on a deep and personal experience of God, growing in personal knowledge of him and a desire to bring him to others, thus making St. PaulÂ´s expression your own: "Woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel" (I Cor. 9:16).<br><br><strong>What Formation Does A Co-worker Receive?</strong><br>The co-worker formation program weaves together the spiritual, human, intellectual and apostolic dimensions of life, and this formation should continue throughout life after the co-working years are over.<br><br><strong>Spiritual Dimension</strong><br>The spiritual dimension is indispensable if we are to be apostles. Therefore the co-workers strive to grow in their union with God, through prayer and the Sacraments. Christ is their Friend and Companion in their everyday struggles, and he is the cure they will offer for the wounds of so many men and women, and the certain hope to quench their every longing. This is the Face of God, which the co-workers find in their times of prayer and solitude. If Jesus is not in their hearts, they know they are missing the center that gives meaning to everything they are and do. "Our lives would be poor indeed were it not for his presence! He is our Father, our Brother, the quiet place to find rest at the end of the day" (Father Marcial Maciel, LC).<br><br>The spiritual life is still more. It entails making the spirit of the Movement their own and spreading it, making the Â“loves of the MovementÂ” the soul of their work: Christ at the center, in the heart of the Church, with Mary our Mother, rooted in an ardent spirit of charity shown in working to save souls and in an unbreakable adherence to the Vicar of Christ.<br><br><strong>Human Dimension</strong><br>Co-workers also need to form themselves in the human virtues and values, so as to achieve their complete human development; supernatural grace needs that human foundation in order to give rise to the lay apostle that the world needs today. Each one works on a personal program of human formation and growth to build a rich and balanced personality, taking care to develop such virtues as: a mature and upright conscience, a sense of responsibility, trustworthiness, strength of will and self-control. These qualities stand them in good stead in any apostolate as well as their future professional and family lives.<br><br><strong>Apostolic Dimension </strong><br>Christ needs your arms, legs and mouth to bring him and speak his word where is not yet known, or where his memory has been erased. Co-workers are ready to go anywhere so that Christ can reach the greatest possible number of people. Thus there are co-workers in places as diverse as the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Poland, Hungary, The Czech Republic, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina and others.<br>The do a variety of apostolates: youth groups and childrenÂ´s groups, urban and rural evangelization missions, teaching catechism to children and teens, some even in universities and colleges -- wherever the Church needs them and their abilities allow them.<br><br>Since good intentions are no substitute for formation, co-workers also receive the necessary training to become militant apostles for Christ, developing the talents that will enable them to better fulfill their mission: public speaking, organizational skills, group leadership skills, often undertaking projects they never would have thought themselves capable of. "If God is with me, who can be against me?"<br><br><strong>Intellectual Dimension </strong><br>Co-workers prepare themselves in a series of courses before beginning their apostolic work. They learn to give reasons for their faith, as St. Peter tells us: "Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you yet do it with gentleness and reverence" (1 Pet 3, 15-16). If you really want to evangelize todayÂ´s world you need to give it both the reasons and the witness of your faith. This is what the world needs.<br><br>As well as the introductory courses, which are an integral part of the formation, each co-worker has a personal reading and study program to prepare for the work ahead.<br></div>
