            <div class='col-md body'><br>BEIJING - CHINA'S state-run Catholic church installed a new Vatican-approved bishop, officials said, after a delay triggered when the cleric publicly voiced his allegiance to the Holy See.<br><br>Reverend Joseph Gan Junqiu, 42, was ordained in the Sacred Heart Cathedral of the southern city of Guangzhou on Tuesday morning, said Mr Liu Bainian, vice-head of the government China Catholic Patriotic Association.<br><br>'Gan Junqiu is replacing Lin Bingliang who died some time ago,' Mr Liu said. 'He is the bishop of the Guangzhou diocese.'<br><br>According to the website of the Rome-based AsiaNews, a news portal reporting on Catholicism in the region, Rev Gan was elected by his diocese on November 2006 and his ordination has been approved by the Holy See.<br><br>But delays over his ordination ceremony have stemmed from concerns by the government association that surfaced after Rev Gan publicly pledged allegiance to the Vatican, the website said.<br><br>The Holy See has long been at odds with China's communist-run church over the appointment of bishops, but in recent months Beijing has appeared willing to appoint church leaders that have the blessing of the pope.<br><br>Such a situation has come as the Vatican has worked to reestablish its relations with China where Catholicism has boomed over the last decades.<br><br>The Vatican and China severed ties in 1951 in anger over the Holy See's diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.<br><br>In 1957, China set up the Patriotic Association, which formally oversees China's officially registered Catholics, estimated at numbering about five million, and growing.<br><br>According to AsiaNews, Rev Gan has been in charge of the Guangzhou diocese since 2001 and maintains good relations with both the Vatican and the state-run church.<br><br>Rev Gan 'is known to be an intelligent pastor, faithful to the pope, committed to the evangelisation of the youth and aiding the poor', the website said.<br><br>'He also has good relations with the government, who collaborated in the restoration of Guangzhou cathedral, dedicated to the Sacred Heart and re-opened to the public last February.' -- AFP</div>
