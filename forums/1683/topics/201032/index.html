            <div class='col-md body'>I hope to post relevant items on the topic of Christian persecution whenever I come across any such news.<br><br>Here is the first item, from the current Middle East conflict.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br>DEBKAfileÂ’s military sources report that Palestinian Jihad Islami, Ahmed JibrilÂ’s PFLP-General Command and Palestinian crime gangs based in S. LebanonÂ’s Burj Shimali east of Tyre are leading the rocket offensive against Nahariya and coastal Galilee. Early Wednesday, an Israeli air raid struck a village house in this sector east of Tyre, causing 10 deaths, according to Lebanese officials.<br><br>DEBKAfile further discloses that the rocket fire against the eastern town of Safed emanates from the Maronite Christian village of Rumeish, while the Galilee panhandle villages and the town of Kiryat Shemona are being attacked from the Christian villages of Marjayoun and Kleia in central-south Lebanon. One difficulty in halting HizballahÂ’s rocket barrage in the east has been IsraelÂ’s reluctance to attack Christian targets, except for pinpointing launch teams. Israeli negotiators are in contact with the village heads on terms for their evacuation so that Hizballah sites can be smashed.<br><br>Hizballah is using Lebanese Christians as human shields for its attacks and their towns and villages as supply centers to pump ordnance to the launch teams in forward positions. The Israeli air force therefore attacked Hizballah targets sheltering near the Maronite town of Zahleh Tuesday and is taking out every container truck heading west from the Beqaa Valley on the Syrian border. Eighteen such trucks were blown up Tuesday.</div>

It would then contravene what the Founding Fathers wanted, and instead of seeing the issue as against Christians, it would then turn around against other religions, especially those with no God in them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ObiterDicta:</div><div class="quote_body">In 'the land of the free', you ain't free if you are Catholic:<br><br><a href="http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=69847" rel="nofollow">CENSOR THREATENS 1ST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF MISSOURI CATHOLIC GROUP</a></div></blockquote>What persecution?

Its a clear expression of his faith which has no implication on any matter, and he got jailed. Another example of clear cut persecution is that of a group of Filipinos expatriates who were caught practising their faith in Saudi Arabia. Freedom of religious worship is not allowed in SA, where Islam is the only recognised religion. Any expression or other forms of practise will result in deportation or even execution.

Why would that be a violation of human rights?  What's more, you fail to recognise the position of the Church correctly.  It teaches that homosexual acts are immoral, as clearly spelt out in the Bible.  It does not teach that people who engage in such acts should be accorded less respect.<br><br>As for the French example, you are comparing apples and oranges.  The ban, which I disagree with, applies to school and work, where the French state wishes, unreasonably, to promote a militant form of secularism.

The food was served, he paid and said grace to thank God for the food.  Immediately, the hawker took the food away and said "Now I see who you can thank!"<br><br>I said to my friend "So mean, this hawker"<br><br>But my friend, being anti Christian, disagreed with me "It was the hawker who cooked the food!"<br><br>Then I said "But the Christian already paid the money for the food.  He has, in this way, thanked the hawker.  What right does the hawker have doing stupid thing like this?"<br><br>My friend "...."  </div></blockquote>This is a case of bigotry getting the better of common sense and rationality.<br><br>Obviously your friend forgot that there exists this little inconvenient thing called 'contract law'.<br><br>Your victimised friend does not even have to thank the hawker.

Why would that be a violation of human rights?  What's more, you fail to recognise the position of the Church correctly.  It teaches that homosexual acts are immoral, as clearly spelt out in the Bible.  It does not teach that people who engage in such acts should be accorded less respect.<br><br>As for the French example, you are comparing apples and oranges.  The ban, which I disagree with, applies to school and work, where the French state wishes, unreasonably, to promote a militant form of secularism.  The spheres of coverage does not overlap with those in which Catholic nuns typically operate.  Hence, this is a false argument.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div></blockquote>Thats why I said its a conundrum. Its an issue where both sides are violating each other's human rights, therefore its not a simple case of persecution. Gee, if I were a Catholic, I would be more concerned with China's persecution of Catholics instead, where its a clear case of the government using overwhelming force to clamp down on a a group of people who meant no harm.<br><br>Your second argument is moot. You said it applied to work for Muslims, so hence where is the justification for nuns to wear their habits as part of 'professional clothing'? I dont deny French is enforcing a militant form of secularism, but the application is rather uneven. If I were to be more equitable, I would have turn to other similar religious symbols, including banning Christians from publicly wearing crucifixes. Of course, that is assuming I am one of those muddle headed French gabrament official.<br><br></div>
