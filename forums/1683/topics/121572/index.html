            <div class='col-md body'>Go "Inside the Passion" with Legionary Father John Bartunek<br><br><img src="http://legrc.org/regnum_db/imagenes_db/servicios/inside.jpg"><br><br>Inside the Passion provides biblical, historical, and theological insights gleaned from hours spent on the set and interviews with director Mel Gibson, actors, and filmmaking crew.<br><br>The inspirational new book Inside The Passion is the first and only authorized, behind-the-scenes look at The Passion of the Christ, and itÂ´s now available from <a href="http://www.circlepressusa.com/interior02.phtml?se=001&amp;ca=001&amp;ar=224" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Circle Press</strong></span></a>.<br><br>Written by Legionary Fr. John Bartunek, Inside the Passion provides biblical, historical, and theological insights gleaned from hours spent on the set and interviews with director Mel Gibson, actors, and filmmaking crew. Inside the Passion is the most complete and thorough commentary on the movie you will read. The book also contains a foreword by director Mel Gibson.<br><br>"For weeks I accompanied Mel Gibson, watching him work with the editors, the composer, the promotions team, and the press. I asked him questions about the film that no one else asked, discovering reasons behind some of the innumerable artistic choices that he was forced to make, choices that turned this small art house project into an international blockbuster,"  Fr. Bartunek said.<br><br>A brief video review of the powerful visual themes portrayed in The Passion of the Christ and explored in Fr. BartunekÂ´s book is available <a href="http://www.themessengersofhope.com/moh/moviemail/view?id=93568" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>here</strong></span></a>.<br><br>Like any great work of art, this film transcends mere explanations--even those of the artist himself--but well-chosen explanations of the context and the artistÂ´s intent provided by Fr. Bartunek effectively turn this emotionally-stimulating, aesthetic experience into a powerful spiritual encounter.<br><br>As director Mel Gibson puts it, Fr. John Bartunek is a man of faith and a scholar who was able to "carefully examine a number of issues that simmer just beneath the surface of the film--vital issues like forgiveness, love, freedom, the role of Mary, salvation, and the meaning of suffering, human and divine. The time he spent with myself and others involved in the production gives him a unique and, I think, interesting perspective."<br><br>From scene selections to theological insights to the controversies debated in the media, Fr. Bartunek provides fresh and unique perspectives into one of the most discussed and controversial films of our time. HeÂ´ll reveal:<br><br>* The reasons the director chose to make certain aspects of the film so violent<br><br>* The miracles that happened during the filming<br><br>* The discussions behind the scenes about the anti-Semitic controversy<br><br>* The realism of the sets and the props<br><br>* The purpose for various lighting and other film techniques<br><br>The author, Fr. Bartunek, is a native of suburban Cleveland, Ohio, and a graduate of Stanford University with a degree in history. He was not raised in a religious home but became an evangelical Christian during his high school years. While a college student, he travelled Europe and was inspired by the art and architecture of the Church to consider Catholicism.<br><br>"My university studies took me to Italy and Poland," Fr. Bartunek recalled. "I drank ever so deeply of the beauties of the Church in Rome, Florence, Assisi, and Venice; stood in awed admiration of the piety of the Polish faithful, and saw the Catholic vision of God everywhere in art and architecture, in statuary and paintings."<br><br>As he explained in a February 24 interview on CNNÂ´s Larry King Live, what helped him fully embrace the Catholic Faith  and pursue the priesthood was the powerful example of Pope John Paul II: "Fifteen years ago, I wasnÂ´t even a Catholic," he said. "I went to midnight mass in St. PeterÂ´s with the Holy Father, and I was inspired by his spirit of prayer, by his presence. And it was the beginning of a journey that led me to the Catholic faith.<br><br>"And then 10 years later, I was a seminarian studying in Rome, and I had a chance to be with the pope on the altar in St. PeterÂ´s Basilica, assisting him, looking into his eyes. He really is -- in a sense, [he] became kind of a spiritual father for my own vocation."<br><br>Ordained a priest in December, 2003, Fr. Bartunek is presently pursuing graduate studies in theology at RomeÂ´s Regina Apostolorum Pontifical Atheneum.<br><br>Read the whole story of "<a href="http://www.circlepressusa.com/interior02.phtml?se=001&amp;ca=001&amp;ar=224" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inside the Passion</span></strong></a>".<br></div>
