            <div class='col-md body'>A great note for all to read it will take just 37 seconds to<br><br>read this and change your thinking<br><br>Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room.<br><br>One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to<br><br>help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only<br><br>window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men<br><br>talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families, their<br><br>homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they<br><br>had been on vacation.<br><br>Every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could<br><br>sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the<br><br>things he could see outside the window.<br><br>The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour<br><br>periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the<br><br>activity and color of the world outside.<br><br>The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. Ducks and<br><br>swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young<br><br>lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of<br><br>the city skyline could be seen in the distance.<br><br>As the man by the window described all this in exquisite<br><br>detail, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and<br><br>imagine the picturesque scene.<br><br>One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade<br><br>passing by.<br><br>Although the other man couldn't hear the band - he could see<br><br>it. In his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with<br><br>descriptive words.<br><br>Days and weeks passed.<br><br>One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their<br><br>baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had<br><br>died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital<br><br>attendants to take the body away.<br><br>As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he<br><br>could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch,<br><br>and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.<br><br>Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take<br><br>his first look at the real world outside.<br><br>He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the<br><br>bed.<br><br>It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could<br><br>have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful<br><br>things outside this window.<br><br>The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even<br><br>see the wall.<br><br>She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you."<br><br>Epilogue:<br><br>There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite<br><br>our own situations.<br><br>Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared,<br><br>is doubled.<br><br>If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have<br><br>that money can't buy.<br><br>"Today is a gift, that's why it is called the present."<br><br>The origin of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck<br><br>to everyone who passes it on.<br></div>
