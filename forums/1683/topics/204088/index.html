            <div class='col-md body'>A touching story and A good reminder : " Take time to appreciate what<br>you Have now."<br><br>On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to The supermarket<br>to buy the remaining of the gift I didn't Manage to buy earlier.<br>When I saw all the people there, I started to Complain to myself," It<br>is going to take forever here and I still have so Many other places to<br>go.<br><br>Christmas really is getting more and more annoying Every year. How I<br>wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake Up after it..."<br>Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and There I started to<br>curse the prices, wondering if after all kids really Play with such<br>expensive toys.<br><br>While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small Boy of about 5<br>years old, pressing a doll against his chest.<br>He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked So sad. I wondered<br>who was this doll for.<br><br>Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him, " Granny, are you sure I don't have Enough money?"<br><br>The old lady replied, " You know that you don't have Enough money to<br>buy this doll, my dear."  Then she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while She went to look around. She left quickly.<br><br>The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.  Finally, I started to walk toward him and I asked him Who did he want to give this doll to.<br>" It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted So much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would Bring it to her."<br><br>I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, after  all, and not to worry.  But he replied to me sadly. " No, Santa Claus can not Bring it to her<br>where she is now. I have to give the doll to my Mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there." His eyes Were so sad while saying this. " My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says That Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she Could bring the doll with her to give it to my sister."<br><br>My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at Me and said, " I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him To wait until I come back from the supermarket."<br><br>Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he Was laughing. He then told me, " I also want mummy to take this photo With her so that she will not forget me." I love my mummy and I wish She doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be With my little sister."<br><br>Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.  I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes And said to the boy, "What if we checked again, just in case if you Have enough money?"<br><br>" Ok," he said. " I hope that I have enough."  I added some of my money to his without him seeing And we started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even Some spare money.<br><br>The little boy said, " Thank you God for giving me Enough money."  Then he looked at me and added, " I asked yesterday Before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll So that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me." " I also Wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't Dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and The white rose."<br><br>" You know, my mummy loves white rose."  A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I Left with my trolley. I finished my shopping in a totally Different state from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind.<br><br>Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days Ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car Where there was one young lady and a little girl.  The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had To decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assisting machine,  Because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma.<br><br>Was this the family of the little boy?  Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the  newspaper that the young lady had passed away.   I couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of White roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young Woman was exposed for  people to see and make last wish before burial.<br><br>She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest.<br><br>I left the place crying, feeling that my life had Been changed forever. The love that this little boy had for his Mother and his sister is still , to that day, hard to imagine. And in A fraction of a second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him</div>
