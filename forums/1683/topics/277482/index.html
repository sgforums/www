            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, Ever since I became Catholic in 2002, i've been deprived of a good christian youth fellowship group.<br><br>What I look for in such a group is slightly similar in form to what I have been accustomed to while I was a Protestant.<br><br>1. Regular Bible Study/Sharing<br><br>2. Regular Prayer Meets (may be combined with bible study/sharing)<br><br>3. Fellowshipping (just hanging out together - makan, chit chat)<br><br>4. Accountability (Being accountable to one another - Sharing times)<br><br>While I was in Campus Crusade for Christ, I think I built up quite a bit as a Christian.. and with the constant (we met everyday for prayer meets!) and strong ties with a group, we could spur one another on to run the race and not fall back. It was easier. Interestingly enough, I became a Catholic despite (more like as a result of) all that :p<br><br>The limitation today, of course is also that I'm working and I stay in the East. I miss those days and I wish there was some way to start a similar youth fellowship of sorts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope to see a revival of RCIY.  Back then, there were so many youths who came forward to find out more about the Catholic faith.  Most of them followed the programme through and received baptism and confirmation, after which, they joined various ministries to serve at the Church.  Some joined the choir to sing at the weekend Mass, some joined Legion Of Mary to become instruments of the Holy Spirit through a balanced program of prayer and service etc.  There was also a youth group formed (not sure whether it is still around).<br><br>I hope the parish could reconsider starting a new journey of RCIY for all the young people out there.</div>
