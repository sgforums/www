              <p>hmm.. i don't know how catholics take the communion, but do they like brief abit what the communion is etc?</p>
              <p>like for my church we will explain what the communion is, and it's only for members of the church etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but.. while it is true that if you take the communion in an unworthy manner, you're sinning against the body of Christ, i guess it's ok because you didn't know. now you know, so, don't make the same mistake lor. =)</p>
              <p>it's good to find out more.</p>
              <p>i'm not catholic btw.</p>

              Yes we do, but the brief only comes during catechism, RCIA, or such classes. Apart from the usual eucharistic prayer, rite of consecration and words of institution, there isn't a brief directed at educating the congregation during the mass itself, if that's what you're talking about.
              
              Four mortal sins? Do not worry, Xoxoz, you had no knowledge of the implications of what you were doing back then. The receiving of Communion without knowledge discounts it as a mortal sin, so what are the other three?

              <p>shrugs, if he's a christian, why should he feel guilty about taking the communion? we're asked to take it regularly wat.</p>
              <p>so if he is, means he don't know what the communion is about, means he's not a christian.</p>

              <p>Not all Christians believe in receiving communion, mind you. You being a protestant, I would expect you to know that. In his case, he could be a Christian who doesn't take communion, and believes it to be restricted to Catholics only.</p>
              <p>He doesn't know what communion is about, therefore he is not Christian? What kind of deduction is that? How about I say I don't know about the laws of thermodynamics, therefore I am not a science student? Christians may or may not know about Communion, and non-Christians can also know or not know about communion. It is not exclusive knowledge. Furthermore, the fact that he knows he is not supposed to receive communion is proof that he does indeed know something about communion.</p>
