            <div class='col-md body'>Being slain in the Spirit is a term related to the Charismatic movement and Pentecostalism which describes a religious phenomenon in which a person enters a state with loss of all motor control over their body and falls to the floor during an event perceived as a personal encounter with God's glory power, usually associated with occasions of public prayer ministry when the laying on of hands is practiced...something liddat bah,im also not sure tho,that's why im asking xD</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I have just come back from a retreat conducted by Fr William Goh. Well, I never fond of Charismatic movement, though I don't think it's bad either. I went to this retreat without knowing what it's all about haha...<br><br>Anyway, regarding the topic "Slain in Spirit", I really experienced this myself. It was quite unbelieveable because there were about 120 people in this retreat. And probably as many as 90% of us are all fall down or having other spiritual manifestation. Oh...wait..actually I'm not really sure if I'm referring to the same thing, cause some people say it as "rest in the spirit".<br><br>As for me, I also fell down, but I'm still fully conscious. I just cannot resist it, when Father prayed over me, suddenly I felt  my leg became very light and immediately fell down. But I was still fully conscious, I can hear the music, people singing, etc. I was able to wake up not long after that, but after that tears ran down, and there is a feeling of happiness and touched at the same time. I must say, it's a great experience, and I thanked God immensely for this exerience.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But also, I don't think it's something that we have to be too excited about. Because the great mystics like St Teresa or St John of the Cross always remind us of the danger being too fond of this spriritual manifestation. Nevertheless, we have to thank God, if He come and give us this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Not to mention the danger of being arrogant for having numerous manifestations/miracles. And the danger of linking manifestations/miracles with God's care/love. The problem is when these manifestations/miracles stop to manifest themselves....for whatever reason or simply for no reason at all, one who is used to them would likely feel abandoned by God or worse missing the manifestations/miracles just for the sake of experiencing them much like a thrill seeker. One word: caution.<br><br>Btw I have never experienced 'resting in the spirit' but have seen people experiencing them.</div>
