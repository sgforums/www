              <p>oh, i am assuming, since TS said that catholics are now becoming like protestants, because they are becoming "modern" i assume he would refer to elec guitars, drum set, modern looking buildings etc.</p>

              <p>so i said i don't see an issue with the types of worship songs sung, or the look of the building, but apparently some catholics here sees an issue if the scenario is reversed.</p>

              <p>It's funny how you jump to the wrong conclusions without allowing us to answer. Please stop doing that. It's not rational.</p>
              <p>How about you judge this for yourself: you say it is good for atheists to become Christian, and bad for Christians to become atheists. Do you consider it double standards too?</p>
              <p>In any case, it's not a simple case of "Catholic is better than protestant" either. The Catholic Church stresses the importance of tradition. It is not our concern if you decide to adopt our traditions or not, but we will take notice if our traditions are being replaced by protestant practices. That's why it's perfectly alright from your perspective if a church becomes more "Catholic". Simply because it fits in with your idea of being appropriate to your church does not mean it fits in with being appropriate to all churches either. Do learn to take other points of view into consideration.</p>

              thus mark it out from Protestant churches.<br> <br> We are not saying, "We want to be reconciled as one Church, but
              don't touch our rituals;" we are saying, "Return to the one true
              Church." That is what we believe we are. Our succession runs from
              St Peter and we have retained the teachings of our Church Fathers.
              It's hardly double standards when we're sticking firmly to and
              rooting for what we believe in.</p>

              <p>Whilst I have no problems with using the whole set-up for 'Praise &amp; Worship' sessions, it's inappropriate for Mass, which is very important ritual to us. They can be equally reverent but the manner of it is too contrasting to fuse the two harmoniously. I'm okay with it if it's for RCIA/Y (by the way, Protestants converting to the Catholic faith do not need to go through that).<br></p>

              <p>I need to correct you here.  Protestants wishing to be accepted into full communion with the Church need to go through RCIA, as the journey allows them to learn about Church teachings so that they know what they are getting themselves into, and also to experience the Faith within a community setting.</p>

              <p>Tradition or tradition hmm? Big difference leh. One refers to the unchangeable Apostolic teachings while the other is simply historical rituals past down through the generations.= eg celibacy, not eating meat on fridays. While I decry, the modernixzation of some of our traditions, it is the protestantiszation of our Tradition that concerns me more and lack of biblical knowledge among our youths and adults.</p>
