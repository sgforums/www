            <div class='col-md body'><br>2 hours, 1 minute ago<br><br>By VICTOR SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer<br><br>VATICAN CITY - Pope John Paul (news - web sites) II was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance Thursday suffering fever and congestion from a relapse of the flu, the Vatican (news - web sites) said.<br><br><img src="http://us.news2.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20050224/capt.alt10102241226.italy_pope_hospitalized_alt101.jpg"><br>AP Photo<br><br><img src="http://us.news2.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20050224/lthumb.xcs15502241611.poland_pope_book_xcs155.jpg">AP Photo<br><br>The 84-year-old pontiff had the same symptoms of the breathing crisis that sent him to Gemelli Polyclinic on Feb. 1, a Vatican official said on condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, the pope made his longest public appearance since being discharged from the clinic two weeks ago.<br><br>Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the pope was taken to the Rome hospital for "necessary specialized assistance and further tests." He was taken by ambulance at 10:45 a.m., officials said.<br><br>Vatican officials played down the seriousness of the hospitalization, saying a patient of the pope's age is always at risk from the flu. The pope also has Parkinson's disease (news - web sites) and crippling knee and hip ailments.<br><br>But aides said on condition of anonymity that the pope had a fever, congestion and had suffered a relapse of breathing problems.<br><br>The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the pope arrived conscious at Gemelli in a private ambulance. He was taken inside in a stretcher, the report said, and quoted people who saw him enter the hospital as saying his face looked "quite relaxed." The news agency said he did not need a tube inserted into his windpipe to assist breathing.<br><br>A medical health bulletin was to be issued Friday morning, and no details on the pope's health were expected to be released before that, the Vatican said. Thursday's hospitalization was the pope's eighth since his election in 1978.<br><br>The pope's breathing problems can complicate the swallowing difficulties characteristic of Parkinson's disease. The lack of coordination of the muscles involved make it easy for food or saliva to get into the lungs. That can cause a life-threatening pneumonia and is one of the most common causes of death among Parkinson's patients.<br><br>Doctors sometimes bypass the throat by inserting a feeding tube directly into the stomach, both to help patients who have difficulty eating and to help prevent food going down to the lungs.<br><br>The muscle problems and the pope's stooped posture also could make it difficult for him to head off infections by mustering a powerful enough cough to shake mucus out of the lungs.<br><br>Rome has been particularly cold, wet and windy in recent days. The pope has twice appeared at his open studio window to address crowds in St. Peter's Square since his Feb. 10 discharge from the hospital, where he had been treated for breathing difficulties following a bout with the flu.<br><br>But the pope failed to show up Thursday morning for a scheduled meeting on new candidates for sainthood. No explanation was given for his absence and the ceremony went ahead, presided by the Vatican's No. 2 official, Cardinal Angelo Sodano.<br><br>The Vatican released a letter the pope had sent for the canonization ceremony, saying that "for reasons of caution," he had been advised to follow it from his apartment by closed-circuit television Â— an indication that the decision to take him to the hospital was made suddenly.<br><br>The pope had been convalescing after his hospitalization but had appeared to be making a rebound. At each new public appearance, he appeared stronger, more alert, and his voice was clearer.<br><br>On Wednesday, the pope wheezed and looked gaunt but managed to make his longest public appearance since leaving the hospital.<br><br>The Vatican originally had planned for the frail pontiff to address pilgrims in St. Peter's Square from his apartment window but decided instead on a video hookup because of the rain and winds.<br><br>In all, the pope followed the audience for 30 minutes Â— the most he has appeared in public since returning from the hospital. Fully alert, he waved and gave his blessing at the end.<br><br>When John Paul was discharged from the hospital, the Vatican made clear he would decide on his schedule in consultation with his doctors.<br><br>Because of his ailments, there has long been speculation that John Paul might consider resigning. That debate was fueled during his earlier hospitalization when Cardinal Sodano declined to rule out that possibility, saying it was up to the pope's "conscience."<br><br>The Gemelli Polyclinic has taken in John Paul so often that it has been dubbed by the Italian press as "The Third Vatican," after the seat of the Holy See on St. Peter's Square and the pope's summer residence in the town of Castel Gandolfo.<br><br>The hospital has a suite on the 10th floor that includes a chapel, kitchen and sleeping quarters for his longtime aide.<br><br>In 1981, the pope was shot in the abdomen and hand in a shooting attack by Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca in St. Peter's Square. He spent 20 days at Gemelli after undergoing surgery.<br><br>The Gemelli clinic was under tight security Thursday.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pope John Paul II spent a second night in hospital, breathing through a hole in his neck, as Catholics around the world prayed for his recovery from acute respiratory problems, while medical experts feared the worst.<br><br>The 84-year-old pontiff was "very serene," according to Colombian Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, who was among a string of prelates who visited the pope Friday at Rome's Gemelli hospital, where he was admitted Thursday for the second time in less than a month.<br><br>But medical experts voiced deep concern over the accumulated burdens on the pope's health of his advanced age, past bouts with life-threatening conditions, the ravages of Parkinson's disease, and a tendency to resist medical advice.<br><br>Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls, in the first bulletin since the pope underwent a tracheotomy on Thursday, sought to alleviate global fears for the pope's imminent demise.<br><br>"The Holy Father spent a night of tranquil rest," according to the statement Navarro-Valls read out to reporters at a Vatican press conference.<br><br>"He is breathing on his own and his cardio-circulatory conditions remain good," he said before detailing what the pope had for breakfast: coffee, yogurt and biscuits, consumed with "good appetite."<br><br>Temporarily robbed of his voice by the tracheotomy, the pope was able to communicate only by writing on a notepad. Navarro-Valls said the pontiff wrote jokingly after he came to from general anesthesia: "What have you done to me?"<br><br>In a major indication of the real state of the pope's health, the Vatican was to announce Saturday whether the old Polish pontiff would appear at his hospital window Sunday to mark the Angelus prayer.<br><br>Professor Corrado Manni, the pope's anesthetist during his life-saving surgery after he was shot in 1981, described the pope's latest setback as "exertion after exertion on an organism which is undoubtedly weakened."<br><br>Manni told La Stampa: "The two episodes, yesterday's and the one at the beginning of February, are real respiratory crises. Air is not getting in via the airways of the lungs and therefore he runs the risk of a cardio-circulatory arrest."<br><br>Upper respiratory infections are common among Parkinson's patients, and the flu is their leading cause of death, said Bruno Bergamasco, head of neuroscience at the University of Turin, where a regional Parkinson's center is housed.<br><br>At the start of the crisis, while the Vatican offered few details of the pope's condition, James Francis Stafford, the highest-ranking American cardinal in the Vatican, offered a window on how Vatican insiders were taking the news.<br><br>They hope John Paul II "won't suffer," he told the Repubblica. "We know that there are problems with breathing. To die of suffocation or even to experience the sensation of suffocating is something we can all identify with. That's why a deep empathy with his suffering is spreading among us."<br><br>Around the world, Catholic bishops urged the faithful to hold prayer vigils for the pope following his seventh operation in 24 years.<br><br>Top cardinals set the tone, gathering in the Vatican's Redemptoris Mater chapel to pray, including the pope's secretary of state Angelo Sodano and the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.<br><br>Meanwhile, even as John Paul II battles to recover, Irish bookmakers Paddy Power have begun taking bets on the identity of his successor.<br><br>The company has made 70-year-old Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, the archbishop of Milan, its firm favorite as next leader of the Roman Catholic Church.<br><br>Tettamanzi, at 5-2, is ahead of 74-year-old Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze, 3-1, and 68-year-old Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino of Cuba, 11-2.<br></div>
