            <div class='col-md body'>by Father David Daly, LC<br><br><strong>Luke 8:4-15</strong><br><br>When a large crowd gathered, with people from one town after another journeying to him, he spoke in a parable. "A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path and was trampled, and the birds of the sky ate it up. Some seed fell on rocky ground, and when it grew, it withered for lack of moisture. Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it. And some seed fell on good soil, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold." After saying this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear." Then his disciples asked him what the meaning of this parable might be. He answered, "Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been granted to you; but to the rest, they are made known through parables so that Â´they may look but not see, and hear but not understand.Â´  Â“ This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God. Those on the path are the ones who have heard, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved. Those on rocky ground are the ones who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, but they have no root; they believe only for a time and fall away in time of trial. As for the seed that fell among thorns, they are the ones who have heard, but as they go along, they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life, and they fail to produce mature fruit. But as for the seed that fell on rich soil, they are the ones who, when they have heard the word, embrace it with a generous and good heart, and bear fruit through perseverance.<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>: Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for this precious time of meditation and dialogue with you. In meditating on the Parable of the Sower, help me to change so that I will not put any thorns, rocks or hardness of heart in the way of your plans for my life.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>: Lord, grant me docility to your will for me.<br><br><strong>1. Hard Ground.</strong> We act like hard ground when we hear the inspirations of the Holy Spirit to do what is right, but let them pass as if it were no big deal. We let the devil take away the grace Jesus offers us, and it does not sink into our hearts. Many times superficiality and a lack of faith prevent us from reflecting and taking advantage of the lights that God gives us. We should pray to be more spiritual.<br><br><strong>2. Rocky Ground</strong>. How many of us hear the Word of God with joy and follow Christ in the peaceful times, but fall away in the times of trial? We need to let our spiritual roots grow deeper; we need to let the roots of GodÂ’s word grow more profoundly into our hearts. The best way to do this is by reading and meditating on the Gospel and solidifying this faith through the sacraments of confession and the Eucharist.<br><br><strong>3. Thorny Ground</strong>. The thorny ground represents those of us who are slowed down in our spiritual life by the anxieties, riches and pleasures of life. When the ground of our hearts is throny, we fail to produce the mature fruit that Christ expects. And we live in the midst of so many thornsÂ…. In order to let GodÂ’s grace grow in us, we have to sacrifice our own comfort and pleasure, because apart from the cross there is no growth in personal holiness.<br><br><strong><br>Dialogue with Christ</strong>:  Lord Jesus, treat me like dirt Â… but good dirt. I donÂ’t want to place thorns or rocks or hardness of heart in the way of your word.  I want to be fertile soil for your word so that you can use me as an instrument to save souls and glorify you.<br><br><strong><br>Resolution:</strong> I promise to pray these words many times today: Â“Not my will, but yours be done.Â”<br><br></div>
