              <p>I don't mean to be provocative but I'm wondering what scriptures did the church authorities of the time base their belief that our planet was the center of the universe?</p>
              <p>That the the universe revolve around our planet. Is there the scriptures to support this belief? I don't mean assumption but clear cut scripture that tells that the universe revolve around our planet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or did they base their belief merely on tradition and church assumption which became a doctrine?</p>

              <p>While I agree with you that these were not meant to be interpreted that the universe was geocentric, a collection of such verses in the Bible perhaps did lead to some of the religious scholars to support a geocentric universe, not to mention how it played to the "arrogance" of mankind. </p>

              <p>hmm. i'd like to point out smth. when God refers to earth, He always calls it earth.</p>
              <p>but when He talks about the world, He talks about the things that are on earth.. the water, seas, sky, mountains.. whatever..</p>
              <p><strong>because.. i've really never seen a verse which actually says that the sun revolves around the earth.</strong></p>
              <p>In Joshua's case, the sun stood still, was spoken from Joshua's point of view.. I kinda see it like.. if a kid saw me using magnifying glass to set a match ablaze, he might see the match on fire, but I would know that its because of the magnifying glass.</p>
              <p>Joshua only saw the sun stood still, but he may not know that God was the one who did it. How? I don't know either, maybe he made the earth stood still, or something.</p>

              <p>Joshua 10 (Douay Rheims):<br><br>12.

Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of one day.<br></strong><br>14.
