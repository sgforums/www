              <p>Hey voice, I try to answer you from my own experience.</p>
              <p>There are many ways in which you could know that God has answered your prayer. The most obvious and perhaps the most common way is by getting what you prayed for at a later time(seeing what you prayed for being realized at some time in the future).</p>
              <p>There are times when God tells you that He grants your prayer whatever it is before you actually see it realized. For example when praying or asking for something (usually when one pray quite hard, under duress, or in times of need) the person would feel that God has listened and granted his prayer. The person usually knows and is so very convinced that God has listened and answered his prayer such that he would stop asking or praying for that purpose any longer. In fact when God answered  prayer in this fashion and lett he person know, he who prayed for it doesn't even need to do anyhting except to wait for it to be fulfilled. So when God answered before His realization took place, that person who prayed for it definitely would be so convinced so that there is no doubt about it(and it's not made up) that God has answered his prayer and be in a state of trust with God and await for His fulfillment.</p>
              <p>There are times but I believe it's quite rare that God grants our prayer in an instant nothing short of miracle you could say. That is you see the realization of your prayer or what you prayed for in a matter of seconds or minutes. This is no coincidence of course. God is all powerful and able to answer whatever we ask for in an instant. But this is rare though. At least it is rare enough in my case.</p>
              <p> The thing about praying and asking for something in prayer is that we should pray that it is God's will that will be done. But it doesn't mean that we can't have or can't ask for what we want but what we ask for must be in tune with what God wants. We can't force God to grant us what we ask for.</p>

              <p>By knowing what God wants. Read the bible to know about God. Be sincere in your prayer that you do not ask for things that are only to satisfy your selfish desires.</p>
              <p>I didn't mean that you cannot ask for things that you want but be sincere in your prayer and don't ask things for the sake of testing God. I mean don't ask for thing with the mindset I'll just pray and who knows God would give it to me. Ask what you want and need sincerely and don't try to test God. And let God works in His own time. Some people see their prayer fulfilled years after praying for it. Some see it fulfilled in a matter of seconds. We have no control over when our prayer will be answered. Trust in God that He will work out the best time for you. Remember that God is our Lord and not the other way around.</p>
              <p>When you're having doubt whether a specific request is worth praying for it probably isn't. When you pray for thing s and doubt about it you are testing God. Just pray and leave it to God. Don't think about the would be outcome or the chance of it being fulfilled. The best words is wait for God. Your prayer is going to be answered one way or another. And you don't need to pray hard just to get God to listen to your prayer. God hears even a whisper of our heart and thoughts.</p>

              <p>I suggest the King James Version and start readin from the new testament first.</p>
              <p>That is to start reading from Chapter Matthew first. I you find something that you don't quite actually understand don't try to guess. I eman you can guess but leave your doubt there. Just leave it and you can try asking them to another Christian one who is more knowledgeable than you preferrably one who has studied theology at higher institution.</p>

              <p>Being faithful to one's faith and being sincere in following God that is you don't share your faith with other things like for example love of money or fear of people. Just try to do what God wants and most people will fall there and here sometimes but get back up and don't be discouraged at all as long as you confess your sins and ask for forgiveness to God and if possible the person you sinned against.</p>
              <p>You cannot hope for God to listen to your prayers when you are not being faithful to God(for example seeing paranormal, shaman, involved in occultism, etc) or when you put other things above fear of God consistently or when you have a grave sin that you are not admitting or ones that you deny.</p>
              <p>Don't get awed or frightened too easily if you see the powers of other power than God. God is above all even when you do not know that for a fact but know it with a steady faith that God is above all. Perhaps you will know to a certain extent later on that God overcomes all. That there is nothing like God.</p>
              <p>When you decide to follow God the devil will attack you sooner or later through a lot of different ways even using other Christians. That the devil is going to attack a believer is a guarantee and sometimes God allows us to be tested but only for some time and He will show to you that He is the one giving you strength and in the end victory.</p>
              <p>Because No one no one really can snatch us away from God. Whomever God has chosen will remain to belong to God because nothing can snatch anyone who is chosen away from the Lord. Not even death.</p>

              <p>Umm I didn't mean that a demon would come and attack a believer directly no no but rather indirectly through hardships, persecutions, anguish, difficulties and such and such. Basically to wear you out and kill your faith in God. A cold war you can say. lol.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that a demon never attack anyone directly but most people are never attacked directly. I personally have only been attacked directly once and that was because someone sent it over to my dorm room. Nothing that God couldn't handle easily.</p>
              <p>The thing is when a believer is weak and knows that he is weak he is strong in Christ.</p>
              <p>All a believer got to do when attacked directly is to give up immediately but not to the demon of course but to God. Give up the attempt to fight by our own strength and ask God for help. And you'll be set free. The demon would fled without delay without resistance. In fact it fled faster than the way it came. At least that was what I experienced. If I were you I wouldn't worry about demons attacking directly.</p>

              <p>Well I'm raised a Catholic and am still a Catholic however after a personal experience my view about the afterlife is somewhat different from most Christian simply due to the fact that I still believe that the dead or a portion of them at least still descend to the world of the dead or what is also referred to as the kingdom of death or what the jews call sheol.</p>
              <p>I don't know how many or in what proportion the number of the dead that must wait judgment in the kingdom of death. I just know that at least some of the dead still descend to the world of the dead.</p>
              <p>However their fate is pretty much sealed. The dead who descend to the world of the dead can no longer do anythng to save themselves from the coming judgment.</p>
              <p>In fact I know what it's like to be in the world of the dead or the kingdom of death. The dead who descend there are no longer aware of themselves at all so that they are not concsious of anything. They no longer remember God at all either. They've lost the memory of God or in fact of anything. They also no longer able to register the passage of time at all. So that to the dead in the kingdom of death there's no difference between seconds, minutes or milleniums.</p>
              <p>But I think I should not talk more of this since you are new and this may confuse you. I'm also NOTone of the Jehovah witness member. Nor I'm a follower of the Jewish Tanach nor do I read the Koran ever. Like I wrote I'm a Catholic.</p>
              <p>About who is going to hell is not my concern. But I do believe that whoever lives in evil and wickedness and follows the path of evil and wickedness will not share eternal life and will be condemned to hell in the end.</p>

              <p>God is not a vending machine or a wishing well. You don't always get what you want, but you will get what you need, and in due time. Sparing quiet time in prayer, reflection and contemplation helps you discern if you are asking for what will really help you grow and whether the way you've looked at the situation is adequate.</p>
              <p>We believe too that redemption through Christ is the sole way to eternal life. However, we leave it to Him to judge who will enter into Heaven. Some people may have never heard of Him before, other people may be doing His work unwittingly, and while there are false Christians He will reject.</p>
              <p>All we can do is to introduce others to the Word not through proselytising but by the example of our actions and our lives and engaging other people when they enquire. The Christian way of life challenges us to do more than just avoid being evil, but to love and serve with humility the world without falling prey to its ways. And anyone may respond to it at any time in their lives and be entitled to the same reward. We cannot judge properly who will be saved or damned by looking at their present response.</p>
