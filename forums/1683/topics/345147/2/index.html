              <p>No problem, take your time.....and even after that, if you don't believe, it's ok. The point I want to make to you is - understand why the Catholics feel sad over such things happening. It's not to convince you.</p>
              <p>Proofs that I am talking about, you can read them in those links too.... it has gone through                       scientific investigation by the most illustrious scientist and it's authenticity proven. The Church do not accept any miracles lightly until they are very sure.</p>

              <p>hmm. we believe it's a reminder. And when he told the disciples when he did, he was telling them about what he was going to do.</p>
              <p>in 1 cor 11, u hv to understand the context of what happened. ...</p>
              <p>... but it doesn't mean that the bread is really Jesus' body, or the wine is really his blood. it's purely symbolic. you can go test the wine now and test the bread that u use everyday, unless God performs another miracle, it's just bread, and it's just wine. but it symbolize everything Christ wanted for the church - to remember He died for us, to remember that we can now stand before a holy God in freedom and joy, to remember we don't have to hide in shame, to remember that He loves us, to remember to love others as He loves us.</p>
              <p>... so basically 2 issues paul addressed. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">St Paul uses very harsh words and warnings about eating the bread and drinking the cup in an unworthy manner. He </span><span style="color: #333333;">describes such a person as <em>sinning/profaning</em> against the body and blood of Christ, <em>eating and drinking judgement </em></span><span style="color: #333333;"><em>upon himself</em> and even links this to the <em>illnesses and deaths</em> being experienced by his audience. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">All these </span><span style="color: #333333;">warnings/consequences would appear 'over-done' if the bread and wine were mere symbols. The warnings would make </span><span style="color: #333333;">much more sense however, if the bread and wine do indeed become the body and blood of Christ when consecrated. This </span><span style="color: #333333;">I believe, was the point that the article was making.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">What we perceive with our senses is not always a good indicator of spiritual realities. In the Holy Eucharist, </span><span style="color: #333333;"><em>Jesus is literally and wholly present - body and blood, soul and divinity - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under the appearances of bread and </span></em></span><span style="color: #333333;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wine</span></em>. This is how we eat his flesh and drink his blood in order to have eternal life as Jesus taught in John 6:54. The Jews understood Jesus as <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">speaking literally</span></em>, hence their question, "How can this man give us His flesh to </span><span style="color: #333333;">eat?" (John 6:52). Many of Jesus' followers then left him because of the difficulty of this teaching. Did Jesus </span><span style="color: #333333;">clarify, ""Hey, guys, come back here, you got it all wrong. I was only speaking symbolically !" ? <em>No, he did not b</em></span><span style="color: #333333;"><em>ecause <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they did not get it wrong</span></em>. They understood correctly - we must eat Jesus' flesh and drink His blood, or we </span><span style="color: #333333;">have no life within us. And we do this during Holy Communion.<br></span></p>

              <p>"How might we deepen our awareness of the meaning of this small gem of a dialogue? What is its purpose? It is a statement of belief that the gathered Church makes in Christ’s presence in the Eucharist. It is further an acknowledgement of the presence of Christ in the faithful and union with Christ in his Body, the Church."</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>How is “Amen” an Act of Reverence?<br>Saying “Amen,” means we assent to our faith with our head and heart and will. Not only do we believe in the real presence but we also commit ourselves to living<br>and acting as Jesus did and does.<br>Tertullian, a 3rd century North African theologian, applied the Latin term sacramentum to the rites of baptism and Eucharist. Sacramentum referred to the oath of allegiance that soldiers made to the Roman emperor to serve him, even with their life. At this time in the Church’s history, persecutions were common enough to make baptism into Christ a commitment that could mean dying for the faith. Thus, saying “Amen” to<br>the sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ serves as a Catholic pledge of allegiance to follow Christ."</p>

              <p>there's a difference between putting God to the test, and testing every spirit and miracle before asserting it as truth. </p>
              <p>i nv said that a demon perform that miracle (i'm not saying that it didn't either), i said that demons can perform miracles as well.</p>
              <p>because of the way it happened. He was asking about whether it was ok to use leavened bread for communion, and the miracle happened. tts why i said, if the miracle happened again, when someone really ask if the bread and wine is really his flesh and blood, then of course i'll be more inclined to believe mah right?</p>
              <p>at best, i see it as God answering a different question, and everyone got ahead of themselves.</p>
              <p>at worst, i see that it's not God who performed that miracle. (with all due respect)</p>
              <p>i'm just seeing it as logically as i can.</p>
              <p>i'm not being bias or trying to attack you la, why so defensive? lol</p>
              <p>even if i don't see the bread and wine as Jesus' real physical body and blood, and it's symbolic to me, doesn't mean i treat it flippantly. i definitely see it as spiritual food, and Jesus wants me to take it and remember His death, and ressurection and that He's coming again.</p>

              <p>amen simply means, "so be it" in hebrew. to affirm blessings or curses.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">How is “Amen” an Act of Reverence?<br>Saying “Amen,” means we assent to our faith with our head and heart and will. Not only do we believe in the real presence but we also commit ourselves to living<br>and acting as Jesus did and does.<br>Tertullian, a 3rd century North African theologian, applied the Latin term sacramentum to the rites of baptism and Eucharist. Sacramentum referred to the oath of allegiance that soldiers made to the Roman emperor to serve him, even with their life. At this time in the Church’s history, persecutions were common enough to make baptism into Christ a commitment that could mean dying for the faith. Thus, saying “Amen” to<br>the sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ serves as a Catholic pledge of allegiance to follow Christ."</span></p>

              <p>lesson number 1: winning an argument doesn't change heart.</p>
              <p>so it really depends what's ur purpose. to win an argument, or to change my heart.</p>
              <p>btw. i attended mass on saturday.</p>
              <p>i'd like to pose a question:</p>
              <p>the 2nd reading, does anyone know what it means when paul was talking about his reward -</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Charis SIL'; line-height: normal;"><span id="en-NIV-28542" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; vertical-align: text-top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. </span><span id="en-NIV-28543" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; vertical-align: text-top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">18</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.</span></span></p>
              <p>Because, this 2 verses seems to go in a circle, if paul reaches voluntarily, he has a reward, which is that he can preach.</p>
              <p>but everyone just says "the word of the lord", then go home, but how many ppl understand what this mean?</p>
              <p>because the way i see it, if you don't understand it, you can't apply it, if you can't apply it, it won't change your life, it's just like.. a breeze blowing past your ears.</p>
              <p>and everyone around me read it, and it's like either they understood it, or.. it doesn't occur to them that it's a difficult verse to understand. because after reading it, nobody seems to be pondering about it. while i kept reading the slip of paper, trying to figure out what it means.</p>
              <p>either that or i'm too stupid to get it. lol</p>

              <p>there's a difference between putting God to the test, and
              testing every spirit and miracle before asserting it as
              truth.</p>
              <p>i nv said that a demon perform that miracle (i'm not saying that
              it didn't either), i said that demons can perform miracles as
              well.</p>
              <p>because of the way it happened. He was asking about whether it
              was ok to use leavened bread for communion, and the miracle
              happened. tts why i said, if the miracle happened again, when
              someone really ask if the bread and wine is really his flesh and
              blood, then of course i'll be more inclined to believe mah
              right?</p>
              <p>at best, i see it as God answering a different question, and
              everyone got ahead of themselves.</p>
              <p>at worst, i see that it's not God who performed that miracle.
              (with all due respect)</p>
              <p>i'm just seeing it as logically as i can.</p>

              <p>The miracle actually involved the use of <em>unleaven</em><em>ed</em> bread, as the priest involved was used to the Eastern Rite where leavened bread is the only acceptable matter. In both Rites, transubstantiation is believed to take place during the consecration.</p>
              <p>You may choose to believe that it was a sign that the matter used didn't matter as the gesture is supposed to be merely symbolic. However, I think the other documented miracles at Betania and Santarem refute that, and show that the power invested in a priest to perform the Eucharist <em>in persona Christi</em> is real.</p>

              <p>If he actually had that particular doubt (whether it was the Real Presence), it would have been a scandalous thing to say publicly, even today.

              <p>The real presence of Christ body is beyond doubts. In your case, you choose not to believe it which is ok.</p>
              <p>The problem is you choose to read it out of context. The question is not about if unleavened bread can be used…..<span style="text-decoration: underline;">the monk was simply having doubt if the bread can really be real body and blood of Christ and that is the question.</span> I quote from the link I gave you:<br><br><strong>“After having pronounced the words of Consecration (“This is My Body... This is My Blood”), as Jesus had taught it to His Apostles, the monk saw the host change into a living piece of Flesh, and the wine change into real blood”</strong><br><br>And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this is not the only one that has happened</span> as per the previous links I gave to you. This has gone through scientific investigations by the most illustrious scientist and it's authenticity proven. I.E. that the flesh and blood are real (human species) proven. And you can even see it today.</p>
              <p>These miracles are in line with what the Bible is saying and Jesus Himself told us that these are His body and blood. Not symbolic. Omnia and Pennycake has explained the bible verses already.</p>
              <p>Not "everyone got ahead of
                          themselves and interpret the miracle for more than what it really
                          is" Rather, many others have tried to downplay this as it merely showed that The Church has the right understanding of the Bible and with miracles as proof.</p>

              to change my heart.</p>
              <p>btw. i attended mass on saturday.</p>
              <p>i'd like to pose a question:</p>
              <p>the 2nd reading, does anyone know what it means when paul was
              talking about his reward -</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Charis SIL';"><span style="font-size: 0.65em; vertical-align: text-top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if
              not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to
              me. </span><span style="font-size: 0.65em; vertical-align: text-top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">18</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">What then is my reward? Just this: that in
              preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make
              use of my rights in preaching it.</span></span></p>
              <p>Because, this 2 verses seems to go in a circle, if paul reaches
              voluntarily, he has a reward, which is that he can preach.</p>
              <p>but everyone just says "the word of the lord", then go home, but
              how many ppl understand what this mean?</p>
              <p>because the way i see it, if you don't understand it, you can't
              apply it, if you can't apply it, it won't change your life, it's
              just like.. a breeze blowing past your ears.</p>
              <p>and everyone around me read it, and it's like either they
              understood it, or.. it doesn't occur to them that it's a difficult
              verse to understand. because after reading it, nobody seems to be
              pondering about it. while i kept reading the slip of paper, trying
              to figure out what it means.</p>
              <p>either that or i'm too stupid to get it. lol</p>

              <p>I don't see how Paul is not having a fulfilling life just because of problems with the Corintin Church. Despite his problems, he is able to continue preaching the Gospel because he knew his vocation and purpose. Not just to the corinthians but others as well (including us today by reading his letters). So can I say Paul is able to continue to serve the Lord for free (not because it was a job that pay him well etc) because he knew his vocation and purpose?</p>
              <p>Do you think he lead a fruitful life as an apostle of Jesus? I would certainly think so....</p>
              <p>Just like in our world today, we are facing problems with the financial crisis and life's pressure....Paul have his fair share of problems too and so do Job. The difference in how they cope is explained in my earlier posts (I hoped I did).</p>
              <p>The readings also aims to inspire us in this difficult time. Do we know what God's will for us? Can we live our life doing God's will? For Jesus and Paul, they are servants to God. They are here to serve.......are we ready to serve or expect to be served?</p>
              <p>Maybe, we should reflect and take a step back....do we need that big house, that big car or that branded toys etc....? Is that our purpose in life?</p>
              <p>Oh, one more thing, do not forget Peter's mother in law.....once she is healed by Jesus, she immediately started to wait on the others.....no MC. That's also telling us to love our neighbour as Jesus has loved us - to serve each other.</p>
