              <p>It is not endless….because the truth is there for all to see.
              Like I said, falsehood that is repeated again and again is causing
              wrong impressions.</p>
              <p>Mother Mary is indeed a powerful intercessor and so are the
              other Saints. Some people are told that Jesus listen to Mother Mary
              more…..and maybe that’s the fault of Novena….or misunderstanding of
              what the priest there meant.</p>
              <p>But really, what they are saying is that the prayers of Saints
              are more powerful than us poor sinners. That is why we asked them
              to help pray with us and for us and it works. We see this happening
              with the many thanks giving testimonies and petitions received at
              Novenas. If you read the latest Catholic News, you will realise
              that 40% of people who attend Novena are non-Christians – many
              later signed up for RCIA and become Catholic as a result of Mother
              Mary’s prayers for them. Yes, Mother Mary always point people to
              her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>Don’t get the wrong impression that we “out-source” our prayers
              to Mother Mary or the Saints….actually, we ask them to pray with us
              and for us…..and,  we, as a Church, as a  community
              worship one God. This is reflected in the creed that we recite
              every week at Mass.</p>
              <p>Actually, the early protestant churches (including martin
              luther) has no problem with devotion to Mother Mary.<br> <br> I never heard that St Joseph is pao ka liao…..?? Pao what?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>what i get annoyed with is, my gf would rather ask mother mary to pray for her rather than allow me to pray with her when she's going through something difficult.</p>
              <p>i very much want to share my enthusiasm with her, prayer, reading bible together, learning together.</p>
              <p>as for something that works. the jews still feel that their annual sacrifices work - but we know that now that Christ has come, the sacrifices don't work with God anymore.</p>
              <p>my parents used to think that burning and drinking yellow paper with magical inscription works.</p>
              <p>in the end, the truth must be more than "something that works". the truth is in the bible, the whole of it. read it, understand it, adsorb it, apply it. </p>

              <p>Mother Mary was still on earth when transfiguration happened
              isn’t it? </p>
              <p>God did include in the Bible. Quoting from Catholic.com:<br> “The possibility of a bodily assumption before the Second Coming is
              suggested by Matthew 27:52–53: "The tombs also were opened, and
              many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and
              coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the
              holy city and appeared to many."</p>
              <p>Did all these Old Testament saints die and have to be buried all
              over again? There is no record of that, but it is recorded by early
              Church writers that they were assumed into heaven, or at least into
              that temporary state of rest and happiness often called "paradise,"
              where the righteous people from the Old Testament era waited until
              Christ’s resurrection (cf. Luke 16:22, 23:43; Heb. 11:1–40; 1 Pet.
              4:6), after which they were brought into the eternal bliss of
              heaven.”</p>
              <p>Finally, though we believed that the Bible is the Word of God,
              we need to be careful as "First of all you must understand this,
              that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own
              interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of
              man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God" (2 Peter
              1:20-21).</p>
              <p>The assumption of Mary is considered false by protestant
              churches because it is not explicitly in Scripture but there is no
              problem so long as it is not in contradiction to Scripture.<br> <br> The Catholic Church was commissioned by Christ to teach all nations
              and to teach them infallibly—guided, as he promised, by the Holy
              Spirit until the end of the world (John 14:26, 16:13). The mere
              fact that the Church teaches that something is definitely true is a
              guarantee that it is true (cf. Matt. 28:18-20, Luke 10:16, 1 Tim.
              3:15).<br></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>sure, mother mary was still alive at that time. but if her bodily assumption was real/ or important, God would have written it in the bible after she has been bodily captured.</p>
              <p>and that verses you quote did nothing to disprove that the fact that mother mary's bodily assumption was not recorded down in the bible.</p>

              <p>She is simply asking Mother Mary to pray for her and with her. Nothing wrong as we are trying to point to you.</p>
              <p>And my questions is, what you see at Mass...? Are we praying to God or Mother Mary?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do believed that we pray to God, then there is nothing wrong.</p>

              <p>what i get annoyed with is, my gf would rather ask mother mary
                  to pray for her rather than allow me to pray with her when she's
                  going through something difficult.</p>
              <p>i very much want to share my enthusiasm with her, prayer,
                  reading bible together, learning together.</p>
              <p>as for something that works. the jews still feel that their
                  annual sacrifices work - but we know that now that Christ has come,
                  the sacrifices don't work with God anymore.</p>
              <p>my parents used to think that burning and drinking yellow paper
                  with magical inscription works.</p>
              <p>in the end, the truth must be more than "something that works".
                  the truth is in the bible, the whole of it. read it, understand it,
                  adsorb it, apply it. </p>

              <p>You should try to separate your private life with your gf and the truth about the Catholic faith - no offence....</p>
              <p>I don't know why your gf do not want to accept your help to pray for her....it's really something personal between you and her. But there is really nothing wrong with her trusting Mother Mary to help pray with her and for her. Perhaps, it is because of your anti-Catholics sentiments shown to her?  I hope you can have a nice heart to heart talk with her and I am sure you can get over this problem.</p>
              <p>As for your parent's old beliefs and what the Jews do, it has nothing to do with Mother Mary. The fact is, she has helped many and is still helping....and we know cause many of us have been helped by her too.</p>
              <p>Everything that the Catholic Church teaches are in line with the Bible and what the apostles preaches. And the doctrines are applicable in our lives.....</p>

              <p>I think we are not talking about the same thing. Not everything that is in the Bible happened exactly as it is and that is an accepted fact....bearing in mind these are events that are pass down orally....and some events are probaly never happened.</p>
              <p>However, the messages and teachings that the stories is telling us is the truth. I agree that some people have misinterpreted the Bible especially if we try to read it on our own based on our own understanding. But I believe that the Church teaches us the absolute truth based on the Bible. I believed that only the Church has the correct intepretation of the Bible.</p>

              <p>I think you are not reading the post in proper context.</p>
              <p>Of course I believed that the Catholic Churches teaches the absolute right. As I said, absolute right to me.</p>
              <p>Why would you want to be in a protestant church and do not believe that your church is teaching and preaching to you the absolute truth?</p>
              <p>And I thought you recently wrote something about being 100% true to your conviction and do not agree on deviation.....</p>
              <p>I don't think it is a matter of being arrogant but rather faith. If you do not believe 100% in Christ and the Church He build, how can you say you have faith? Whatever church you go, you need to believed 100%.</p>
              <p>For me, I can accept protestant as I mentioned to you before, I am not here to convert you (or anyone) to become a Catholic. What we share is based on what we know...and what we don't know, we can go find out.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, we choose what is more convincing to us about the truth and we embrace it whole-heartedly. Catholic or protestant, we worship the same God isn't it?</p>
              <p>I am certainly not anti-protestant and there is no need to....being anti-protestant does not make Catholic correct. Understanding the doctrine will.</p>
              <p>Which doctrine did you proved that we are wrong but I insist?</p>
              <p>And no, I never said that bible is not reliable....NEVER.....and I do believe the teachings 100%.</p>

              <p>I see . . .the catholic church held dominion over Christian kings and the people's daily lives in the middle ages. That's the kind of power that is vulnerable of becoming corrupted. And it is no secret that it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> become much corrupted.</p>
              <p>And actually i've found that in order for my church doctrines to be correct the others may not necessarily be wrong. Or in precise words, In order to believe my church doctrines to be at least partially correct the others may not necessarily be wholly wrong.</p>
              <p>I pick this stand to keep an open mind. If you notice, the Catholic church doctrine has changed over time and we can expect it to continually evolve no matter how little. The Early church doctrine on death is not the same with the current Catholic doctrine on the same topic for example. So you see either the early church was wrong or the current doctrine is wrong. Or they both may be partially correct.</p>
              <p>Anyway I put no stock in doctrines either state or religious. In fact I put no stock in religion nor state. I'm a simple man just putting my faith in Christ. I hate neither Catholic(I'm one) nor Protestant. And I think they are both great. Of course bad apples are everywhere. And I firmly believe that Christian IS NOT a religion. It's a way of life.</p>

              <p>Not everything is found in the Bible. The Bible is only half of it. The Bible is our written tradition, written, compiled and interpreted by the Catholic Church.

              <p>Ok I will copy and paste my comments on a blog post (http://wooq.blogspot.com/2005/08/theological-response-to-fcbc-and-its.html) -</p>
              <p>Yes, we have the doctrine of <strong>papal infallibility</strong> (not
              impeccability, which is quite different... the Pope is perfectly human
              and goes for weekly Confession) - which is why we are <strong>One</strong> Church, not many. (if you disagree on major issues with your spiritual leader, how could you purport to share the same faith?)<br>The Pope is infallible not through his own merit, but by the action of the Holy Spirit, and his <em><strong>authority</strong></em> can be traced in <strong>visible unity of the apostolic succession</strong> from St. Peter, who received his authority from Christ: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.<br>http://www.catholic.com/library/Peter_the_Rock.asp<br>'This
              authority of the prime minister under the king was passed on from one
              man to another down through the ages by the giving of the keys, which
              were worn on the shoulder as a sign of authority. Likewise, the
              authority of Peter has been passed down for 2000 years by means of the
              papacy.'</p>
              <p>In any case, the Pope is only infallible in certain cases.<br><br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5355758.stm<br><br>The
              agreement reached by the Council stated that a Pope "when he speaks ex
              cathedra" - that is, as head of the Church - is "possessed of
              infallibility" when "he defines.... a doctrine concerning faith and
              morals to be held by the whole Church". <br><br>Once the Pope has spoken, the First Vatican Council agreed, his definitions "are irreformable of themselves".<br><br>Routine papal teaching, however, is not considered infallible.<br><br>And
              such infallible proclamations are highly uncommon. According to papal
              historian Michael Walsh there has only been one occasion since the
              council proclamation when a pope has made an infallible statement.<br><br>...<br>To issue an infallible statement "you make a dogmatic statement 'ex cathedra' from the chair of Peter".<br><br>...<br>And,
              if the Pope rarely issues an infallible statement, why is it necessary?
              According to Mr Walsh, it's all down to the way the Church is
              structured.<br><br>"The Catholic Church is really a federation of
              churches," he says. "Each bishop rules his own diocese, but all those
              bishops are united in the Pope, as the Bishop of Rome.<br><br>"The
              bishops are supposed to be united in faith, but when there is division
              over theological issues, the argument is that the one person who can
              never fall away from the faith is the pope. He, in a sense, maintains
              the true faith and will be prevented by the Holy Spirit of 'going into
              error'."<br><br>-=+=-<br><br>The Catholic Church is like a wheel - the
              Vatican is the hub, and each diocese is at the end of a spoke.. but it is
              one wheel, and thus we roll along..</p>

              <p>We need to understand the scope of the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. Jesus Christ established the Catholic Church and gave it the authority to teach <em>faith</em> <em>and morals.</em> St Paul describes the Church (not the bible) as the "<em>pillar and foundation of truth</em>" (1Tim3:15). When there are disputes, Jesus tells us that the final arbitrator is the Church which is given the authority to bind and to loose on earth ("<em>If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen even to the church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector. Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven</em>." Mat 18:17)</p>
              <p>So when the Catholic Church teaches on faith and morals, we listen and follow.</p>
              <p>But beyond faith and morals (eg: science, politics) the Church does not have this teaching authority. The Church's mission is to bring souls to heaven, not groom scientists or astronomers. This teaching authority is also <em>not</em> dependent on how holy or good the pope and his bishops are. Even St Peter and the apostles were sinful men who denied and deserted Jesus at this death, yet we treat their letters as the inspired word of God in the bible.</p>
              <p>How and when has the Catholic Church's interpretation of doctrine been proven wrong ? Miracles&amp;Prophecies mentions contradictions in current church teachings on death with that of the early church. Could you explain more about these contradictions ?</p>
              <p>Put it another way, if we do not believe the Catholic Church to have this teaching authority, who are we to turn to in order to learn the truth ? The bible ? Who's interpretation of the bible are we suppose to follow ? Mine ? Yours ? The pastor of the church down the road ? The one three blocks away ?</p>
              <p>Did Jesus leave all of us to fumble around and try to discern the truth on our own, and follow whichever teaching we ourselves feel good about ? How are we to follow Jesus' words in Mat18:17 to go to the Church ? Which Church would that be ?</p>

              <p>To me personally, the Catholic Church has convinced me that she is preaching the truth, not just by what they said but also what they do....and my perssonal experiences with God simply reaffirm that to me.</p>
              <p>Are you a "stay at home Catholic" or one that goes to weekly Mass?</p>
              <p>Christianity is a religion and way of life and putting our faith in Christ means listening to His words and acting on it. I.E. living our Christian life based on love and charity. Our Church is Christ and our fellow brothers and sisters.</p>

              <p>I think you still have the misconception that the Catholic Church is about the Pope.</p>
              <p>The Pope is only the head of the Church and a successor of St Peter.....the Church is about Christ and His followers....</p>
