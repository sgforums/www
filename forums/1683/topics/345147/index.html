              <p><strong>The host is important to Catholics.  True.</strong></p>
              <p>For us, it is a sacrament and a sacrifice.  In the Holy Eucharist, under the
                  appearances of bread and wine, the Lord Christ is contained, offered, and received. (Extract from EWTN).  Hence it is Holy.</p>
              <p><strong>However it can be used for evil. False.</strong></p>
              <p>God is never evil, so how can you use Him for evil?  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  Besides, Holy and evil have opposite meanings.</p>

              For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died,

              <p>Satanists or lately, atheists, procure the Blessed Sacrament for profaning. There are many ways of doing it, but I shan't say it because it is too dreadful to contemplate.</p>

              <p>If it is a simple case of theft, it's not so frightening....but if it is some lunatics that are trying to stir feelings and religious discomfort, then it is scary.....</p>

              <p>With that brought to my mind of "Eucharistic Miracle of Santarem" when the host was supposed to be used for witchcraft but was never allowed to happen.

              <p>mm this is remarkable. okok, i know i'm hairsplitting and being petty here, but this is how i honestly feel:</p>
              <p>firstly, with utmost respect and by no mean to insult, the bible do say that demons can perform miracles too, as seen during moses time. i don't think this is the case la.</p>
              <p>2ndly, if it wasn't demons, the priest wasn't asking God is the bread and wine really embodiment of his flesh and blood, when it turned. He was asking of a different issue. whether can unleavened bread be used or not. and God answered it, just like God telling peter to eat unclean food.</p>
              <p>when someone ask God again if the bread and wine is really literally his flesh and blood, and it turns, let me know. </p>

              <p>2ndly, if it wasn't demons, the priest wasn't asking God is the

              turned. He was asking of a different issue. whether can unleavened

What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <p></p>
              <p> <span id="en-NIV-28608" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">23</span>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <span id="en-NIV-28609" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">24</span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me." <span id="en-NIV-28610" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">25</span>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me." <span id="en-NIV-28611" class="sup" style="font-size: 0.65em; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: text-top;">26</span>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</p>

              <p>there are 2 issues which paul wishes to address here: first, the disunity in the church, and 2nd, the unworthy way they see the communion.</p>
              <p>apparently you have to understand what the communion symbolize. the bread, symbolize the body, we are all part of the body of Christ, the blood, poured out for our sins, made from many grapes crushed together and fermented together.</p>
              <p>it is appropriate that we all take it together, as a symbolism of unity, as a body. but apparently that's not so during that time. everyone takes it whenever they wish it, instead of together. some don't wait for the bread to be passed around, but quickly gulp his share etc, instead of waiting for everyone to be ready to take it together. the spirit of unity.</p>
              <p>it's again, like how my friends although order their food already, wait for the others' food to arrive before tucking in.</p>
              <p>the second issue, taking the communion in an unworthy manner.  take note, that some church goers, treat the communion as some sort of breakfast meal. they come early to church, grab a huge hunk of bread, and eat it and gulp down the wine. and get drunk in the process.</p>
              <p>is this how u remember the Lord's sacrifice? that's what paul is trying to say.</p>
              <p>but it doesn't mean that the bread is really Jesus' body, or the wine is really his blood. it's purely symbolic. you can go test the wine now and test the bread that u use everyday, unless God performs another miracle, it's just bread, and it's just wine. but it symbolize everything Christ wanted for the church - to remember He died for us, to remember that we can now stand before a holy God in freedom and joy, to remember we don't have to hide in shame, to remember that He loves us, to remember to love others as He loves us.</p>
              <p>a metaphor: when we sing the national anthem and recite the national pledge, it only symbolize the spirit behind the pledge and anthem right? that's all to it. if we treat the spirit (of unity in this case), by not standing still and upright, we're not being respectful.</p>
              <p>but does that mean the flag becomes the person who wrote the anthem of pledge?</p>
              <p>so basically 2 issues paul addressed. </p>
              <p>1) the need for unity in the family of God</p>
              <p>2) not to treat Christ's sacrifice lightly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so when we take communion - remember, <span style="font-weight: bold;">if we have any arguments with anyone, make peace with that person first, before taking it, if we have any sins, confess them in ur heart, before taking it. </span></p>
              <p>that's the proper way of taking it.</p>
              <p> i remember my gf got brief me how to take communion (during christmas eve mass), the priest will say something, and i must say something also. is that really the proper way? personally i don't think so.</p>
              <p>it is more important to do what i embolded above, than to recite a procedural phrase isn't it.</p>

              <p>let me use another metaphor:</p>
              <p>if someone ask me a question, say, am i christian, and I say "Yes", he can't go around telling people that dumbdumb is anti-buddhist, because he says "Yes".</p>
              <p>a bad metaphor, but what i'm trying to say is, i don't think God is answering the question that the bread is really his physical body, and the wine, his physical blood.</p>
              <p>so i don't believe it, not because i don't believe the miracle is fake or anything. but i believe that the miracle was to answer a different question.</p>
              <p>basically</p>
              <p>it's not even proven that it is his physical body or blood. I believe God was answering another question with a miracle, but not the question of whether the bread and wine is his real body and blood</p>
