              <p>The reading is not about Paul and the corinthian church. It is
              about Paul's spirit as apostle of Christ. I think you are looking
              at it differently.</p>
              <p>It does not go in circles and certianly not out of context. Only

                                      me to take it and remember His death, and ressurection and that

              <p>Glad
              to know that =) just that.. some of my Protestant friends give me the
              impression that it's not really that important to them? =/ they are quite curious about why we have it at every Mass (they have it just on the 1st Sunday of each month).. It's the <em>point</em> of the Mass! and it's the
              heart of the Catholic Church so our attitudes feel so difficult to
              reconcile =(</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>amen simply means, "so be it" in hebrew. to affirm blessings or
                                      curses.</p>
              <p>and has nothing to do with reverence etc.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The attitude with which I speak the utterance is reverent..</p>
              <p>You have to remember, the use of many words tend to change over time (just flip through any etymology dictionary), and the Wikipedia article is separated into <strong>different usages of Amen</strong>. Its use in Christianity differs from its use in Judaism.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The use of the initial amen, single or double in form, to introduce
              solemn statements of Jesus in the Gospels had no parallel in Jewish
              practice.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>and its use in different branches of Christianity has variations too. Catholics at Mass use it as a reverent affirmation of our beliefs and commitment. Other denominations may use it as a way of agreeing heartily with their preachers or spiritual leaders.</p>

              <p>You are right that every aspect is important (including doing God's will) .....but what pennycake is trying to tell you is that the holy communion is the highlight of the Mass (not that the others are not important or less important)....which is why our Mass is also called Eucharistic Celebration and you know now that it is not symbolic but real presence of Christ.</p>
              <p>You will notice that the Mass from begining till end is about God and Christ.....and wonder why some protestants are spreading lies that Catholics are not worshipping God and that they are worshipping Mary........??</p>

              <p>You are right that every aspect is important (including doing
                  God's will) .....but what pennycake is trying to tell you is that
                  the holy communion is the highlight of the Mass (not that the
                  others are not important or less important)....which is why our
                  Mass is also called Eucharistic Celebration and you know now that
                  it is not symbolic but real presence of Christ.</p>
              <p>You will notice that the Mass from begining till end is about
                  God and Christ.....and wonder why some protestants are spreading
                  lies that Catholics are not worshipping God and that they are
                  worshipping Mary........??</p>

              <p>i've talked about this many times already. if it's just something i've heard from others it's one thing, but it's different when i see it for myself, and hear ppl talk about it etc.</p>
              <p>it's another endless discussion, really.Â </p>
              <p>to me, if you stand in front of a statue, bowing your head (and i'm not talking about checking out your shoes), it's prayer. call me ignorant, but tts how it is for me.</p>
              <p>yes, i know you all say that it's the same as how i would ask my cell leader to pray for me etc. but erm yeah, i actually hv a physical conversation with him, and i'm not on my knees when i ask him to pray for me.Â </p>
              <p>and some say that Jesus will hear mother mary's prayers more, and be more inclined to listen to her, because she's his mother etc. this one i think my aunt said that.</p>
              <p>and some will tell the congregation to go st joseph because he, as Jesus' father, pao ka liao.</p>
              <p>and some will tell the congregation that mother mary is the best matchmaker</p>
              <p>and of course, to sum it up, some rosary group member was unhappy that the group changed the statue and in fact, kicked a big fuss until they had to have an official meeting about it. ugly business. (yes, yes, some ppl feel more attached like photograph etc as quoted by smarty or some others - but as the list goes on, the excuses cooked up just gets weaker and lamer la)</p>
              <p>so like chin eng says.. let's just agree to disagree. on my part, my prayers will only be directed to God alone, and i will only ask a living person to pray with me or for me. i won't ever ask a dead person to pray for me on my behalf to God.</p>

              <p>tts how it works.</p>
              <p>now, i'm not discrediting catholics who are real in their faith - like mother theresa, father richards and alot of nuns and monks who devoted their lives to God. commendable really.</p>
              <p>i'm just saying, that u can't use that as an excuse. protestant or catholic.</p>
              <p>from what i've heard, alot of things i agree with father richard - everytime u see a christian with a sour face, it's always a catholic. or, the time he talked about bringing in a coffin, and placing a mirror in it, and watch their own reflection in it, to emphasis the fact that the church is dead.</p>
              <p>so what if you have fiery preachers, until you stop giving excuses and start doing things, then people's perspective will automatically change.</p>
              <p>u know what really gets to me now - christians (protestant or catholic) with lousy anger management problem. full of pride.</p>

                          cell leader to pray for me etc. but erm yeah, i actually hv a

                          him to pray for me.Â </p>

              <p>It is not endlessâ¦.because the truth is there for all to see. Like I said, falsehood that is repeated again and again is causing wrong impressions.</p>
              <p>Mother Mary is indeed a powerful intercessor and so are the other Saints. Some people are told that Jesus listen to Mother Mary moreâ¦..and maybe thatâs the fault of Novenaâ¦.or misunderstanding of what the priest there meant.</p>
              <p>But really, what they are saying is that the prayers of Saints are more powerful than us poor sinners. That is why we asked them to help pray with us and for us and it works. We see this happening with the many thanks giving testimonies and petitions received at Novenas. If you read the latest Catholic News, you will realise that 40% of people who attend Novena are non-Christians â many later signed up for RCIA and become Catholic as a result of Mother Maryâs prayers for them. Yes, Mother Mary always point people to her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>Donât get the wrong impression that we âout-sourceâ our prayers to Mother Mary or the Saintsâ¦.actually, we ask them to pray with us and for usâ¦..and,Â  we, as a Church, as aÂ  community worship one God. This is reflected in the creed that we recite every week at Mass.</p>
              <p>Actually, the early protestant churches (including martin luther) has no problem with devotion to Mother Mary.<br><br>I never heard that St Joseph is pao ka liaoâ¦..?? Pao what?</p>

              <p>By the way, it will be good to know what the rosary is aboutâ¦â¦you will be surprised that it is all about Christ and not Mary if you know it.</p>
              <p>It is not excusesâ¦..itâs a tradition that has been passed down. It is not compulsory for Catholics to do Novenas or pray the rosary but why so many of them do? It is because it works and have been workings for centuriesâ¦.<br></p>

              <p>so like chin eng says.. let's just agree to disagree. on my
              part, my prayers will only be directed to God alone, and i will
              only ask a living person to pray with me or for me. i won't ever
              ask a dead person to pray for me on my behalf to God.</p>

              <p>honouring is giving her the due respect she deserves because she
                  had the guts to do God's will even though it would have given her
                  great dishonour (to be pregnant before being married is a big
                  scandal). but i think there's a line drawn la, we can't hv this
                  discussion if neither of us can be open minded enough to see it
                  logically.</p>
              <p>this is the facts i see: you set up altars for statues of mother
                  mary</p>
              <p>you decorate her altar with flowers and bottles of holy
                  water</p>
              <p>she's dead (and will be called up at the end of days to be
                  judged by Jesus, like every one of us)</p>
              <p>at the end of it, she's human, Jesus is God. i really cannot
                  reconcile the fact that some of you can tell me, asking her to pray
                  for me is more effective because she is his mother, and Jesus will
                  listen to her.</p>

              <p>Actually, you are right that we must honour Mother Mary for what she has done. The whole salvation plan started with Mother Mary and it is her obedience and faith in God that makes the birth of Christ possibleâ¦And God must have very good reasons to choose her as the mother of His only son.</p>
              <p>She is human, she is mother of God and also our mother too...as Jesus said. At the wedding of Cana, she showed us her concern for what the wedding couple lack and interceded with Jesus to help.</p>
              <p>Centuries of Novenas devotions are testimony that she still does and it works. For us, we treat her like our mother also and we know that she will help us when we askâ¦.but she can only help us pray and intercede with Jesus. Only God can grant us what we pray for.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, Mother Mary is not a âdead personâ but are in heaven with Christâ¦enjoying eternal lifeâ¦..and helping and praying for us....</p>

              <p>true as that may be, but it certainly isn't an excuse.</p>
              <p>we're all salt and light in the world, ppl see the fruits of our
                  belief and use that to see if what we believe is good or bad.</p>
              <p>tts how it works.</p>
              <p>now, i'm not discrediting catholics who are real in their faith
                  - like mother theresa, father richards and alot of nuns and monks
                  who devoted their lives to God. commendable really.</p>
              <p>i'm just saying, that u can't use that as an excuse. protestant
                  or catholic.</p>
              <p>from what i've heard, alot of things i agree with father richard
                  - everytime u see a christian with a sour face, it's always a
                  catholic. or, the time he talked about bringing in a coffin, and
                  placing a mirror in it, and watch their own reflection in it, to
                  emphasis the fact that the church is dead.</p>
              <p>so what if you have fiery preachers, until you stop giving
                  excuses and start doing things, then people's perspective will
                  automatically change.</p>
              <p>u know what really gets to me now - christians (protestant or
                  catholic) with lousy anger management problem. full of pride.</p>

              <p>Actually, there is no excuse for doing what we do. It is all about God and act of faith in Himâ¦.</p>
              <p>Mother Mary, Saints, Rosary, Statues and Icons are all leading us to Godâ¦.lack of understanding of what they are is the problem.</p>
              <p>Thinking that having statues = idolatory is one such example.</p>
              <p>One did not become perfect because he is a Catholic and the same goes for any faith. Disgusting and horrible people are found everywhere and in every faith.....it is not the fault of their faith and it certainly does not means that there is a problem with that faith.</p>

              <p>no i don't. but even if it is, so what? the bible didn't say it.

              wholly inspired by God, and if that was either true or important,

              <p>Mother Mary was still on earth when transfiguration happened isnât it?Â </p>
              <p>God did include in the Bible. Quoting from Catholic.com:<br>âThe possibility of a bodily assumption before the Second Coming is suggested by Matthew 27:52â53: "The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many."</p>
              <p>Did all these Old Testament saints die and have to be buried all over again? There is no record of that, but it is recorded by early Church writers that they were assumed into heaven, or at least into that temporary state of rest and happiness often called "paradise," where the righteous people from the Old Testament era waited until Christâs resurrection (cf. Luke 16:22, 23:43; Heb. 11:1â40; 1 Pet. 4:6), after which they were brought into the eternal bliss of heaven.â</p>
              <p>Finally, though we believed that the Bible is the Word of God, we need to be careful as "First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of oneâs own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God" (2 Peter 1:20-21).</p>
              <p>The assumption of Mary is considered false by protestant churches because it is not explicitly in Scripture but there is no problem so long as it is not in contradiction to Scripture. <br><br>The Catholic Church was commissioned by Christ to teach all nations and to teach them infalliblyâguided, as he promised, by the Holy Spirit until the end of the world (John 14:26, 16:13). The mere fact that the Church teaches that something is definitely true is a guarantee that it is true (cf. Matt. 28:18-20, Luke 10:16, 1 Tim. 3:15).<br><br></p>
