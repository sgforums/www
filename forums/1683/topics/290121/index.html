            <div class='col-md body'>The Doll and the Rose<br><br><img src="http://www.just-imagine-dolls.com/art/marie_osmond/MO_princesss_L.jpg">     <img src="&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;%5Bimg%5Dhttp://www.dfngallery.com/images/franke_white_rose_on_white_.gif"><br><br>I was walking around in a Target store,<br><br>when I saw a Cashier hand this little boy some money back.<br><br>The boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old.<br><br>The Cashier said, 'I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money to buy this<br><br>doll.'<br><br>Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him:<br><br>''Granny,<br><br>are you sure I don't have enough money?''<br><br>The old lady replied: ''You know that you don't have enough money to buy<br><br>this doll, my dear.''<br><br>Then she asked him to stay there for just 5 minutes while she went to look<br><br>a round. She left quickly.<br><br>The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.<br><br>Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give this<br><br>doll to.<br><br>'It's the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for Christmas.<br><br>She was sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.'<br><br>I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus would bring it to her after all,<br><br>and not to worry.<br><br>But he replied to me sadly. 'No, Santa Claus can't bring it to her where<br><br>she is now. I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to<br><br>my sister when she goes there.'<br><br>His eyes were so sad while saying this. 'My Sister has gone to be with God<br><br>. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought<br><br>that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister.''<br><br>My heart nearly stopped.<br><br>The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mommy not<br><br>to<br><br>go yet. I need her to wait until I come back from the mall.'<br><br>Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then<br><br>told me 'I want mommy to take my picture with her so she won't forget me.'<br><br>'I love my mommy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me, but daddy says<br><br>that she has to go to be with my little sister.'<br><br>Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.<br><br>I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. 'Suppose we check<br><br>again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll?''<br><br>'OK' he said, 'I hope I do have enough.' I added some of my money to his<br><br>without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the<br><br>doll and even some spare money.<br><br>The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough<br><br>money!'<br><br>Then he looked at me and added, 'I asked last night before I went to sleep<br><br>for God to make sure I had enough money to buy this doll, so that mommy<br><br>could give It to my sister. He heard me!''<br><br>'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I<br><br>didn't dare to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll<br><br>and a white rose.''<br><br>'My mommy loves white roses.'<br><br>A few minutes later, the old lady returned and I left with my basket.<br><br>I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started.<br><br>I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind.<br><br>Then I remembered a local newspaper article two days ago,<br><br>which mentioned a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young<br><br>woman and a little girl.<br><br>The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical<br><br>state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the<br><br>life-sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to<br><br>recover from the coma.<br><br>Was this the family of the little boy?<br><br>Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper<br><br>that the young woman had passed away.<br><br>I couldn't stop myself as I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the<br><br>funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to<br><br>see and make last wishes before her burial.<br><br>She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand<br><br>with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest.<br><br>I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed<br><br>forever.. The love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister<br><br>is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second, a drunk<br><br>driver had taken all this away from him.<br><br>Now you have 2 choices:<br><br>1) Repost this message, or<br><br>2) Ignore it as if it never touched your heart.<br><br>The quote of the month is by Jay Leno:<br><br>'With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding,<br><br>severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, and<br><br>with the threat of bird flu and terrorist attacks, 'Are we sure this is a<br><br>good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?'<br><br>For those who prefer to think that God is not watching over us....go ahead<br><br>and delete this.
