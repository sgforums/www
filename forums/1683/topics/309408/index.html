              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Gunmen have kidnapped the archbishop of the Chaldean
              Catholic Church in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and killed three of
              his aides, his church says. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho was seized as he left a church in the eastern al-Nour district, it added. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Pope Benedict XVI deplored the kidnapping as a "despicable" crime. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Most of Iraq's estimated 700,000 Christians are
              Chaldeans - Catholics who are autonomous from Rome but recognise the
              Pope's authority.
               </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Many have been targeted since the 2004 invasion by Sunni extremists groups. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In January, bombs exploded outside three Chaldean and
              Assyrian churches in Mosul. Several Christian priests have also been
              kidnapped or killed during the past five years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'Fervent prayer' </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Archbishop Rahho had just left the Church of the Holy
              Spirit in Mosul, where he had been leading afternoon prayers, when his
              car was ambushed by armed men, a church spokesman said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The gunmen opened fire on the car, killing his two companions and driver, before kidnapping the archbishop, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Bishop Rabban al-Qas of the nearby city of Irbil said
              his 65-year-old colleague, who was ordained archbishop of Mosul in
              2001, was "in the hands of terrorists". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"But we don't know what physical condition [he is in]," he told the Rome-based Catholic news service, AsiaNews. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"It's a terrible time for our church - pray for us," he added. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The kidnappers have reportedly communicated their demands, but these have not been made public. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Vatican later issued a statement saying the Pope was
              saddened by "this despicable act" which "touches the whole of the
              church in that country". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"The Holy Father asks the universal Church to join in
              his fervent prayer so that reason and humanity prevails in the
              kidnappers and Monsignor Rahho is returned to his flock soon," it said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The incident comes less than year after a Chaldean
              priest and three sub-deacons were gunned down the same church in Mosul
              after celebrating Sunday Mass. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Syrian Catholic archbishop of Mosul, Basile Georges
              Casmoussa, was kidnapped at gunpoint in 2005, but was released after
              one day without a ransom having been paid. </span></p>
