            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friend of Catholic Answers,<br><br>There's something wonderful happening all across America right<br>now ...<br><br>It's something I think you should know about.<br><br>It's getting bigger every day.<br><br>It's affecting tens of thousands of people already.<br><br>It's impacting their daily relationship with the Lord.<br><br>It's impacting their eternal salvation.<br><br>What is this strange force that's causing so much commotion?<br><br>CATHOLIC RADIO!<br><br>Yes, Catholic radio.<br><br>Believe it or not, it's taking America by storm!<br><br>In just the last few years, the Catholic radio movement has grown<br>by leaps and bounds. Take a look ...<br><br>* The number of full-time Catholic radio stations has exploded --<br>from around 4 in 1997 to over 90 today ...<br><br>* The number of Catholic programs being aired on non-Catholic<br>stations has also skyrocketed recently.<br><br>And two of the largest syndicated Catholic radio programs being<br>heard across the country right now are our very own Catholic Answers<br>Live and The Doctor Is In.<br><br>They have rapidly become two of the most popular programs on<br>Catholic stations today.<br><br>We even air them on Evangelical and secular stations--where they<br>are quickly attracting a large following because of their challenging,<br>relevant, and often controversial messages.<br><br>They are easily two of the most influential and effective radio<br>programs people are listening to today.<br><br>How do we know?<br><br>Simple ...<br><br>Every day, we get calls, letters, faxes, and e-mails from people<br>all around the country whose lives have been profoundly influenced by<br>listening to Catholic Answers Live and The Doctor Is In.<br><br>They tell us how the programs have helped them to understand and<br>appreciate the Catholic faith ...<br><br>* to start going to church on Sundays and holy days ...<br><br>* to go to confession for the first time in years ...<br><br>* to receive Holy Communion again ...<br><br>* to pray the rosary ...<br><br>* to strengthen their families ...<br><br>... and to share their new spiritual awakening with family,<br>friends, neighbors, and co-workers.<br><br>If you were able to read the correspondence we get from our<br>listeners, you would be truly amazed.<br><br>Space allows me to share with you just a few examples.<br><br>Here's one from a Protestant pastor who recently converted to the<br>Catholic faith ...<br><br>"Just a quick note to thank you so much for your ministry. As a<br>Protestant minister working toward my masters in divinity, my<br>studies have brought me to several disturbing facts about my<br>faith, e.g. Communion, baptism, etc ...<br><br>"While studying, I stumbled onto your radio program on my local<br>Christian radio station. Ever since that day, I haven't been able<br>to miss one broadcast. I'm hooked! Not only has the program<br>answered my questions, but it has also caused my faith to<br>increase. And I'm happy to say that I am converting to Catholicism<br>in the near future, due in part to your show.<br><br>"Please pray for my family and me as we continue our journey<br>Home."<br><br>Here's one from a stay-at-home mom ...<br><br>"Dr. Ray and Dr. Coleen are an inspiration to my friends and me who<br>are stay-at-home moms. Their program starts our day with humor,<br>excellent advice, and inspirational stories.<br><br>We laity need some practical guidance. Dr. Laura used to be who we<br>turned to for advice, but after listening to The Doctor Is In, we really<br>appreciate receiving the Catholic perspective."<br><br>I could give you many more examples like these, but I'm sure I<br>don't need to.<br><br>You can clearly see that Catholic Answers Live and The Doctor Is In<br>are making a BIG difference in people's lives. They're helping to spread<br>the Catholic faith to tens of thousands of people all across America ...<br><br>... but to keep them on the air, we need your help!<br><br>It costs us an average of $3,000 a day to produce and broadcast our<br>programs.<br><br>That's $780,000 a year.<br><br>Yes, that's a lot of money--but it's worth it when you think of all<br>the people whose lives and souls we're touching in such a profound way.<br><br>I ask you, who among us would want to see this life-changing work<br>stop for lack of funds?<br><br>Not me. And I don't think you would, either.<br><br>You see, we rely largely on the members of the Catholic.com Radio<br>Club to provide the financial resources it takes to keep Catholic<br>Answers Live and The Doctor Is In on the air.<br><br>Your membership makes it all possible.
