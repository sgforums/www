              with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, adopting some needy families
              and elderly living in one-room flats. These have indicated their
              Christmas wishes on tags which have been hung on the Christmas tree in

              of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, Holy Family and Risen Christ will be
              singing Christmas carols and having a harmonica and violin performance

              the Montfort Youth Training Centre in Sabah, East Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The parish is also organising a Christmas Carols Delight on

              hand bells performance. Church of St. Anthony has a three-fold Advent
              project. It is divided into Advent for individuals, where individuals
              are guided over a four-week period by parish priest Father Terence
              Pereira with prayers and reflections; Advent for Families, where
              families are prepared to celebrate the birth of Jesus with a specially
              tailored programme – the Making of the Jesse Tree; and a three-week
              Advent for CNCs (Catholic Neighbourhood Communities).</p>

              <p><strong>St. Joseph Church (Bukit Timah)</strong> will be
              carolling in the homes of parishioners and friends to raise funds for
              BoysÊ¼ Town. Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour will be giving a
              HOPE ribbon to each family as their Advent project. Each family is
              encouraged to affirm the people around them.</p>
              <p><strong>Church of Divine Mercy</strong> Planning Committee
              will be presenting each construction worker building the new church
              building with a hamper consisting of basic necessities such as
              condensed milk, toothpaste, etc, as a token of appreciation for their
              work.</p>
              <p>Parishioners of <strong>Church of the Holy Trinity </strong>are encouraged to contribute to this project by donating these items or contributing a love offering.</p>

              <p><strong>Church of St. Mary of the Angels</strong> has, for
              their Advent project, embarked on a journey to learn more about the
              work of Franciscans International (FI) and how they work – in the
              offices of the United Nations – for change in the lives of the the
              vulnerable and the poor. Each week of Advent features a case study of
              how FI works to confront the systemic problems in development, the
              environment, human rights, and peacemaking in the developing nations of
              Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America.</p>
