            <div class='col-md body'>Pope John Paul II<br>18 May 1920 - 2 April 2005<br>Born in May 18, 1920, Karol Wojtyla was Poland's youngest bishop at 38 and the first non-Italian Pope in 455 years.<br><br>At 58, he became the youngest Pope for more than a century. He took on the name John Paul II after he was elected Pope on October 16, 1978.<br><br>The Pope succumbed to his illness on 2 April 2005.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here is a brief look back at the life of Pope John Paul II</span><br><br>EARLY LIFE<br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/obituary/pope/images/1930.jpg"><br>1930<br>Karol Wojtyla was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, near Krakow. His father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and his mother died in 1929 when he was eight.<br><br>In 1938, he began studying philosophy and literature at the university in Krakow which the Nazis closed when they invaded in 1939. To escape death or deportation, Wojtyla worked in a quarry and later took an office job. In 1941 his father, the last member of his immediate family, died.<br><br>After deciding to become a priest, Wojtyla continued working in the quarry by day but studied secretly in the evenings with the Krakow cardinal because the Nazis had closed the seminaries.<br><br>PATH TO PAPACY<br>Wojtyla was ordained in 1946 at the age of 26 and went to Rome for advanced studies. In 1948, he returned to Poland.<br><br>He became Poland's youngest bishop at 38, was promoted to Archbishop of Krakow in 1964 and made cardinal three years later by Pope Paul VI.<br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/obituary/pope/images/1978_2.jpg"><br>On October 16, 1978, Wojtyla was elected the first non-Italian Pope in 455 years. He was the 264th successor of St Peter and, at 58, the youngest Pope for more than a century.<br><br>PAPAL MILESTONES<br>His pontificate has been the third-longest in the history of the Roman Catholic Church.<br><br>He has travelled the equivalent of 30 times the circumference of the earth, making 104 foreign trips.<br><br>The Pope has canonised 482 saints and beatified 1,338 people, more than all of his predecessors combined.<br><br>He has held 1,160 general audiences at the Vatican, attended by about 18 million people.<br><br>GREATEST MOMENTS<br><br><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/obituary/pope/images/2000.jpg"><br>2000<br>Pope John Paul II fulfilled three great dreams: helping end communism in Eastern Europe, heralding the third millennium and visiting the Holy Land in March 2000.<br><br>He left a personal note in the cracks of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, asking for forgiveness for the past sins of Christians against Jews.<br><br>PAPAL DOCUMENTS<br>Pope John Paul II has issued 14 encyclicals -- the most authoritative form of papal writing, which the world's 1.1 billion Catholics are expected to obey. While some discussed moral or religious issues, others were social writings.<br><br>HEALTH<br>The man once called "God's athlete" has gone from being a robust globetrotter to a frail, pained man weighed down by Parkinson's disease and arthritis. Three years after his election, he nearly died from wounds to the stomach and hand after a Turkish gunman shot him. Otherwise, he enjoyed relatively good health until 1992, when surgeons removed an intestinal tumour.<br><br>2003<br>In 1993, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease began to appear. Later came problems with speech and a stooped posture. By 2003, arthritis made it virtually impossible for him to stand or walk without intense pain.<br><br>After more than a year of relatively good health, the Pope's health took a turn for the worse. He underwent throat surgery on Feb. 24, from which he has struggled to recover.<br><br>Doctors inserted a tube into his windpipe to help him breathe, and on 30 March started feeding him through a nasal tube.<br><br>Source: Reuters<br></div>
