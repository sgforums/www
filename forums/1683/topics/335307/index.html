              <p>If you want to find out more, read <a title="http://www.catholic.org.sg/cn/wordpress/?p=2614" href="http://www.catholic.org.sg/cn/wordpress/?p=2614">http://www.catholic.org.sg/cn/wordpress/?p=2614</a> which will give you some ideas and also visit the Church website at <a title="http://www.cssr.org.sg/" href="http://www.cssr.org.sg/">http://www.cssr.org.sg/</a>.</p>
              <p>The best way is to go and attend the Novena service yourself and buy a book which cost $1.00-$2.00 I think. Then you know how the service goes.</p>
              <p>Important to note is that you are not worshipping Mother Mary at Novena but asking her to pray with you and for you - not unlike how you and your friends gather to pray together. Big difference is that Mother Mary is a Saint and mother of God while we are all sinners.</p>
              <p>All petitions are granted by God and never by Mother Mary. Just to make sure you are not confused by some who may tell you that Novena is about praying to Mary.</p>
              <p>You can write your petitions to our Blessed Mother and you can request for more than 1 thing. You can marked it as private and confidential if you do not want them to be read out by the priests during the service.</p>
              <p>All petitions received are placed at the alter of our lady and prayed daily for 9 weeks. I think you must do 9 consecutive weeks and no break in between but I am not entirely sure....you can go to a service and approach the priest to ask them.</p>
              <p>If you are serious, why would you want yo miss a week? I am there every Saturday..... and they have service every hour from 7.00am till 7.00 pm. Only 12.00pm is lunch break and 3.00pm for Mandrain service. No reason to miss really and all it takes is only half an hour.</p>
              <p>Many who goes to Novena are non-Catholics, non-Christians and even Protestants Christians. Go and experience yourself.....</p>

              <p>You can write or type in advance, put in an evelope and put them into the box at the Church. Some of the letters received in the week will be read out but all letters will be place at the alter and prayed. You can visit the website to check as I think you can also send in by e-mail..... You can go anyday to put in your petitions and every Saturday is Novena service.</p>
              <p>If you go to the church, there is an admin block beside the church hall. This is where you can see the priest after the service and approach the admin office counter if you need any help. Get a acopy of Dear Padre from the counter available every Saturday..... and visit the bookshop (where you can buy the Novena service booklet).</p>
              <p>Start going this Saturday as last week was the first special Novena leading up to Christmas (yes only 8 more weeks to Christmas) and hope you find peace and joy attending the service.</p>
              <p>May God bless you and grant you all your petitions.</p>

              <p>hi fantagf..</p>
              <p>I'm glad you are going to novena church and trying to know this 9th week novena devotion.</p>
              <p>1stly, i would encourage you ( at yr own pace) to explore the church in and out.. Pretty easy.. take less than 10 mins.. also very important to know where is the LOO.. why ..the novena service is abt 30 mins.. and some control the bladder so tight that 1st thing right after the novena is to the LOO.. (just kidding!)</p>
              <p>Get yrself aquaint with the church.. (if you have never been to a catholic church b4!) Dun worry if you do not know anything.. Just relax.. normally in the church, there are statues of Jesus, Mother Mary, and all other saints.. eg. St. Joseph etc.. (foster father of jesus) Incidentally, the feast of all saints was celebrated  just 2 days ago.. behind  the altar, usually have a cruxifix and a large one..at the entrance of the church, there is a small font with holy water for the catholics to dip their fingers to make the sign of the cross prior to enter the church. Non catholics can also do that!</p>
              <p>I would encourage you to go during one of the weekdays pereferably in the  afternoon. (less people).. and observe.. You'll see people doing genuflecting b4 the altar. Dun worry, if you not sure whether to do or how to do.. If you do not know how to genuflect.. just go directly and sit on the pews. Now.. praying.. ?? Again, dun worry.. just relax.. take a deep breath.. close yr eyes.. and start to pray.. dunno how or what to say? again, dun worry.. well for starters.. just say.. this (you can say this in yr own words if you want!).. Dear Sweet Mother mary, this is my 1st time to this church.. I want to know you and yr son, jesus better.. so pls help me.. Also, I have some thing to ask you to intercede for me.. (pray for yr petitions) eg.. to know God.. to become a catholic.. for yr job.. anything as long is is not morally wrong..</p>
              <p> as for yr novena.. it's ok if you miss one of the 9 novena.. just come for the following sat again to make up for it..</p>
              <p>btw, you are not there by accident, it's the Holy spirit that has prompting you to come to novena.. Gradually you will come to love the novena sessions every sat.. (I dun go every sat due to work.. but try to go whenever i can) It's very peaceful.. and quiet just the right place to pray and meditate ..</p>
              <p>God bless and Good luck!</p>
