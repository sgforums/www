              <p>I fell for a girl who attended mass regularly every saturday in the St. Mary of the Angels parish. I never knew her name sadly. when I intended to say hello and got to know her name she was never around. I guess she stopped attending masses in St Mary altogether.</p>
              <p>The problem is this was a long time ago in 2002. She was quite active in the church.Mostly collecting offering/tithing. Also in church fund raising event.</p>
              <p>The one thing that really made her stood out from the crowd was that she was really pretty. I mean really pretty.</p>
              <p>I know she may have been married by now but at least I want to know her name.</p>
              <p>Anybody attended St  Mary of the Angels in the period of 2000-2002(up to renovating period) may be familiar with her. So I'm asking does anybody know her? I really would like to have a chat with her or something. At least I want to know her name.</p>
              <p>Funny thing is that I had been given a prophecy relating me to her well it wasn't about her actually it was more about me. The prophecy was given in Bandung in 1997 during my high school retreat in a monastery. All has come to pass. All except one actually. I still remember being told what she would 'say'(I never spoke to her never did she) to me during my last time seeing her from acrross the pews: "be strong". OMG it was already known in 1997.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>hi m&amp;P,</p>
              <p>I think by now she has been taken.. oops.. sorry didn't mean to break yr heart.. ya..maybe mother of 2 kids.. coming 2 sunday mass.. with her hubby.. wish you were the one!!.. dun you? Fret not! Maybe she was not meant for you.. perhaps you can pray and ask God to help you to find a life partner.. esp a good catholic girl..</p>
              <p>Maybe for a start, you can join choir (if you luv to sing!) meet people (legion of mary, wardens, charismatic etc.. or any other ministries that you like and has yr kind of people..) Strengthen yr spiritual life by spending more time with God, asking him to guide you as you  go along in life. Also, ask Mother Mary and yr patron saint to intercede for you.. By living a faithful christian life, you not only strengthen your faith but you be a good WITNESS to many others. Soon you'll have that  qualities that other people find you attractive. Pls be sincere and humble in all yr endevours and tasks.. Speak to people and develop genuine people relation (it's hard i know!) and who knows .. one fine day somebody.. somebody will find you irrestible to resist and you find her good too.. dun give up.. God Bless and good luck..</p>
              <p>or maybe you are called to a priesthood?? get a spiritual director, priest or sister prefered to help you.. ..</p>

              <p>Thanks for your response. You seemed sincere enough.</p>
              <p>Priesthood... Well better be one lousy Catholic than one lousy Catholic priest. Haha.</p>
              <p>Besides all men in fact all people are called to serve God imo one way or another. One doesn't have to be a priest in order to serve God. Only a servant. On the pilgrimage to eternal power that is if you are very lucky :-). Or eternal sufferings if you waste this life on sins.</p>

              <p>Like I said everybody is called to walk in his own different path. There are many ways to serve God. Priesthood is just one of them. And i'm absolutely sure I'm not called to priesthood.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your book suggestion.</p>
              <p>I know than  I'm chosen(which put a smile on my face everytime I recalled that little event) and anyone who is chosen are also called to serve God in one way or another but I don't think everyone who is chosen are called to priesthood.</p>
              <p>You can be a toilet cleaner and serving God though I'm not planning to be one :-)</p>
              <p>If there's something I want from God is . . . . eternal power but that is like wishing to hold the moon in my arms. I'm not a holy man deserving that reward. I've seen a man who served and is still serving God and now is given eternal power. God is truly the source of authority. In the end of day the whole humanity will see Genghis Khan, Alexander the great, Napoleon Bonaparte, Hitler, Stalin and their likes as fools who fought and died[punished] for rubbish. God will give autorithy and eternal power to those that He chose. His holy people. Nothing is better than this.</p>
              <p>If men of this world lie, betray, fight and kill for a small and short power what would not they give for eternal power had they known it? but they neither believe and know it. Nor do they have the capacity nor they are chosen.</p>
