              <p><br> Unbeknownst to many people, there is a deity greater than God. This
                                      deity, in fact, created God. That is to say, he created ALL of the
                                      Gods. These Gods were created to do the greater deity's bidding,
                                      for the greater deity felt no compulsion to do little things
                                      himself.<br> <br> That deity is Rey Mysterio. Rey Mysterio is time and and space. Rey Mysterio is the universe. Rey Mysterio giveth, and Rey Mysterio
                                      taketh away. This is the history of the eternal Rey Mysterio.<br> <br> If you add up all the Rey Mysterio in the world, your head would
                                      explode becuase YOU COULD NOT COMPREHEND IT!!!!!<br> <br> In the beginning, there was Rey Mysterio, and only Rey Mysterio. From nothing, Rey Mysterio brought forth God to handle his light work. Then, God created
                                      the universe, and within the universe, Earth, all in seven days. Rey Mysterio then spake unto God, "Seven days and all you have to show for
                                      it is one measly universe and a semi-sentient race? FOOL!" and
                                      smote thusly the unworthy God.<br> <br>Rey Mysterio then created a new God. Throughout history, humans never once
                                      noticed that Rey Mysterio destroyed and created new Gods quite frequently.
                                      In any case, they were pleased when this God gave them a a giant
                                      garden all for them. Also, this God created several more universes,
                                      a multiverse, and an omniverse, though no one is exactly sure what
                                      the multiverse and omniverse are like. Sadly, these universes
                                      didn't get along very well, and started to war immediately. The
                                      inter-universe war lasted for many millions of years, and God could
                                      do nothing to rectify his mistake. Rey Mysterio, while fully capable of
                                      ending the war, decided to sit idely by and watch, because it was
                                      funny.<br> <br> Anyway, after an incident with a talking snake and an apple tree,
                                      the humans were banished from their garden. God had wanted to give
                                      them another chance, but Rey Mysterio said, "If you don't punish them,
                                      they'll never learn." Then, Rey Mysterio smote God for second-guessing
                                      him. Rey Mysterio then created another new God, though this one seemed
                                      rather more competent than his predecessors.<br> <br> Pleased, Rey Mysterio then allowed history to unravel as it would, all
                                      under the watchful eye of his Gods. Rey Mysteriok would only interfere when
                                      one of his Gods screwed up badly. The following is a history of the
                                      divine actions of His Holiness, Rey Mysterio.<br> <br> Before detailing the actions of Rey Mysterio, it is important to know the
                                      chronological order in which things happened, and the names of the
                                      eras in which they took place. Note that not all of Rey Mysterio's actions
                                      are listed here.<br> <br> * The Era of Learning - Primitive man learns to wield his

                                      splitting it apart and seperating the tribes.<br> o Not intending to stop the war, Rey Mysterio gives the humans sailing
                                      technology.<br> o Rey Mysterio opens a rift in space-time, allowing the Jedi of a
                                      different universe to step through. The Jedi, with their superior
                                      Force powers, steal the lightsabers of the humans and effectively
                                      end the Age of Strife.<br> o Rey Mysterio follows back through the rift where he became bored and
                                      creates the wookie race. He returned with his great grandson
                                      Chewbacca after training Darth Vader to become awesome rather then

                                      stuff.<br> o Rey Mysterio shows the humans how to build a house. Trading Spaces

                                      wrong?<br> <br> * The Dark Times - Primitive man is tortured by an evil
                                      entity.<br> o With Rey Mysterio sleeping, another omnipotent entity rises - the evil Edge. Edge used his powers for malevolent purposes,
                                      causing pain and suffering among the humans.<br> o Edge kills an entire colony of Indonesian midgets for no reason. Rey Mysterio continues to sleep.<br> o Indiana Jones and the Van Helsing family form an alliance to
                                      protect the world while Rey Mysterio slept but nearly failed.<br> o Edge accidently sets off Mount Vesuvius while fighting Indiana
                                      Jones for the last ring needed to awaken his master. The smell of
                                      sulfur awoke mighty Rey Mysterio, who was enraged at the sight of his
                                      planet being torn apart.<br> <br> * The Universal War - Primitive man is caught in the middle of a
                                      war between deities.<br> o Rey Mysterio and Edge began battling for supremacy. However, both wield
                                      great and indescribable power and fight to a stand-off.<br> o Rey Mysterio and Edge set rules for a game. The game would ultimately
                                      decide who would rule the multitude of universes created by Rey Mysterio's
                                      Gods. Game of Death<br> o The Universal war is accurately detailed in the Animorphs series
                                      by K.A. Applegate. Edge is represented by the character called
                                      Crayak, whereas Rey Mysterio is represented by the mighty Ellimist.<br> <br> * The Invention Period - Primitive man becomes regular man.<br> o After winning the Universal War, Rey Mysterio bestowed humans with

                                      morning he saw Cher and was comitted to inventing first underwear,

                                      frm the movies. Rey Mysterio then freed Ford from the vile clutches
