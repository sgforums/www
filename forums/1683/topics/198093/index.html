            <div class='col-md body'>ROME, JUNE 30, 2006 (Zenit.org).- Here is a translation of a commentary by<br>Capuchin Father Raniero Cantalamessa, preacher to the Pontifical Household,<br>on this Sunday's Gospel passage.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Little girl, arise!<br><br>The passage of this Sunday's Gospel is made up of scenes that occur<br>rapidly in different places.<br><br>First of all is the scene on the lakeshore. Jesus is surrounded by a crowd<br>when a man falls down at his feet and begs him: "My daughter is at the point<br>of death. Please, come lay your hands on her that she may get well and<br>live." Jesus leaves his half-finished address and goes to the man's home.<br><br>The second scene takes place on the road. A woman who suffered from<br>hemorrhage, went up behind Jesus to touch his garment and felt she is cured.<br><br>While Jesus was speaking with her, someone arrived from Jairus' house to<br>tell him: "Your daughter has died; why trouble the teacher any longer?"<br>Jesus, who heard everything, said to the ruler of the synagogue: "Do not be<br>afraid; just have faith."<br><br>And next comes the crucial scene, in Jairus' house.<br><br>There was great confusion, people weeping and shouting, which is<br>understandable given the death of the adolescent which had just occurred.<br><br>"So he went in and said to them, 'Why this commotion and weeping? The<br>child is not dead but asleep.' ... Then he put them all out. He took along<br>the child's father and mother and those who were with him and entered the<br>room where the child was.<br><br>"He took the child by the hand and said to her, 'Talitha koum,' which<br>means, 'Little girl, I say to you, arise!'<br><br>"The girl, a child of twelve, arose immediately and walked around. ... He<br>gave strict orders that no one should know this and said that she should be<br>given something to eat" (Mark 5:39-43).<br><br>The Gospel passage suggests an observation. The degree of historicity and<br>reliability of the Gospels is again continually discussed. We recently<br>witnessed the attempt to put at the same level, as if it had the same<br>authority, the four canonical Gospels and the apocryphal gospels of the<br>second and third centuries.<br><br>However, this attempt is simply absurd, and it also shows a good deal of<br>bad faith. The apocryphal gospels, especially those of Gnostic origin, were<br>written several generations later by persons who had lost all contact with<br>the events, and who, moreover, were not in the least interested in making<br>history, but in putting on Christ's lips the teachings of their own schools.<br><br>The canonical Gospels, on the contrary, were written by eyewitnesses of<br>the events or persons who had been in contact with eyewitnesses.<br><br>Mark, whose Gospel we are reading this year, was in close relationship<br>with the Apostle Peter, of whom he refers many episodes that had him as<br>protagonist.<br><br>This Sunday's passage gives us an example of that historical character of<br>the Gospels. The clear portrait of Jairus and his anguished request for<br>help; the episode of the woman they meet on the way to her home; the<br>messengers' skeptical attitude toward Jesus; Christ's tenacity; the<br>atmosphere of the people mourning for the dead girl; Jesus' command<br>mentioned in the original Aramaic language; Jesus' moving concern that the<br>resurrected girl be given something to eat. All makes one think of an<br>eyewitness' account of the event.<br><br>Now, a brief application of Sunday's Gospel to life: There is not only the<br>death of the body but also the death of the heart.<br><br>Death of the heart exists when one lives in anxiety, discouragement and<br>chronic sadness. Jesus' words "Talitha koum," Little girl, arise, are not<br>addressed only to dead boys and girls, but also to living boys and girls.<br><br>How sad it is to see young people . sad. And there are very many around<br>us. Sadness, pessimism, the desire not to live, are always bad things, but<br>when one sees or hears young people express them, the heart is even more<br>oppressed.<br><br>In this connection, Jesus also continues today to resurrect dead boys and<br>girls. He does so with his word, and also by sending them his disciples who,<br>in his name, and with his very love, repeat to today's young people that cry<br>of his: "Talitha koum," youth, arise! Live again!<br></div>
