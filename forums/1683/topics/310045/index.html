              <p>It was indeed true that Luther did not intend for the Church to be split.  Being a religious Catholic, it was also never his wish to alter the Church teachings. He honoured Mother Mary and saints like any good Catholic will do.  Even at his death bed, he gave thanks to Mother Mary for the many blessings that he had received.</p>
              <p>But why were the teaching in his new founded Church so different from the Original Church?</p>
              <p>The reason is very simple.  Once you're broken from the Original Church, your root is broken and foundation is lost.  That explains why many protestant churches further broke into other branches and some have even formed cult groups namely Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses.  They no longer agree on the teachings.  Any difference in opinion will bring to the birth of a new church.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">A comment on this issue by Mark Brumley, CEO of Ignatius Press.  Not the very last 2 sentences about  the mainstream media's often inaccurate reporting of things Catholic.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">That's why when it comes to Church news, I don't use the secular media.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">-------------------</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">Whatever Luther's original intent, he wound up a "heretic". His positions have often been misunderstood by Catholics. A better understanding of Luther can help reduce or eliminate unnecessary problems in the Catholc-Protestant dialogue. Indeed, because some Catholics have gone so far off the deep end, Luther can actually help them move closer to Catholicism, if they bother to understand the real Luther.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">However, no amount of better understanding will make Luther a Catholic.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">The Reformation was not, as Jaroslav Pelikan once said (in his Protestant days) a tragic necessity. It was tragic in that it was not necessary. Which is not to say that genuine reform was not necessary; it was. But Protestantism involved more than simple reform; it involved a radical and novel understanding of key aspects of Christianity. Those aspects, as Bouyer points out, framed positively--the gratuitousness of salvation and the supreme authority of the Word of God--were integral to Catholicism. However, Protestantism went well beyond the mere affirmation of those points to maintain the doctrine of forensic justification, a defective understanding of <em>sola fide</em>, and a problematic view of <em>sola scriptura</em>--to mention only a few major problems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">To be sure, Catholics contributed their own share to the problem by living sinful lives, by poor understanding of their own tradition, and by any number of other objectively sinful actions in the dispute with Protestants. None of that, however, can alter the problematic understanding of Christianity espoused by the Protestant Reformers, nor should anyone naively expect that dialogue will magically make everyone able to agree about everything.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">The 16th century was a long time ago. In some ways, Catholics and Protestants are closer than ever. In some instances, we are further apart than were our ancestors. (Imagine what Luther or Calvin would say about Bishop Spong or many oldline Protestants who purport to operate out of a theological tradition reflective of Luther or Calvin's views.)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">It's great that B-16 is taking up Luther in the Schuelerkreis meeting. I am sure the result will be a good discussion, one that provides a fuller, more accurate picture of Luther than one finds in certain Catholic apologetical and polemical literature. We need to help Catholics avoid the mistake of caricaturing Luther (and the other Protestant Reformers) on the one hand, and canonizing him (and the Protestant leaders) on the other. There is more to be said for Luther than many Catholic apologists and polemicists are willing to admit. There is much less to be said for him than many liberal Catholics and ecumenists insist on saying. Reality is somewhere in the middle. Not exactly a fact that lends itself to fruitful discussion on many blogs. I hope Ignatius Insight will be different.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;">Not that bloggers are the only problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Many in the MSM are simply misreporting this story. (Shock.) Can we all agree not to take what is "reported" there at face value and wait to get the facts?</span></p>

              <p>So you think Luther was indeed a heretic?</p>
              <p>Because last time I met a Protestant their God was still Jesus <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>So I believe it was a false accusation made to him because he stood up against the Church authority which was undeniably corrupt at the time.</p>
              <p>The same kind of false accusation made to Jesus by the Jewish religious authority then by calling Jesus a false Messiah.</p>
              <p>Well that false Messiah has healed so many people, appeared in many visions with glorified God-like body and lay the way to God the father until this very day.</p>

              <p>ok, this raises 2 questions from me.</p>
              <p>the first question would be, since martin luther is already dead and with God now, why is there a need to rehabilitate him? its just a corpse now, the spirit is with God. unless you're saying that salvation comes only and only from the catholic church?</p>
              <p>and the second question would be, i will take it that the pope admitted that there was indeed corruption in the catholic church at some point of time. but since martin was the only one who discovered it and stood against it, that means apart from the followers of martin luther, there would logically be no change in its practices of these corruption because they all still followed the direction of the pope who obviously wouldn't change his stand, which would mean that these corrupted were passed down until now. so it still wouldn't mean anything, since nothing was changed.</p>
              <p>and i read in a catholic article that they defended themselves that the catholics were right and protestants were wrong by quoting the verse "that the gates of hell will never prevail against it"</p>
              <p>so now apparently the gates of hell did, and maybe God made a way out by seperating the church and saved the "bloodline" of the church?</p>

              <p>the first question would be, since martin luther is already dead
                      and with God now, why is there a need to rehabilitate him? its just
                      a corpse now, the spirit is with God.</p>

              <p><br>Dumbdumb it's called politicking Luther is revered by the Protestants and now the Catholic church want them to cooperate or something like that. Not because Luther need it to go to heaven. In order to get something from other party you need to be in a good relationship with them so the real intention of the Catholic church I guess is to mend the relationship with the Protestant churches.

              <p>So I believe it was a false accusation made to him because he

              at the time.</p>
              <p>The same kind of false accusation made to Jesus by the Jewish
              religious authority then by calling Jesus a false Messiah.</p>
              <p>Well that false Messiah has healed so many people, appeared in
              many visions with glorified God-like body and lay the way to God

              <p>No, I don't think he was a heretic.  My position is the same as Mark Brumley's and note that he used the word 'heretic' in quotes, which means that he didn't think so either.  But the fact is, as Brumley has rightly pointed out, he wasn't Catholic, and therefore by implication, he can't be called a reformer of the Church.</p>
              <p>It's not complicated at all, actually.</p>

              <p>Believe me, I understand how you feel. Whatever happened and whatever will be happening to Catholic Church, may God give unsuspecting and innocent flock a way to reach Him.<br><br>Catholic Church has been attacked over and over again by the devil because it holds the Truth, so he can decieve men and lay claim to our soul.<br></p>

              <p>I had been visited(apparition) by a saint wearing a catholic monk robe long time ago. I could still remember his cold touch.</p>
              <p>My mother had had a Marian apparition too.</p>
              <p>I'm staying Catholic.</p>
              <p>Last time somebody sent me an evil spirit, It fled at the cry for help to God. That and bunch more keeps me going to church.</p>
