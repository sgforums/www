This struggle is fought, as far as we are concerned, on our knees in prayer.  Weak as we all are, it is fought within ourselves as well, as an ongoing conversion effort for us to overcome our sinful nature, with God's grace.  And it is fought in the hope that as we allow Christ to act more and more freely within our own souls, we will be able to help manifest the love of Christ to the whole world.<br><br>To quote Fr. Benedict Groeschel, CFR, a famous television preacher, the spiritual life is the life of Christ within us.<br><br>To reiterate earlier points, it is about struggles with powers and principalities of the spiritual realm. Killing people is not going to do it.<br><br>Of course, if one is an atheist, then this is meaningless, since there is no belief in the existence of anything other than the material world.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta<br><br></div>

However, most of us want our free choices without the consequences, which is of course absurd.<br><br>The Church has lost a lot of people.  However, we do not 'just let him leave'.  We always work in the hope that they will come back.  We will pray, we will persuade (if the opportunity arises).<br><br>I'm not sure if you have 'lost' loved ones who departed from the faith.  I  know, for instancce, that many parents have 'lost' their children.  If you talk to them, the sense of pain and loss is palpable.  Are they restricting their children's freedom?  Not at all, but they grieve.<br><br>As for me, I have 'lost' a very dear loved one who left the Church as well.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>

If the person leaves for another church, why should we label him a deserter? I have frens who leave for another church and have a fren who left a protestant church for a catholic church. Should I label him deserter too? I dun think so.<br><br>But in the article, the person dun even know why a person is leaving and label him deserter liao....It seems to me he dun even care why a person leaves the church, as long u leave the church, u are bad.<br><br>And the last thing you should do if you wanna get the person back is to label a name on a person just like what the article suggests.</div>
