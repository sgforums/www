A diocesan bishop who has completed the seventy-fifth year of age is requested to present his resignation from office to the Supreme Pontiff, who will make provision after he has examined all the circumstances.<br><br>Â§2. A diocesan bishop who has become less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause is earnestly requested to present his resignation from office.<br><br>Can. 402 Â§1. A bishop whose resignation from office has been accepted retains the title of emeritus of his diocese and can retain a place of residence in that diocese if he so desires, unless in certain cases the Apostolic See provides otherwise because of special circumstances.<br><br>Â§2. The conference of bishops must take care that suitable and decent support is provided for a retired bishop, with attention given to the primary obligation which binds the diocese he has served.<br></blockquote>Ergo:<br><br><strong>What does he do now?</strong> Don't know, but I can make enquiries. He's probably rather infirm now.<br><br><strong>Why is there such a position?</strong> It is provided for in Church Law.<br><br><strong>Is this the usual practice? </strong> Yes.<br><br><strong>I know the Archbishop tenure is for life one. </strong> Not true - he must submit his resignation to the Pope at age 75. The Pope will either accept or decline the resignation. It has been known to happen that the Pope asks certain bishops to carry on. [/b]</div>
