            <div class='col-md body'>Liturgical Colors: Christian Color Symbolism<br>In Christianity, color symbolism is primarily used in liturgical decorations (banners, vestments, etc.) and to a lesser degree in Christian art. Symbolic colors are rarely used in the Bible.<br><br>Black is symbolic of death, and is therefore the liturgical color for Good Friday. Black can also represent sin, which results in death.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Blue, the color of the sky, is symbolic of heaven. It may also be used to symbolize truth. Blue is gaining acceptance as a liturgical color for Advent. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">Brown is the color of spiritual death and degradation</span>.<br><br>Gray is the color of ash, so is sometimes used to represent repentance and may be used during Lent.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Green is the color of plant life, abundant in spring. It is used to represent the triumph of life over death. Green is the liturgical color for the Trinity season in some traditions, and may be used during Epiphany in others</span>.<br><br><span style="color: violet;">Purple is the color for penitence and mourning. It is also the color of royalty. Purple is the liturgical color for the seasons of Advent and Lent.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Red is the color of blood and therefore is the liturgical color for the commemoration of martyred saints. Red is used as the liturgical color for Pentecost, since it is the color of fire. </span><br><br>White is a symbol of purity, innocence and holiness. It is the liturgical color for the Christmas and Easter seasons. White is sometimes represented by silver.<br><br><span style="color: yellow;">As the color of light, yellow may be used to represent divinity. However, because yellow light is not pure white, it may also be used to symbolize corruption and degradation. </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Greek and Latin Symbols<br><br>Latin and Greek letters, words and abbreviations are often seen in Christian art. Though not exactly symbols, they are intended to convey a particular meaning significant for Christians.<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/ALPHAO.jpg"><br>Alpha and omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, signifying that Jesus is "the beginning and the end," i.e., eternal. (Rev 1:8 )<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/CHIRHO.gif"><br>The Chi Rho is a symbol made from the first two letters of "Christ" in Greek. It is said that before an important battle, the Emperor Constantine saw this symbol in the sky and heard the words "By this sign, conquer."<br><br>Ecce homo means "Behold the man," which was said by Pilate before Christ's crucifixion.<br><br>Ecce agnus Dei is Latin for "Behold the Lamb of God." This phrase is used during Epiphany, which celebrates Christ's manifestation.<br><br>INRI is the Latin abbreviation for "Jesus Christ, King of the Jews," the sign placed above Jesus' head on the cross (John 19:19) Though the sign was intended to mock Jesus, Christians view the phrase as a confession of faith.<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/ICHTHUS.gif"><br>IXOYE is really ICHTHUS, the Greek word for "fish" and an acrostic for "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior." See Christian Fish Symbol for more information.<br><br>IHC is the first three letters of the Greek word for "Jesus" (iota, eta, sigma).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christian Crosses<br><br>The cross is one of the earliest and most widely used Christian symbol. In the most broad sense it symbolizes the religion of Christianity (and so appears at the top and left of this page). More specifically, it represents and memorializes Christ's death. A great variety of crosses has developed, some with specific symbolic meaning and others that have simply become culturally associated with certain groups.<br><br>The simplest and most common cross is the Latin cross, pictured at left. It may not have come into use until the 2nd or 3rd century. The empty cross, usually favored by Protestants, reminds Christians of the resurrection, while the crucifix, with Jesus on it, favored by Catholic and Orthodox churches, is a reminder of Christ's sacrifice.<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/LATIN.gif"><br>The simplest and most common cross is the Latin cross, pictured at left.

The top bar represents the "INRI" sign placed over Jesus' head. The meaning of the slanted bar is not known for sure, but probably represents St. Andrew's cross (which looks like an X). St. Andrew is believed to have introduced Christianity to Russia. The crosses in the above right picture sit atop the domes of the Kremlin. Note that they have a slightly different lower bar.<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/POPEC.gif"><br>The papal cross is the official symbol of the papacy, and may be used only by the Pope. The three bars of the cross most likely represent the three realms of the Pope's authority: the church, the world, and heaven.<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/BAPTIS.gif"><br>The baptismal cross has eight points, symbolizing regeneration (see Numbers). It is formed by combining the Greek cross with the Greek letter chi (X), the first letter of "Christ" in Greek.<br><br><img src="http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/images/symbols/budded_cross_wegast.jpg"><br>The budded cross is a common form of the cross. Its trefoils represent the Trinity.<br><br>to be continued...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><img src="http://home.att.net/~wegast/symbols/crosses/crstriu.jpg"><br><br>The triumphant cross with orb represents Christ reign over the world. It is often shown atop Christ's scepter in Christian art.<br><br><img src="http://www.fisheaters.com/PETERS.gif"><br>An inverted cross is the cross of St. Peter, who, according to tradition, was crucified upside down because he felt unworthy to die the same way as Christ. As Catholics believe the pope to be a successor of St. Peter, the inverted cross is frequently used in connection with the papacy, such as on the papal throne and in papal tombs [photo]. It also symbolizes humility because of the story of Peter. The inverted cross has more recently been appropriated by Satanists as a symbol meant to oppose or invert Christianity.<br></div>
