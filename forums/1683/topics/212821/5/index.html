Unless he was doing it for God.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Galatians 2</strong><br><br>Paul Accepted by the Apostles<br><br>1Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. 2<strong>I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles.</strong> But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain. 3Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. 4This matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. 5We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.<br><br>6<strong>As for those who seemed to be importantÂ—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearanceÂ—those men added nothing to my message.</strong> 7On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles,[a] just as Peter had been to the Jews.<strong> 8For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles. 9[b]James, Peter[c] and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me.</strong> They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews. 10All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.</blockquote>The following should be clear:<br><br>1. Paul had preached to the gentiles before the Jerusalem Council. Peter was not the one who assigned him the task. It was God. Paul went to the Council partly to tell them his work. Arguably Peter did not even know what was Paul really doing before the Council.<br><br>2. James was mentioned first before Peter. One counter-argument with Peter being the Pope.<br><br>3. Nobody added to Paul's message. So Paul couldn't be their communicator. He was a communicator for God.<br><br>4. Paul had quite low view of the peeps in the Council.<br><br>5. Paul was not working under any leadership.<br><br>6. Paul affirms that Peter's role was to preach to the Jews.</div>
