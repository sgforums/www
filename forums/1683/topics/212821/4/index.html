Even though James was the bishop of Jerusalem, Paul chooses to examine Peter, not James. Why? Because Peter was the head of the Church.<br></div>

We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."<br><br>12The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 13When they finished, James spoke up: "Brothers, listen to me. 14Simon[a] has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself. 15The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:<br>16" 'After this I will return<br>and rebuild David's fallen tent.<br>Its ruins I will rebuild,<br>and I will restore it,<br>17that the remnant of men may seek the Lord,<br>and all the Gentiles who bear my name,<br>says the Lord, who does these things'<br>18that have been known for ages.[c]<br><br>19"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. 20Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. 21For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."</blockquote></div>
