            <div class='col-md body'><br>by<br><br>Father David Daly, LC<br><br>Luke 8:1-3<br><br>Jesus journeyed from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. Accompanying him were the Twelve and some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, Joanna, the wife of HerodÂ´s steward Chuza, Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their resources.<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord Jesus, you were open to everyone seeking to be faithful to GodÂ’s will. Thank you for your great example of love for all men and women, and especially for your personal love for me. Help me to live this same universal charity and seek to bring everyone closer to you.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>: Jesus, teach me to live universal charity.<br><br>1. Â“<strong>Accompanying Him Were the Twelve</strong>.Â” In this rather commonplace phrase from the Gospel, we perceive JesusÂ’ universal charity. He chose his twelve apostles from many different backgrounds and most of them probably would not have been friends were it not for Christ. Matthew was a tax collector; Peter, James and John, fisherman. Judas was more Â“sophisticatedÂ” than the rest. Yet, Jesus called them all to be his closest collaborators.<br><br><strong>2. Mary, Called Magdalene</strong>. Not only did he choose men to be his close collaborators, but as the Gospel says there were also Â“women who provided for him out of their resources.Â” Jesus assigned them different roles, but saved and transformed all their lives all the same. We think of Mary Magdalene as a close friend of Christ, but we should also remember that he transformed her, with the power of GodÂ’s grace, by expelling seven demons from her.<br><br><strong>3. The Wife of HerodÂ’s Steward</strong>. Another of the women following Jesus was Â“Joanna, the wife of HerodÂ’s steward.Â” It is amazing to see that the Gospel can take root even in the midst of the fiefdom of Herod, a man who had absolutely no esteem for our Lord. JesusÂ’ message is capable of inspiring followers in all societal conditions and groupings. Similarly, we are called to build the Kingdom at all levels of our secularized world.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord Jesus Christ, you give us the example of unconditional love for each and every person. You do not care what our background is or how many sins we have committed. Your mercy is infinite and everlasting! Thank you for your love. I beg you to teach me to love without limits.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I promise today to practice universal charity by being kind to someone with whom I do not ordinarily associate.<br><br></div>
