              <p>We can start with last week's Masses or even memorable ones before that, and make it a practice every weekend.</p>

              <p>Great to have this thread.  Yup, it's good to type out what we remember.  I have the problem of forgetting in a couple of days after attending the Mass <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p>It should be ok to add the priest's name.  It's just sermon, nothing sensitive. </p>

              <p>Honestly, I did not find anything inspiring to share from the homily at the church I attend. But I came across this site <strong><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12742">"Eucharist should make us attentive to the needs of the poor, Benedict XVI teaches".</a></strong></p>
              <p>Click on the above to read yourself. I think this is inspiring for all Catholics and remind us not to forget to love our neigbhours and do whatever we can to share and help the needy.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The 3
              readings of this week is very interesting especially the second reading. The
              simple word of St Paul has caused great debates among Christians with regards
              to the subject of salvation. On one extreme are those who believed that deeds
              are needed for salvation. On the other extreme are those who believed that all
              works are done by Jesus’s death and nothing else is needed to be done.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As Fr
              Ambrose Vaz explained during his homily, when St Paul said that no works by man
              can achieve salvation, he was targeting those who do not believe that Jesus has
              a part in their salvation. He was telling them that without Jesus, there is
              nothing that they can do that can lead them to salvation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Salvation in Hebrew means victory. Jesus is in his resurrection is victorious
              over sin and death. He has purchased for us with his suffering and death our salvation. He is inviting everybody to join Him in victory. However,
              people must co-operate with Him in order to join Him in victory over sin and
              death. How?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the
              first readings, Moses said that those who obeyed the commandments <span> </span>will receive blessings while those who don’t
              will be cursed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the
              second reading, I found a link that helps to explain what the position of our
              church. Pls click here <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/bible/rom003.htm</a></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">And in the
              Gospel reading, Jesus<span>  </span>said tell us
              clearly that not all who call “Lord, Lord….” will enter into heaven but those
              who hear the words and act upon them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In
              conclusion,<span>  </span>Christians should be aware
              that in order to be saved, they need to have both faith and deeds.<span>  </span>As James said in JAS2:14-16 faith is dead
              without deeds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Remember
              that Jesus told us that the 2 most important commandments for us is to love God
              and our neighbour<span>  </span>which can be found in
              MT 22:34-40.</span></p>

              <p>Today evening's Mass was conducted by Fr Mark from Malaysia. He told us an interesting story that I would like to share here.....</p>
              <p>A priest from Penang attended a retreat in Mexico and received a standing ovation when he said he is from Penang, Malaysia. Of course he felt good but at the same time confused since he is the only one getting such attention.</p>
              <p>Towards the end of the retreat, he  finally knew the answer.......</p>
              <p>Years before, at the same retreat, the retreat master asked for volunteers to do the various chores...At retreats, there is no ranks and files and the chores are shared.</p>
              <p>When it came to washing the public toilets, there was no volunteer....as expected.</p>
              <p>The retreat master asked 3 times for volunteer and at the third time, a hand went up...Bingo, someone has volunteered.</p>
              <p>At the end of the retreat, the retreat master aske each and everyone to introduce themselves again.....when it came to the guy who volunteered for toilet washing, he stood up and said that he is Anthony from Malaysia....</p>
              <p>The retreat maser asked him, Brother Anthony, can you tell us what you do? Anthony replied : "I am the Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur" !</p>
              <p>Here we have a true leader who is here to serve....imagine teh Archbishop washing the toilet daily ?</p>
              <p>In line with today's theme, what God wants is our service and not sacrifies...</p>

              <p>Thanks MLK. =)</p>
              <p>Fr William Heng celebrated Mass yesterday at Holy Spirit. He mentioned that whilst many of us don't commit mortal sins, we don't do anything right either. When we rationalise some of the wrongdoings that we commit, or claim that we have are fine, we remain in the dark and are unable to see our own flaws.</p>
              <p>We commit the sin of omitting God  from our lives, asking what His will for us each day is, going beyond the circle of ourselves and our family, and living out the little bit of Him that exists in all of us. He has given us free will but we need to use it to choose Him. We need to slow ourselves down in spite of our schedules and deadlines to seek His will and to be less oblivious to the people around us.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Fr William Goh proclaimed the Gospel and gave the homily today.<br><br>Nowadays priests have to wait for people to come to confession instead of the other way around. We don't recognise that we are sinners, and blame society and human nature for our "imperfections" as if we aren't a part of them. It's because we've lost the fear of God, a respect and reverence for a higher authority who is omnipotent.<br><br>"What is now hidden will be revealed," as Jesus said in the gospel. God's truth and the fear of God have been replaced by fear of the world and its own values. The world says that we are competing against one another and fighting against nature. As long as it feels good and everyone can come to a consensus, that is "truth", or so it claims.<br><br>We no longer want to hear about what is wrong with us; we want to hear only the good stuff, padding our egos but making us more and more arrogant as we think we are fully in control of our destinies. The world doesn't respect people who are "subservient", even if it is to God and faith. However, eventually our sins will come back to haunt us, ruin our lives and cause the degeneration of society. That is why we must stand up and continue to proclaim God's message "from the housetops", and use his laws as a moral compass.</p></div>
