            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Seeing God</strong></span><br>September 23, 2004<br>Thursday of the Twenty-Fifth Week in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 9:7-9<br>Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was being done by Jesus, and he was greatly perplexed because some were saying, "John has been raised from the dead"; others were saying, "Elijah has appeared"; still others, "One of the ancient prophets has arisen." But Herod said, "John I beheaded. Who then is this about whom I hear such things?" And he kept trying to see him.<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Hidden from the kings of this world, you come, my God to spend this time with me. Let me speak to you and listen with the simplicity and sincerity of a child. Open my eyes to see and believe in you and your word. I live in the hope of eternity, putting aside all things that lead nowhere. Help me know once more the great mystery of your love for me.<br><br>Petition:Let me see you Lord in my whole day today. Help me to put aside all that blinds my soul to your presence.<br><br>1. Royal Frustration.<br>It remains a curiosity that Herod finds it so difficult to meet Jesus. Herod canÂ’t figure out who Jesus is. He has his learned philosophers to discuss the subject with. He has his informers to keep him up-to-date. He has his messengers to carry out his orders and wishes. In spite of it all, Herod remains in the dark. Even when Herod finally has his chance and Jesus stands before him, he gets no satisfaction. Jesus remains silent and works no wonders. Was not Herod also created to know the wonder of GodÂ’s love and mercy revealed in the FatherÂ’s only begotten Son?<br><br>2. Spiritually Blind.<br>Blinded by progress and material wealth, Herod does not look beyond his small, closed world. He lives without regard for God and his will. It is the old temptation to forget God, or at least to live as though he did not exist (Wisdom 2:19). Still, this way of living -- refusing to look to God -- cannot completely stifle the deep aspirations within the human heart, whose destiny is eternal. Blindness like HerodÂ’s leads one to idolize the world, to seek satisfaction here. The end of such a path is deep disappointment, even hopelessness.<br><br>3. Seeing with the Heart.<br>Â“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see GodÂ” (Matthew 5:<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Â“Pure in heart" refers to people attuned in intellect and will to the demands of GodÂ´s holiness. This involves three chief aspects: charity, chastity and the love of truth. There is a connection between a pure heart, a pure body and a pure faith. (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, nos. 1720 and 251<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Herod allowed the things of this world to darken his soul; he could not progress in charity, chastity or love of truth. And so he could not see what was offered him. He could not see what stood before him.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Christ Jesus, purify my heart for the faith you want for me, a faith which shows itself by obedience to the FatherÂ’s will. You are love; teach me to believe in love. Purify my heart with your love so that it may be attuned to the demands of my faith.<br><br>Resolution: I will take time today to speak to someone about my faith. I will especially take time outside my Â“comfort zoneÂ” to speak, write or phone someone.<br><br>By Father Jon Budke, LC<br><br>Adoration for Vocations invites you to offer time in adoration for your parish priest.

            <div class='col-md body'>September 24, 2004<br>Friday of the Twenty-Fifth Week in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 9:18-22<br>Once when Jesus was praying in solitude, and the disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?" They said in reply, "John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, Â´One of the ancient prophets has arisen.Â´" Then he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter said in reply, "The Messiah of God." He rebuked them and directed them not to tell this to anyone. He said, "The Son of Man must suffer greatly and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed and on the third day be raised."<br><br>Introductory Prayer:You are my God, my creator. All that I am and have comes from you. You have not only created me but wish to have constant and close friendship with me. Thank you for being with me during this time of prayer. Put the fire of your love in my heart. Let it burn away my unworthiness so I can bring the fire of your love to the world around me.<br><br>Petition:Christ Jesus, let me witness to my belief in you, the Messiah, with my life.<br><br>1. And You?<br>Jesus asks his disciples: "Who do they say that I am?" They respond that some people say he is John the Baptist raised from the dead. For others he is the return of Elijah or one of the other great prophets from of old. The people have great esteem for Jesus of Nazareth, the wonder-worker, the one with a message unlike any they have ever heard. They certainly have a high opinion of him. Many of them believe he has been Â“sent by God" but they still do not recognize him as the Messiah, the long-awaited one. Jesus responds to these various answers with another question. He forces them to take a personal position. He is no longer asking for statistics or impressions. Who am I to you? He asks us, too Â– he who calls us by name and knows the secrets of our heart.<br><br>2. Self-Defining.<br>Who should I be if I belong to Christ? Christ puts this question to each of us. What does it mean to be a Christian? He is not John the Baptist or one of the prophets; he is something more. The apostles leave everything to follow him. He has not just added a bit of blessing to their lives. He is their savior, for they cannot save themselves. He is the redeemer of all who were lost in sin. He loved them even when they were lost. So if I too define myself as a Christian, what does it mean to me that God gives me his only Son?<br><br>3. Anointed.<br>Â“MessiahÂ” in Hebrew means Â“to be anointedÂ” -- anointed and therefore consecrated to fulfill a mission of God. In the Old Testament it was the king, the priest and the prophet who were anointed to do GodÂ’s work. Jesus is all three: the perfect priest, prophet and king sent to redeem the lost people. The disciples had their ideas of what the Messiah had to be. They expected the Messiah to restore King DavidÂ’s dynasty; they likely expected to take positions of political power. But Jesus the Messiah points out his path, the way to accomplish perfectly all the Father asks: the way of the cross. Suffering and rejection is the path he has come to walk. Being a Christian, therefore, means accepting the logic of the cross in my life; it means following Jesus as he carries the cross.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: You, Christ, are the answer to my every desire. You are the heart from whose fullness I constantly draw. You are the fulfillment of all of GodÂ’s promises, the source of life and holiness. I am yours and you are mine. You gave yourself to be crushed for my sins. Open my heart to believe in your love for me; make my life a testimony to your love as yours is a testimony to the FatherÂ’s love for us.<br><br>Resolution: I will speak well of someone today when I am tempted to be negative Â–Â– or when I hear someone else speak negatively Â–Â– about him or her, remembering that Christ shed his blood for every person, even this one.<br><br>By Father Jon Budke, LC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>Stumbling Block</strong></span></span><br><br>September 25, 2004<br>Saturday of the Twenty-Fifth Week in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 9:43b-45<br>At a time when all were amazed at his every deed, Jesus said to his disciples, Â“Pay attention to what I am telling you. The Son of Man is to be handed over to men." But they did not understand this saying; its meaning was hidden from them so that they should not understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.<br><br>Introductory Prayer:"O God, you are my God, I seek you, my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water Â… My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds meÂ” (Psalm 63:1,8 ). When we were lost in sin you came to bring your mercy and goodness. Come now my God to remind me of all your presence means, to remember the misery you have saved me from. Help me to be astonished by your works -- most astonished at the works you do deep in my heart and soul. Seeing all you do makes it easier for me to hope in the good things you promise. Let me constantly grow in faith in your word. Help me hope in your promise. Grant that I may love as you love.<br><br>Petition:Your plan is always better Lord. Help me to remember this even when I donÂ’t understand.<br><br>1. A Contradiction.<br>The words are clear enough, yet the apostles struggle to understand. It is impossible that their Master could be betrayed. He who had conquered devils, how could he be a prisoner? He who brought the dead back to life Â… it was impossible, unfathomable. Until he explained himself more clearly there was no more to be said. The apostles were troubled and afraid, but did not ask. Certainly he would soon explain it to them.<br><br>2. Light of Faith.<br>Â“For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of GodÂ” (1 Corinthians 1:22-24). The blind stumble because they donÂ’t see. Placed in the dark we are all equally blind. He who makes the light shine in the darkness, as seen in the account of creation, is also able to bring light to our spiritual darkness. He makes us see what is otherwise beyond us. What the disciples need when Jesus speaks of his coming passion and death is not more explanation but faith. Faith is GodÂ’s gift enabling us to believe, without doubting, all that He has revealed to us. And do we ever need it! We demand explanations when we should be asking for stronger faith.<br><br>3. He Keeps His Word.<br>The Lord keeps faith. He fulfills all his promises. All that is promised in the Old Covenant is perfectly fulfilled in Jesus Christ. John the Baptist sent messengers asking, Â“Are you the one?Â” Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see: the blind recover their sight, cripples walk, lepers are cured, the deaf hear, dead men are raised to life, and the poor have the good news preached to them. Blest is the man who finds no stumbling block in me" (Matthew 11:4-6). Jesus is faithful, and yet faith is never easy for us, especially when GodÂ’s plans run counter to our own. This is true for us, true for the disciples, true even for Mary: Â“They did not grasp what was said to themÂ” (Luke 2:50). In MaryÂ’s case, however, incomprehension leads her to reflect and rely on GodÂ’s unfailing Word: "Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and loyally persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross" (Lumen Gentium, 58 ). The disciplesÂ’ incomprehension too, will eventually lead them to reflect and rely on God. How about our incomprehension, as we face the suffering of this life? Our lives, like MaryÂ’s and the disciplesÂ’, needs to progress day by day in faith and understanding.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Jesus, my Lord and my God, you accompany me every step of the way. Thank you. You answer every one of my needs. You are faithful to every promise. When I am tempted to doubt remind me of your love, especially in your suffering upon the cross for me. I who am so weak would have chosen an easier path, while you spared nothing in giving me your goodness and love. Help me to believe and actively accept your will in my life. Help me to embrace even the cross with the love you teach me. And let Mary, the Mother you gave me at the foot of the cross, accompany me along GodÂ´s mysterious path!<br><br>Resolution: Today, I will pray a decade of the rosary with family or friends.<br><br>By Father Jon Budke, LC<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>One Life to Live</strong></span></span><br>September 26, 2004<br>Twenty-Sixth Sunday in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 16: 19-31<br><br>Jesus said to the Pharisees: "There was a rich man who dressed in purple garments and fine linen and dined sumptuously each day. And lying at his door was a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who would gladly have eaten his fill of the scraps that fell from the rich manÂ´s table. Dogs even used to come and lick his sores. When the poor man died, he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried, and from the netherworld, where he was in torment, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he cried out, Â´Father Abraham, have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering torment in these flames.Â´ Abraham replied, Â´My child, remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented. Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours.Â´ He said, Â´Then I beg you, father, send him to my fatherÂ´s house, for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they too come to this place of torment.Â´ But Abraham replied, Â´They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.Â´ He said, Â´Oh no, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.Â´ Then Abraham said, Â´If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.Â´"<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for these moments of prayer. Thank you for this opportunity to enter into dialogue with you, making you the priority of my day and week. Help me be a more faithful follower and effective instrument in order to reflect your love to all my brothers and sisters.<br><br>Petition:Lord, grant me the grace to realize how fleeting life on earth really is. Please help me to see that my time for serving you is limited and that you have given me gifts in order to be your apostle.<br><br>1. Poor Lazarus. The figure of Lazarus reminds us of GodÂ’s preferential love for the poor, especially the poor of heart. Indeed God had mercy on Lazarus who, upon his death, was carried to the Â“bosom of Abraham.Â” In the context of this passage, though, GodÂ’s love for Lazarus calls each one of us to ask ourselves whether we practice a similar love. It is so easy to think that what we have is due to some merit on our part and that those less fortunate than ourselves are undeserving of those same gifts. The Holy Spirit wants to remind us that everything we possess is from God. Furthermore, we have received it for a purpose: to serve others, especially by helping to bring them closer to God. Do I recognize the poor Lazarus in anyone that I meet during a typical day?<br><br>2. The Rich Man. The rich man in this passage did not realize what his life and mission were all about. Blinded by material goods, he put all of his hope in the good things of this world and totally missed the fact that God expected much more from him. Most tragically, he completely failed to take notice of anyone but himself. He was so accustomed to being served by others that he even maintained this attitude in the afterlife: Â“Father AbrahamÂ…send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue.Â” Instead of forgetting about himself, the self-centeredness of the rich man caused him to forget about those around him. How easy it is to be satisfied with the things of this world and to forget about our lofty mission as ChristÂ’s apostles!<br><br>3. One Life to Live. The rich man realizes too late that we have one life to live and one chance to live it. If only he could have warned his brothers about the dangers of living a selfish life! If only he could go back to tell them! If only someone could offer a credible witness on earth so that they might believe that life is so much more than our time on earth! The lesson of this gospel is that we must live only for God and others; a selfish life satisfies neither us nor God. It is an invitation for each of us to live all of the implications of our vocation as Catholic Christians. We must be apostles of ChristÂ’s kingdom. In the words of Fr Marcial Maciel: Â“You must be convinced of this truth: Without your faithful, constant cooperation Christ cannot accomplish what he intends to do with you. You are ChristÂ’s hands, feet, eyes, mind and heart. You are the channels and means he will use to give himself to humanity.... What a great honor our good Jesus has given you, but what a great responsibility he has laid on your shoulders!Â” (Letter of Father Marcial Maciel, LC, March 23, 1947).<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord Jesus, thank you for teaching me through the gospel, for teaching me that life is too short to be spent thinking about myself. You have chosen me not because of any merit of my own, but simply out of your providential love. Help me to see the suffering around me. Never let me be deceived into thinking that my talents are due to some merit of mine. Please, Lord, help me to use my time on earth to be your instrument so that I will never lament losing the opportunity to be an apostle of your kingdom.<br><br>Resolution: Lord Jesus Christ, I promise today to seize at least one opportunity to be an apostle by overcoming selfishness and reflecting your love to someone in need.<br><br>By Father David Daly, LC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>Humility: Foundation for an Apostle.</strong></span></span><br><br><strong>September 27, 2004<br>Saint Vincent de Paul </strong><br><br>Luke 9: 46-50<br><br>An argument arose among the disciples about which of them was the greatest. Jesus realized the intention of their hearts and took a child and placed it by his side and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. For the one who is least among all of you is the one who is the greatest." Then John said in reply, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow in our company." Jesus said to him, "Do not prevent him, for whoever is not against you is for you."<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for this time of prayer. I come to you with faith and confidence, knowing that you will guide me today to be your instrument in the midst of so many seemingly ordinary circumstances. May your gospel and grace teach all of us how to be true apostles.<br><br>Petition:Lord, grant me the grace of true humility so that I can be your instrument and apostle.<br><br>1. Who is the Greatest? A sad reflection on the apostles is that on more than one occasion Jesus had to rebuke them for arguing about who was the greatest among them. However, it helps us to see ourselves in them, realizing that the first apostles had the same tendencies and weaknesses as each one of us. Who among us does not want to be great? Actually, God is calling us to be great! He does not want mediocre souls or half-hearted apostles. Jesus calls us to channel and purify our desire for greatness so that our primary concern is not our own good but GodÂ’s glory and the good of our brothers and sisters. Where does my desire for greatness lie?<br><br>2. The One Who Serves. The medicine that Jesus offers to his apostles in order to help them grow in humility is the example of a child. In the gospels he gives ongoing doses. Jesus said, Â“Let the little children come to me.Â” He also warned that no one could enter the kingdom of heaven unless they became like a little child. In this passage he uses a child in order to illustrate that the greatest among them is not the one who is served by the rest. The greatest among them is not the one who stands out for his many honors, great deeds and successes in life. No, the greatest among them is the one who serves the rest. Even more shocking, the greatest among them is the one who receives (serves) the most insignificant ones, those from whom we can expect no return. We can ask ourselves, Â“When was the last time I served with absolutely no desire for recognition, but simply for the glory of God and the good of the one I was serving? When did I give and not count the cost?Â”<br><br>3. ChristÂ’s Patience. Immediately after reprimanding his apostles for their ambition, teaching them that true greatness is humble service, Jesus again finds traces of that same lack of humility in the beloved apostle, St. John. Perhaps John accepted the lesson that the apostles should not compete among themselves as to who should be the greatest. Nevertheless, it would seem that he still thought that that the Twelve should be given a special place of honor since he asks Jesus if they should stop those who Â“were not of their companyÂ”. The gentle humility of Jesus surfaces in his response. He does not rebuke John again, but patiently teaches him that whoever is not against them is on their side. Jesus teaches us throughout the day that humility must be the foundation of our work for his kingdom.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord Jesus, thank you for this time of prayer. I pray for the gift of humility so that I might be a more docile instrument. Your patience and personal attention throughout the day is a sublime reality that frequently escapes my notice, and so I ask you to make me more aware of your presence today. Help me to learn to follow you in selfless service to my brothers and sisters. May I serve them out of the purest of loveÂ–Â–for your glory and not mine.<br><br>Resolution: Lord, I promise that on at least one occasion, I will serve one of the least of my brothers today, someone from whom I will receive no recompense. In doing so, I will heed your call to become a more humble follower.<br><br>By Father David Daly, LC<br></div>

There is no duplicity in him." Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree." Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel." Jesus answered and said to him, "Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this." And he said to him, "Amen, amen, I say to you, you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for these moments of prayer. Open my eyes so that I may recognize your grace in my life. Grant me the love to follow the call to be your instrument today. Mary, help me to appreciate GodÂ’s grace in my life and, by being his instrument as you were, help me to be a reflection of his love for my brothers and sisters today.<br><br>Petition:Lord Jesus, I ask for the grace of being dependent on you so that I may truly be a docile instrument in your hands.<br><br>1. No Duplicity. When Jesus called his apostles, he looked for people who were sincere and coherent. His words to Nathanael express this attitude: Â“Here is a true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him.Â” He knew that coherent and upright individuals would make the best followers; he knew that they would be faithful followers. To follow Christ we must be faithful to his teaching, word and example. That will make us instruments of GodÂ’s grace. On the contrary, if we are not coherent and faithful to ChristÂ’s teachings, we will not be instruments but obstacles blocking the path to Christ. Am I coherent with my Catholic faith in the way that I live my life? This is the first step to letting him use me as an instrument.<br><br>2. The Angels of God. TodayÂ’s feast of the Archangels celebrates the angelic ministers who stand before us as models of docility to the plan of God. Gabriel transmitted the message to the Blessed Virgin that she would be the mother of God. Michael fought against Lucifer and hurled him into hell. Raphael, whose name means Â“God has healed,Â” was sent by God to heal Tobias. The angels serve as examples of faithful service to God despite troubling circumstances and difficult odds. They were docile instruments of GodÂ’s plan. WouldnÂ’t it be great to be as faithful as they were, being true instruments of God?<br><br>3. Jesus Knows You. As Jesus recognized Nathanael under the fig tree, he also knows each one of us. He knows if there is duplicity in our hearts. He knows if we are coherent and faithful to his will in our lives. Therefore we have nothing to hide and we have nothing to lose! If my life is marked by fidelity to God, then I must seek to give him to others. If my life is marked by duplicity, now is the time to strive for a more faithful following of Jesus. Either way, he wants to use me as an instrument today. How many people do not know him, yet how many graces I have received! Jesus knows me and expects me to reflect his merciful love starting today.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord Jesus, thank you for these words of the gospel and especially for the example of the apostles and the angels. We all form the communion of saints, united in you. I offer you my best efforts to be faithful to your plan for me today. Even more, knowing that so many people are far from you, I offer myself to be an instrument of your plan of salvation. Use me to reach others. I pray for all those people who find themselves in darkness because no one has shown them the light.<br><br>Resolution: Lord, today I promise to reflect your glory by being coherent in my Christian life and thus being your instrument. In particular, I offer you the perfect fulfillment of your will in whatever will be difficult for me today.<br><br>By Father David Daly, LC<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>September 30, 2004<br>Saint Jerome </strong></span></span><br><br>Luke 10: 1-12<br><br>The Lord appointed seventy-two others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended to visit. He said to them, "The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest. Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves. Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way. Into whatever house you enter, first say, Â´Peace to this household.Â´ If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another. Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you, cure the sick in it and say to them, Â´The kingdom of God is at hand for you.Â´ Whatever town you enter and they do not receive you, go out into the streets and say, Â´The dust of your town that clings to our feet, even that we shake off against you.Â´ Yet know this: the kingdom of God is at hand. I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom on that day than for that town.Â”<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:God Almighty Father, I offer you this prayer in union with your son Jesus Christ. I begin by recalling in faith that you are truly present and that you have a special grace ready for me in this meditation. Mary, help me to pray and to come closer to God in this meditation.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord, in this prayer I would like to ask for the grace of being truly docile to your will for me as a Catholic and as one who is called to be your apostle in todayÂ’s world.<br><br><strong>1. The Laborers Are Few</strong>. Jesus himself points out the need for apostolic souls, for men and women who are not afraid of taking up the challenge of proclaiming the gospel to the world. In our day and age the Vicar of Christ has announced the New Evangelization, yet the laborers are few. Who will respond? The Holy Spirit is calling all Catholics to respond with a robust, Â“Here I am Lord!Â” The fields are truly ripe for the harvest and the Lord continues to call. Am I ready to follow? What inspirations have I received? How can I follow Jesus and take up the challenge?<br><br><strong>2. Follow the Instructions.</strong> We see the Lord getting very specific with the seventy-two disciples whom he chose and sent out. Jesus has chosen each of us in the sameÂ–Â–very personalÂ–Â–way. We are to transform the culture, the workplace, the university environment, the home, etc. Anywhere human activity takes place, we are called to bring the gospel. Jesus gives very specific instructions to the seventy-two and specific instructions to us. It is important to be docile to these instructions, which come to us through the Church. If we are attentive, we will hear the specifications on how to go about the New Evangelization. There are different approaches but the essentials are the same: Mary, the Eucharist, prayer, the gospel, charity, etc. Have the pastoral instructions of the Vicar of Christ and the Church found fertile soil in my heart?<br><br><strong>3. Shake off the Dust.</strong> ChristÂ’s invitation to follow and serve is as strong today as it was for the seventy-two disciples! A perennial temptation is fear. Jesus warns and motivates them not to be afraid. He would be with themÂ–Â–and he will be with usÂ–Â–until the end of the world. Therefore he encourages them to be fearless even in the face of apparent failure. If any town does not accept them, Jesus tells them to shake the dust off their feet and move on to another town. The townÂ’s hardness of heart will stand as a condemnation. In the same way, we must not be discouraged that many do not accept the gospel today. We must shake the dust off our feet and move forward to proclaim GodÂ’s Kingdom!<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord Jesus, you call workers to your harvest today as you did during your days on earth. May many of us follow your call as priests, consecrated men and women and lay apostles. The harvest is great, but the workers are few. Send more laborers, Lord. Send me! You know that I want to serve you, but you also know my weakness and frailty. I trust in your grace to sustain me. With you all things are possible!<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I promise, Lord, that I will pray for vocations today. The best prayer that I can make is the offering of myself: Â“Not my will, but your will be done!Â”<br><br>By Father David Daly, LC<br></div>

Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. And as for you, Capernaum, Â´Will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to the netherworld.Â´ Whoever listens to you listens to me. Whoever rejects you rejects me. And whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for granting me this time of prayer. What a great gift! Grant me a deeper faith in your presence so that my prayer will truly be a moment of union with you. I trust that you are with me and that you have a special mission for me. Accept the offering of myself and use me as your instrument today.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord Jesus, grant me the grace of a deep, unshakable confidence in you, despite my shortcomings and weaknesses. Grant me a confidence like that of St Therese of the Child Jesus.<br><br><strong>1. Christ Is on Our Side</strong>. Â“Woe to you, Chorazin!Â” Why is Christ so angry with these towns? He is angry because they have hard-heartedly refused the Kingdom of God brought to them by the seventy-two missionaries. He offered the people of his time salvation and immediate access to his Kingdom, yet they refused. Times have not changed. Today Christ speaks to the Church and the world through faithful Catholics who pray and work to fulfill the missionary mandate. Nevertheless, many hardened hearts reject the Good News. Our greatest consolation is to know that Jesus Christ is with us in the Church, in his vicar on earth, and most especially in the Eucharist. No matter how much rejection we experience in proclaiming the fullness of the gospel, Jesus Christ is with us.<br><br><strong>2. Represent Christ</strong>. In the most difficult moments, Jesus offers us the greatest gifts. In the face of these unrepentant towns and the rejection of the Good News, Jesus reiterates his love for his closest followers. He trusts them so much that he makes them his personal representatives: Â“Whoever listens to you listens to me.Â” He trusts them so much that he makes them the FatherÂ’s personal representatives too: Â“And whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.Â” What trust and confidence Jesus has for these chosen disciples. The same is true for us. Each Catholic is called to represent Jesus Christ and God the Father. The mission seems lofty, perhaps beyond our capabilities, but it is true. How can I represent Christ today?<br><br><strong>3. Love in the Heart of the Church</strong>. St Therese of the Child Jesus is a great example of total confidence in God that led her to be a wonderful instrument of his love. She, like many of us, desired to do great things for Christ, but discovered many limitations of health, personal capabilities and her vocation to the cloister. St Therese realized that with Christ all things are possible. After searching for her mission, she finally realized that it was to be love in the heart of the Church. She could be a great missionary by humbly accepting GodÂ’s will in her daily life and by fulfilling her daily duties with extraordinary love and union with Christ. St Therese became the co-patron, together with St Francis Xavier, of missionaries. There is nothing that can stop any one of us from being great missionaries either!<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord Jesus Christ, thank you for enlightening my mind with your gospel and strengthening my heart with your grace. I believe in the mission to which you have called me. I believe that it is always possible to love you in all I do. I believe that this Â“little wayÂ” can allow me to be a missionary all the time. It allows me to transform all I do into acts of love for you and my brothers and sisters. Help me to infuse an ardent love for you in the duties of this day.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Lord, I promise to consciously offer up a trial, difficulty, disappointment or the perfect fulfillment of one of my duties today as a way to participate in your mission of love. Grant me your grace to fulfill this resolution.<br><br>By Father David Daly, LC<br></div>

Jesus said, "I have observed Satan fall like lightning from the sky. Behold, I have given you the power Â´to tread upon serpentsÂ´ and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven." At that very moment he rejoiced (in) the holy Spirit and said, "I give you praise, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him." Turning to the disciples in private he said, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord Jesus Christ, I come before you today in prayer. Grant me the faith to trust in your presence and build my life on faith in your love for me. Thank you for these moments of prayer. I realize that I am dependent upon you as a creature, a forgiven sinner and a chosen apostle. May my guardian angel help me never to forget your constant presence in my life.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord Jesus, grant me the grace of joyful confidence in your delicate care for me today.<br><br><strong>1. Rejoice Because Your Names Are Written in Heaven</strong>. The seventy-two disciples returned to Jesus amazed that even the demons were subject to them. They received and used a power given to them by Christ, a spiritual power by which they could influence spiritual realities. Jesus, however, calls their attention to the deeper reason for rejoicing: their names are written in heaven. In other words, he tells his disciples to rejoice not so much because of their power on earth, but because of GodÂ’s power through them to affect heavenly realities. Jesus rejoiced because GodÂ’s greatness had been shown through these simple men. Why do I rejoice as a Catholic? Is it because of the way I can influence earthly things or is it because I am able to participate with Christ in saving souls and glorifying God?<br><br><strong>2. Only the Childlike</strong>. Jesus rejoices in the Holy Spirit. Rarely do we see the gospels depict the Lord in such an outwardly jubilant attitude. If we could only understand the reason for his rejoicing, we would understand what we should do to really make him happy. Jesus rejoices because the first are the last and the last are the first. The mysteries of God and the power of his grace have been given to the childlike and the simple (the disciples) and not to sophisticated and worldly people. What is so great about that? It reveals the power of God. It is not the disciples who have done such great work but the grace of God working in them. GodÂ’s glory is revealed when the humble become his instruments. Have I adopted a childlike attitude in order to be an instrument of God?<br><br><strong>3. Your Angel in Heaven</strong>. The greatest reason for rejoicing is the fact that God has become man in Jesus Christ. In doing so, the greatest becomes the least in order to lift us up to a higher level Â— Christ becomes poor in order to enrich us with his poverty. The angels are not totally marginalized from this mystery. The angels are on a higher level than men, but if Christ deigns to serve man in the Incarnation, then these exalted creatures must follow his example. They must serve man and participate in ChristÂ’s humility. Today we celebrate this reflection of GodÂ’s glory by remembering that each human being is cared for by an angel in heaven; we each have a guardian angel. This exalted spiritual being guards our path and helps us to fulfill our mission from God.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord Jesus, thank you for choosing me to be your follower and apostle at a time when the spiritual needs of the world abound. I believe that everything I have comes from you. Teach me, Lord, not to focus on the great things that I can do because of your gifts but on your greatness for having chosen such a lowly instrument as myself. Teach me to be like a child, trust in you, and particularly trust in my guardian angel who is with me always.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Lord, I promise to lift my mind and heart to you a few times today during the hectic pace of my life. In doing so, I will remember that all good things come from you, especially the gift of my guardian angel.<br><br>By Father David Daly, LC<br></div>

The Lord replied, "If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you would say to (this) mulberry tree, Â´Be uprooted and planted in the sea,Â´ and it would obey you. "Who among you would say to your servant who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, Â´Come here immediately and take your place at tableÂ´? Would he not rather say to him, Â´Prepare something for me to eat. Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink when I am finishedÂ´? Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded? So should it be with you. When you have done all you have been commanded, say, Â´We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.Â´"<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord, grant me a faith that urges me to dedicate myself wholeheartedly and untiringly to sow the seeds of Gospel charity in those around me. Uproot all that holds me back from living a true and authentic faith that will move peopleÂ’s hearts to be your disciples.<br><br><strong>Petition:</strong> Lord increase my faith so that my love may not tire.<br><br><strong>1. A Request for Faith</strong>.<br>How small indeed is a mustard seed! But as we can readily observe, the size of a seed is not necessarily proportional to the size of the fruit it ultimately produces. How little faith there is in the hearts of those who inhabit the face of the earth! Yet Our Lord makes it very clear that the faith he is asking of us is really something very small in comparison to the goodness heÂ’s ready to show us. The apostles who traveled town-to-town with Our Lord saw firsthand the great effects faith had in the lives of all the people that Jesus cured of illness and disease. The apostles could not but want more of it in their own lives. Thus they exclaim Â“Lord, increase our faith.Â” How is my faith? Is my desire, like these apostlesÂ’, for Our Lord to increase it? Do I still not see that faith is the greatest force in the world?<br><br><strong>2. God as a Bargain Bin</strong>.<br>Often we find ourselves living our Christian lives as if it were some sort of legal contract with God. I say these prayers and God gives me something I want in return. I do this good deed and God rewards me with something else I think I need. If I am good, God will surely be good to me. In a legalistic and materialistic society, this attitude can quickly slip its way into our Christian way of thinking unnoticed by our conscience. We can be so self-centered and wrapped up in wanting things for ourselves that we fail to recognize what truly is good for ourselves here in time as well as in eternity. The values of our faith hold less weight than our immediate desires or the selfish Â“goodsÂ” that we unwittingly seek. When we think about ourselves first our relationship with God becomes reduced to a cheap and cold exchange. We turn God into a bargain bin of material or spiritual goods that I go to only because the moneybag of my stingy heart can afford him. Instead, our relationship with God should be marked with filial trust in a loving Father who knows and wants what is best for usÂ–Â–even if that entails sacrifices that seem to lack personal recompense.<br><br><strong>3. Unprofitable Servants. </strong><br>The remedy for sickness in our spiritual lives begins with a sincere prayer to see God as the source of all blessing. Â“Those who seek the Lord lack no blessingÂ” (Psalm 34:10). In this light how can we not see the undeniable fact that no one can fully repay God for all the gifts that he has already given usÂ–Â–the gift of life for starters, and the promise of eternal happiness? When I dedicate myself to the work of evangelizing, is it inspired by a deep and profound gratitude and humility for all the Lord has done for me? Or is it inspired by a pernicious and deeply-rooted attitude of a reward in the waiting? Has my response to Our Lord taken on characteristics more like a contract rather than a loving relationship with one who loves me deeply and deserves all my love in return?<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ: </strong><br>Lord how easy it seems for me to fall into the trap of thinking that my love for you receives such little recompense! How blind and self-centered I remain! In fact you constantly give like that loving father you described in the parable of the prodigal son, the father who said, Â“Son you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.Â” Help me always to trust in your providential love for me so that you may always find in me dispositions of an unbreakable faith and total generosity in fulfilling your holy will in my life.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Without complaint and moved by faith I will do a hidden act of charity or service that makes a difference in the life of someone IÂ’ve wronged in the past.<br><br>By Father Ned Brown, LC</div>

He said to them, "When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us, and do not subject us to the final test."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord what you teach us today in Scripture is more than a prayer; it expresses your own deepest and most ardent sentiments of love for our Father in heaven. May this prayer mold my heart so that it can be lived with conviction in my daily life.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord teach me to pray!<br><br><strong>1. Childlike Simplicity</strong>. Shortly after the incident in the home of Martha and Mary, the apostles observed Our Lord in prayer more closely. How they wanted to imitate him but felt so at a loss as to where to begin. Luckily for the apostles they could ask Our Lord how to prayÂ–Â–and how fortunate it is for us that they did ask. Jesus loved the apostles especially when they possessed this childlike simplicity. It is when we are childlike, that is, when we are eager to learn, willing to listen, conscious of our own weakness and dependent on him, that Our Lord can teach us.<br><br><strong>2. Filial Trust in Prayer</strong>. Our Lord left us with this prayer as a model for all other prayers. We need to begin every prayer by first adoring God as our Father. Only after doing so are we to bring before him our petitions for our spiritual and material needs. Fostering in our spiritual lives a filial love and trust for God is the key to always praying well. Nothing wounds parents so much as when they sense that theyÂ’ve lost the filial trust and love of their child; so too nothing closes off the flow of our FatherÂ’s graces than a lowering of our confidence and trust in his providential love for us. Our Savior could, indeed, have started this divine prayer with some word other than Â“Father,Â” conveying perhaps more the idea of majesty (Â“LordÂ”) or power (Â“CreatorÂ”). Instead Jesus chose a term which inspires confidence and love; for what is sweeter than the name Â“FatherÂ”, conveying as it does the idea of indulgence and tenderness?<br><br><strong>3. "Our FatherÂ” </strong><br>When we each invoke Â“Our FatherÂ”, we affirm that, through the gift of divine adoption, all the faithful are brothers and sisters and should love each other as such. Also, as a necessary consequence of this adoption, we are truly called to be brothers and sisters of Christ. Â“In spite of the divisions among Christians, this prayer to Â‘ourÂ’ Father remains our common patrimony and an urgent summons for all the baptized. In communion by faith in Christ and by Baptism, they ought to join in JesusÂ’ prayer for the unity of his disciplesÂ” (CCC 2791). If we are to say this prayer sincerely, our divisions and oppositions have to be overcome. Â“The baptized cannot pray to Â“ourÂ” Father without bringing before him all those for whom he gave his beloved Son. GodÂ’s love has no bounds; neither should our prayerÂ” (CCC 2793).<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Lord you made me, creating me out of nothing. Though I sinned against you, you did not abandon me but redeemed me, adopting me along with my fellow Christians into your family of the Most Holy Trinity. Because of this I dare to pray: Â“Our Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us, and do not subject us to the final test.Â” Help me to pray this your prayer with total sincerity and committed love so that I may mean what I pray and live what this prayer contains.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I will look for time to begin reading the section of the Catechism of the Catholic Church that concerns the Our Father (CCC 2759-2865). I will try to always say this prayer conscientiously and with greater fervor, avoiding dissipation and routine.<br><br>By Father Ned Brown, LC<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We pray for any friends and family members who have fallen away from Christ.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>An Importunate Friend and a Lesson in Prayer</strong></span></span><br><br>October 7, 2004<br>Our Lady of the Rosary<br><br>Luke 11:5-13<br>Jesus said to his disciples, "Suppose one of you has a friend to whom he goes at midnight and says, Â´Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey and I have nothing to offer him,Â´ and he says in reply from within, Â´Do not bother me; the door has already been locked and my children and I are already in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.Â´ I tell you, if he does not get up to give him the loaves because of their friendship, he will get up to give him whatever he needs because of his persistence. "And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. What father among you would hand his son a snake when he asks for a fish? Or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg? If you then, who are wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord, in my prayer I often have to wait for your response. Too often I seek my own interests even to the detriment of my spiritual life. I am still such a novice at prayer and the spiritual life. Grant me your grace to persevere in prayer. May I never doubt your goodness and friendship towards my soul. Fill me with an unbreakable confidence and trust in your loving plan of redemption for me and all of mankind.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord, grant that my prayer may always have the quality of complete and total confidence in you.<br><br><strong>1. Purify Our Friendship with Christ in Prayer. </strong><br>TodayÂ’s Gospel passage is one of the three parables Luke records from ChristÂ’s public ministry concerning prayer. The passage of the Â“importunate friendÂ” invites us to persistent prayer. Friends can usually ask other friends for special favors especially if there is an urgent need. Helpfulness in time of need is one proof of a loyal friend. Hopefully weÂ’ve all had experiences of others calling on us in their time of need. This would be a sign that they consider us their true friends. Our Lord wants to be our true friend. But all too often our hearts arenÂ’t set on our friendship with Christ, and we allow other loves and interest that arenÂ’t of Christ to enter into the sanctuary of our heart. How do I know God has answered my prayers? Is it because I get what I want or is it because I get what God thinks is best for me? In my prayer am I ready to open my heart and life to greater things, higher ideals, a deeper love?<br><br><strong>2. Perseverance in Prayer. </strong><br>In this parable Our Lord makes it clear that if the friendship is not strong enough to answer the request of a friend, persistence will. Our Lord wants us to fight against all temptations of doubt and lack of trust when our prayers seem unanswered. We should never doubt GodÂ’s friendship towards us. Have we forgotten that we are praying to the omnipotent God? In him all things are possible! If it seems we are not getting what we want, these trials can serve Our Lord in maturing our faith and getting us to trust more in his loving providence. Remember the words of Scripture: Â“My child, when you come to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for testingÂ” (Sirach 2:1). Â“Consider the generations of old and see: has anyone trusted in the Lord and been disappointed? Or has anyone persevered in the fear of the Lord and been forsaken? Or has anyone called upon him and been neglected?Â” (Sirach 2:10). Remain hopeful and persevere in prayer!<br><br><strong>3. GodÂ’s Goodness is Always Beyond Our Expectations. </strong><br>We put GodÂ’s goodness on trial when we are called on to wait for Our Lord. We trust so much in our own goodness and so little in GodÂ’s! Do we forget so easily how Christ suffered for our redemption? Why cannot we then endure even a slight inconvenience out of faith in ChristÂ’s goodness? For the one who trusts in the Lord in the time of trial Our Lord promises, Â“How much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!Â” (Luke 11:13). The FatherÂ’s greatest gifts are yet to come. And his greatest gift is his very divine life. Did not Our Lord commend Solomon for asking for wisdom rather than material goods? (1 Kings 3:5-14). Did not Christ promise to send the Paraclete to teach us all things? (John 14:25-27; 15:26; 16:7-15). We should seek the Kingdom of God first, persevering in our prayer until Our Lord brings it to fulfillment. With his wisdom and love God answers all prayers.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Oh Lord it is you who say to me, Â“Ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.Â” Grant me confidence in your words, for you countlessly back them up with mighty signs of love and predilection in my life. If I must wait on your response to my prayer, purify me of selfishness that keeps me from trusting you and your supreme goodness. Help me to be patient in trials and comfort those who suffer until you come in your glory to remove every tear and sadness from our hearts.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I will pray the rosary of Our Lady today with special fervor, recollection and confidence in her intercessory power for the needs of world peace.<br><br>By Father Ned Brown, LC<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Faith-Filled Gratitude<br><br>October 10, 2004<br>Twenty-Eighth Sunday in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 17:11-19<br>As he continued his journey to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled through Samaria and Galilee. As he was entering a village, ten lepers met (him). They stood at a distance from him and raised their voice, saying, "Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!" And when he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they were going they were cleansed. And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan. Jesus said in reply, "Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?" Then he said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has saved you."<br><br>Introductory Prayer: Lord, I am happy that you are giving me this opportunity to spend time with you. Help me to focus, to put aside the distractions that can undermine my complete attention to you. Open my soul up to all the graces you wish to give me.<br><br>Petition: Teach me, Lord, how to be thankful for your great gifts.<br><br>1. Ask and You Shall Receive. When George Bailey sat in the bar, with impending doom hanging over his head, he did what came naturally. He prayed. The feeling of our backs firmly against the wall is probably just as conducive a position for prayer as kneeling with our hands folded. One of GodÂ’s purposes in allowing us to wind up in situations that seem beyond human solutions is to compel us to turn to him. The lepers in todayÂ’s Gospel had no place to turn; there was no doctor, no medicine that could make them better. They could only cry out to Christ. Â“Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!Â” Their plaintive cry reminds us that there is no problem or situation too big to bring to Christ. Our belief in his power can work miracles.<br><br>2. Forgetful Souls. When we think of the nine lepers who did not return to give thanks, we are probably as amazed as Jesus. They have received a tremendous miracle, how could they be so forgetful? Perhaps we should ask that question of ourselves. Just think of it Â… when we are present at Mass, the words of consecration bring about a miracle infinitely greater than curing a skin disease. When I receive the very Body and Blood of Christ, I participate in a miracle that is far more impacting than even bringing the dead back to life. The point here isnÂ’t to formulate a measuring stick for miracles, but to see how I can be like the nine lepers. When I receive the Eucharist in a distracted, lukewarm way, I fail to see the miracle before my eyes. ItÂ’s said that St. Philip Neri, that master of the brilliant catechetical stroke, once had candle-bearing altar boys accompany a man who would consistently leave Mass early without spending any time in thanksgiving. St Philip hoped that this would help him to realize what a great gift he had just received. The blessings we receive are beyond our comprehension. But a dull heart can be very forgetful.<br><br>3. Grateful Souls. The Samaritan leper threw himself at JesusÂ’ feet in a spirit of total thanksgiving. He is the example of the grateful soul, who knows that however great his faith is, it is Christ who works the miracle. The grateful soul takes nothing for granted. George Weigel writes in Witness to Hope: Â“Piotr and Teresa Malecki, longtime members of Karol WojtylaÂ’s srodowisko were staying in the papal villa at Castel Gandolfo in the late summer of 1997 as the PopeÂ’s guests. Their bedroom was just below his, and before dawn each morning they knew by the thumping of his cane that he was up and about. One morning, at breakfast, the Pope asked if the noise was disturbing them. No, they answered, they were getting up for Mass anyway. Â“But, Wujek,Â” they asked, Â“why do you get up at that hour of the morning?Â” Because, said Karol Wotjyla, the 264th Bishop of Rome, Â“I like to watch the sun rise.Â”<br>The grateful heart doesnÂ’t grow old; it is always being renewed through the contemplation of GodÂ’s generous, creative love. Â“Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God. It is right to give him thanks and praise!<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord Jesus, you fill my life with so many good things. I thank you with all my heart for creating me, redeeming me, and giving me your love and friendship. I marvel at your work. Keep my soul fresh and alive with the spirit of gratitude for all your tremendous gifts.<br><br>Resolution: I will be fervent in my thanksgiving at Mass.<br><br>By Father Steven Reilly, LC<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some People Do Much More with Much Less<br><br>October 11, 2004<br>Monday of the Twenty-Eighth Week in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 11:29-32<br>While still more people gathered in the crowd, Jesus said to them, "This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it, except the sign of Jonah. Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. At the Judgment the queen of the south will rise with the men of this generation and she will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and there is something greater than Solomon here. At the Judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it, because at the preaching of Jonah they repented, and there is something greater than Jonah here.<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Father, give me the grace to know you more deeply. DonÂ’t let me float through life with a superficial spirituality. I love you with all my heart and ask you to bless this time of prayer.<br><br>Petition:Lord, please help me to not waste any of your precious graces. I want to be faithful and fruitful.<br><br>1. Jonah and Solomon: Not Exactly Stellar Instruments of God. Jesus speaks in todayÂ’s reading about Jonah and Solomon. Neither one will ever be canonized. Jonah had to be dragged kicking and screaming into his prophetic mission. Solomon, at the end of his life, found himself building temples to other gods, just to keep the harem happy. Yet, surprisingly, other people encountered GodÂ’s grace through them. The Ninevites, inhabitants of that infamous city of the ancient world known for it cruelty, converted after one dayÂ’s preaching by Jonah, the unenthusiastic and unconvinced prophet. As for Solomon, his wisdom was legendary among his contemporaries. Jesus is asking the people, if others listened to Jonah and Solomon, why are you so slow to accept my message, backed up by hundreds of miraculous cures?<br>Very often the same thing happens today. Despite the spiritual treasures of the Catholic Church, frequently we encounter a lot more fervor outside the Church. To take one example, look at the Mormons. They send 60% of their young men to do missionary work for two years. Their tithing is extensive and their divorce rate is low. But we Catholics can be hard pressed just to get our youth to go to Mass, let alone give two years of their lives to voluntary service. Many of our institutions struggle financially, and our divorce rate is no better than the national average. As committed Catholics, we need to enkindle our own personal enthusiasm and our capacity to sacrifice for the Church.<br><br>2. We Have the Fullness of Truth! We are incredibly blessed in the Catholic Church. We have it all! We donÂ’t lack anything. Our souls are fed with the precious Body and Blood of Our Lord. The sacred Scriptures continually enlighten our minds. We have a Â“cloud of witnessesÂ” in all the martyrs and saints. Look at all the good examples we have. If you are struggling with purity, you have a St Maria Goretti reminding you what a jewel chastity is. If you lack confidence in God, you have a St Therese of Lisieux showing you that not even the temptation of atheism should take away your faith. And what a gift we have in the Magisterium! Truth is never far away.<br>If we were to value what we have, we would go so much further in our spiritual lives. When asked why he wasnÂ’t a Christian, Ghandi replied that if they really believed that Jesus was in the Eucharist, they would never be able to leave the church. Yes, let us value what we have received. Let us give Christ the consolation of seeing that we are making good use of all the incredible blessings.<br><br>3. ItÂ’s Not Just Our Own Spiritual Lives. A person that has been truly touched by Christ canÂ’t just be routine and lackadaisical about his faith. It wouldnÂ’t even occur to him to miss a Sunday Mass. In fact, he tries to go as often as possible. The Bible doesnÂ’t sit on the shelf gathering dust; he is continually going to it to keep his soul nourished. Most importantly, his love for the Lord is a fire in his soul that is contagious. As Pope John Paul II writes in Novo Millennio Inuente, Â“At the threshold of the third millennium, God calls believers, especially lay people, to a renewed missionary zeal. Mission is not an appendix to the Christian vocation. Rather, as the Second Vatican Council recalls, the Christian vocation by its nature is a vocation to the apostolate. Christ should be proclaimed by word and the witness of life, and, before being a strategic and organized effort, the apostolate involves the grateful and joyful communication to all of the gift of meeting Christ. An evangelically mature person, or community, is motivated by intense missionary enthusiasm, which spurs him to bear witness to Christ in every circumstance and situation, in every social, cultural and political context.Â” We are blessed in the Church. LetÂ’s try to give our best efforts, so that there will be fruits after all the great gifts we have received. It would be a shame if we let the Ninevites beat us in the generous response category.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord, you were frustrated when people continued to ask for signs without opening their hearts to the meaning of your words and deeds. I hope that I will never offend you with a stubborn attitude. Help me to realize that you have given me incredible gifts to allow me to be spiritually fruitful. I know that with your grace, I will succeed.<br><br>Resolution: I will speak about my faith to someone, so that they can see how powerful a help it is in my daily life.<br><br>By Father Steven Reilly, LC<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inviting Jesus to Dinner<br><br>October 12, 2004<br>Tuesday of the Twenty-Eighth Week in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 11:37-41<br>A Pharisee invited Jesus to dine at his home. Jesus entered and reclined at the table to eat. The Pharisee was amazed to see that he did not observe the prescribed washing before the meal. The Lord said to him, "Oh you Pharisees! Although you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, inside you are filled with plunder and evil. You fools! Did not the maker of the outside also make the inside? But as to what is within, give alms, and behold, everything will be clean for you.<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Lord, I would like to invite you into the home of my heart. Grant me the joy of a deep and meaningful conversation with you during this meditation.<br><br>Petition:Lord, grant me a faith that is both deep and practical.<br><br>1. An Invitation to Dinner. Inviting Jesus to dinner is a dangerous idea for the spiritually challenged. That is what the Pharisee in this Gospel passage discovers. It seems that we have learned the lesson Â— there are times when we avoid a more intimate relationship with Christ because we are afraid of what he may ask of us. We are comfortable where we are at and the Lord has a way of upsetting the spiritual status quo that we are content to wallow in. But the saints teach us how fulfilling it is when we invite Christ to dinner with a spirit of openness. When recovering from his wounds, St Ignatius of Loyola discovered deep interior satisfaction when he gave up the superficial pastime of reading novels of chivalry (the sixteenth centuryÂ’s equivalent of tuning out in front of the TV) and started to read the lives of the saints. Why donÂ’t we do the same? LetÂ’s put aside our silly fears and sit down to supper with the Lord. He will show us how to get to the next level.<br><br>2. Interior Purity. The Pharisees were extremely concerned about observing external laws of ritualistic purity. Insofar as that reflected a desire to be faithful to God in their vocation as the Chosen People it was a good thing. But Jesus gave this particular Pharisee the great blessing of a personal lesson on how external religious observance needs to be underpinned by internal observance. We may not be robbing banks, but still we can have hearts Â“filled with plunder and evil.Â” The vast world of our thoughts and interior emotions needs to be sanctified. Daydreams, uncharitable thoughts, impure ones -- they all need to go. With the grace of the Lord and a decided will, we can make the strides forward to a greater holiness in the heart.<br><br>3. WhatÂ’s Outside Reflects WhatÂ’s Inside. It would be a mistake, however, to think that our faith is purely interior. Â“Give alms, and behold, everything will be clean for you.Â” Legionary of Christ founder Father Marcial Maciel, LC writes in Gospel Charity: Â“I consider it a farce, or at least a naÃ¯ve deception, the attitude of people who feel they are at peace with God because they pray every day and go to Mass on SundaysÂ…, yet on the other hand they do not move even a finger to help their fellow man in the spiritual, moral and material fields. Â… Remember always: without charity there is no authentic ChristianityÂ” (p. 7). Our faith, as well as being spiritual, is very, very practical.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord, frequently I am superficial. I get caught up in my own concerns and have a hard time looking beyond them to the needs of others. Help me to live a deep charity that is both interior in my thoughts and exterior in my deeds.<br><br>Resolution: I will offer to help a person in need.<br><br>By Father Steven Reilly, LC<br></div>

You pay tithes of mint and of rue and of every garden herb, but you pay no attention to judgment and to love for God. These you should have done, without overlooking the others. Woe to you Pharisees! You love the seat of honor in synagogues and greetings in marketplaces. Woe to you! You are like unseen graves over which people unknowingly walk." Then one of the scholars of the law said to him in reply, "Teacher, by saying this you are insulting us too." And he said, "Woe also to you scholars of the law! You impose on people burdens hard to carry, but you yourselves do not lift one finger to touch them.Â”<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Father, thank you for giving me this time of prayer. I adore you as my Creator and the goal of my whole existence. Send me your Holy Spirit to enlighten my mind and strengthen my will.<br><br>Petition:Lord, help me to love you above all things!<br><br>1. Getting Distracted by the Small Stuff. It can happen that sometimes, like the Pharisees, we can get distracted by what is insignificant, wasting our energy on things that have very ephemeral value in the grand scheme of things. It could be frustration at a husband who forgets to bring home the milk. Maybe the hours of caressing the memory of some success at work. Perhaps it is feverishly pursuing a hobby or having a bout of angst until I can try out the newest upgrade to my video game collection. Why? Jesus said to the Pharisees, Â“You pay no attention to judgment.Â” The small stuff is not going to matter when we stand before God. We will not give a second thought to having skipped one of the World Series games. But we will certainly bemoan having skipped our prayers or and opportunity to do good. We need to earnestly ask Our Lord for the spiritual wisdom to recognize what is really important.<br><br>2. Priorities! We need to keep focused on our priorities. A good PDA is not enough. What is essential is a good interior life. We need to meditate on the priorities that flow from our fundamental relationships. We are children of God and friends of Jesus Christ. We may be parents with kids or priests with a flock or a manager with employees. The will of God flows directly from the relationships that form the tapestry of our lives. Our prayer and reflection help us to take a step back and to see the bigger picture of GodÂ’s call to love him by serving others. In this way, we can put first things first, avoiding the pitfall of getting caught up in the trees and missing the forest.<br><br>3. Helping Out. Jesus chastises the religious scholars for imposing burdens and then not helping to carry them. Our faith does not allow us to do this. We realize that compassion and mercy are what Christ represents as the savior of the world, so that as his followers, we try to lighten the burden of others through our prayers, encouragement and good example. But it would be a false compassion to try to lighten the burden by watering down the demands of the moral law. False compassion has brought about Â“no-faultÂ” divorce and abortion on demand and is now seeking same-sex marriage. True compassion seeks to uplift people and confirm them in living truly human lives. LetÂ’s extend a helping hand to all around us. It is not easy to be faithful in todayÂ’s world; we all need to Â“bear one anotherÂ’s burden.Â”<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Lord, your anger towards the Pharisees is a wake up call for me. So often I get wrapped up in things that donÂ’t matter. Help me to have spiritual discernment to recognize when I am drifting away from your will. I want to stick to my priorities: you and the souls you have given me to save!<br><br>Resolution: I will review my use of time to make sure that I am living by my priorities.<br><br>By Father Steven Reilly, LC<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prophets: A Gift from God<br><br>October 14, 2004<br>Thursday of theTwenty-Eighth Week in Ordinary Time<br><br>Luke 11:47-54<br>Jesus said to the scribes, Â“Woe to you! You build the memorials of the prophets whom your ancestors killed. Consequently, you bear witness and give consent to the deeds of your ancestors, for they killed them and you do the building. Therefore, the wisdom of God said, Â´I will send to them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and persecuteÂ´ in order that this generation might be charged with the blood of all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who died between the altar and the Temple building. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be charged with their blood! Woe to you, scholars of the law! You have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter and you stopped those trying to enter." When he left, the scribes and Pharisees began to act with hostility toward him and to interrogate him about many things, for they were plotting to catch him at something he might say.<br><br>Introductory Prayer:Father, another morning of prayer! I am grateful for this chance to be with you. Accept my effort for the sake of the whole world.<br><br>Petition:Lord Jesus, teach me to be faithful to the truth.<br><br>1. Why God Sends Us Prophets. Jesus reminds the Pharisees of the long history of IsraelÂ’s prophets. Whether accepted or rejected, they were all sent by God. He spoke through them, using their passionate conviction to remind the people of his love and the demands of his law. To be the Chosen People was a lofty vocation; and at times it probably seemed tiresome to many. After all, idolatry was mainstream, and so it was tempting to just want to be like everyone else, to blend in with the surrounding peoples. God knows that faithfulness is hard, so he sent the prophets to sustain Israel in its vocation. Today, the CatholicÂ’s vocation is also tough. It is easy to start drifting and to become like everyone else. When statistics are considered, Catholics are frequently indistinguishable from the secular culture. Fortunately, the Lord continues sending Â“prophets,Â” our Holy Father (Pope John Paul II) being an outstanding example. They are the witnesses of GodÂ’s love and law. They are beacons that enlighten our minds with the truth and steady our steps with their good example. Their inspiration fills us with hope. And they encourage us to be Â“different.Â”<br><br>2. Prophets for the Church and the World. The Holy SpiritÂ’s work in the Church is awesome: she is a prophet for the whole world. In the 1960s, when much of the western world was swept up in the sexual revolution, Pope Paul VI writes Humanae Vitae to remind everyone of the truly human and holy dimensions of marital intimacy. In the face of so many threats against life, Pope John Paul II writes Evangelium Vitae. But witnessing to the truth has carried a heavy price. Paul VIÂ’s fidelity brought him opprobrium and rejection; John Paul has borne an ample share of misunderstanding and ridicule. Human explanations of their fortitude are insufficient. GodÂ’s love for the world keeps the flame of truth burning bright and brilliant Â— it made them, like Peter, into unshakeable Â“rocksÂ” of fidelity.<br><br>3. Spiritual Docility. Through our baptism we are configured with Christ: priest, prophet, and king. Thus, we share in the same prophetic mission that the Pope has carried out with such love and perseverance. How hard this can be, especially when we are called to be prophets in our own families! It can be excruciating to stand firm in the truth -- are we ready to do whatÂ’s right? We would prefer to not make waves; we donÂ’t want to be up on the soapbox. But there are times that require taking a stand. LetÂ’s beg the Lord for the right words in those circumstances. LetÂ’s pray to avoid the slightest hint that we are looking down on others from a proud perch of self-righteousness. Let us pray that we wonÂ’t compromise the non-negotiable, lest the flame of truth lose some of its luster. Some day, in heaven, a soul may thank us for that good example.<br><br>Dialogue with Christ: Jesus, give me strength. When I am tempted to water down my faith, help me to have spiritual backbone. I am weak, but you are strong. I know that with your grace I can do all things.<br><br>Resolution: I will speak up for the truth, and not dodge the issue.<br><br>By Father Steven Reilly, LC<br><br></div>

You also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come." Then Peter said, "Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone?" And the Lord replied, "Who, then, is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master will put in charge of his servants to distribute (the) food allowance at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so. Truly, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his property. But if that servant says to himself, Â´My master is delayed in coming,Â´ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, to eat and drink and get drunk, then that servantÂ´s master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the unfaithful. That servant who knew his masterÂ´s will but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely; and the servant who was ignorant of his masterÂ´s will but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly. Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more.Â”<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord, help me to listen to you today with the same attentiveness you had when listening to your Heavenly Father in prayer.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">ear Jesus, grant me the grace to live like someone who truly understands he will die one day, instead of someone who knows it but never moves a finger to prepare.<br><br><strong>1. Gambling on Salvation.</strong> Jesus is telling us that we should be prepared for our death. Nevertheless, a great number of people donÂ’t prepare at all. Although they believe that one day they will die and face judgment, they donÂ’t live according to what they believe. Their lives focus on worldly things and ideas. In a sense, you could say they are leaving their eternal salvation up to chance. It isnÂ’t that they have purposely chosen to do it this way. Instead, they have allowed themselves to be so distracted with day-to-day things that planning for eternity never even enters their minds. Their eternal salvation is the most important thing in their existence, but they fail to focus on it long enough to ensure that it will turn out the way they want. They have a choice in the matter, but they fail to make that choice.<br><br><strong>2. Living in the Midst of Shadows</strong>. In our everyday lives, the majority of things we deal with are passing. They exist today. They may be very important to us today, but the day will come when they wonÂ’t exist anymore. Even though we tend to forget about them, the eternal truths Â–Â– which we may contemplate in a moment of prayer or on a spiritual retreat Â–Â– are much more Â“realÂ” because they are eternal. Compared to them, the Â“realitiesÂ” of our everyday lives are like shadows or the forms of clouds Â– constantly changing. They may look like one thing now, but in a minute or two, they will look like something completely different. Before long, they will be gone and never return.<br><br><strong>3. In This World We Should Be Living Out of Suitcases.</strong> Sudden accidents and unexpected illness take people everyday. We know the same thing could happen to us, but we donÂ’t live as if we believe it. Knowing that we could die at any time, the intelligent thing to do would be to be ready Â– to live every day as if it were the last. Not morbidly, but intelligently. We have to remember this: if I am not willing to prepare myself for death today, knowing that it could happen at any time, when do I think I will start preparing? It doesnÂ’t suddenly happen that at some significant birthday we suddenly are gifted with the attitudes necessary to begin preparing. Few are given the grace, through a doctorÂ’s diagnosis or sometimes even a direct warning from God, to know in advance and begin to prepare. What would I do to prepare spiritually if I knew I were going to die tomorrow? Go to confession? Make a Holy Hour? Reach out to someone who needs my Christian witness, but whom I have been putting off?<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ:</strong> Dear Jesus, up until now, I have lived irresponsibly, not prepared for the possibility of death, but leaving my eternal salvation up to chance. Please help me to take seriously the fact that one day I will die. Grant me the grace, not just to believe it, but to live like I believe it, not with a morbid fascination with death, but the clear knowledge that it is coming and that it is the most definitive moment of my existence.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Whatever I would need to do spiritually if I knew I were to die tomorrow, I resolve to do today.<br></div>

There is a baptism with which I must be baptized, and how great is my anguish until it is accomplished! Do you think that I have come to establish peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. From now on a household of five will be divided, three against two and two against three; a father will be divided against his son and a son against his father, a mother against her daughter and a daughter against her mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer:</strong>Lord, open my mind and fill my heart in this meditation so that it helps me do your will today.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">ear Jesus, my heart is like firewood that wonÂ’t catch. Help me to light it with love for you, the same love that burned in your heart on the cross.<br><br><strong>1. We Should Not Only Be Warmed with Divine Love, But Burning with it.</strong> What is the fire that Jesus wants to bring to the world? It is the fire of his divine love. It is his plan to release the love that blazes in his own heart -- the boundless love shared by the persons of the Blessed Trinity -- to burn in the hearts of all people throughout the world. He sees the coldness of the world he has entered, that we are all in danger of spiritually freezing to death because of selfishness, vanity and sensuality. He wants to help us, so badly that he calls Â“anguishÂ” his desire to warm up the world with flames of love from his own heart. But he doesnÂ´t just want that. He wants every one of us to burn with love like he does. He wants us to help him set the world ablaze.<br><br><strong>2. Someone Died for Me</strong>. But before Christ can accomplish this, he must undergo a Â“baptism.Â” What baptism? His passion and death. The love in his heart will only be released by his death. Only then will it become available to us. Only then will we be able to blaze with that same love ourselves and set fire to those around us. We need to see the depth of his love for us by seeing him on the cross before we can accept it ourselves. Perhaps Jesus would have been able to release the love from his heart in some way without dying, but would we have understood that love as well? If he had just come and said, Â“I love you more than you can imagine,Â” and then returned to heaven, would we have really understood how deep that love could be? But because he came and died for us, we are able to go deeper and deeper in pondering a love that has no limits. Perhaps I have never had the experience of having someone love me so much that he or she gave their life for me. In Jesus, I discover someone who loved me that much. And he wouldnÂ’t have avoided it even if he could. No. He wanted to die for me, so that I would have a chance of understanding how much he loves me.<br><br><strong>3. Let Go of Your Security and Jump into the Fire</strong>. The love Jesus offers will divide the world. You would think that everyone would want to have a love like the love of Jesus. But our selfishness, vanity and sensuality are strong. WhatÂ’s more, they allow us to exert a kind of control over our lives. If we refuse to get rid of them, we can stay in control Â–Â– and we like to be in control. On the other hand, if we let ourselves burn with the same love that Jesus had, we will have to give up control to him. That love will take over our lives. It will only bring us good things. Now, the best thing that could happen to us would be for the love of Jesus to overwhelm us and allow us to help others to burn with this love for Jesus. Sometimes, they will cling to their selfishness, vanity and sensuality out of fear. That is why this love will divide the world because without wanting to, we will become signs to them of what they should be, and some will resent it. But we canÂ’t let that hold us back. Setting the world on fire with this love is what will save the world.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Dear Jesus, teach me about your love. Help me to walk with you today, loving as you love. Help my heart to see little by little the supreme goodness that your love offers me. Help me to get over my fear. Help me to lay aside the desire to control my life and everything around me. Help me to trust in your mercy and wisdom and surrender my life to you Â– surrender my life to the happiness of loving without limits. I know I cannot begin to love this way on my own. Only you can give me this perfect ability to love. Help me to love as you love, as if I borrowed your own heart to love with.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Today, I will look for opportunities to let others be in control, to let them choose what they prefer instead of insisting on what I prefer. And I will do it with as good an attitude as possible because to do it grudgingly would not be an act of love at all.<br></div>

You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky; why do you not know how to interpret the present time? "Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? If you are to go with your opponent before a magistrate, make an effort to settle the matter on the way; otherwise your opponent will turn you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the constable, and the constable throw you into prison. I say to you, you will not be released until you have paid the last penny."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord, please speak to me all that I need to hear for my salvation. Help me to make every necessary effort to receive all the graces you offer me in this meditation.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord, convince me that laziness in the spiritual life is not worth it, that any sacrifice in this life is preferable to ending up in purgatory.<br><br><strong>1. I WonÂ’t Believe Unless You Spell It Out for Me</strong>. Jesus is upset with the crowds because they have had plenty of proof that he is the Messiah and yet ask for more. Just as they can tell the weather from natural signs, they should be able to see he is the Messiah from the signs he performs. It was well known that the Messiah would come with power to heal and to drive out demons, and Jesus consistently does this. Not only does he perform miracles like the prophets did, but he goes way beyond. The prophets occasionally healed. Jesus heals many people every day. The prophets occasionally drove out a demon. Jesus drives them out frequently. Even though he doesnÂ’t declare it openly, because it is not yet time for his passion, the people should have all the proof they need. He has a hard time understanding their lack of faith that they should still ask for more proof.<br><br><strong>2. I Live My Life On Autopilot</strong>. Do I ignore the signs God works in my life? Do I fail to follow him because I am expecting something more from him? Many times our lives are so busy that we fail to see the hand of God in the events of each day. It is clear if we look for it. If we donÂ’t look, we will not see it clearly. We may catch a fleeting glimpse from time to time, but never gain a true appreciation of all that God does for us. Perhaps Jesus is a little upset with us and has a hard time understanding that after all he has done for us we still have a hard time accepting him and living like one of his followers. There is really no excuse for missing all that he does for us. There is no excuse for not living like someone who believes in him.<br><br><strong>3. The Fire of Purgatory Hurts, Too</strong>. What advice does Christ give? Live like someone who will have to settle accounts one day. We know that Jesus is speaking of purgatory here and not hell since no one gets out of hell and the punishment he speaks of here is not eternal. If we have any unsettled accounts with Christ, letÂ’s not wait until the Day of Judgment to settle them. On that day, full justice will be demanded and we will have to pay the full extent of what our sins are worth. How do we settle Â“on the way to the magistrateÂ”? Confession. If I have offended anyone, I ask their pardon, but all my sins, even my sins against other people, are first of all offenses against God. As much as I have offended someone by something I have done, I have offended God more, since he made that person in his own image. I settle accounts voluntarily now at the Tribunal of Mercy (confession) so as to avoid having to face the punishment my sins really deserve at the Tribunal of Justice (the Last Judgment).<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Dear Jesus, maybe I have always assumed that IÂ’m not such a bad person and I can count on going straight to heaven. Or maybe I didnÂ’t think I was really the kind of person who could live the holiness you call me to. In either case, I havenÂ’t taken your Gospel seriously. Help me to work hard in this life, to do your will every day and do it out of love for you, since that is the holiness you want me to live. Help me not to give into the kind of spiritual laziness that will land me in purgatory, because even though it will come to an end, it will be an agonizing separation from you, my true love.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: What is the habit or attitude in my life that more than any other has me Â“bound for PurgatoryÂ”? I will do something today that will help me break this habit or change this attitude.<br></div>

He said to them in reply, "Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were greater sinners than all other Galileans? By no means! But I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did! Or those eighteen people who were killed when the tower at Siloam fell on them Â– do you think they were more guilty than everyone else who lived in Jerusalem? By no means! But I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did!" And he told them this parable: "There once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard, and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none, he said to the gardener, Â´For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none. (So) cut it down. Why should it exhaust the soil?Â´ He said to him in reply, Â´Sir, leave it for this year also, and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it; it may bear fruit in the future. If not you can cut it down.Â´"<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>: Dear Jesus, help me to be receptive to what you want to teach me today. I know that I cannot live today well from a spiritual point of view without this time with you. Help me to spend it well.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord, help me not to be concerned only about immediate reward and punishment, but to work for my own salvation and that of others.<br><br><strong>1. Lord, If I Follow You, YouÂ’ll Make Everything Easy for Me, Right? </strong>We tend to make the same mistake as the people Jesus is speaking to. We expect God to dole out reward and punishment immediately. We donÂ´t understand why he doesnÂ´t strike down the sinner, especially when his sin hurts so many others. We donÂ´t understand why he doesnÂ´t reward us when we do whatÂ’s right, why he doesnÂ´t at least clear a path for us, keeping evil out of our lives. We donÂ´t understand why sometimes the good suffer and the wicked get away with the evil they do. We want immediate reactions from God.<br><br><strong>2. God Plays for the Highest Stakes Why doesnÂ´t God react more quickly to what we do in this life?</strong> The answer is simple. God is patient. He wants to give the sinner a chance to repent. He wants us to follow him not because of immediate reward or punishment, but because we love him. If someone asked what would be the worst thing that could happen to you, most of us would respond, Â“Death.Â” Wrong answer. The worst thing that could happen is that we could end up in Â“hellÂ”, separated eternally from our God. When that happens, not only do I lose, but God loses. We worry about the little evils of this life, but God is playing for higher stakes Â– my eternal salvation. He is willing to accept the ups and downs of our lives in order to save us in the end.<br><br><strong>3. IÂ’m Just a Pagan at Heart.</strong> ShouldnÂ´t I be more worried about the eternal salvation of my soul and the souls of others than about reward or punishment in this life? ShouldnÂ´t I be more concerned about the conversion of a sinner than about his punishment? We are really pagans at heart when we are more worried about enjoying the things of this life instead of working for the next. Jesus is telling us how far off our priorities are. He wants our top concern to be to our own salvation, not the comforts of this life. He wants us to seek the conversion of sinners, not their punishment. I need to convert my heart, to have a heart that sees things the way God sees them, from the viewpoint of whatÂ’s really in the balance Â– not my comfort or discomfort, but my eternal salvation.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Dear Jesus, instead of looking at things from the point of view of what is most important, my salvation and the salvation of others, I look at it from the point of view of my own pride and comfort, wanting you to reward me immediately for any small good thing I do, to overlook my failings, and to punish anyone who crosses me. Help me not to be so foolish. Help me to see the big picture like you do and give you the help you expect from me in your work for the salvation of souls.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Today I will try to accept whatever GodÂ’s will sends me: I will accept setbacks humbly and not look for my glory in whatever I accomplish. If there is something particular I can foresee today, either setback or glory, I will resolve to spend that moment as I should, not as I would like.<br></div>

"Two people went up to the Temple area to pray; one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector. The Pharisee took up his position and spoke this prayer to himself, Â´O God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity -- greedy, dishonest, adulterous -- or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week, and I pay tithes on my whole income.Â´ But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his chest and prayed, Â´O God, be merciful to me a sinner.Â´ I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord Jesus, thank you so much for your generosity in being with me today. Please accompany me during this time of prayer and speak to my heart the words that will help me to be a more effective instrument in your hands. My only desire is to please you. Lord, please flood my heart with your grace so that I may fully accomplish your will in my life.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord Jesus, at times, I pride myself on my human accomplishments and take the credit and glory for all of my good deeds. Please help me to live in an attitude of authentic humility, remembering that without your grace, nothing would be possible. Remind me again and again that you are the protagonist and I am merely an instrument of your love.<br><br><strong>1. Humility Is Truth</strong>. The first and fundamental truth that we need to remember is that God is our creator and we are his creatures. He is infinitely superior to us in all things, and this attitude should be reflected in our relations with him. But at the same time, there is also the truth that we are truly GodÂ’s sons and daughters, made in his image and likeness. Â“The Word of God returns insistently throughout this Mass to the value and necessity of humility. It is a very important lesson, which we must learn well if we truly desire to walk on the way of truth. In fact, humility is truth. The first fundamental truth is the absolute transcendence of God the Creator, manifested in the infinite goodness of Christ the Redeemer: this is the supreme and decisive reality, in the face of which the person feels both exalted as a son and abased as a lowly creature who can boast of nothingÂ” (Pope John Paul II, Homily, August 31, 1986).<br><br>2. <strong>Humility Demands Charity</strong>. We naturally tend to judge others and compare ourselves to them. But we forget that in GodÂ’s eyes, we have been given very much, so much more will be expected from us. How easy it is for us to fall into the temptation of comparing ourselves with Â“the rest of humanity.Â” We may be objectively good and holy people, we may faithfully uphold all of the Ten Commandments and live a life of rigorous prayer and abnegation, but we need to remember that we as Catholics have also been given much more than Â“the rest of humanity.Â” Because of this fact, God will hold us to a higher bar, especially in regard to our love. Â“I have never trusted a Christianity that places great stock in pious practices but neglects charity towards our neighbor, or the self-styled Â‘virtueÂ’ that consists in fulfilling religious or Church rules perfectly and then literally destroying peopleÂ’s reputations through criticism, detraction, or slander. Where charity and love are, God is there too. God cannot be where there is no charity, neither can authentic ChristianityÂ” (Fr Marcial Maciel, LC,Christ is my Life, no. 66).<br><br><strong>3. Humility Is the Foundation of Prayer</strong>. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states, Â“When we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will, or Â‘out of the depthsÂ’ of a humble and contrite heart? He who humbles himself will be exalted; humility is the foundation of prayer. Only when we humbly acknowledge that Â‘we do not know how to pray as we ought,Â’ are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. Â‘Man is a beggar before GodÂ’Â” (no. 2559). Without the constant and abundant flow of GodÂ’s grace in our lives, humility and all of the other virtues would be impossible. We can never take these graces for granted; much less can we demand them from God. We truly are beggars before God, beggars desperately in need of this spiritual nourishment, without which a Christ-like lifestyle will never be attainable. God is our creator, and we are his creatures. He is the Lord and King, and we are his subjects. This attitude of humility and submission must always be prevalent in our prayers. God can only bless a humble heart.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Thank you Christ for reminding me of my exalted dignity of being a Christian and at the same time of my lowliness as your creature. Help me to live an attitude of humility, conscious that you are the protagonist and I am a mere instrument of your love and grace. Help me not to get in your way or be afraid of lowering myself through a life of generous service and self-giving to all the souls that you have entrusted to me.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I will repeat this prayer often: Â“Jesus, meek and humble of heart, make my heart more like yours.Â”<br><br></div>
