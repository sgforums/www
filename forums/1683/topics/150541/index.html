            <div class='col-md body'>Today's Regnum Christi<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large"><strong>Putting Out into the Deep </strong></span></span><br>September 1, 2005<br><br>Fr Robert Presutti<br><br>Luke 5:1-11<br><br>While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret. He saw two boats there alongside the lake; the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets. Getting into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch." Simon said in reply, "Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower the nets." When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing. They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in danger of sinking. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said, "Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man." For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him and all those with him, and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men." When they brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed him.<br><br><img src="http://www.montereyconventionauthority.com/html_pages/images_monterey/dir_landscapes/thumbnails/fcSunset-boat-in-bay_jpg.jpg"><br><br><strong><br>Introductory prayer</strong>:  Holy Spirit, enable me to pray with love and fervor. Stir up in my heart a real longing for communion with you.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:  Lord Jesus, work in my life and make it the arena for your Gospel.<br><br><strong>1. Preparation for a Miracle. </strong>Jesus prepares the call of his first apostles by preaching a message intended not for them, but for the crowds that pressed him in on Lake Gennesaret. Jesus preaches to the crowd, steps into PeterÂ’s boat, and seems to be completely absorbed with the crowd while Peter and his companions look on and listen. Yet Jesus is preparing himself for the biggest catch of the day, not the crowd, but his first apostles. Jesus is the master of knowing what we need at every moment, even when it does not seem he is paying attention to us. Even his apparent forgetfulness of us is really part of his ongoing plan for our souls.<br><br><strong>2. Â“Put Out into the DeepÂ” </strong>. The best human assessment of the situation might lead the Â“prudentÂ” to judge Jesus as out of touch. Nothing human could have led Peter to put out into the deep. The nets had just been cleaned and stored, and the prime fishing hours Â– the night Â– had passed unsuccessfully. Humanly speaking, there was no reason to do what Jesus asked. Yet, PeterÂ’s faith had been prepped and primed by his listening to ChristÂ’s teaching the crowd, and ChristÂ’s word had already begun to work in his heart. Peter puts the oars back in the water, unfurls the nets and lets them down, in JesusÂ’ name. ChristÂ’s command is a prelude to a wonderful miracle. And the miracle comes as a result of obedience in faith to ChristÂ’s command. Faith in ChristÂ’s word makes the miracle. Without faith, there can be no miracle.<br><br>3. A Lot of Big Fish. Peter had never had such a big catch of big fish. And he would never have another one like it, till after the Resurrection when Christ would repeat the miracle. Christ reveals himself as the most remarkable fisherman ever to walk the shores of Gennessaret. He is the fullness not only of the divine but also of the human. Christ brings us not only to the fulfillment of our supernatural vocation. He also leads us to the fullness of humanity.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>:  Jesus, as you step into the boat of my life, you ask me to put out into the deep. Teach me trust in you. Teach me how to put out into the deep in your name.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I will avoid all complaining today, and do all things Â“in ChristÂ’s name.Â”<br></div>
