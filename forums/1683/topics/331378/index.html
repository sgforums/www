            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi folks, i have a blogging service website (Cathopologist.com) that is currently under a phase. It was originally setup for Catholics to blog in a family-friendly and Catholic-friendly environment. I am however, thinking of changing that to something more beneficial for Catholics and Eastern Churches (including the Orthodox churches) members around the world.<br><br>Okay, here is my plan. The website will be an online magazine which will will feature the best chosen articles from Byzantine Forum members. Articles can be about anything. Such as:<br>[b]Catholic-Orthodox ecumenical communion<br>Catholic-Anglican ecumenical communion<br>Islam in today's society<br>Catholic politicians, etc.[/b]<br>Well, you get the picture. What we do not want are dissents of the Magisterium or nit-picking with our Orthodox brethren, as the Orthodox church members are welcome to participate also, but the same rules apply. Ecumenical dialogues are the best when differences of each tradition and doctrine and dogma are respected. What we dislike is to quarrel over our past misfortunes.<br><br>Articles chosen will be published on our website. All articles will be screened by a panel of editors which will include myself and my wife. We will make the final decisions and publish the best ones submitted . The online version will have free with excerpts of the articles. The PDF version (downloadable) will have a *minimum charge. They will be in hardcopies in high gloss print paper (hoefully) sponsored by Hewlitt Packard. The hardcopy version can be distributed in churches or given out in the streets. It's your choice of distribution.<br><br>We are currently looking for volunteer writers, editors, photographers and [color:#FF6666]*[/color]webmasters who are willing to take up to their tasks. So here's your chance to reach out to the world, preaching the Good News and dispelling misinformation about Catholicism. Anyone can be a writer but please bear in mind that photographers, editor and webmasters must have proven experience/portfolio as part of the application.<br><br>[color:#FF6666]*[/color]Webmasters will have the responsibility of updating the site daily (whenever needed). Webmasters must be good in design and a person of good standing with proof of experience/portfolio.<br><br>*Editors must have a good command of the English, Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and Malay languages. Bilingual editors are preferred but not necessary. As our main printing language is English. The other languages may come in handy one day, hence the thought. Its preferable there be at least two editors from all countries.<br><br>[b]Editors: At least 2<br>Junior Editors: At least 2<br>Webmasters: At least 2<br>Photographers: Unlimited<br>Writers: Unlimited[/b]<br><br>Please remember, our sole purpose is to spread the Good News to anyone and everyone. So please do not misuse the website for other propaganda or mischief. We also urge members to be mindful in the way you write about certain issues. As soon as the emails start pouring in, we will allocate tasks ASAP.<br><br>This magazine will be for everyone, for the people, by the people - They must be members of Apostolic churches of course.<br><br>Remember, although we charge for our PDF downloads, half of its earnings will go to keeping the site alive. Whatever is left over will be given to charities or organizations of our choice (preferably Catholic). But we are also open to the feedback of the magazine's contributors.<br><br>So is anyone interested? Please vote or you can send in feedback at webmaster@cathopologist.com if you wish to remain anonymous or if you have further questions.<br><br>[color:#FF6666]*[/color]Please note there are no cash awards. This service is entirely voluntary for the purpose of educating non-Catholics. The authors name will be published, of course (exceptions for those who wish to remain anonymous).<br><br>For those who are ready to submit your article, please write them in Word Format or Text Format.<br><br>Send them to: articles@cathopologist.com<br><br>Just in case, "cathopologist" means Catholic Apologist.</p></div>
