How should men and women worship? Who is worthy of worship? How should men and women pray, and when, and where... and why?<br><br>Yesterday, here in Istanbul, in a remarkable way, these questions were highlighted - if not answered - by two very different moments of Pope Benedict XVI's historic trip to Turkey.<br><br>The first "moment" was the solemn, majestic, three-hour Orthodox liturgy (a Mass according to the ancient Byzantine rite) filled with solemn chants and gestures.<br><br>Benedict attended the liturgy yesterday morning to celebrate the Feast of St. Andrew (November 30) at the Orthodox Patriarchal Cathedral of St. George in the Phanar district of Istanbul - the same place where he prayed together with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew two days ago.</div>

He would know very well that the modern media is an enemy of the Catholic Church, and there would be no reason for him to purposely provide ammunition for the enemy.<br><br>You should also invite your friend to read the full text of the Pope's speech at the www.chiesa website.  The Pope <strong>did not</strong> make 'that kind of comment about Muslims'.  As a scholar, he was quoting someone else in another historical context.  Assuming that your Muslim friend has some basic tertiary-level education, this kind of distinction should not be too subtle for her to appreciate.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If one were living in the Medieval Ages, one would immediately be lulled into the sense that the Muslims were out to conquer Europe and try to influence people into converting into Islam by imposing a tax on non-believers. The Byzantine Empire back then was under constant attack by Muslims for hundreds of years until it fell.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, that as usual people have selective memory. Whereas the Koran says no, the people following the Koran decided to adopt religious superiority and convert the non-believers. There was perhaps only a few Islamic empires back then who did follow the principle of tolerance as much as they could but the zealots always say nay.</div>
