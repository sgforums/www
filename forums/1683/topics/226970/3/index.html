The commission declared that Catholics can fulfill their Sunday obligation by attending Masses offered by SSPX priests. If the priests of the SSPX were in schism, the Ecclesia Dei commission would presumably not allow Catholics to frequent their Masses, since they would be allowing Catholics to worship outside the Church. This indicates that SSPX priests are not in fact in schism (for example, Catholics could not fulfill their Sunday obligation by attending liturgies offered by the schismatic priests of the Eastern Orthodox churches). The same commission has said that, so long as Catholics attend SSPX chapels out of their devotion to the Traditional Latin Mass (and not because they want to separate themselves from the Roman Pontiff), such conduct is not sinful. </blockquote>It looks like you are referring to this letter<br><br><a href="http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm</a><br><br>What about this statement in the letter:<br><br><blockquote>We have already told you that we cannot recommend your attendance at such a Mass </blockquote>Is it not unambigous that Ecclesia Dei Commission (EDC) does not support Catholics attending the SSPX Masses?<br><br>You see, what this letter purports to do is to address technical questions - for example, it specifically mentions "in the strict sense" regarding fulfilling sunday obligation. But, brought into the larger context of the disobedience of the SSPX (which Pope John Paul II has himself declared), and also in the letter it mentions,<br><br><blockquote> 1.) The priests of the Society of St. Pius X are validly ordained, but they are suspended from exercising their priestly functions </blockquote>Also in an earlier letter, EDC says<br><br>[ur]http://www.unavoce.org/Protocol539-99.htm[/url]<br><br><blockquote><br>The difficulty is that the longer they frequent these chapels, the more likely it is that they will slowly imbibe the schismatic mentality which stands in judgement of the Church and refuses submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him. If that becomes the case, then it would seem that they adhere to the schism and are consequently excommunicated. For these reasons this Pontifical Commission cannot encourage you to frequent the chapel of the Society of St. Pius X. </blockquote>Clearly, the EDC does not encourage Catholics to attend SSPX Masses at all, never mind that it is not sinful.<br><br>It is a dangerous thing to pick one part of the matter (attending SSPX masses are not sinful) and ignore the rest (The church does not encourage you to attend SSPX Masses because of the schismatic mentality of the SSPX).

If SSPX priests join the society out of their devotion to the Traditional Latin Mass and do not intend to sever their union with the Holy Father, it is difficult to conclude that such men are schismatics. Most men become SSPX priests because of their devotion to tradition and the fact that their diocesan bishops would never let them celebrate the Traditional Latin Mass (which they have every right to do according to St. Pius VÂ’s Quo Primum), or put unjust restrictions upon it (which is against the directives of John Paul II). How can such priests be in schism?<br><br>The EO church is no longer considered schismatics even though they reject papal authority but the SSPX priest who consider the Pope as the Vicar of Christ, follow the church infallible teachings and more importantly wishes to stick to Tradition are schismatics. Ur logic is flawed.<br><br>The Holy See regard its founder as Schismatics but not its priest if they do not sever ties with the Holy See. Lay ppl who attend thier masses are not in SIN if their parish do not have it.<br><br>I REPEAT I DO NOT SYMPATHISE WITH THEM AT ALL.

            <div class='col-md body'>Icemoon, there are many reasons why Bishops are not so generous with the Traditional Mass. I can provide u with a few:<br><br>1.

Many priests have emotional baggage against the traditional Mass. You saw for yourself how complicated it was.<br><br>3. Since it is so complicated, priests who know the new rite only, need to go and undergo training on how to do the traditional Mass. Sometimes they can't because they're so busy!

Those excommunications would not have been lifted if those six Catholics were attending Masses offered by schismatic priests. Moreover, if the SSPX priests are Â“suspended,Â” and thus still subject to the ChurchÂ’s disciplinary laws, they cannot be schismatics who are outside the Church. You cannot be outside the Church and still subject to her canon law. This is a legal impossibility.<br><br>OK i agree. My knowledge on the SSPX is rather limited. I do belive however the Masses they conduct is valid as any priest can conduct a tridentine mass. I feel there isnt a problem if u go to a SSPX church just to attend tidentine mass (if u parish do not have one). It is obvious that we need further guidance from the Church on this matter.<br><br>Can someone enlighten me on the pro-multis? i heard POpe Benedict XVI is changing the Novus Ordo to meet it....<br></div>

Take an analogy - you may not be a drug addict yet, but taking small amounts of drugs will slowly lead u to become one.<br><br>Give you another example. If a religious order wants to set up shop in a diocese, it has to seek the permission of the Bishop to do so. But the SSPX does not care.

Great to hear that, and please keep on reading up more about your faith, as well as praying for your priests and asking God for His graces to help you in your faith.<br><br>We already know what to do when you want to attend a tridentine Mass. Ecclesia Dei says, don't go to the SSPX. Those who attended the recent FSSP Mass in Singapore patiently waited 16 months for it, knowing that it is more important to maintain unity with the Church. If you have the means, you can fly to Hong Kong - they have it once every 2 weeks. <a href="http://tridentine.catholic.org.hk" rel="nofollow">HK Tridentine Mass Community</a> I saved up in order to do so earlier this year.<br><br><blockquote>Can someone enlighten me on the pro-multis? i heard POpe Benedict XVI is changing the Novus Ordo to meet it.... </blockquote>here <a href="http://www.adoremus.org/Arinze_ProMultis.html" rel="nofollow">Arinze on Pro Multis</a><br><br>Essentially, this means that, any new translation has to translate "pro multis" as "for many".
