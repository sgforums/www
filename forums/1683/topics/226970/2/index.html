The consecration words are different like the pro multis. In USA, there is rock music and dancing priest and even pizza communion once haha. The entire format is different and now there is communion minister despite the fact only consecrated ahnds can touch the flesh of Christ. Removal of st Micahel prayer. Alot of modern teachings.<br><br>3) I dont think its possible. The old rite has little participation. People just sing a few hymns and the rest of the time are supposed to adore the Lord presence.<br><br>4) Haha this si quite common.

Not abortion or war, but communion in the hand. - Mother Theresa<br><br>According to Memoriale Domini (promulgated under the pontificate of Paul VI in 1969), the only time Communion in the hand is permissible is when the practice (which the pope calls a Â“contrary usageÂ”) has already been established (usually through disobedience), and only then where the appropriate episcopal conference approves the usage by a secret 2/3 vote, which must then be reviewed and approved by the Holy See.<strong> Communion on the tongue (sub lingua) is still the universal law of the Church</strong>.<br><br>John Paul II affirmed the foregoing. In Dominicae Cenae, the pope said: "<strong>To touch the sacred species and to distribute them with their own hands is a privilege of the ordainedÂ”</strong> (No. 11). In Inaestimabile Donum, the pope said: Â“<strong>It is not permitted that the faithful should themselves pick up the consecrated bread and the sacred chalice, still less that they should hand them from one to another</strong>Â” (No. 9). In 2004, John Paul IIÂ’s Congregation for Divine Worship issued Redemptionis Sacramentum which addressed certain matters concerning the celebration of the Eucharist. The document reiterated the warnings of Memoriale Domini by stating: Â“If there is a risk of profanation, then Holy Communion should not be given in the hand to the faithful.Â”<br><br>I believe that the universal law of Communion sub lingua should be enforced more vigoroously, and Communion in the hand abolished, for the love of Christ and His Church.<br><br>His Holiness, Myself<br></div>

I held ur view till i read what the Holy See said.<br><br>Tecnically the SSPX is not in schism and the Church agrees with that. To be in schism, one must renounce ties with the Roman Pontiff. However the SSPX recognises him as the Vicar of Christ but reject the novelties of Vatican 2. Their founder Levbre was excommunicated for ordainig 4 bishops without vatican approval which was a Schismatic act. The SSPX as a whole is not in schism.<br><br><strong>The Ecclesia Dei commission that John Paul II instituted </strong>has said the same. <strong>The commission declared that Catholics can fulfill their Sunday obligation by attending Masses offered by SSPX priests</strong>. If the priests of the SSPX were in schism, the Ecclesia Dei commission would presumably not allow Catholics to frequent their Masses, since they would be allowing Catholics to worship outside the Church. This indicates that SSPX priests are not in fact in schism (for example, Catholics could not fulfill their Sunday obligation by attending liturgies offered by the schismatic priests of the Eastern Orthodox churches). <strong>The same commission has said that, so long as Catholics attend SSPX chapels out of their devotion to the Traditional Latin Mass (and not because they want to separate themselves from the Roman Pontiff), such conduct is not sinful</strong>.<br><br></div>

SSPX isnt abt doctrines but rather canon laws....<br><br>For modern-day Church documents, <strong>there is no need for speculation as to which are ex cathedra, because the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith can be consulted directly on this question</strong>. For example, after Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter Ordinatio Sacerdotalis (On Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone) was released in 1994, a few commentators speculated that this might be an exercise of papal infallibility (for an example, see [3]). In response to this confusion, the Church's magisterium has unambiguously stated, on at least three separate occasions [4] [5] [6], that Ordinatio Sacerdotalis was not an ex cathedra teaching, although the content of this letter has been taught infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium</div>
