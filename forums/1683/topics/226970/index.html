Onli some of thier bishops are truly in schism. All of them accept Papal authrotiy so its okay and they comply with canon law haha. I did some research on it haha. Their formation is wholly legal but thier consecration of 4 bishop in 1988 was a schismatic act.

Give credit to him la...Father of Protestantism eh<br><br>2) To quote:<br><br>According to the 1983 code of canon law (promulgated by John Paul II), illicitly consecrating a bishop is not a schismatic act. That is most likely why the Holy See gave Lefebvre a canonical warning only about excommunication, not schism, before he consecrated the bishops. LefebvreÂ’s action seems to be one of disobedience, but not schism.<strong> Disobedience of a papal command does not give rise to schism; the person must actually deny the popeÂ’s authority to be guilty of the crime of schism</strong>. I understand that Lefebvre Â– unlike a true schismatic - never denied Pope John Paul IIÂ’s authority as the Vicar of Christ. In fact, he believed his actions were actually serving the pope and the Church at large. Nevertheless, because the pope is the supreme legislator, <strong>we are obligated to conclude that LefebvreÂ’s consecration of the bishops was a schismatic act because the pope said so.</strong> Only another pope could overrule him.<br><br>The issue is not as clear with respect to the priests of the SSPX and the faithful who attend their Masses. Certainly, the SSPX priests are not automatically schismatic or excommunicated simply because of the actions of Lefebvre. Lefebrve's actions are not imputed to the other SSPX priests either canonically or theologically<br><br>The problem with John Paul II's motu proprio is that it never provided a definition of "formal adherence" to the schism. Presumably, if a person formally supports Lefebvre's disobedience and attends the SSPX chapel as a manifestation of that support (or a priest joins the SSPX to manifest such support), that person would presumably be "formally adhering" to Lefebrvre's schism. <strong>However, if a person merely attends Mass at an SSPX chapel out of love for the Traditional Latin Mass, including the piety it fosters and the theological clarity it provides, then such a person would not be in schism</strong>.<br><br>The Ecclesia Dei commission that John Paul II instituted has said the same. <strong>The commission declared that Catholics can fulfill their Sunday obligation by attending Masses offered by SSPX priests.</strong> If the priests of the SSPX were in schism, the Ecclesia Dei commission would presumably not allow Catholics to frequent their Masses, since they would be allowing Catholics to worship outside the Church. This indicates that SSPX priests are not in fact in schism (for example, Catholics could not fulfill their Sunday obligation by attending liturgies offered by the schismatic priests of the Eastern Orthodox churches). <strong>The same commission has said that, so long as Catholics attend SSPX chapels out of their devotion to the Traditional Latin Mass (and not because they want to separate themselves from the Roman Pontiff), such conduct is not sinful.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There is nothing wrong wif attending Tridentine Mass by SSPX priest.

I have onli seen a 60min clip in youtube and enjoyed it<br><br>2) Obviously. A SSPX priest is valid, the tridentine mass is valid. The protestant service even if it is conducted by the Archbishop of Cantebury is not valid haha. A SSPX member is still catholic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I enjoyed the Tridentine Mass even though it was after a day at work. Even though I don't understand Latin. Hmm ..<br><br>Actually there is something I don't understand. What was the real reason why they changed the Tridentine Mass to the current one? If it is because of language, they could have just changed the language right?<br><br>Furthermore the Tridentine Mass is what it should have been - priest facing the same direction as the congregation, holy communion received kneeling and on the lips etc.</div>
