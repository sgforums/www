              <p>I think no one has a right to pass judgement on your views as none of us were in your situation there and then. </p>
              <p>I guess when we ourselves are scrutinized by our fellow men one day, there will be the ones who sing praises of us, while others who criticize us. The truth is, we are all humans, and as humans, are anywhere near perfect. There are days where we feel great about ourselves. and days where we are totally off the line. There are times we decide to look past everything, others where we are just anally retentive. As such, there is no just one single narrative that can define one person, rather how we choose to remember individuals. In your situation, you met with his ugly side, and as such remember him in that respect. For me, I met him under different circumstances, and as such see him in a different light. </p>
              <p>As such, I hope you would not feel bitter about your situation, rather, just pray that you will have the strength to look past your experience and journey towards building your faith in God.</p>

              <p>also.. i'd like to point out something i think no one remembers.</p>
              <p>that in all experiences we have in life.. good or bad, God allows it. nothing can happen to us unless God, who loves us so, allows it.</p>
              <p>so if God allows it, i think it's a good idea to pray and ask God, what is He trying to tell us in this situation, because God's plan for us is never to harm us, so there must be something good for us in this situation.</p>
              <p>just a thought, ninja, anything u need to talk about, just pm me ya? i need to go off le.</p>

              <p>the leader should serve the people under him, that's God's hierachy. and he did a bad job serving you, but that's because he's human.</p>

              <p>unfortunately, there is no "should" in forgiveness. nobody who has his face slapped, automatically feels that he "should" forgive. Given that, some forgives easier than others, but there are those who just can't let go. they need God's love and grace to overcome that.</p>
              <p>And it helps if the offending party initiate to ask for forgiveness for any trespasses, and apologise. <strong>A christian is called to be a peacemaker</strong>, something i just recently learnt.. honeybunz would do well to remember that.</p>
              <p>i should know how ninja feels, because i'm someone who naturally bears grudges too. but in the end, will forgive la, but it takes a long while to continuously remember to forgive again and again, everytime i remember the incident.</p>
              <p>and of course, i forgive easier, when i hear the word "sorry". =)</p>

              <p>unfortunately, there is no "should" in forgiveness. nobody who has his face slapped, automatically feels that he "should" forgive. Given that, some forgives easier than others, but there are those who just can't let go. they need God's love and grace to overcome that.</p>
              <p>And it helps if the offending party initiate to ask for forgiveness for any trespasses, and apologise. <strong>A christian is called to be a peacemaker</strong>, something i just recently learnt.. honeybunz would do well to remember that.</p>
              <p>i should know how ninja feels, because i'm someone who naturally bears grudges too. but in the end, will forgive la, but it takes a long while to continuously remember to forgive again and again, everytime i remember the incident.</p>

              <p>heh heh! did you know, that forgive AND FORGET is not in the bible?</p>
              <p>the forgetting part is a burden we put on ourselves.</p>
              <p>Jesus says, "Forgive, just as I have forgiven you"</p>
              <p>not</p>
              <p>"Forget, just as I have forgotten you".</p>
              <p>Jesus only wants us to forgive, why? because we can't forget, it's totally impossible, because it is a significant event in our life. it's a hurt, and it's significant and it goes deep.</p>
              <p>But as we forgive, again and again and again... God takes away the sting of the incident, and when we remember, we don't feel the pain and angry and frustration anymore.</p>
              <p>so don't burden yourself with "extra logic", just stick with the bible's way la. just keep forgive! =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but, back to the topic, well, it's apparent that ninja has trouble forgiving, so being the more mature christian, they should initiate apology to help facilitate ninja.</p>
              <p>unless, all those fancy talk about using the soft method to show love to your neighbours are just that. fancy talks.</p>
