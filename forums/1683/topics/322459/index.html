            <div class='col-md body'><p>My parents had the distinct opportunity of picking him up from the Bishop's house a few times for our parish events when he was still the archbishop, and they have nothing but praise for the man's character. Even though he was bishop, there was no airs about the man and he spoke to everyone he met with the upmost humility and sincerity. My dad described him as a gentle father figure who possessed a unique sense of humor (still remember his homilies where he went true/false on everything!) and to show his appreciation for giving him a ride, he actually presented two rosaries to my parents - of which they still pray with fervently. Now, I'm certain those two rosaries extend a greater significance to them - as it reminds them of how a great bishop Gregory Yong was and how much he contributed to building and leading the Catholic Church here in Singapore and I'm certain that like my parents and myself, His Grace would be missed by all of us, but we take comfort that he is now with the almighty. </p></div>

              </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>This afternoon, the Roman Catholic Archbishop Emeritus Gregory Yong passed away peacefully at Joseph’s Home, Singapore. Here’s a biography of the shepherd.</strong></p><strong>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Gregory Yong Sooi Ngean (Chinese: æ�¨ç‘žå…ƒ) D.D. D.C.L was the Roman Catholic Archbishop Emeritus of Singapore. From May 20, 1925 - June 28, 2008.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Born in Taiping, Malaya on May 20, 1925, he was educated at St. George’s Institution and St. Michael’s Institution in Ipoh, Malaya. In January 1941, he entered the Minor Seminary and in 1944 graduated to the Major Seminary. He was ordained in 1951 and posted to the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Singapore. In 1953, he left for studies in Rome where he was conferred a Doctorate in Canon Law, the very first local priest to achieve the distinction. Back in Singapore in 1956, he was sent as assistant Parish Priest to the Church of the Sacred Heart. In the following year, he joined the teaching stuff of the Minor Seminary. After a short stint as assistant Parish Priest at the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, he was appointed to a teaching position in the Major Seminary, again, the very first local priest to be thus honoured. On July 1, 1968, he was consecrated Bishop, and took over the Diocese Of Penang from Bishop Francis Chan who had died on October 27, 1967.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">On February 3, 1977, he was appointed to succeed Archbishop Michel Olcomendy as the first of the local clergy to lead the Church in Singapore. On April 2, 1977, he was officially installed as the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore. He was the second Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Singapore, which was formed in 1972 when the Archdiocese of Malacca-Singapore split and held the office until retiring on October 14, 2000.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">He died on June 28, 2008 at St Joseph’s Home, Singapore.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">As announced earlier during Sunset Mass this evening, his body is lying in wake at <a href="http://www.stjh.org.sg/index.html"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>St Joseph’s Home, Singapore</strong></span></em></a>. <a href="http://www.stjh.org.sg/contact.html"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Map Location</span></em></a>.</p>

              <p>He's a church leader, i'd be ticked off if i was in ninja's shoes too.</p>
              <p>and yeah, i certainly can blame him. because if he's going to preach turning the other cheek, or preaching about being nice to your neighbours, and enemies, but can't or won't do what he preach.</p>
              <p>then.. well, you figure out the rest i guess.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you really want to know although I was baptised and had my holy communion I was never confirmed as a catholic and was brought up by my grandparents in an Islamic enviroment.16 years ago.At that time I got a letter from father Dunn to go to see Father Kang at the Good Shepherd for an Interview .....which would later turn out to be a Mas Selamat type of Interrogation.Arch Bishop Gregory Yong was particularly pissed as I didnt even know who he was at that time and didnt give him the proper greetings.Throughout the session we didnt exchange good words,I think the words that really ticked him off was when I said 'I want to have a second chance at worshipping GOD' That was a long time ago but the interview is still fresh in my mind.Last year my sister told me not to feel angry at the Church because of two servants of GOD and from her  I also learned that he had retired and Father Kang had gone to Jail for stealing millions $$$ church money (hope he too have his second chance).My sisters are praying that someday I would go back to the Catholic faith but like I said I was never a Catholic in the first place.</p></div>

              <p>hmm..</p>
              <p>what do you mean mas selamat interrogation.</p>
              <p>and why did u say u want a 2nd chance to worship God? that part i don't get.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and.. i guess.. it's also time to try to forgive them. not easy i know, i was hurt by a church leader too, but it's so funny that.. they don't even know that i was angry at him. i found that out when i decided to forgive him during church camp, and talked to him about it, and we prayed together. it felt really good to drop the burden.</p>
              <p>he really didn't know i was angry at all.</p>
              <p>so.. i guess.. what i'm trying to say is that.. you're only hurting yourself actually, by unforgiveness, k?</p>
              <p>take time to talk to God about it, i'm sure God understands how you feel, let Him heal you. =)</p>
