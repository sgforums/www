            <div class='col-md body'>Any of you Catholics, during your younger days or even now, thought of becoming a Priest, Monks or Nuns (or any Protestants ever wanted to become Pastors and Reverend)?<br><br>When I was schooling, I ever thought very seriously about becoming a nun, but couldn't quite decide which order to join.  I thought of Camelite, cuz I was inspired by The Sound of Music.  I also liked Good Shepherd cuz I saw the works that they do at hospitals, Marymount and their convent in Katong.  When I helped out in Little Sisters for the Poor, I was impressed by them.<br><br>Every day, I attended Mass, just to be close to the Lord.  When I saw the Priest celebrating Mass, I was so envious cuz the Church wouldn't accept female priests.<br><br>I ding dong here and there, comtemplating.... Before I know... I started to meet guys, involved in relationship, received marriage proposals, started working &amp; moved up corporate ladder etc etc... that I totally stopped thinking about religious life anymore, cuz I am too comfortable in the secular life now.  I just hope that I dun get too distracted by the worldly stuff and distant myself from the Lord.<br><br></div>
