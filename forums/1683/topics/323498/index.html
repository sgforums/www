              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>It appears that we are all incorrect on both counts. There is
              both a Particular Judgement and a Final Judgement. Every person
              undergoes Particular Judgement upon death, and is thereby judged to
              proceed into Heaven, Purgatory, or Hell, where they will spend
              their time until the day of the Final Judgement. At the Final
              Judgement, every person - whether dead or alive - is brought before
              Jesus Christ to be perfectly judged. While the living are delivered
              their judgement, the souls of dead shall be reunited with their
              bodies and continue to be sent to the domain they were previously
              judged to enter - Heaven or Hell. Those in Purgatory at the time of
              the Final Judgement are directly released into Heaven.</p>
              <p>In particular, the concept of a 'soul slumber' till Final
              Judgement is a heresy hailing from the domain of the
              Hypnopsychites. A 'kingdom of death' for the souls would roughly
              translate to a state of temporary destruction, and that again is a
              heresy, this time of the Thnetnopsychites. These deny the existence
              of the Particular Judgement upon death, and are hence contradictory
              to the Church's theology. For a possible explanation for the 14
              hours of 'sleep', one might like to look at the Eastern Orthodox
              position that Particular Judgement occurs on the fortieth day after
              death, offering a short term of so-called 'slumber', but not in the
              indefinite sense that the Hypnopsychites hold to. Alternatively,
              one might also like to draw parallels with the teaching that the
              seven days of creation were not literal 24-hour periods, but rather
              eras. Is it not possible that a few minutes in divinity could well
              occupy 14 hours on earth?</p>

              <p>What about Job what I wrote I have found to be the belief of
              Jews as well. What about what Martha said to Jesus when Jesus spoke
              that Lazarus was alive.</p>
              <p>Martha replied something like this: I know that the Lord will
              rise him up as He rise the deads on the last day.</p>
              <p>What you wrote in the bold text where in the bible does it say
              so?</p>
              <p>The dead are not in divinity. The deads are not aware of time.
              Jesus mentioned the kingdom of death many many times. So you were
              saying the dead slept in divinity. If sheÂ  were in heaven why
              did she said she was sleeping? So in heaven we all would be
              sleeping. That's illogical and nonsense.</p>
              <p>Soul slumber is not a heresy. It's biblical and it's Jewish.
              What you wrote is heresy if not based on the bible. So pls point
              where in the bible you wrote what you wrote. I will poin again
              where in the bible I wrote what I wrote.</p>

              <p><em>I saw thrones, and sitting on those thrones were the ones

              people who had their heads cut off because they had told about
              Jesus and preached God's message. They were the sameones who hadn't
              worshipped the beast or the idol, and they had refused to let its
              mark be put on their hands or foreheads. They will come to life and
              rule with Christ for 1000 years.</em></p>
              <p><em>These people are the first to be raised to life, and they
              are especially blessed and holy. The second death has no power over
              them. They will be priests for God and Christ and will rule with
              them for 1000 years.</em></p>

                          Finally, Christ's Resurrection - and the risen Christ himself is the principle
                          and source of our future resurrection: "<strong>Christ has been raised from the
                          dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep</strong>. . . For as in Adam all

                          Christ lives in the hearts of his faithful while they await that fulfilment. In
                          Christ, Christians "have tasted. . . the powers of the age to
                          come"<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><sup><a name="-TG" href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1S.HTM#%24TG">529</a></sup></span> and their lives are swept up by Christ into the heart of
                          divine life, so that they may "live no longer for themselves but for him
                          who for their sake died and was raised."<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><sup><a name="-TH" href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1S.HTM#%24TH">530</a></sup></span></em></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Now it is clear that the dead is in a state likened to sleeping but the question is when will the Christian be risen? After 3 days? Or on the last day or end of time?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">According to Mark, Matthew, Luke and John Jesus promised His believers that He would rise them up on the last day. So it takes the Lord for us to be risen from our death. And Jesus our Lord will raise us up on the last day.</p>

              <p>I'm going to use the same quote you took from the Book of John:</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><em>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The he[Jesus] told them, â<strong>Our friend </strong></em><strong>Lazarus is asleep</strong><em>, and Iâm going there to wake him up.â</em></p>
              <p><span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span> <em><em>They replied, âLord, if heâs asleep, heâll get better.â </em><strong>Jesus really meant that Lazarus was dead, but they thought he was talking only about sleep.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span> Then Jesus told them plainly, âLazarus is dead! Iâm glad that I wasnât there, because now youâll have a chance to put your faith in me. Letâs go to him.</em></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Surely, now, we can clearly see that even Jesus uses sleep as a metaphor to allude to true death. Keep this fact of scripture in mind, and the we will find that all is consistent with the teachings of the Church, inspired by both scripture and tradition. Indeed, we are all definitely dead even after our Particular Judgement - our souls are merely sent to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory where we will spendÂ the rest of our time till Final Judgement. All this while, we are considered dead, noÂ more.Â Yet, come Final Judgement, we will be reunited with our physicalÂ vessels so as to be truly alive once more. At this point, then we are brought to life in fulfilment of the scriptures. To this end, we now all die in the hope of rising again. If that may ring familiar, it is because that is what we say in the Liturgy of the Eucharist.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Of course, as of now, we might have a concern on the issue ofÂ cremated bodies being incapable of being brought backÂ -Â I'll probably have to read up more about that. Nonetheless, keep in mind that conventionally buried bodies -Â save those of the holiest saints -Â are whithered and hence to a degree damaged, and yet are within the power of God to be restored. It would then follow thatÂ cremated and completelyÂ destroyed bodies are merely more greatly damaged.</p>

              <p>No this is where you got it wrong. Our soul would descend to the world of the dead or what Jesus referred to as the kingdom of death. Here our soul that is us will be in a state likened to sleeping. The dead has no awareness of themselves, of God and of time. Really there is no life in death. The kingdom of death is a very very quiet and dark place. No life!</p>
              <p>Before the soul enters either eternal damnation(the second death), purgatory or heaven the sould needs to be raised up from death first. It's ridiculous to think that we could still be living without the needÂ  of our Lord to raise up us. ThisÂ  is actually can be called heresy .Â  That one believes that one soul would remain active after death is actually heretical. The believers of Christ await in the hope of the Lord our savior to raise him or her from his or her death.</p>

              <p>I'm going to use the same quote you took from the Book of
                  John:</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><em>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The
                  he[Jesus] told them, âOur friend</em> Lazarus is asleep<em>, and Iâm going there to wake
                  him up.â</em></p>
              <p><span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span> <em><em>They replied, âLord, if heâs asleep, heâll get
                  better.â</em> <strong>J</strong>esus really meant that Lazarus was dead, but
                  they thought he was talking only about sleep.</em></p>
              <p><em><span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span> Then Jesus told them plainly, âLazarus is dead! Iâm glad that I
                  wasnât there, because now youâll have a chance to put your faith in
                  me. Letâs go to him.</em></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Surely, now, we can clearly see that even Jesus uses sleep as a
                  metaphor to allude to true death. Keep this fact of scripture in
                  mind, and the we will find that all is consistent with the
                  teachings of the Church, inspired by both scripture and tradition.
                  Indeed, we are all definitely dead even after our Particular
                  Judgement - our souls are merely sent to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory
                  where we will spendÂ the rest of our time till Final Judgement.</p>

              <p>No Jesus said that the dead Lazarus was asleep to make known that to God Lazarus' soul didn't perish(or any soul belonging to any dead). He is now in a state likened to sleeping. Like I said the dead would not be aware of themselves, of God, of time or of anything. It's quite like being sleeping but there is one big difference that in sleep there is always perpetual life.</p>
              <p>Death is no life! To think that we can still be active in the next life immediately after our death is not only not biblical but also heretical in that we belittle the role that Jesus our Savior were meant to play. That Jesus would raise his believers on the last day. Before being risen by the Lord there is no life at all.</p>
              <p>So death is above all not a transformation to another life. In order to be still living and active after death a soul needs to be raised by God. Only God has the power to raise the dead to life.</p>

              <p>To understand death we must realize that death is a punishment because Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge. So Adam and Eve would stopped living after awhile. That is death</p>
              <p>Because men now know the difference between good and evil men are liable to be judged. The fruit of sins is death. we died because of our sins but the Lord our Christ promised that if we believe in Him He would raise us on the last day and that we would never really die.</p>
              <p>These words are said in the liturgy: "Remember those who died with the hope of being raised...."</p>
              <p>Why do we say it? Because the dead would no longer be able to pray to God to remember them. We said that prayer in place the now asleep dead.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>To think that it is our body who is sleeping while our mind(soul) would still be living is incorrect</strong>. When Jesus said that Lazarus and the daughter of Jairus were sleeping he meant that their soul were in a state likened to sleeping i.e, they had descended to the kingdom of death.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Here is the explanation of 'He descended into Hell; on the third day He rose again' in Chapter 5:<br><br>632 The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was "raised from the dead" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection. <strong>This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead. But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.</strong><br><br>633 Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead Christ went down, "hell" - Sheol in Hebrew or Hades in Greek - because those who are there are deprived of the vision of God. Such is the case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while they await the Redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is identical, as Jesus shows through the parable of the poor man Lazarus who was received into "Abraham's bosom": "It is precisely these holy souls, who awaited their Saviour in Abraham's bosom, whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended into hell." <strong>Jesus did not descend into hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy the hell of damnation, but to free the just who had gone before him.</strong><br><br>634 "The gospel was preached even to the dead." The descent into hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to complete fulfilment. This is the last phase of Jesus' messianic mission, a phase which is condensed in time but vast <strong>in its real significance: the spread of Christ's redemptive work to all men of all times and all places, for all who are saved have been made sharers in the redemption.</strong><br><br>635 Christ went down into the depths of death so that "the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live." Jesus, "the Author of life", by dying destroyed "him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and [delivered] all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage." Henceforth the risen Christ holds "the keys of Death and Hades", so that "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth."<br><br>Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great stillness. A great silence because the King is asleep. the earth trembled and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh and he has raised up all who have slept ever since the world began. . . He has gone to search for Adam, our first father, as for a lost sheep. Greatly desiring to visit those who live in darkness and in the shadow of death, he has gone to free from sorrow Adam in his bonds and Eve, captive with him - He who is both their God and the son of Eve. . . "I am your God, who for your sake have become your son. . . I order you, O sleeper, to awake. I did not create you to be a prisoner in hell. Rise from the dead, for I am the life of the dead."</p></div>

              <p>654 The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ liberates us from sin; by his Resurrection, he opens for us the way to a new life.

              <p>By His death and resurrection, when we are baptised, we are saved from being unable to see God in death as long as we follow Him. That was explained above in paragraph 633.</p>

              <p>And this from Part 2, Section 2, Chapter 4 explains why we pray for the deceased:</p>
              <p>1681 The Christian meaning of death is revealed in the light of the Paschal mystery of the death and resurrection of Christ in whom resides our only hope. the Christian who dies in Christ Jesus is "<strong>away from the body and at home with the Lord.</strong>"<br><br>1682 For the Christian the day of death inaugurates, at the end of his sacramental life, the fulfillment of his new birth begun at Baptism, the definitive "conformity" to "the image of the Son" conferred by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and participation in the feast of the Kingdom which was anticipated in the Eucharist - even if final purifications are still necessary for him in order to be clothed with the nuptial garment...<br><br>1684 The Christian funeral confers on the deceased neither a sacrament nor a sacramental since <strong>he has "passed" beyond the sacramental economy</strong>. It is nonetheless a liturgical celebration of the Church. The ministry of the Church aims at expressing efficacious communion with the deceased, at the participation in that communion of the community gathered for the funeral and at the proclamation of eternal life to the community...<br><br>1689 The Eucharistic Sacrifice. When the celebration takes place in church the Eucharist is the heart of the Paschal reality of Christian death. <strong>In the Eucharist, the Church expresses her efficacious communion with the departed: offering to the Father in the Holy Spirit the sacrifice of the death and resurrection of Christ, she asks to purify his child of his sins and their consequences, and to admit him to the Paschal fullness of the table of the Kingdom</strong>. It is by the Eucharist thus celebrated that the community of the faithful, especially the family of the deceased, learn to live in communion with the one who "has fallen asleep in the Lord," by communicating in the Body of Christ of which he is a living member and, then, by praying for him and with him.</p>
              <p>When we die, our mortal bodies are asleep in the Lord. We do not rest in Hades, unable to see God, unless we have turned away from Him. If we live in Him, we will also die in Him and we will not be subjected to the punishment that results from Original Sin.</p>

                                                      from the dead" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned in the
                                                      realm of the dead prior to his resurrection. <strong>This was the
                                                      first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent
                                                      into hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his
                                                      soul joined the others in the realm of the dead. But he descended
                                                      there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits
                                                      imprisoned there.</strong><br> <br> 633 Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead Christ
                                                      went down, "hell" - Sheol in Hebrew or Hades in Greek - because
                                                      those who are there are deprived of the vision of God. Such is the
                                                      case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while they await
                                                      the Redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is identical, as
                                                      Jesus shows through the parable of the poor man Lazarus who was
                                                      received into "Abraham's bosom": "It is precisely these holy souls,
                                                      who awaited their Saviour in Abraham's bosom, whom Christ the Lord
                                                      delivered when he descended into hell." <strong>Jesus did not
                                                      descend into hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy the hell of
                                                      damnation, but to free the just who had gone before
                                                      him.</strong><br> <br> 634 "The gospel was preached even to the dead." The descent into
                                                      hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to complete fulfilment.
                                                      This is the last phase of Jesus' messianic mission, a phase which
                                                      is condensed in time but vast <strong>in its real significance: the
                                                      spread of Christ's redemptive work to all men of all times and all
                                                      places, for all who are saved have been made sharers in the
                                                      redemption.</strong><br> <br> 635 Christ went down into the depths of death so that "the dead
                                                      will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will
                                                      live." Jesus, "the Author of life", by dying destroyed "him who has
                                                      the power of death, that is, the devil, and [delivered] all those
                                                      who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage."
                                                      Henceforth the risen Christ holds "the keys of Death and Hades", so
                                                      that "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on

                                                      trembled and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh

              <p><strong>Hmm this might have changed my mind</strong>.</p>
              <p>But the nonbelievers would still be imprisoned in death yes?</p>
              <p>Actually the kingdom of death is not hell. And the kingdom of death like hell is God's realm too, only the people who are not raised were not raised because they lived their life under the influence or power of the devil. The devil is a very poor being indeed he got no realm to rule. Only influence.</p>
              <p><strong>If anyone can explain the meaning that Jesus promised us to raise us on the last day. I would happily accept the understanding that all believers in Christ are raised immediately after death.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And if you could pls explain what I quote from the revelation. It'sÂ  the third quote on the first post.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Job said that he would await in the sleep of death until the sky disappears that is until the last day. It's not my or your last day it's the last day.</strong></p>
              <p>What would happen to nonbelievers or those who Christ didn't raise? They would not be condemend to hell...will those be ever get freed from imprisonment in death?</p>
              <p><strong>You have no idea how much I want to believe this theory for I know theÂ 
                                              sleep of death and the kingdom of death and I really really want God
                                              that is Christ to save me from my sleep of death.</strong></p>
              <p>So if believers are raised immediately(which is good news indeed very very good news) then some people would also be immediately raised to be condemned to hell? Because if some are raised to receive eternal blessing, some other would be raised to be condemned to hell. While other or the rest would still be imprisoned in death?</p>
              <p><strong>And where is the basis in the bible for the CCC that stated men would be raised immediately after our death?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>How about the testimony of a resurrected dead sister who said she had been sleeping while she was dead?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We need a knowledgeable priest to join in the discussion. Somebody get your parish priest to participate in this discussion will you?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I really want to believe that Jesus won't allow us to wait for him in our sleep of death. That Jesus would raise us immediately after our death. But I need the basis for that from the bible. So pls point me where in the bible that can support this theory?</strong></p>

              <p><br>I strongly believe that the lot of those who await in the kingdom of death is the same(identical). That's why it's called the sleep of death. It's the same even for Lazarus who was Jesus' friend. Or for Job who was a righteous person.</p>
              <p>So there might be a mistake here?</p>
              <p>And I firmly believe that even now at least some number of dead people(if not all) are still in their sleep of death.</p>
              <p>Anyone can explain this to support immediate resurrection after death? Some people would be imprisoned in death for indefinite time? That their punishment is not hell but death itself?</p>
              <p>Let's remember our common ground: That Jesus is our Messiah, Christ our savior from the power of death. That Christ would raise us His believers from the power of death.</p>
              <p>Now the question is when. <strong>Is it immediate or is it at the end of time/ the last day</strong>. From what I know the dead don't have any awareness of anything and that includes time so the last day would not be felt as being very long but still I wish that none of us would taste the sleep of death. At all.</p>

              <p>Luke 16:22 Immediate resurrection is implied in the story</p>
              <p>Luke 23:43. This is one of the weirdest thing in the bible. Matthew, Mark and John wrote that the two criminals both insulted Jesus and none of them believed in Him. So this is where the bible contradicts itself. I would rather believe in 3 writers than in one. Besides we know for sure that Jesus descended to the kingdom of death for three days how could the criminal be with Jesus in heaven on the day Jesus and he died.</p>
              <p>Mt 16:26 <em>What will you gain, if you own the whole world but destroy yourself? What would you give to get back your soul?</em></p>
              <p>This is irrelevant to the topic we are discussing. If not pls point out where. The sleeping dead still has their soul but they are not alive.</p>
              <p>2 Cor 5:8 <em>We should be cheerful, because we would rather leave these bodies and be at home with the Lord. </em></p>
              <p>When? Immediately wasn't told but nevertheless could be implied. To be with the Lord one need s to be raised from death first that is one needs to be dead first or to leave these bodies(descended to the world of death)</p>
              <p>Phil 1:23 <em>It is a hard choice to make. I want to die and be with Christ, because that would be much better.</em></p>
              <p>Immediate resurrection is clearly implied</p>
              <p>Heb 9:27-28 <em>we die only once, then we are judged. So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people. <strong>But when he comes again, it will not be to take away sin. He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him.</strong></em></p>
              <p>This verse tells that When Christ comes the 2nd time(and he hasn't come) he would save those who are waiting for him. Those who have died and now waiting for him<br>Â in the kingdom of death. Yes of course we die only once then we are judged but it didn't specify whether we are going to be judged immediately after death or at the last day.</p>
              <p>Heb 12:23. It says about the heaven not on when God would resurrect his people.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Let me add this important verse</p>
              <p>Hebrews 12:14 <strong><em>Try to live at peace with everyone! Live a clean life. If you don't, you will never see the Lord.</em></strong></p>
              <p>So it is telling us that some people would never be resurrected from death. That is to be in the state of death for eternity. That it is the same with perishing. So the Hades is not an empty place afterall. And not all the people would be raised from the Hades to see(to live with) the Lord.</p>
              <p>So even if resurrection after death is immediate it is stictly for those people that are saved by the Lord.</p>
              <p><strong>Death is not a transition to another life without God intervention.</strong></p>
              <p>Not only the ungodly people or those whose faith are fake would never see the Lord they would be the permanent resident of the kingdom of death. They would see nothing. They would become nothing. That is the power of death. Their souls don't live on as ghost in this world or the next. The vain of cosmetics faith.</p>

              <p>If I could live as a soul or spirit I would choose to live as a spirit for I will live forever. I no longer need a body for me to die again. IÂ  will live with God who is spirit in heaven and look at His glory as the angels do every day. Why would I want my body back and be separated with God? To die again? No way.</p>
              <p>It's kind of silly to think that our spirit lives on despite the fact that Jesus raised from among the asleep dead. Again the asleep dead refer to the state of mind that is the soul of the dead not their body.</p>

              <p>It actually still leaves room for purgatory. After the judgement that is....after being raised on the last day and be judged.</p>
              <p>Btw where in the bible that anyone has ever mentioned the purgatory? Since when does the Catholic church hold this belief?</p>
              <p>Any belief must be based on the scriptures that is the bible. Did Jesus ever mention purgatory? Or something about temporal punishment before heaven?</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to ridicule or attack the Catholic church as I'm Catholic myself and I've seen a once a man that now given a new body. And he dressed in a brown Catholic monk robe so I believe that God is pleased with the Catholic church such that he made a Catholic church monk robe to clothe one of His own in heaven.</p>

              <p>I am given 1 Corinthians 15. I suggest those who are following this thread read it.</p>
              <p>The whole 1 Corinthians 15 written by St.Paul.</p>
              <p>I believe this is the key but the meaning still eludes me somewhat I won't speculate,</p>
              <p>Verse 22-24</p>
              <p><em>Adam brought dead to all of us, and Christ will bring life to all of us<strong>. But we must each wait our turn. Christ was the first to be raised to life, and his people will be raised to life when he returns. Then after Christ has destroyed all powers and forces, the end will come, and he will give the kingdom to God the Father.</strong></em></p>
              <p>If any of you could intepret this please.</p>
              <p>St Paul told us that actually the whole humankind would be transformed into new body that is going to live forever. So read the verses I gave.</p>
              <p>Christ would not only defeats all his enemies but Christ would defeat death in the end. So there would no longer be death. Awesome!</p>

              <p>Revelation 20:11-15 The judgement at the great white throne</p>
              <p>Â Â Â  <em>I saw a great white throne with someone sitting on it. earth and heaven tried to run away, but there was no place for them to go. I also saw all the dead people standing in front of that throne. every one of them was there, no matter who they had once been. Several books were opened, and then the book of life was opened. The dead were judged by what the book said they had done.</em></p>
              <p><em>Â Â Â  The sea gave up the dead people who were in it, and death and its kingdom also gave up their dead. Then everyone was judged by what they had done. afterwards, death and its kingdom were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire </em></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>So according to this verse <strong>all</strong> <strong>the dead </strong>are judged at the end of time that is on the last day where the kingdom of death finally gave up their stock of dead people. And the dead would be gathered to be judged. In the end anyone whose name wasn't written in the book of life was thrown into hell. So it's either heaven or hell in the end. And what kind of people whose name would not be in the book of life? Read the following,</p>
              <p>Revelation 21: 8</p>
              <p>Â Â Â <em> But I will tell you what will happen to cowards and to everyone who is unfaithful or dirty minded or who murders or is sexually immoral or uses witchcraft or worships idol or tells lies. They will be thrown into the lake of fire and burning sulphur. This is the second death.</em></p>
              <p>The more I read the bible the more I'm convinced that our judgement would be at the last day/the end of time when the kingdom of death would finally give up <strong>all </strong>of their asleep dead to be judged. But don't jump to the conclusion too quickly.</p>
              <p>But if you read 1 Cor 15:22-24</p>
              <p><em>Adam brought dead to all of us, and Christ will bring life
                                              to all of us<strong>. But we must each wait our turn. Christ was
                                              the first to be raised to life, and his people will be raised to
                                              life when he returns. Then after Christ has destroyed all powers
                                              and forces, the end will come, and he will give the kingdom to God
                                              the Father.</strong></em></p>
              <p>Paul told us that there are three phases when the dead are raised. First to raise is Christ, then his people when he returns the second time and last at the end of time.</p>
              <p>Could the revelation speak of the last phase of what Paul had said?</p>
              <p>To be sure we need to know for sure when can the believers expect the return of Christ? Is it not at the end? according to Paul it isn't.</p>
              <p>The answer to this I believe is in the third quote of the first post, so here is when the Lord returns for His people,</p>
              <p>Revelation 20:4-6 The thousand years</p>
              <p><em>I saw thrones, and sitting on those thrones were the ones
                                      who had been given the right to judge. I also saw the souls of the
                                      people who had their heads cut off because they had told about
                                      Jesus and preached God's message. They were the sameones who hadn't
                                      worshipped the beast or the idol, and they had refused to let its
                                      mark be put on their hands or foreheads. They will come to life and
                                      rule with Christ for 1000 years.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>These people are the first to be raised to life</strong>, and they
                                      are especially blessed and holy. The second death has no power over
                                      them. They will be priests for God and Christ and will rule with
                                      them for 1000 years.</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>No other dead people were raised to life until 1000 years
                                      later.</em></strong></p>

              <p>Â Â Â  <em>I looked and saw that heaven was open, and a white horse was there. Its rider was called Faithful and True, and he is always fair when he judges or goes to war. He had eyes like flames of fire, and he was wearing a lot of crowns. His name was written on him, but he was the only one who knew what the name meant.</em></p>
              <p><em>Â Â Â  The rider wore a robe that was covered with blood, and he was known as "The Word of God." He was followed by armies from heaven that rode on horses and were dressed in pure white linen. from his mouth a sharp sword went out to attack the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and will show the fierce anger of God All-Powerful by trampling the grapes in the pit where wine is made. On the part of the robe that covered his thigh was written, "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."</em></p>
