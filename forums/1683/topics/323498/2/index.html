              <p>What you need to know about Purgatory, including its bases, is <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM">here</a>.</p>
              <p>At the Final Judgment, as far as the true and false believers of Christ are concerned, their bodies will be re-united with their spirits (and do not die again in the mortal sense) to face eternal punishment or enjoy heaven. But first you need to grasp that the spirit lives on. If it doesn't, Christ's death and resurrection would be meaningless to us as Original Sin would still have its hold on us and render us unable to see Him.</p>
              <p>With due respect, it seems that you have a number of unorthodox and contrary concepts and interpretations of Scripture. Remember that Sola Scriptura isn't enough; in history many different schisms arose because of the various interpretations. Have you verified them with your local priests?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link I'll check it out</p>
              <p>No I haven't but I'm going to. But the priest is currently out of town until July 20th.</p>
              <p>Read 1 Corinthians 15. St Paul spoke what kind of body that we would inherit in eternal life.</p>
              <p>This sudden curiosity into death and resurrection was spurred by.....a sort of revelation that I was allowed to feel what was it like to be dead whereby I was allowed to feel a middle age dead women in the world of the dead. She wasn't aware of herself, of her surroundings, of God even of time as if she was becoming nothing. The closest word to describe it is sleeping though there is a difference that I cannot put into words only I can say that in a natural sleep there is always perpetual life. That took me by surprise and kind of bother me for a day or two. Then some Christian Protestant men left my home a brochure on the meaning of death which basically speaks the same things that I was allowed to feel just a couple days ago. I don't think it was a coincidence so I started my bible study to find out more and wrote what I found here.</p>
              <p>Though I couldn't tell and was not told whether this women was a Christian. Or whether she was not saved.</p>
              <p>And I'm not making this story up. Never had something like it before though God had allowed me to know some events before they happened. So I could(am used to) differentiate which 'dream' was from God and which were not( just ordinary dream).</p>

              <p>Well I asked a Catholic priest who alos teaches in a local university(though I don't know what subject he teaches) what was the Catholic stand on death and resurrection. I asked him whether believer wold descend to the world of the dead. when would the descend take place and when would a believer be raised to life.</p>
              <p>He said that theologically I was correct that the dead would not be immediately be raised to life. There would be a period of rest for the dead before being raised to life. After being raised the dead would then be judged. He said it was like a process too for the dead. That a Catholic would first be baptized then receive his or her first communion later on in his or her life. So it is for the dead that the dead would not be immediately be raised to life. But would descend to the world of the dead. The descend would be immediate after the death of a person.</p>
              <p>But when I asked whether a believer would be raised on the last day that is the end of time. He said no the dead would await in an unknown amount of time before being raised and then judged but it would not be at the end of time.</p>
              <p>I would try to confirm this again with another priest after 20th of July that is.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think I see where the ickiness of the discussion is stemming from. What do we define by dead? Suppression of the soul, or death of the body? And when we say 'raised to life', do we mean the resurrection of the soul <em>with</em> the body, or the sending of the soul to its judged place?</p></div>

              <p>Hi Ariedartin what I mean by death is the the death of the body and the descend of the soul to the kingdom of death or the world of the dead where the sould would sleep the sleep of death before being raised.</p>
              <p>What I mean by ressurection is the resurrection of the soul.</p>
              <p>Read 1 Corinthians 15. St Paul wrote what our body would be like when we are raised from our sleep of death to share eternal life with God.</p>

              <p>For myself the entire argument is a non issue since you are trying to talk about time and apply it to God who exists outside of time and spirits who are likewise not bound in the same temporal states as we of the flesh are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess what I'm really saying is, does it really matter if judgement is early or late if our souls/spirits/essence what have you cannot register the passage of time?</p>

              <p>Yes you are right. But there is a difference if God raised us, you and me early or later on. because those raised early would enjoy life much earlier. So it's not that I worry how long I have to wait because I can never felt to be waiting long at all but I want to enjoy life as early as possible. Even if possible without ever descending to the kingdom of death at all hahahahhahahah. The point is we all want to live and enjoy living not to mention living in the presence of God.</p>
              <p>Some more at death I and you would no longer remember God, I and you would not be able to 'relate' to God for anything. I know this is no longer needed because we would rest without disturbance but Isn't it scary to have lost your entire memory of God and what God has done in your life? even though God still 'feel the dead' as He is faithful and all knowing. But it's more like one way connection from God and none from ours.</p>
