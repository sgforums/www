What's priestly duty to her?</div></blockquote>1. The priesthood has nothing to do with the inherent characteristics of the priest.  If the person's characteristics were important, our Lord would not have chosen the 12 clueless Apostles as he did.<br><br>2. The priestly functions are conferred, as we Catholics believe, by Christ on his Apostles.  As he did not confer them to Mary, she could not be a priest nor exercise priestly authority, irrespective of her lack of sin.<br><br>To use an analogy from law, Parliament in Singapore delegates authority to the MAS to regulate banks through the MAS Act.  That power is not conferred on another agency like the EDB.  So no matter how knowledgeable EDB staff may be and regardless of how competent they are, they have no authority to regulate banks.<br><br>3. In the Catholic understanding of the relationship between Christ and His Church, the Church is seen as a bride (c.f. Revelations).  In the offering of the Eucharist, the priest, acting <strong>in persona Christ</strong>, offers the sacrifice on behalf of the Church as head and bridegroom.  To act in the person of Christ, the priest has necessarily to be male.<br><br>4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mary cannot be a priest simply because she is no longer on earth.  To wonder if she <strong>could have</strong> when she was alive would be fruitless speculation.  Far more important tasks such as personal repentance and reform await us.<br><br>regards,<br>obiterdicta</div>

The only other time God breathed on man was when He created him and breathed life into his body. Genesis 2:7. When God breathes on man, a transformation takes place. Here, the apostles were transformed into "other Christs," filled with the Holy Spirit and endowed with Jesus' divine authority to forgive sins. Thus, Matthew writes that God gave the authority to forgive sins Â“to men.Â” Matt. 9:8. We also note that Jesus makes no distinction between very serious sin (called "mortal sin") and lesser sins (called "venial sin"). See 1 John 5:16-17. By virtue of God's mercy, the apostles are able to forgive all sins.<br><br>We also note that the apostles were not only given the authority to forgive sin, but to retain sin as well. What does this mean? This means that the apostles were given the gift of rendering judgment on the sincerity of the penitent, and binding the penitent to works of penance in order for him to be forgiven of his sin. If, in the apostles' judgment, the penitent was not sincere, or should be required to perform acts of penance in reparation for his sins, the apostles could retain the sin (withhold forgiveness) until their conditions were satisfied. While such authority is reserved to God alone, Christ shared this authority with the apostles.<br><br>Of course, Jesus' gift of authority described in John 20:22-23 only makes sense if the penitent orally confesses the sins to the apostles. The apostles were not given the gift of mind reading, and, even if they were, forgiveness of sin would still depend on the sinner's desire to be forgiven (the sinner would express that desire by confessing his sins to the priest). If oral confession were not required, the way that Jesus granted the gift to the apostles would not make any sense<br><br>Why Jesus would grant such an incredible gift to the apostolic age, and then remove the gift from future generations. The answer, of course, is that He didn't remove it. The gift was preserved through priestly succession by the sacrament of ordination as Christ intended, which the Scriptures often refer to as "the laying on of hands." Acts 1:20; 6:6; 13:3; 8:18; 9:17; 1 Timothy 4:14; 5:22; 2 Timothy 1:6.<br><br>History and Bible supprts us....<br><br></div>
