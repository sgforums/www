            <div class='col-md body'>Many a time IÂ’ve heard Catholics ask why is it that the Christians (Protestants) believe in what they believe and do what they do, instead of the truth of the Catholic Church, and sometimes despite correcting their misconception and explaining Catholic beliefs and practices they still seem to be comfortable being Protestants. Let me attempt to share my perspective from my Protestant background, and my experience of having most of my friends being Protestants.<br><br>Put aside the major differences such as the true presence of Christ in the Eucharist, praying to Mother Mary and the Saints, and common issues such as Christian services being more welcoming, dynamic and filled with the Holy Spirit etc. I think another major underlying reason is that many Protestants see and wish to believe that Christianity is a simple religion, it is as simple as believing that Jesus died on the cross to take away our sins and have gained salvation for us, thatÂ’s it. What puzzles the Protestants and they find it hard to accept is why are Catholics putting in place so many rituals, requirements and obligations which to them are meaningless and Â“obstaclesÂ” to God, making it such a Â“difficultÂ” faith? Do most Catholics have answers for that? Do many Catholics fully understand the significance, meaning and appreciate the spirit of why we do certainthings and follow certain traditions?<br><br>Many a times Catholics follow and perform the obligations, traditions and practices blindly and out of habit without understanding the meaning of it all, literally blind faith. Worse, sometimes some apply and follow the practices so rigidly and in such an antagonistic manner without even first understanding the reason and meaning of those practices, and that completely missed the point and loses the spirit of it all. It may be even basic things like genuflecting, making the sign of the cross, abstaining meat on Fridays, confession etc etc.<br><br>It is human nature to want to choose an easier path, religion is no exception, especially in this modern society of instant gratification and good life, who would want to believe that we have to be like our suffering messiah, carry our cross and go through trials and persecutions when the other Protestant churches are preaching that we are already saved, believe and rejoice! Preaching your faith alone saves you, no need to follow so many rituals, obligations and man made requirements! But is it true that our faith alone (sola fide) saves us? If Catholics believe that, then we are no different from Protestants. Unlike the Protestants, Catholics believe that faith must come with good works (actions), but Protestants will then ask, if Catholics believe so, why is it then that the Protestants are doing more and greater works in social welfare, humanitarian and community services? Do you have satisfactory answers? Is our faith about belief or discipleship? Are we believers (believe and do nothing) or disciples (believe, follow and do)?<br><br>My point is, like it or not the Church is about the people. It is the  people that makes up the Church, the Church is not about buildings and infrastructure. People form opinion and perception of the Church based on her people. If Catholics do not understand and appreciate the teachings, practices and traditions and do not practise what we preach, thereÂ’s no need to wonder why Protestants continue to believe in what they believe and do what they do. In many aspects they are doing a better job anyway!<br><br>Quek Hong Choon<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Responses to Â“Why do Protestants believe what they believe (May 10)Â”<br>Peter McDade says:<br><br>May 11th, 2006 at 7:39 am<br>I am a practising Catholic and I read your article on why Protestants believe what they believe with interest. I too come from a Â“ProtestantÂ” background with my mother converting from protestantism to catholicism in Ireland. We have many non-Catholic friends and family.<br><br>Unfortunately I found your argument biassed against Catholics in general and one is left to conclude that the only reason there is any form of tension between the traditions is solely the fault of Catholics. Interest in our rubrics by Â“outsidersÂ” will always be a source of comment and at times ridicule by the ignorant. Tensions are seen to be caused by antagonistic attitudes by Catholics etc etc. Have you considered why the interest has always been from the Protestant side? How often have you heard Catholics ridicule rubrics practised by Protestants? Not often, I would hazard to guess, because most Catholics would not know what they are. Rather than being antagonistic, Catholics tend to become defensive in justifying their practices - the result of which is often ridiculed.<br><br>So one cannot simply dismiss the major ecclesiological sources of difference between the two traditions as you have and reduce the comment to the generalities whilst assuming one side is more credible than the other. This only feeds the attempts by some to marginalise the real differences. For instance, Catholic works in social justice and charity are dismissed in your article as inferior to similar works by protestants! By my observations, this is a gross overstatement. No recognition of Catholic involvement in major public hospitals, education, St Vincent de Paul, local parish care and concern action, and so on. Just dismissed as being inferior to similar works by Protestants.<br><br>I accept there are elements of truth in what you say, but letÂ’s be even handed about it - it happens on both sides. Catholics deserve better than to be ridiculed or put down by their own.<br><br>We can be different and for good reason. We just need to respect each otherÂ’s tradition, keep dialogue open, and work towards loving our brothers and sisters - Christians and other faiths alike.<br><br>======================================================<br><br>Audrey Choo says:<br><br>May 12th, 2006 at 9:33 pm<br>In response to the article Â“Why Do Pretestants Believe what They BelieveÂ”<br><br>Firstly I think we should know that the term Â‘ChristianÂ’ means followers of Christ. It puzzles me why the other denominations call themselves christians but do not consider catholics christians. We are called Â—- Â‘catholicsÂ’. We are actually all christians, we are all followers of christ. When Martin Luther nailed his theses in 1517 he started the reformation and this gave birth to the protestant movement. So the Calvinists, Lutherans and all the other denominations that flourished later are called Â‘protestantsÂ’Â—simply because they protested against the catholic church. So to reiterate we are ALL christians and under this umbrella, there are catholics and protestants.<br><br>God speaks to us in different ways and we have different journeys of faith to take. I am a cradle catholic and I have very good protestant friends. All of us respect the different ways in which we worship. It is sad that the view expressed by Mr Quek is common amongst the other denominations.<br><br>We must remember that Christ came to save especially the sinner, the broken hearted, the weary and the lost. He reached out to the tax collectors, the prostitutes and people despised by society. We must never think that we are better than others. If catholics are viewed as inferior then what will become of the non christians? Judgement comes only from God, not fallible humans.<br><br>The Church of course is about its people and we are still educating young catholics about rituals and practices that the catholics church holds sacred. If one bothers to read up and ask questions, one will understand why catholics follow certain practices.<br><br>Yes, all of us believe in the risen Christ but we have to remember that without his suffering, without his cruxifiction, without his sacrificeÂ…there will be no ressurection. AndÂ… Mr Quek said that Â“It is human nature to want to choose an easier path, religion is no exception, especially in this modern society of instant gratification and good life,..Â”<br>My question is,Â…..is there such a thing as an Â‘easyÂ’ religion?<br><br></div>
