However, because of what transpired during the Children’s Day celebration 1130am mass, I couldn’t possible ignore it. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">I will try to discuss the issue with objectivity and humility. So allow me to discuss it in this letter point by point. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Saturday, 27 September 2009 – Philippines </span><br><br><br><span class="postbody1">Residents of both the posh villages and common residences bravely evacuated the heavily-flooded portion of Ortigas Avenue, Quezon City and Makati City desperately to find a safer place for their family. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">PLEASE WATCH THIS HEART WRENCHING VIDEO </span><br><br><span class="postbody1"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923IKL9Lij4"><span style="color: #006699;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923IKL9Lij4</span></a> </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Filipinos around the world were frantic because back in their country, they were unsure if their love ones were safe. Having heard from the news that there was no electricity and communication lines were cut. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">In Singapore, we couldn’t sleep well worrying about our families, relatives, and friends. I have friends who were crying because their elderly parents where trapped inside the house and frightened with rising water. I was also informed that there were families who were sick and had to climb on the roof top and stay there helplessly until Sunday, shivering in cold, frightened with the darkness, hungry for food. All of these, we had to cry off being away from our families and unable to provide help. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Sunday, 28 September 2009 - Singapore </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Full of hope that things will get better, we all woke up earlier than usual to hear mass. I was anticipating that a short prayer for the Filipino people who are still suffering the effect of Typhoon Ondoy. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Then Father Thomas Lim started the homily with his unfortunate experience in the Philippines. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">He said, and I quote in the best way that I can remember </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">“There was a typhoon in the Philippines….” </span><br><span class="postbody1">“I checked in at around 11am ….then we were informed that there was a delay” </span><br><span class="postbody1">“I prayed very hard because I have to reach Singapore for the Sunday mass” </span><br><span class="postbody1">“At 430 pm, everyone is moving…..but we were informed that crew is not around yet!” </span><br><span class="postbody1">People in the church, including the children were all laughing. </span><br><span class="postbody1">“…. Then we were informed that the pilot is not around yet!” </span><br><span class="postbody1">People started to growl, sharing the priest disappointment. The children were laughing and overheard the kid in front of me saying “That is stupid! Then what? The co-pilot is missing?” and laughed so loud. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">I really can not comprehend why a catholic priest, who is supposed to fulfill the role as a mediator between us and God and should teach the ways of God and His Church, can deliver a homily intended for the children with such negativity and selfishness. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">If he wasn’t able to see the big picture or simply be sensitive about what happened, then for me and in my opinion, he was the biggest disappointment of all. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Allow me to visually and literally explain why I felt this way. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">While Fr. Thomas was safe, dry and with unlimited source of food inside the airport terminal, thousands of Filipino people outside the terminal were suffering and some may even be dying. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">When the crew and the pilot arrived late, I was hoping that he will say, “I thank these people’s effort because in spite of the heavy rains, they were brave enough to leave their family who might also be in danger, and courageously make it thru the 5ft deep flood outside just to fulfill their obligations. (Remember, the time this incident happened, it was during the time when our country was dumped with the heaviest rainfall in 4 decades.) </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Instead, what we heard from him was, and I quote again with the best of my ability to remember “Philippines and Singapore are 2 different world! Tsk tsk tsk…. Can not compare” </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Father Sim, whatever happened to the teaching that says, “We are all one in Christ?” </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Am sorry but I wanted to ask him these questions, Father Thomas, you were very proud of having travelled to different Asian countries. During your visits, were you able to touch the lives of the unfortunate people or were you just busy thinking about the difference between Singapore and the 3rd world countries in Asia? What about the culture? Did you even find time to learn and understand the culture in order for you to appreciate and grateful (not boastful) of your life in Singapore more? </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">For you to question why you felt disappointed that Filipino people calls you Father Thomas and not just Thomas? Didn’t you know that Filipino people were instilled to respect people in the church, the elders, government officials and what have you? You should have been grateful! I bet my life that you were welcomed warmly and well taken cared of during your stay in the Philippines. I am sure that his most Reverend Fr. Gaudencio Rosales, did his best to give you the most comfortable accommodation only to criticise Filipinos in your sermon for respecting you by calling you Father? </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">I would have walked out and called on other Filipinos to walk out during the mass and lobby against you. But I said to myself, if Father Thomas can not be mature and sensitive enough to human feelings, it doesn’t mean that I have to be like him. So I just prayed for His intercession and asked the Lord that if He wanted me to relay what we felt, He would arrange ways for me to talk to Father Sim. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">In the mass for children, Father Thomas could’ve just capped his unfortunate experience in the Philippines with the following virtues which we all hope that our children will be instilled with: </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">GRATITUDE </span><br><span class="postbody1">1.Thank the crew and the pilot for being brave enough to fulfill their duties even if it means that they have to survive the 5ft deep flood and leave their families amidst the calamity. </span><br><span class="postbody1">2.Thank God because Singapore does not have to suffer the effect of heavy rainfall which they said was the effect of climate change (This is the first time that posh villages whose got good drainage system and elevated lands were fully submerged. The highest recorded rainfall in Metro Manila since about 40 years ago). </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">COMPASSION </span><br><span class="postbody1">1.Offer sympathy and kindness to those who were affected by the calamity (As of Sunday night, the National Disaster Coordinating Council reported 240 persons killed and nearly 470,000 families displaced due to floods caused by tropical storm Ondoy) </span><br><span class="postbody1">2.Show consideration and sensitivity amidst conflict and chaos. Isn’t he, as a priest, supposed to demonstrate this virtue? </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">POWER OF PRAYER </span><br><span class="postbody1">1.Let the children understand that prayers can move mountains. Isn’t that in spite of the heavy rainfall, Father Thomas was able to arrive in Singapore safe and sound? Yes, there was a huge delay, but there was a huge reason behind that. Did he fail to look into the other side of the story? </span><br><span class="postbody1">2.Ask the children to offer a short prayer for those who are still suffering… hungry… drying and sick…drenched overnight because their homes were submerged into the ocean like flood. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Father Sim, it was just 3 simple virtues that the children were supposed to hear during the mass. Highlighting the inefficiency of Philippines and comparing it to Singapore is UNCALLED FOR! We may have a lot of flaws. I am not stopping Fr. Thomas to talk about his disappointments with our country and our flaws. He can share this to his friends for all I care. However, in front of the children? Did he really think that the church was the appropriate venue? Not to mention that it was during the Children’s Day? He failed to exercise respect. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">My heart, together with the rest of the Filipinos who were present during the 27 September Children’s ,1130 morning mass, sunk. We were physically battered by the typhoon and Fr. Thomas made it even more painful for us. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">MY PERSONAL REQUEST: </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">I originally intended to demand Father Thomas to give a public apology. However, all were said and done. There is nothing else we can do. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">I just want to request from you Father Sim, if we can offer the 1130am mass on 4th of October 2009 for all those who were affected. I hope that you can also show this video to the church goers so that they know what happened in our country. </span><br><br><span class="postbody1"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bCW7IkICKA&amp;feature=related"><span style="color: #006699;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bCW7IkICKA&amp;feature=related</span></a> </span><br><br><span class="postbody1">Father Sim, I know that you want to promote compassion and unity. We believe in you as our parish priest. I hope that you will not take this for granted. Just please relay my opinion about this matter to Father Thomas.</span></span></p>
