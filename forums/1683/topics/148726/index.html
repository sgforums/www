(8bc) Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake the work of your hands.<br>I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart,<br>for you have heard the words of my mouth;<br>in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;<br>I will worship at your holy temple.<br>R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake the work of your hands.<br>I will give thanks to your name,<br>because of your kindness and your truth:<br>when I called, you answered me;<br>you built up strength within me.<br>R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake the work of your hands.<br>The LORD is exalted, yet the lowly he sees,<br>and the proud he knows from afar.<br>Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever;<br>forsake not the work of your hands.<br>R. Lord, your love is eternal; do not forsake the work of your hands.<br><br><strong>Reading II<br>Rom 11:33-36</strong><br>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!<br>How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways!<br>For who has known the mind of the Lord<br>or who has been his counselor?<br>Or who has given the Lord anything<br>that he may be repaid?<br>For from him and through him and for him are all things.<br>To him be glory forever. Amen.<br><br><strong>Gospel<br>Mt 16:13-20</strong>Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi and<br>he asked his disciples,<br>"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"<br>They replied, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,<br>still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."<br>He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"<br>Simon Peter said in reply,<br>"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<br>Jesus said to him in reply,<br>"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah.<br>For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.<br>And so I say to you, you are Peter,<br>and upon this rock I will build my church,<br>and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.<br>I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.<br>Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;<br>and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."<br>Then he strictly ordered his disciples<br>to tell no one that he was the Christ.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reflection</strong><br><br>Yahweh promised justice, deliverance and salvation. While the heavens will disappear like smoke, the earth, wear out and those who live on it, die, GodÂ’s promises will last forever. The Psalm sings the praises of the Lord whose steadfast love and faithfulness have preserved the singer and delivered him/her from his/her enemies, and who also gives light and salvation to the nations. As we reflect on the blessings with which the Lord has gifted us, we praise him for his goodness and his glory.<br><br>Now, Jesus is recognized as the Messiah, the Son of the living God. He gives to Peter the authority to determine what courses of action are permitted or not in the church. GodÂ’s gifts are given, not only to the people of Israel, but also to "the peoples," Gentiles. What we are to believe, what we are to do, are not ours to determine. Rather God has provided the instruction we need to know how to do his will, and by his Spirit he has enabled us to do what he has given us to do. We are to praise God not only with our words, our songs, but also by our actions. Paul calls upon us to offer ourselves as sacrifices to God, to reject the world and seek the will of God.<br><br>Though GodÂ’s will is one, our gifts are many, and our ways of serving are not all the same. We are not expected to all do the same thing, only to do what we can for the community with the gifts we have been given.<br><br></div>
