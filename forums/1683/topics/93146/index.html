The movie premier, organised by the local Catholic Church, counted Archbishop Nicholas Chia, as well as members of his clergy among the attendees. While various Protestant churches had clamoured to organise this movie premier, the distributor of the movie had rationalized this Catholic link as fitting since the filmÂ’s producer and director, Mel Gibson, is a Catholic.<br><br>Certainly, the movie, which focuses on the last 12 hours of ChristÂ’s life, leading to his ultimate death on the cross, presented an aspect of the Christian faith that is intimately familiar to most Catholics. The heart wrenching scenes of intense affliction that Jesus had patiently suffered for love of God and Man, have unfolded with great devotion in the hearts and minds of Catholics, through the decades, as they meditate on the sorrowful mysteries of the rosary. ChristÂ’s Passion and death is also commemorated with great devotion in the Stations of the Cross, particularly during Lent, as Catholics prepare themselves spiritually to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at Easter.<br><br>These meditations on ChristÂ’s Passion and death, have provided an abundant source of spiritual solace and inspirations to Catholics over the years. Through these devotions, we are constantly reminded of the immeasurable depth of GodÂ’s immense love for us. And for the crosses that we have to carry in our own lives, we are reminded to patiently bear these with faith and trust as Christ did more than 2000 years ago.<br><br>For all the media hype this controversial movie had generated even prior to its screening in Singapore, The Passion naturally drew not only the pious but also the curious. Interestingly, one major group drawn to the box office was Protestant Ministers who were enthusiastically snapping up tickets wholesale for their congregations. Members of their congregations either received free tickets or paid nominal rates, perhaps as an added incentive to evangelize non Christian friends and relatives through the movie.<br><br>So is The Passion bringing about a shift in perspective within a Christian group which, at the most radical moment of its history, had discarded the crucifix and cross as idolatrous images, citing the 2nd commandment as the basis for their stand? Well, The Passion certainly did not cause them to shy away from the box office. Let us hope this is not simply a knee jerk reaction to popular moods.<br></div>
