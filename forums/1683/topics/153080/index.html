            <div class='col-md body'>by Father David Daly, LC<br><br><strong>Luke 2:33-35</strong><br>The childÂ´s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted (and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>: Mary, show me the way to follow Christ. You, more than anyone else, knew how to live as an authentic Christian. You were the first Christian! Intercede for us in heaven.<br><br>Petition: Mary, my mother, grant me the courage to follow GodÂ’s plans for me.<br><br><strong><br>1. A Sign of Contradiction</strong>. Jesus was a sign of contradiction, and he calls his followers throughout the centuries to be signs of contradiction too. How true this is for us today! With each passing day the Christian faith appears to be more and more contrary to the ways of our world: the culture of life versus the culture of death, true family values versus hedonistic individualism, relativism versus the truth that will set us free.<br><br><strong><br>2. A Sword Will Pierce Your Heart</strong>. If we are true followers of Christ, we too will experience the sword that pierces our hearts. What was that sword for Mary? It revealed itself in many ways: the insults she received for being a virgin mother, the sorrow she felt at the rejection of her son, the agony she shared with him on Calvary. Through all these experiences, her heart was united with ChristÂ’s; she participated intimately in his passion, death and resurrection.<br><br>3. <strong>The Thoughts of Many Hearts</strong>. At the foot of the cross, Mary received the mission to be the mother of all Christians. When Jesus said, Â“Woman, behold your son,Â” he gave all of us to her as sons and daughters.  Mary is also the best intercessor, who, when we pray to her, will reveal our hearts to Christ.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Mary, thank you for being faithful to your son and remaining with him through the pain and suffering of the cross. Your motherÂ’s love helped him triumph and this same love will help me fulfill my vocation as an authentic Christian. Teach me the courage to follow Christ in the faithful fulfillment of GodÂ’s will.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Mother, I resolve to visit you today and ask for your help in facing whatever tough decisions come before me.<br></div>
