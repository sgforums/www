Jon Budke, LC<br><br><strong>John 5: 31-47 </strong><br><br>"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. There is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that his testimony to me is true. You sent messengers to John, and he testified to the truth. Not that I accept such human testimony, but I say these things so that you may be saved. He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. But I have a testimony greater than JohnÂ´s. The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form, and you do not have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe him whom he has sent. You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf. Yet you refuse to come to me to have life. I do not accept glory from human beings. But I know that you do not have the love of God in you. I have come in my FatherÂ´s name, and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name, you will accept him. How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God? Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?"<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>: Father, I ask you to help me in this prayer. I know you want to speak to me. Open my heart to hear what you have to say to me. You do not want me to live the legalism of the scribes and Pharisees, but rather the charity you teach me by your example. You know how often I fail to love you and live charitably with those around me. Teach me to love you by loving my neighbor. Let my charity to them be the living of my love for you. I believe in you, Lord; increase my real dependence on you in the things I do today.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:My Lord Jesus Christ, keep me faithful to you as you are to me, always 100%.<br><br><strong>1. Harder Than Stone </strong>Â“If they were silent the very stones would cry outÂ” (Luke 19:40). What a sight that would have been, stones crying out in recognition of their God! But the Pharisees probably would have dismissed this witness just like all the others. Jesus testified to himself starting in the synagogue at Nazareth: Â“Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing" (Luke 4:21). He did it again speaking to the woman in Samaria: Â“I am he.Â” He would do so again to many others. But for the Pharisees this was unacceptable. If he testified to himself it was not acceptable. Still, another witness, John, had testified to him too. Yet they would dismiss him as well as a witness who was biased by his friendship with Jesus. This they would say even after they trusted John enough to ask him about himself Â– as though a witness would be more objective about himself than about another! Jesus performed works, the miracles and wonders that all testified to his identity. To us the evidence seems undeniable, but the Pharisees dismissed it just the same. Ultimately, the final witness would be the Father, not just in his words at the Jordan when Jesus was baptized, or at Mt. Tabor when he was transfigured, but also his words spoken through the prophets throughout Scripture.<br><br><strong>2. Beyond the Law</strong> The Pharisees were strict observers of the law, and proud of it. Nothing heavier than a fig could be carried on the Sabbath. That was the law and they observed it, with the thousands of interpretations and applications that they had given to it. If Jesus had concerned himself with giving further interpretations of the law they might have more readily embraced him. They focused on the commands that God had given his chosen people and their duty to obey. But when Jesus Christ revealed more deeply what God is in himself Â– not just more laws Â– they didnÂ’t know what to do with him. We, too, are people who like to have and know the small print. We might do well to look at our own response when God comes into our lives, asking us to sign the dotted line on the empty page on which God will write our future.<br><br><strong>3. Covenant</strong> God entered into the history of the chosen people as he enters ours. He begins with the patriarchs, from Abraham up through Moses. He enters into our history as he who Â“Is.Â” Â“He isÂ” with his chosen people. Â“He isÂ” with me. He is not a remote God of infinite majesty. He is the God of the Covenant. He has entered a covenant with his people. He has entered a covenant with me. Jesus Christ has come to establish this covenant. He did not send just a message or a messenger. He himself, true God, becomes true man in order to make his covenant with me. Â“He who isÂ” has loved me, has chosen me, and so I have a history and a future. He loves me, and so, I can know love.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Free me from my self-love Lord; give me detachment from myself and from the vanities of the world so that I can have you. I want to live as you invite me to live, as you have taught and shown me. I want to find my happiness in you and in doing your will. Show me Lord that self-love is not love at all, but exclusion of all others. My self-love excludes you and the salvation you bring. Teach me to love as you love me: a love of donation, humility and charity.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: I will give thanks to God for the gift he gives in saving and redeeming me. I will show my gratitude by an act of charity to someone I know, remembering that an act of charity to anyone is an act of love for Christ.<br></div>
