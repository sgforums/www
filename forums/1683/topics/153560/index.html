The 1983 Code of Canon Law standardized ten days to be observed as Holy Days of Obligation throughout the Church. These days are:<br><br><span style="color: brown;">The Immaculate Conception (December 8   )<br>Christmas (Feast of the Nativity) (December 25)<br>Mary, the Mother of God (January 1)<br>Epiphany (January 6)<br>St. Joseph (March 19)<br>St. Peter and St. Paul (June 29)<br>The Assumption of Mary (August 15)<br>All Saints (November 1)<br>The Ascension (39 days after Easter; 40th day of Eastertide)<br>Corpus Christi (60 days after Easter)</span><br>Red vestments are worn at Mass held on the Feast of SS Peter and Paul. White vestments are worn at Mass held on all other holy days of obligation, even those which fall during a season of the liturgical year when some other colour is used.<br><br><strong>Observation by country </strong><br>The conference of bishops in a particular country or region may suppress the observance of these days, or transfer it to another day, with the permission of the Vatican. In some cases the obligation is observed during the following weekend mass. At times if a Holy Day is on a Monday or Saturday the observance will be held during regular weekend mass. They may also make the feast day of county's patron saint a holy day of obligation.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Australia </span></strong><br><ul>Christmas<br>The Epiphany (observed on following Sunday)<br>The Assumption of Mary<br>The Ascension (observed on following Sunday)<br>Corpus Christi (observed on following Sunday)</ul><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Belgium </strong></span><br><ul>Christmas<br>The Epiphany (observed on the Sunday after January 1)<br>The Assumption of Mary<br>The Ascension<br>All Saints</ul><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Canada </strong></span><br><ul>Christmas<br>Mary, the Mother of God<br>The Epiphany (observed on following Sunday)<br>The Ascension (observed on following Sunday)<br>Corpus Christi (observed on following Sunday)</ul><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>England and Wales </strong></span><br><ul>Christmas<br>The Epiphany<br>St. Peter and St. Paul<br>The Assumption of Mary<br>All Saints<br>The Ascension<br>Corpus Christi</ul><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Ireland </span></strong><br><ul>The Immaculate Conception<br>Christmas<br>The Epiphany<br>St. Patrick's Day<br>The Assumption of Mary<br>All Saints</ul><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">The Netherlands </span></strong><br><ul>Christmas<br>The Ascension</ul><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Poland </span></strong><ul><br>Christmas<br>Mary, the Mother of God<br>Epiphany<br>The Assumption of Mary<br>All Saints<br>The Ascension (observed on following Sunday)<br>Corpus Christi</ul><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>United States </strong></span><br>By Decree of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (now the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops), promulgated November 17, 1992 by the Most Reverend Daniel E.

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we're at it, let me cover the Eastern Orthodox's part:<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Eastern Orthodox Church </strong></span></span><br>In a few, predominantly Eastern Orthodox, nations, religious holidays are celebrated on the corresponding day in the Julian Calendar. From 1900 until 2100, there is a thirteen-day difference between the Julian and the Gregorian Calendar, which is used in most of the world as well as in Eastern Orthodox countries for civil purposes. Thus, for example, Christmas is celebrated on January 6 in these countries. The computation of the day of Easter is, however, completely different between the two calendars and does not differ in any straightforward way.<br><br>The Liturgical year in the Eastern Orthodox Church is characterized by alternating fasts and feasts, and is in many ways similar to the Roman Catholic year described above. However it is traditionally held to begin on September 1, not on the first Sunday of Advent. It includes the 12 Great Feasts, plus Pascha (Easter) itself, the Feast of Feasts. These feasts generally mark various significant events in the lives of Jesus Christ and of the Virgin Mary. Winter Lent is one name for the extended fast leading up to the Feast of the Nativity of Jesus Christ (Christmas). Great Lent is the extended fast leading up to Holy Week and Pascha. Other times are especially set aside as well. Two other extended fasts are the Apostles' Fast, generally about one to two weeks leading up to the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, and the fast leading up to the Dormition of Mary, which is for the two weeks prior to that feast, from August 1 to August 14.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The twelve Great Feasts </strong></span><br>The Nativity of Mary (September 8 )<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">birth of the Virgin Mary to Joachim and Anne </span></ul><br>The Elevation of the Cross (September 14)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">the rediscovery of the original Cross on which Christ was crucified </span></ul><br>Entrance of Mary into the Temple (November 21)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">the Virgin Mary's first entry into the Temple around the age of 3</span> </ul><br>Nativity of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (December 25)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">the birth of Jesus, or Christmas </span></ul><br>Theophany (January 6)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">the baptism of Jesus Christ, Christ's blessing of the water, and the revealing of Christ as God </span></ul><br>Presentation of Our Lord in the Temple (February 2)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">Christ's presentation as an infant in the Temple by Mary and Joseph. </span></ul><br>Annunciation of Mary (March 25)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">Gabriel's announcement to Mary that she will conceive the Christ, and her "Yes" </span></ul><br>Entry into Jerusalem (Sunday before Pascha)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">known in the West as Palm Sunday. </span></ul><br>Ascension (40 days after Pascha)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">Christ's ascension into Heaven following his resurrection. </span></ul><br>Pentecost (50 days after Pascha)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">The Holy Spirit comes and indwells the apostles and other Christian believers. </span></ul><br>Transfiguration of Our Lord (August 6)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">Christ's Transfiguration as witnessed by Peter, James and John. </span></ul><br>Dormition of Mary (August 15)<br><ul><span style="font-style: italic;">The falling asleep of the Virgin Mary (cf. the Assumption of Mary in Western Christian)</span></ul></div>
