              <p>Not true. The novena service is only a devotion, the Mass is wholly separate liturgical service, which may also be celebrated after a novena service. Nonetheless, I believe the threadstarter is talking about both the service and church.</p>
              <p>I'm not inclined to speculate on the cause of this disturbance when you are unable to provide any further information that can allow us to even begin consideration. Baseless opinion is not knowledge, and when inconsequential it should be none of our concern.</p>

              <p>ONE of the two Catholic priests embroiled in a law suit surrounding an
                  exorcism on a woman was attacked by a woman in church on Saturday
                  afternoon during a service at the Novena Church.</p>
              <p>In front of a packed congregation, the woman ran up the aisle to
                  the altar where Father Simon Tan , 45, was standing and used her black
                  handbag to hit the priest's arms and shoulders.</p>
              <p>The attack lasted just a few seconds. The woman managed to
                  get a few swings away at Father Simon before a younger woman ran up to
                  pull her aside with the help of several churchgoers. Witnesses
                  described her as tanned, slim built and wearing jeans and a turquoise
                  polo T-shirt.</p>

              <p>Actually elmertan, the church is called St Alphonsus. Novena is just the common name for it due to the association in people's minds with the Novena service and the novena service is truly just that, a devotion / service and not a mass. It's important for Catholics to remember the difference.</p>

              'exorcism' on a woman was attacked by a woman during a service at the
              Novena Church on Saturday.</p>
              <p>In front of a packed congregation, the woman ran up the aisle to
              the altar where Father Simon Tan, 45, was standing and used her black
              handbag to hit the priest's arms and shoulders.</p>
              <p>The attack lasted just a few seconds. The woman managed to
              get a few swings at Father Simon before a younger woman ran up to pull
              her aside, with the help of several churchgoers.</p>
              <p>Witnesses described the attacker as tanned, slim and wearing jeans and a turquoise polo T-shirt.</p>
              <p>At that time, Father Simon was in the midst of asking for
              donations to fund a procession to be held on Sept 7 to mark the
              birthday of the Virgin Mary.</p>
              <p>The woman was shouting incoherently during the scuffle and
              was struggling violently when pulled away. Father Simon kept calm and
              composed and asked the congregation to 'pray'.</p>
              <p>The woman was led out of the church by the younger woman.</p>
              <p>The priest continued the 30-minute service without mentioning the incident.</p>
              <p>Father Simon is one of two priests from the Novena Church in
              Thomson accused by Madam Amutha Valli Krishnan of performing an illegal
              exorcism on her in 2004.</p>
              <p>The High Court hearing into the lawsuit ended last month although a verdict is still pending.</p>
              <p>Father Simon could not be reached for comment yesterday.
              Another priest in the church said he knew of the incident but would not
              say more.</p>
              <p>No police report was lodged. Disturbing a religious assembly is a crime punishable by up to a year in jail.</p>
              <p>A churchgoer who witnessed the attack said: 'When I saw the
              woman rushing forward to Father Simon and raising her handbag, I
              thought she was going to pass some donations to him. I was thinking why
              she didn't want to do that later.'</p>

              <p>I am so impressed that Fr Simon could still keep calm and composed.</p>

              <p>Ah that's nothing imo. In Jakarta we have a Catholic priest
              beaten up while walking to a minimarket recently. He passed out but
              the attackers moved him to a restaurant premises where the beatings
              continued. I believe he's still hospitalised now.</p>

              <p>Poor guy.  Not surprising to have that happening in a country with Catholics being the minority.</p>
              <p>I watched a documentary a few years back about some thugs in US murdering Catholic priests for no reason. </p>
              <p>One of them very suay.  The thugs initially called to look for a certain priest, saying that their family needed him.  The priest picked the phone but as he was in the midst of something, he told the caller to call back at a certain time to arrange where to meet. </p>
              <p>Sway sway... when the caller called back (the caller called back late),  it was another priest who picked up as the first priest was busy again.  So the thugs called the second priest out instead.  They picked him up somewhere, claiming to bring him to their family who needed prayer.  They drove to some ulu place, pulled the priest out and killed him. </p>
              <p>Till now, the police still not able to trace the murderers.</p>

              <p>Disturbing a religious assembly is a criminal offence under Section 296 of the Penal Code that is punishable by up to 3 years of imprisonment, not 1 year.</p>
              <p>"<strong>Disturbing a religious assembly.</strong><br><strong>296.</strong> Whoever voluntarily causes disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both."</p>
              <p>The ST reporter could not even get her basic facts right.  That's why I have stopped reading ST for some time.  One end up knowing less by reading it than not.</p>
              <p>I think Catholics need to take a tougher stance against such abuses against our priests and religion.</p>
