            <div class='col-md body'><p>An unemployed graduate woke up one morning and checked his pocket. <br>All he had left was $10. He decided to use it to buy food and then wait <br>for death as he was too proud to go begging. He was frustrated as he could <br>find no job, and nobody was ready to help him.<br><br>He bought food and as he sat down to eat, an old man and two <br>little children came along and asked him to help them with food as they <br>had not eaten for almost a week. He looked at them. They were so lean that <br>he could see their bones coming out. Their eyes had gone into the socket.<br><br>With the last bit of compassion he had, he gave them the food. The <br>old man and children prayed that God would bless and prosper him and then <br>gave him a very old coin.<br>The young graduate said to them "you need the prayer more than I do".<br><br>With no money, no job, no food, the young graduate went under the <br>bridge to rest and wait for death. As he was about to sleep, he saw an old<br>newspaper on the ground. He picked it up, and suddenly he saw an advertisement<br>for people with old coins to come to a certain address.<br>He decided to go there with the old coin the old man gave him. On<br>getting to the place, he gave the proprietor the coin. The proprietor <br>screamed, brought out a big book and showed the young graduate a photograph. <br>This same old coin was worth 3 million dollars. The young graduate was<br>overjoyed as the proprietor gave him a bank draft for 3 million dollars <br>within an hour. He collected the Bank Draft and went in search of the old <br>man and little children.<br><br>By the time he got to where he left them eating, they had gone. He <br>asked the owner of the canteen if he knew them. He said no but they left <br>a note for you. He quickly opened the note thinking it would lead him to <br>find them.<br><br>This is what the note said: "You gave us your all and we have <br>rewarded you back with the coin" Signed God the Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost. <br>1 Kings 17:10-16; Matthew 11:28-30<br><br>Have you given all to Jesus Christ? If you haven't, do so today <br>and he will surprise you.<br><br>PRAYER:<br><br>Here is your financial blessing! It's a simple prayer, you've got 30seconds.<br><br>If you need a financial blessing, continue reading this e-mail.<br><br>Heavenly Father, most Gracious and Loving God,<br>I pray to you that you abundantly Bless my family and me. I know <br>that you recognize, that a family is more than just a mother, father, <br>sister, brother, husband and wife, but all Who believe and trust in you.<br>Father, I send up a prayer request for financial blessing for not <br>only the person who sent this to me, but for Me and all that I have <br>forwarded this message on to. <br>And that the power of joined prayer by those who believe<br>and trust in you is more powerful than anything.<br>I thank you in advance for your blessings.<br>Father God, deliver the person reading this right now and those <br>who will read it in the near future from debt and debt burdens. Release <br>your Godly wisdom that I may be a good steward over all that You have given <br>me Father, for I know how wonderful and mighty You are and how if we just <br>obey You and walk in Your word and have the faith of a Mustard seed that You <br>will pour out blessings.<br><br>I thank You now Lord for the recent blessings I have received and <br>for the blessings yet to come Because I know You are not done with me yet.<br>In Jesus name, I pray,<br>Amen<br><br><br><br>SEND THIS TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHO SENT IT TO <br>YOU AND YOU WILL BE BLESSED<br><br>"God will put His angels in charge of you to protect you wherever <br>you go" ~Psalms 91:11<br><br><br><br></p></div>
