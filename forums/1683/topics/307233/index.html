              <div><span style="font-size: large;"><strong> Why Catholics are easy targets<br> for Mormon evangelists—<br> and what we can do to keep Catholics Catholic.</strong></span><br></div>
              <p> <br>         The Mormon church has been in the news a lot recently. The head
              of the church, styled its “prophet,” recently died. Many dignitaries
              attended his funeral, including a major political candidate whose
              Mormonism has been discussed a lot these last few months. <br> <br>         Mormon evangelists have been taking advantage of their church
              being in the headlines. They have been doing their best to invite
              Americans to take a closer look at their religion.<br> <br>         Many people have been doing just that—especially Catholics. In
              fact, in recent years the majority of converts to Mormonism have been
              Catholics.<br> <br>         It makes sense, when you think about it. <br> <br>         Catholics are targeted by Mormons because many Catholics can be
              swayed easily by Mormon arguments. That’s because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">many Catholics don’t know their own faith</span>.<br>     <br>         In a way, you can’t blame the Mormons. Targeting Catholics has
              worked for them, so why shouldn’t they keep their evangelizing focus on
              Catholics?</p>
              <div>        <span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: medium;"><strong>What Catholics Don’t Know <em>Can</em> Hurt Them</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><br> </span></div>
              <p><br>         Think the Mormons are just a group of nice folks who uphold
              family values, clean living, and American patriotism? <strong>Think again.</strong><br> <br>         Think the Mormons are just a slightly eccentric offshoot of traditional Protestant Christianity? <strong>Think again</strong>.<br> <br>         Think Mormons are actually Christian, accepting the core doctrines of Christianity? <em><strong>Think again!</strong></em><br> <br>         <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The truth is that Mormonism is far different from what most people think it is.</span><br> <br>         If asked, most Catholics would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be able to explain what Mormons believe. Nor do they have a clue what is wrong with Mormonism.<br> <br>         Therein lies the danger—especially today, as Mormonism is
              enjoying a resurgence in popularity and interest, largely because of
              recent news coverage.<br> <br>         But the news media aren’t providing useful information about Mormonism.<br> <br>         This worries me—because, as I said, the majority of converts to Mormonism are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ill-informed Catholics</span> who are highly vulnerable to Mormon proselytizing.<br>     <br></p>

              would grow at a rate of 30%–50% per decade for the next several
              decades, reaching from 70 million to possibly as high as 280 million
              members by the year 2080. He said it would be “the first new major
              world religion since Islam.” <br> <br>         Indeed, from 1984 to 2000, the church actually grew at an average rate of <strong>52% per decade</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">outpacing the upper bound on Stark’s prediction</span>. <br> <br>         <strong>FACT:</strong> When Mormon missionaries make their first contact with a person in the
              home of a Mormon friend or relative, a conversion will result <strong>50% of the time.</strong>  <br> <br>         <strong>FACT:</strong> Each year, the Mormon church baptizes <strong>300,000 converts</strong>. (That’s 800 a day—or another million every three years.) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Half are former Catholics</span>. <br> <br>         The time to act is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span>— to stop losing our fellow Catholics to the Mormon faith in the decade ahead.</p>

              <p>Catholics not only convert to Mormon, but to other Protestants as well.</p>
              <p>I would say partly is because of the modernization in Catholic Church. The
              modernization makes people confuse, for example "Can a person be saved
              without believing in Jesus?" My answer as a post modernization that
              attended RCIA catechism class will be "Yes, because Heavenly Father love
              all humanity, and if He want to save anyone, he can do it with His power."</p>
              <p>Then how about John 14:1-6:</p>
              <p>"'Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.<br> In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you.
              I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
              for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where
              I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.' Thomas said to him,
              'Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?' Jesus
              answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father
              except through me.'"</p>
              <p>The modernization creates doubts, and it in turn into unbelieving all
              together. I believe without the modernization, there will be no such doubts, if
              we seek, we can find consistent message throughout history of the Catholic
              Church.</p>
              <p>Saint Padre Pio, a stigmatist, modern day Saint:</p>
              <p>In 1966, the Father General [of the Franciscans] came to Rome prior to the
              special Chapter on the Constitutions in order to ask Padre Pio for his prayers
              and benedictions. He met Padre Pio in the cloister. "Padre, I came to
              recommend to your prayers the special chapter for the new
              Constitutions..." He had scarcely gotten the words "special
              Chapter"..."new Constitutions" out of his mouth when Padre Pio
              made a violent gesture and cried out: "That is all nothing but destructive
              nonsense." "But Padre, after all, there is the younger generation to
              take into account...the youth evolve after their own fashion... there are new
              demands..." "The only thing missing is mind and heart, that's all,
              understanding and love." Then he proceeded to his cell, did a half-turn,
              and pointed his finger, saying: "We must not denature ourselves, we must
              not denature ourselves! At the Lord's judgment, Saint Francis will not
              recognize us as his sons!"</p>
              <p>I would say we don't need Church modernization because as Jesus say:</p>
              <p>Mat 24:35 "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass
              away."</p>
              <p>I suggest for the Catholics, before we think of converting to other faith,
              seek the truth first, may not be easy because we are living in post
              modernization, but as Jesus say:</p>
              <p><span class="redheading">Matt 7:7 </span>"Ask, and it will be given to
              you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."</p>
              <p>And pray that may the Holy Spirit give us enlightenment.</p>
