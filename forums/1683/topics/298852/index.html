Now you can download the propers in advance to read and pray. For the next mass, you can get it here<br><br><a href="http://uvoc.org/Epiphany/Epiphany.html" rel="nofollow">Epiphany Propers</a><br><br>Oh there are no hard-and-fast rules as to where the schola should stand. Usually they stand where you can get the best sound. At Holy Cross, the roof was highest at that point where the schola sang from. Most of the time, the best sound is in the middle of the cross for cross-shaped churches. Singing at the front of the church is the practice in the FSSP parish in Sydney too.</div>

Usually they stand where you can get the best sound. At Holy Cross, the roof was highest at that point where the schola sang from. Most of the time, the best sound is in the middle of the cross for cross-shaped churches. Singing at the front of the church is the practice in the FSSP parish in Sydney too. </div></blockquote>By the way, good work guys!<br><br>The schola coordinated well with the conducting priest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
