              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Your gf is absolutely right and your other friend is not. So
              there are no 2 opinions about this and I am very sure. Think about
              it, you agree that God is great, forgiving, loving etc.....why
              would He want to condem one of His own children to hell just
              because he is not a christian? This especially if the child is a
              good one who is always loving and giving to others?</p>
              <p>As converts, we have many ancestors (some must be good people
              right?) and why would we want to worhip a "god" that will send all
              our ancestors to hell?</p>
              <p>Having said that, it does not means that we contradict that
              Jesus is the only way to salvation.... He is.</p>
              <p>Jesus is the only one tasked by God to judge and He told us
              exactly what we need to do in Mt 25:31-46 Last Judgement. It is
              about love and charity that we do that will qualify us to be sheep.
              I.E. sheep are true disciple of Christ who listen and act on His
              words (read Mt 7:21-27 and Lk 13:25-28).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, we are not saved by grace alone.....because St
              Paul never said so. This also drive the big divide in doctrines
              preached. Read Jas 2:14-26 which to my understanding is that it
              disturb Martin Luther so much that he actually removed the entire
              book of James from the bible he preached.</p>
              <p>St Paul said in one of the letters (I need to go and find if you
              must have the quote) that we are judged according to the Gospel he
              preached and those with law will be judged by the laws and
              something to that effect.</p>
              <p>Depending on how you want to understand and read the bible,
              salvation is indeed by faith and deeds. Not when we profess our
              faith or faith alone.</p>
              <p>When we profess our faith, it is an indication that we accepted
              Christ. Having done that, we need to co-operate with Him so that He
              can accept us into the Kingdom of God. How? By listening and
              following His Words like I mentioned earlier (read Mt 7:21-27 and
              Lk 13:25-28).</p>
              <p>When we all die, we will meet with Jesus (regardless if we
              believe Him or not) and face our judgement. The questions He will
              asked is what He told us in Mt 25:31-46. Our answer determine where
              we go......</p>
              <p>And there is this strong views also about purgatory.....the word
              was never mentioned in the bible (just like the word Thrinity) but
              the idea was as in the bible and you can read them up on the
              following:</p>
              <p>(2 Macc. 12:44-45), (Matt. 5:25-26), (1 Cor. 3:13-15), (1 Peter
              3:18-20), (Rev. 21:27)</p>
              <p>and that gives all who are imperfect (we all are) a chance to be
              purify by God so that we can finally enter into His Kingdom.</p>
              <p>I hope my answer can satisfy you but I am really not trained to
              do so. The best place you can have a better understanding and know
              what Catholics is about is the RCIA.</p>
              <p>You can go and join one as there are no obligation and you can
              stop anytime. Or take a copy of the bi-monthly Catholic News and
              check for talks that are relating to what you want to know and
              attend them.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i believe this is circumstantial, if a person has never heard of the gospel before, i agree the bible said that God wrote His laws in a person's heart, and he will be judged accordingly. (my friend said that usually catholics give a question mark about salvation for unbelievers for this particular circumstance - that's why they say it is possible that an unbeliever is saved)</p>
              <p>But for a person who have heard the good news, and purposefully rejected Jesus in sound mind. like the pharasees and teachers of the law during Jesus time? they believed themselves to be saved because they are able to follow the law rather perfectly.</p>
              <p>But Jesus said so many times affirming that salvation comes from faith in Him alone and even rebuked the teachers of the law and even suggesting in a parable that they will be the ones cast out into the cold.</p>
              <p>as for the topic of james, i agree really. a person who has salvation, will produce fruits of good work, which proves that he is saved and spiritually alive. a person without works, proves that he is dead inside.</p>
              <p>how can you worship God and not try to better urself, and be a person of greater character? (even though, as human, we fail so often, but where sin abounds, grace abounds more)</p>
              <p>the only differences is. you see works as the root.. where i see works as the fruits of the Spirit, and it isn't by my effort to produce, and every good work i do, is really Christ in me who enables me to do it.</p>
              <p>but these are all doctrines, and in a way, they are all up for personal interpretation.. but.. the most fundamental belief is salvation, which i am more concerned about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so.. confirm catholics believe that a person of sound mind can still be saved even if he rejects Christ as saviour?</p>

              <p>We do not believed that works is the root but work is a must as per scriptures (that I quoted to you). Faith without deeds is dead. Even from your perspective, if there is no works, there is no faith right?</p>
              <p>As for people who rejecct Christ, there are 2 sides to a coin. Why do they reject it? Sometimes it is because of how they are being preached to. So who is at fault? The christian preaching or the person who reject it?</p>
              <p>The point I am trying to make to you is that God is not petty and He wants to saved the world and not just christians or believers.....which is why He send His only Son to die for the world, the entire human race.</p>
              <p>Jesus is here to save and not to condem people to hell.....unless if one's conduct and behaviour is "beyond hope".....If there is love and charity, there is always hope. Judgement is the sole right of Jesus and we are not here to say who goes where....</p>
              <p>But as Christians, should we not pray and hope that the enrire human race can go to heaven especially those who showed love and charity even if they are non-believers?</p>
              <p>Yes, the Catholic Church teaches that salvation is possible outside the Church.</p>

              <p>No lah.....Archbishop is the one who is involved with the Church even when it was not build. He is the one who is responsible and overlook the building of this Church and has been the parish priest (I think for 2o years) until he became the Archbishop.</p>
              <p>But I think he will be fair to all Churches under him.....and what resources does the Church really need? I mean special need? No lah...</p>
              <p>Fr Richard speaks his mind and can be very direct so you either like him or don't. But as a priest, I think you can rely on him to help if you need. He is a nice guy like most other priests.....Relax.....</p>

              <p>Next time, don;t go with those friend....go with yr gf......Relax and enjoy your journey to discover the Catholic Church....if you finally think it is not for you, so be it and go to one that you think make most sense to you in terms of truth and reasons.</p>

However, around 100 A.D., Jewish rabbis revised their Scripture and established an official canon of Judaism which excluded some portions of the Greek Septuagint. The material excluded was a group of 15 late Jewish books, written during the period 170 B.C. to 70 A.D., that were not found in Hebrew versions of the Jewish Scripture. Christians did not follow the revisions of Judaism and continued to use the text of the Septuagint as the Old Testament.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">Protestant Bibles</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;"><br>In the 1500s, Protestant leaders decided to organize the Old Testament material according to the official canon of Judaism rather than the Septuagint. They moved the Old Testament material which was not in the Jewish canon into a separate section of the Bible called the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">Apocrypha</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">. So, Protestant Bibles then included all the same material as the earlier Bible, but it was divided into two sections: the Old Testament and the Apocrypha. Protestant Bibles included the Apocrypha until the mid 1800s, and the King James Version was originally published with the Apocrypha. However, the books of the Apocrypha were considered less important, and the Apocrypha was eventually dropped from most Protestant editions.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">Catholic and Orthodox Bibles<br></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica;">The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches did not follow the Protestant revisions, and they continue to base their Old Testament on the Septuagint. The result is that these versions of the the Bible have more Old Testament books than most Protestant versions.

These protesters became separated from the Catholic Church and formed their own Church which was more inline with what they believed was the truth. Just like the Catholic Church, Protestant Churches are not perfect, they have also changed many times in many ways.<br><br>The main issue is Catholics have believed and done some things differently to what Protestants believe the Bible has instructed. Protestants believe this is a result of Catholics believing what certain individuals and traditions have said, rather than what God has said through the Bible. The problem of traditions becoming more important than God's truth is something all religions have at some time been guilty of, including Protestants. The Catholic Church has admitted to some of the errors it has been guilty of in the past, and has changed. But there are still some beliefs and practices that Protestants would say are against what the Bible teaches.<br><br>An example of change in the Catholic church is, the fact that today, the Catholic Church does encourage Bible reading. But in the past the Catholic church has discouraged personal study of the Bible, in fact reading the Bible was at one time banned by the Church. Only certain people were allowed to do so. People that did read, or spread the Bible, were even killed by the Catholic Church, like William Tyndale who was one of the first people to translate the Bible into English.<br><br>The Catholic Bibles include certain books which Protestants say should not be there. They are called the apocryphal books, which are writings protestants do not believe have been approved as inspired by God. Since they are not referred to as Scripture by Jesus or His disciples.<br><br>At one time almost all Catholic Church services were entirely in the Latin language, and only a few people could understand Latin. This is no longer case.</span></p>

              Septuagint as the Old Testament.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Protestant
              Bibles</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"><br> In the 1500s, Protestant leaders decided to organize the Old
              Testament material according to the official canon of Judaism
              rather than the Septuagint. They moved the Old Testament material
              which was not in the Jewish canon into a separate section of the
              Bible called the </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Apocrypha</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">. So, Protestant Bibles then
              included all the same material as the earlier Bible, but it was
              divided into two sections: the Old Testament and the Apocrypha.
              Protestant Bibles included the Apocrypha until the mid 1800s, and
              the King James Version was originally published with the Apocrypha.
              However, the books of the Apocrypha were considered less important,
              and the Apocrypha was eventually dropped from most Protestant
              editions.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Catholic
              and Orthodox Bibles<br></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">The Roman Catholic and Orthodox
              Churches did not follow the Protestant revisions, and they continue
              to base their Old Testament on the Septuagint. The result is that
              these versions of the the Bible have more Old Testament books than
              most Protestant versions. Catholic Old Testaments
              include </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">1st</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"> and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">2nd</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"> </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Maccabees</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Baruch</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Tobit</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">Judith</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">, </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">The

              and the Dragon</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"> which are included in
              Daniel. Orthodox Old Testaments include these
              plus</span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">1st</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"> and </span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;">2nd

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>HISTORY:</strong><br> The Catholic Church has a long history over which time it has
              changed in many ways, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the
              worse. <br> <br> Protestant Christianity began in the 1500's when a group of people
              began to protest against some of the wrong things they believed the
              Catholic Church was doing and teaching. These protesters became
              separated from the Catholic Church and formed their own Church
              which was more inline with what they believed was the truth. Just
              like the Catholic Church, Protestant Churches are not perfect, they
              have also changed many times in many ways.<br> <br> The main issue is Catholics have believed and done some things
              differently to what Protestants believe the Bible has instructed.
              Protestants believe this is a result of Catholics believing what
              certain individuals and traditions have said, rather than what God
              has said through the Bible. The problem of traditions becoming more
              important than God's truth is something all religions have at some
              time been guilty of, including Protestants. The Catholic Church has
              admitted to some of the errors it has been guilty of in the past,
              and has changed. But there are still some beliefs and practices
              that Protestants would say are against what the Bible
              teaches.<br> <br> An example of change in the Catholic church is, the fact that
              today, the Catholic Church does encourage Bible reading. But in the
              past the Catholic church has discouraged personal study of the
              Bible, in fact reading the Bible was at one time banned by the
              Church. Only certain people were allowed to do so. People that did
              read, or spread the Bible, were even killed by the Catholic Church,
              like William Tyndale who was one of the first people to translate
              the Bible into English.<br> <br> The Catholic Bibles include certain books which Protestants say
              should not be there. They are called the apocryphal books, which
              are writings protestants do not believe have been approved as
              inspired by God. Since they are not referred to as Scripture by
              Jesus or His disciples.<br> <br> At one time almost all Catholic Church services were entirely in
              the Latin language, and only a few people could understand Latin.
              This is no longer case.</span></p>

              <p>It must be highlighted that one of the motivations of these Jewish abbis in trying to revise (including re-translating) the commonly used Greek Septuagint was because Christians at that time were using the Septuagint for evangelistic purposes - they were converting Jews to Christianity using the Jews' own Greek scriptures ! Tthis took place around 90-100 AD, after the destruction of the Jewish temple by the Romans (70 AD) and after God had replaced the old wine and wineskin (Judaism) with the new wine (the gospel) and new wineskin (the Church). <em>Why would any Christian then accept the decision of those rabbis on scripture as authoritive and binding ? I wouldn't.</em></p>
              <p>The new testament authors quoted from the original Greek Septuagint and the Septuagint was accepted by Christendom as part of the bible for 1500 years before protestants came along and decided that they would follow the example of those Jewish rabbis in throwing out various books from the old testament.</p>

              <p>Yes, the Catholic Church has changed over the centuries. Worship practices have changed (services conducted in Latin previously and now in various languages including english) <em>but its dogma and doctrines have never contradicted one another or the bible even as theological development took place</em>. Catholics believe Jesus' promises in Mathew 16 that the gates of Hell would never prevail against the Church, and that the Church is the pillar and foundation of the truth, as written by St Paul in 1Timothy3:15.</p>
              <p>In the past, the Church has certainly erred in terms of politics, the conduct of its clergy etc. Afterall, as with any human organisation, the Church is made up of human beings prone to sin; <em>but this is entirely distinct from its teachings of dogma and doctrines which we believe to contain no error</em>. Your write-up puts it very well when it says, "These protesters became separated from the Catholic Church and formed their own Church which was more inline with what <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">they believed</span></strong> was the truth." (emphasis added)</p>
              <p>As regards to reading the bible, the Church has never discouraged the reading or personal study of the bible. What it discouraged and even banned where necessary were bible translations that were inaccurate at best or at worst, corrupt and full of heresy in trying to teach false doctrine and morals. The article link provided by SmartyBoy gives more details of the Tyndale episode. One point to note though, personal study of the bible does not mean that each Christian is free to interpret scripture any way he likes without regard to the teachings of the Church. This is the surest way to the fragmentation of doctrine that we see in the protestant world today.</p>

              <p>Hi, new here, catholic and from holycross too.<br> <br> just wondering..<br> <br> how do you guys gather so much knowledge of catholicism? I mean i went through catechism
                  and am a confirmed catholic but..<br> <br> from what i think, the only way to acquire a rich amuont of knowledge is to be
                  a seminarian. (have got no intention of being a priest though :P)<br> <br> Or is there any other way?<br> <br> <br> I've got a few questions to ask too..<br> <br> 1. Is it wrong to feel put off when a protestant friend suddenly tells me in a
                  middle of a conversation when i said that my grandparents are Buddhists,
                  "Why you never bring the gospel to them!? Har!?" <br> <br> I mean like, firstly, communication between grandchild and grandparents isn't
                  that good, they've been Buddhist perhaps all their lives, although i admit im
                  not being very christian by not spreading the good news to them, but
                  still...... <br> <br> <br> 2. Went for confession, told my protestant friend about it, then he said
                  something like you mean you dont believe God can forgive your sins. As in maybe
                  why must you go for confession while you can just pray to God?<br> <br> I know it has something to do with God and the congregation. <br> <br> 3. Honestly, why are there divisions among our religion, christainity as a
                  whole? I mean, its not helping the human race man.. <br> <br> I'm a catholic, i've got little against other denominations (shan't talk about
                  the 'little'), i fully respect their decision. But somehow they seem to have
                  something against us one way or another. Like "only catholics do
                  that", "we're different" haha. (sorry for stereotyping)<br> <br> <br> P.S. I'm okie with the new church… though the cruxifix.. hmmmmm.... lol<br> I love olden day churches more, those high celing, pointy roofs, wooden pews,
                  old wooden cruxifix. Gives a mystical warm feeling.</p>
