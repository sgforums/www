Mainly because it doesn't really matter to me. I know many people perservere this and that just because they look towards their Salvation in the afterlife.<br><br>Personally, Salvation is the least important thing for me as a Christian.<br><br>Facts are:<br><br>1) God is God<br>2) God loves me.<br><br>That's all that matters to me.<br><br>And because He has been good to me and loves me, I want to be the same as him to others.<br><br>And that is what it means for me to be a Christian.<br><br>Salvation belongs to God. There's nothing I can do to change that. But what I can do, I change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
