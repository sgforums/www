Weekday Masses do not usually have choirs present due to the fact that all choir members are volunteers.  As for ushers, each parish would have a hospitality ministry where ushers volunteer to serve during the weekend Masses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ObiterDicta:</div><div class="quote_body">The unfortunate fact in the Catholic Church is that there is a constant shortage of people willing to serve in ministries, so that volunteers often have multiple roles.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Maybe the local Church is short of money, but I am sure many things are better run efficiently by professionals and/or dedicated staff than by volunteers.<br><br>If you want to see what I mean, just look at what St Mary of the Angels are doing. They are slowly building up a team of dedicated staff to run the admin side of the parish.<br><br>As a volunteer myself, I have absolutely no problems in setting aside church work if I need to feed myself.<br><br>The next thing is also that the church itself teaches that workers should be paid a just wage. So the electrician who repairs the church wiring must be paid fairly. The gardener must be paid fairly. And so on.<br><br>Ergo, musician not a profession meh? website designer not a profession meh?<br><br>Its good that people are willing to volunteer but sometimes it seems to me things border on <strong>expecting</strong> people to volunteer.<br><br>So its not a matter of banging it into people's heads, "Serve! Serve!" but also asking the question of how things can be done differently.</div>
