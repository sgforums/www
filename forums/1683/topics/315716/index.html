              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>A friend of mine told me an interesting testimony he heard in a mega church he attend. It touches the heart of 18,000 people.....and the testimony goes something like this :</p>
              <p>A woman (who recently lost her husband - I think) received a letter from a bank stating that she has an outstanding housing loan of more than $300,000.00. She could not service her loan....</p>
              <p>After coming to the church for prayer, she received a letter from the bank stating that<strong> she do not owe them any money! </strong>She showed the bank the earlier letter but the bank says they could not locate details of her loan with the bank.</p>
              <p>After discussion, the bank collected a token of $ 10,000.00 from her and allow that to be paid by interest free installment.</p>
              <p>After paying off the $ 10,000.00, the bank wrote to her again to confirmed that her loan was cleared and they are crediting $ 50,000.00 plus interest bank to her CPF account! (for reasons nobody knows).....</p>
              <p>The whole congregation was moved by "the mercy of God" whom they beleived have "cancelled" her debts.</p>
              <p>They all believed that this is true (It must be since it is a testimony in church) as the letters are shown on the screen.</p>
              <p>When I asked what bank this was? The answer was the name of the bank was covered up.</p>
              <p>Can any logical person think such things happen to a bank in Singapore?</p>
              <p>I wonder why and how such testimony was allowed in the church. Have the church leaders verified that this is a true case?</p>
              <p>Do the church leaders believed that this is a miracle by God ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would be nice if someone who heard this testimony will help explain...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>As far as I know when God gives He gives according to exactly what was needed not slightly less or more in many cases(from many testimonies I've heard and read). And He gives with a good reason too plus the source of money is clearly known like a long time friend, church-friend, overseas contact, etc. It's just that either the timing can't get any better or the amount matches exactly what was needed or both. It's not always money too. Like the amount of food given exatcly matches the number of people in a particular event, etc. But all in all it takes faith to believe they are God send as you can always cry coincidence! or what a lucky stroke!</p>
              <p>Other than that He blesses us when we work to earn our living.</p>

              <p>I agree with Miracle&amp;Prophecies...... this testimony (at least to me) is irresponsible and the church should never have allowed this. If this is a true case, then the bank involved should be investigated since they are regulated by MAS. Money cannot just disappear from the bank right ?</p>
              <p>However, the bigger picture is this.... does anyone think that God will be cheating the bank of $ 300,000.00 ?</p>
              <p>I am sure that God will provide in His own way like what M&amp;P says but certainly not in the manner of the testimony.</p>

              <p>Hi Kuali Baba,</p>
              <p>Reason I post it here is for people to know that some Mega Churches are very irresponsible and one should be careful about where they go to or where their children is going.</p>
              <p>I may be wrong as I heard it from a friend who attend service there. I hope someone who heard this testimony from the horse's mouth can shed some light here.</p>
              <p>The testimony cannot be true and in some way, it goes to say that God is their partner in crime! What shocked me is that thousand of people think it is true ? How could they ?</p>
              <p>The friend who told me actually says that people as well as businesses goes to their Church to get blessings from God and prosper...I.E. get wealthier in terms of material wealth. Again, this is not Christ's teaching....</p>
              <p>Hope this clear the doubts....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Going to a megachurch to seek blessings for their business? Sounds just like what the Buddhists and Taoists do too. It's nothing truly spiritual. It's more of blind greed and self-interest that drives people toward megachurches which market this promise of wealth and prosperity. These kind of testimonials are quite valuable because they can appeal to people in a common language - money. Now, if you're self-interested, why wouldn't you want money?</p></div>
