              We all face challenges in our lives. To ask God for help is to humble ourselves and recognise that we need God in our lives and that everything we have comes from him. It is a proud man who says that he does not need God and that all his successes stem from his own efforts and abilities.
              
              And praying need not always be for 'selfish' reasons. Besides asking God for help to deal with challenges, folks may also ask that God help a friend in need, that God comfort those afflicted by natural disasters or that God help oneself avoid sinful living like lust and prnography.

              <p>Everyone has their faith, beliefs and a different mindset. They may have had different experiences from you, for them to think in such a way.</p>

              <p>You should say what you know about God in your life, what has God brought in your life.</p>
              <p>To these kind of questions only our own testimony could give it a counterpunch. But of course the other party may decide not believe your own testimony on God but if that person is your friend he or she most likely will believe you since you are his or her friend and that he or she knows you personally not to be the type to fabricate such lies.</p>
              <p>If the other party still refuses to believe your testimony the only chance you have is to spend time with him or her so that he or she could be a witness to your testimony that you had given him.</p>
              <p>That's why it is imporant for Christians not only to believe in God but to experience God and to have the personal knowledge of God in his or her own life. Afterall Christians are called the children of God. What children that don't know their father?</p>
              <p>God is the living God so it's not a question of if but it's a question of when we will experience God fisthand in our life. Just be true to yourself and to your faith.</p>
              <p>There are theologians that do not believe in God and moralist who are not moral as well as Christians who do not know their God. If you think God hasn't come into your life reflect back into your own life and invite Him over again.</p>
              <p>Our testimonies may not have to be dramatic such as God healed me of my cancer which the doctor had given up on me. Things like since putting faith in Christ I feel a peace that I had never felt before will do and will show just as good. Anyway all the people that experience God first hand agree that <strong>God is wonderful and miraculous. That He is great like no other. Tell or even show that person this!</strong></p>
