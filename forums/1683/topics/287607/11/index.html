              <p>As a catholic, I attend Novena church mass sometimes during weekdays.. Their homilies were good pretty easy to understand.. The priests were "people priests".

              <p>They have a great devotion to Mother Mary. people of all religions came to pray and seek help. Countless petitions were answered. I have friends who go to saturday novena regulary to pray.. I do not go that often maybe once a while.</p>

              <p>Thank you for sharing :)</p>
              <p>Yes, many priests are Teochew.  In fact, many Catholics are Teochew.  Last time, I ever heard that Hougang area has a relatively higher population of Teochew.  And if you live around there, you will notice that the Catholic population there is also high.</p>

              I think when Bajwa used the word "goof", he caught sight of his own reflection!  May God forgive you Bajwa for not recognising your own reflection!
                  
              Catholicuser, I am not a Catholic.  I actually had a negative impression of Catholics.  The first Church I ever attended was the Novena Church and I liked the priests homily.  Its done to earth.  Protestant Churches are more warm in the way they greet you, the music and prayers, services etc. are meant to bring you to an emotional high.  But if you listen to the Eucharistic prayer in the Catholic Church - man, nothing beats that.  it is so moving and powerful.  And if anyone has ever listend to a Euchasristic prayer during Mass, they would know that protestants talk rot when they keep claiming that catholics do not know God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  and Catholics worship Mary as Goddess.  This stubborness to accept what is before their very eyes turned me off Protestant Churches and Protestant pastors who would condemn the Catholic Church from their holy altar.  I have never heard a Catholic Priest use the altar to condemn Proestants!  Which is why when I want to go to Church, it is only a Catholic Church I will go to and my very favourite is the Novena Church.
                  
              In my kinder moments, Catholicuser, I do pray for Bajwa, SW and her family.  I think they must be desperate - SW and family for  money and Bajwa hoping to revive a pathetic going nowhere law practise (yah, google him and see what you find!) but when I read of her medical history, all the lies involved, it is very hard to remain charitable.  But I guess if it is easy then Jesus didn't have to come to earth to teach us!
              
              Back to the trial, I think - Catholics can correct me if I am wrong - at Easter service, there is a prayer to renounce Satan etc.  Does that mean all Catholics are possessed?!  This Bajwa and his sorry loser clients know nothing - and obviously have zero respect - for the Church.  They cannot differentiate a simple prayer from hollywood style demonic expulsion!  
                  
              I am looking forward to Monday when Angelina Chan takes the stand.  I think more of the SW's DELIBERATELY DECEITFUL medical history will be made known.  Changi Hospital doctors have been played like a violin!

              <p>hi adetet,</p>
              <p>nice to know that you appreciate the catholic mass. Th catholic mass is the highest form of prayer. The church has always been under "attacked". for many things, devotion to mary, etc.. eucharist, anti-gay etc.. Until people come to know the truth of its teachings. it will remain to be seen as such. As they say " they cannot accept the truth" The truth hurts!</p>
              <p>This case of "alleged" excorcism is a "classic" IIMO,  this lawyer is using logic and science  to prove that exorcism cannot "cure" of her illness or there's no such thing as exorcism at all. And in so doing, you get the consequences of a so called "botched" exorcism.. Unfortunately, "praying over" invlovled faith and faith is a mystery. What abt those prayed and being cured? How do answer that? It's a miracle, right? can science proved it? Of course no!</p>
              <p>At Easter, we took the rite of baptism and this include the renounce of Satan and his demons and all his works. The presence of evil is very real in this world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>ok, perhaps we need to examine this area as well.</p>
              <p>1) If the lady's case is a medical issue, hence best option is to call an ambulance as what her lawyer sugest should have been done....therefore... its a medical issue and not a evil spirit processed issue. Then, it shouldn't have matter if the prayer offered is not "professional" enough, as its not a spiritual issue, so prayer as best is just for comforting, encouragement, at worst nothing.</p>
              <p>2) If the lady's case is a spiritual issue, than the prayer offered may cause thing to be worst if not "professional" enough. On the other hand, this would also meant that she would had been tormented by evil spirits all along, which means, at worst, what the prayer could had done is just to bring forth manifestation of the torments that was already there in the first place, hence cannot say, prayer not good enough so she got tormented, when the tormentation would have been there all along, with or without the prayers.</p>

              Hi Vince69
              My take on the areas you want to examine :-
                              
              1) the "lady" (you're very kind to refer to her as that) has been trained since young to go into trances and trained to get out of them!  She goes into a trance at Novena and claims demonic possession.
                  
              2) Yet strangely enough no-one in her family is aware of this ability of hers which she had since young and which she had often performed in her family's presence.  What were they doing during the performances - sleeping?!  
                  
              3) She and her family deliberately set out to claim money furnishing a false medical history.  If the defendants didn't have good attorneys, the whole of Singapore would not have known of this.  I wonder if Bajwa is legally obliged to make sure the full facts were disclosed or it is okay since he is the defendants laywers to let them hide behind half-truths and deliberate lies?  If he is legally obliged then I hope he gets disbarred.  I talk about legal right and wrong and not morals and/or ethics as these are not words I would associate with Bajwa and his clients!  
                  
              4) Would a more "professional" prayer - i.e. exorcism help?  Well, as the priests have been saying they would need time to ascertain if she is really possessed.  This is not a Hollywood drama where the priest would make a snap decision and rushes to exorcise the person.
                      
              The plaintfiff writhers like a snake and has the morals of one.  She's no lady! Points 1 and 2 on their own is damaging enough but taken together with Point 3 shows a deliberate attempt to defraud.

              Yah, Vince69, you are very nice :)  Must learn from you.  Only occasionally I can see the SW and her family as poor lost souls but mostly I just see them as con artists who need to pay big time for this.
              
              BTW, how come no news on Angelina Chan's court appearance?  Has the case been postponed again?!

              <p>Psychiatrist maintains Amutha Valli suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder<br> <span class="update">By Lynda Hong, Channel NewsAsia | </span></p>

              Day 22 of the Amutha Valli alleged exorcism trial saw a second
              psychiatrist reaffirming an earlier doctor's diagnosis of
              post-traumatic stress disorder.
              <br> <br>Dr Angelina Chan, a consultant at Changi General Hospital, had
              treated Amutha Valli following Ong Thiew Chai's retirement from Tan
              Tock Seng Hospital.
              <br> <br> She told the court that she had found Amutha Valli stressed, paranoid and often harbouring delusions about people.
              <br> <br>Dr Chan explained that Amutha Valli had been encouraged to do
              whatever it took to relax and thus was allowed to travel overseas, in
              spite of her mental state.
              <br> <br> She testified that she knew Amutha Valli had planned to visit some temples in Malaysia.
              <br> <br>The trial continues in the High Court where a private
              investigator's video purportedly showing some of Amutha Valli's outdoor
              activities is expected to be shown. - CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              But the question is whether she is really suffering from PTSD or not?  Her symptoms are soo clever - only when going to Changi Hospital, then she got PTSD attacks.  Otherwise, she is fine.  NUH doctors say no PTSD, Changi Hospital doctors say yes.
