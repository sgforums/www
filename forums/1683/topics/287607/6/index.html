Plus, she has history of conning her ex-employer for compensation by pretending to be mad.  This was attested by the medical note from one of the shrink that she consulted and spoke to before.  She was even paid $30,000 compensation when she left the job.<br><br>This is a good enough reason for the judge and defendants to believe that she is trying the same stunt again.  But this time is for a much bigger amount.  She and whoever plotted this with her probably did not expect this time to be so difficult as compared to 20-30 yrs ago when Singtel (it was then known as Telecom) paid her the compensation.</div>

At the start, the way the press, esp. the New Paper ran the articles, like in sympathy for the mad dog.  I read one or two articles where the writer seemed happy that the slutty lying daughter replied so aggresively etc and when the mad dog said she don't like lawyers etc.<br><br>Now its so obvious each time they open their bleedy mouths that they are lying, the press is not so dumb to write so sympathetically for their cheating cause.<br><br>What upsets me is the report that the bleedy son is training to be a teacher?  It is still an honourable profession.  I would not want him to teach and mold the minds of anyone.  What can he teach - scamming 101?!<br><br>and newcomer, of course, the plantiff is being scrutnised very carefully.  Since she came forward with the accusation, it has to be proven that she is in the first place credible.<br><br>BTW is there a mistake in yesterday's newspaper article where the lover's age is stated as 38?  He looks like he's in his 50s.  Ah, maybe the scam is to raise funds for his plastic surgery!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree it is a waste of the court's time and taxpayers money.  Mad dog should have to incur some kind of penalty as otherwise might encourage other con artists like her to sue people left, right and centre.<br><br>I think the defense has already poked gaping holes in the mad dog's medical records.  How many doctors has she seen and many different kinds of medication!  Not to mention mad dog's husband asking the doctor to change the medical records, etc.  They did prove that she could go into a trance - before her teens and she can control her trance!<br><br>As the case stands, it is one doctor's diagnosis against another.  I think the defendants lawyers said they will call one of the doctors whom the mad dog has seen to testisy her condition is not caused directly by the alleged forced exorcism (and since she could do this even before her teens, it goes without saying!).  With the amount of lies told by mad dog and her family, her theatretics in court, her twist-and-turn to the doctors, all of us wait eagerly to hear Doctor Chan's sworn statement in April!</div>
