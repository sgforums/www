It is not certain now whether the former neighbour will take the stand.<br><br>Madam Valli's lawyer, Mr R.S. Bajwa, objected to his affidavit being admitted in court. Both sides will argue on this when the hearing resumes on Tuesday.<br><br>Mr Ting's input on the nature of the relationship between Madam Valli and Mr Singh came at the end of Mr Singh's third day on the stand.<br><br>The law-trained forex trader has emerged as a key figure in the suit, which Mr Tan is asserting was filed to milk money from the church.<br><br>Probing into Mr Singh's relationship with Madam Valli, Mr Tan produced notes by her doctors to whom she told in 2004 of her plans to leave her husband, but denied having an affair with her 'brother'.<br><br>Mr Tan asked Mr Singh to explain why, in 2003, they had travelled to Sydney on the same dates.<br><br>Mr Singh replied that when she heard he was going there for a seminar, she rounded up her children for a holiday. He added that he only booked the trip for her, and that they did not travel together.<br><br>Mr Tan also noted in court that Mr Singh seemed selective about when he regarded her as a 'sister': While he has insisted she is 'family', he has also denied kinship when asked why he didn't try harder to free her from the 'exorcism'.<br><br>Also on the stand briefly yesterday was Madam Valli's trainee-teacher son, Mr Jairaj Kumar Jeyabal, 28, who, like his sister Subashini, denied knowledge about his mother's past psychiatric conditions.<br><br>Madam Valli is in hospital and it is not clear whether she will return to the stand.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fresh twist in Amutha Valli's 'exorcism' trial<br><br>16 November 2007 2340 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE: There was some startling revelations out of the High Court on Friday in the case of Amutha Valli, who is sueing the Novena Church for alleged forced exorcism.<br><br>Lawyers defending the Church have obtained new information from Amutha's former neighbour, who in an affidavit (a formal sworn statement) said the woman had been behaving intimately with her so-called 'sworn brother' since 2000.<br><br>The lawyers have spent the past few days trying to find out the exact relationship between 38-year old Resham Singh and the 52-year-old plaintiff and her family.<br><br>Amutha's daughter, son and Mr Resham himself had all testified that he was a close family friend.<br><br>Mr Resham had told the court that he first came to know the family in 2000 and got close around 2004 and even more so after the alleged exorcism on August 10 that year, which Amutha claimed had traumatised her.<br><br>Mr Resham said he only started to stay over at Amutha's house two to three times a week early this year at the request of Amutha's husband to "help the family watch over her".<br><br>But a sworn statement by their former neighbour, Ting Meng Chang, also known as Mike, suggested that this was certainly not the case.<br><br>Defence lawyer Denis Tan told the Court that since the trial started, their team has been receiving calls and emails from members of the public who have offered to give evidence.<br><br>But the latest from Mr Ting was perhaps the damnest against the plaintiff. His affidavit, however, has not yet been submitted as evidence.<br><br>Mr Tan asked Mr Resham if he knew of a neighbour called Mr Ting, whom Amutha was said to have introduced to Mr Resham as 'Mike' in 2000.<br><br>According to Mr Ting, Mr Resham was so frequently seen going in and out of Amutha's house between 2000 and 2002 that he thought Mr Resham was staying with Amutha.<br><br>He said Mr Resham usually left the residence early in the morning and returned late in the evening<br><br>Mr Tan said Mr Ting claimed that he had on five occasions joined Amutha and Mr Resham for drinks at a coffeeshop at their invitation.<br><br>On one occasion, Amutha was "dressed sexily in a translucent night dress. She had all but a jacket on, but she made no effort to cover up herself," according to Mr Ting. He also claimed that the two were "behaving intimately".<br><br>Mr Ting had also claimed that when he drank with the couple, Mr Resham usually drank beer while Amutha would usually finish an entire bottle of gin (a hard liquor).<br><br>But Mr Resham has denied all these allegations.<br><br>Amutha's lawyer R S Bajwa objected to Mr Ting's affidavit being submitted as evidence.<br><br>The lawyers will discuss this when hearing resumes on November 20.<br><br>Earlier, Amutha's son - 28-year-old Jairaj Kumar Jeyabal, a trainee teacher - testified that he has known Mr Resham for 15 years.<br><br>Lawyers asked him if it is true, referring to to his mother's doctor's records, that Amutha was beaten up by her husband, son and daughter when she refused to give the children more money. Jairaj defiantly denied them all.<br><br>He also denied that his mother was depressed, had mental problems and was addicted to alcohol and drugs.<br><br>- CNA/yb</div>

He said: 'I went there for a seminar. At the same time, she wanted to gather her kids for a trip. I merely helped her to book the trip.'<br><br>Unconvinced, MrTan suggested to MrSingh that Madam Amutha's daughter, MissSubashini Jeyabal, 22, called her a slut and a prostitute because she let MrSingh sleep at her place.<br><br>Mr Singh said: 'Subashini has already testified and she has given her explanation.'<br><br>Miss Subashini stated that she said those words in a heated argument over her dropping out of Catholic Junior College.<br><br>SON EXPELLED<br><br>It also emerged yesterday that MadamAmutha's son, MrJairaj Kumar Jeyabal, 28, was asked to leave the National University of Singapore while he was a third-year engineering student.<br><br>Miss Subashini testified earlier that her brother, a trainee teacher, had dropped out of the course.<br><br>But under cross-examination by MrPPadman, the church's lawyer, MrJairaj Kumar said: 'Civil engineering wasn't appealing to me but I didn't make the effort to quit.<br><br>'I just simply didn't turn up for exams and NUS sent me a letter of disqualification.'<br><br>The episode apparently troubled MadamAmutha so much that in 2003, she became depressed and was treated by doctors at Flame Tree Medical Centre on Thomson Road.<br><br>She was also unhappy that her son drank and smoked.<br><br>To that, Mr Jairaj Kumar said: 'She wasn't happy about me smoking - no parent would be. And she wasn't happy that I used to go out with friends and have drinks with them.'<br><br>He also denied his mother is an alcoholic. 'If she was drinking half a bottle of gin every day, she would be dead by now,' he said.<br><br>'To my knowledge, she only had a sleeping disorder. She only became depressed and horrible after the exorcism. I can't comment on her medical history because you're showing me this for the first time.'<br><br>EXCHANGE OF THE DAY<br><br>YESTERDAY'S hearing was punctuated by sharp exchanges between the church's lawyer, Mr P Padman and Mr Jairaj Kumar Jeyabal, Madam Amutha Valli's son.<br><br>Mr Padman: Do you know that your mother told doctors that she had a platonic relationship with your father because of his drinking habit and character flaws?<br><br>Mr Jairaj Kumar: It's impossible. If that's the case, how could I have been born? How could my sister have been born?</div>

I ask the questions. You are not to be argumentative,' Mr Lee said at one point.<br><br>Mr Jeyabal's mother, Madam Amutha Valli Krishnan, has sued the Redemptorist Order that runs the church, two priests and six churchgoers, seeking compensation for the ordeal that so traumatised her that she can't lead a normal life.<br><br>Earlier in the day, defence lawyer Darrell Low said it was incredible how Mr Jeyabal, as Madam Valli's son who knows her well, never saw the need to speak to her doctors to get sedatives after the Aug 10 incident which allegedly left her traumatised.<br><br>His comeback: It is not his style.<br><br>'I have a different way of showing concern,' he retorted.<br><br>Justice Lee Seiu Kin also had some questions for Mr Jeyabal.<br><br>He asked the witness where and when he tried to call his father while Madam Valli was allegedly forced into the exorcism.<br><br>He also wondered why Mr Jeyabal had not followed his sister, Subashini, and mother into the toilet after the alleged ritual.<br><br>On Tuesday, Mr Jeyabal had described the 'exorcism' as 'a wrestling match' and called the priests 'thugs' and 'gangsters'.<br><br>The hearing continues on Thursday, when Madam Valli's taxi-driver husband, Mr Suppiah Jeyabal, takes the stand.</div>
