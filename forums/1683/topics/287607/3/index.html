Not charges against so many priests and parishoners.  Only in Hollywood movies, a priest will instantly declare a person is possessed by the devil and start to exorcise her.  In real life, it takes tiime and it is not a decision the priest will make by himself or make so lightly.<br><br>besides, with her history of telling lies and her daughter to show the family tradition of being dishonest is proudly carried on, I say it is not true but a real con job to get a quick buck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 1, 2007<br><br><strong>Exorcism hearing adjourned to Nov 14</strong><br>By Jermyn Chow<br><br>THE exorcism suit has been adjourned to Nov 14 after the woman at the centre of the case said she could not remember anything about her personal and family background, and her medical history.<br><br>Justice Lee Seiu Kin summoned lawyers for both sides into his chambers after defence lawyer Tito Isaac drew a blank to almost every question he put to Madam Amutha Valli, 51, during cross-examination in the afternoon.<br><br>When asked about her medical history, Madam Valli insisted that she had never been hospitalised or admitted to National University Hospital, contrary to what the medical records tendered in court had stated.<br><br>'I was very fit... I was representing Singapore. I had no sickness,' said the ex-national walker who is seeking compensation from the Redemptorist Order of Catholic priests who run the Novena Church in Thomson Road, two priests and several church-goers for what she claims was forced exorcism on her, which left her unable to work.<br><br>She could not recall having worked as a morse code operator in Singapore Telecoms. Neither could she tell if she was the third child in a family of eight, although she had earlier confirmed those details when her lawyer, Mr R.S. Bajwa took her through her entire affidavit.<br><br>To almost every question Mr Isaac asked about herself, she responded by saying she could not remember anything.<br><br>For instance, when asked about her father, she started wailing and said: 'I have no father now. He is dead. If he knew that I came to court, he will be very sad.'<br><br>After an hour of futile grilling, Justice Lee asked the lawyers to see him in chambers.<br><br>When they emerged shortly after, Justice Lee said he had adjourned the suit to Nov 14 - after only four days of hearing .<br><br>At Thursday morning hearing, Madam Valli's maid sat next to her in the witness box, and was seen calming her when she could not control her emotions.<br><br>She sobbed and bawled as her lawyer took her through various parts of her affidavit - in a repeat of Wednesday when she took the stand. Her maid also cried with her.<br><br>When Mr Bajwa recounted the scene in the room where the plaintiff had claimed she was pinnned down by two men while the two priests were carrying out the alleged exorcism rites, Madam Valli burst out: 'Don't strangle me, don't strangle me. Leave me alone.'<br><br>She also demonstrated to Justice Lee how she was held down to the floor by the two men.<br><br>She started bawling and hitting her forehead when Mr Bajwa read out her statement about Father Simon Tan's insistence in wanting to hear her urinate when she was in the toilet.<br><br>Mid-way through reading her affidavit, Mr Bajwa had to remind her to compose herself as she repeatedly broke down and buried her face in her hands.<br><br>Earlier on Thursday morning, the lawyers for both sides and the two priests - Father Simon and Father Jacob Ong - met behind closed-door chambers for a discussion before hearing resumed,<br><br>When hearing began, Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim, who is acting for Father Jacob, applied to the court to allow psychiatrist Dr Dr Ken Ung Eng Khean, of Adam Road Medical Centre, to sit in as an observer during Madam Valli's testimony.<br><br>Opposing the request, the plaintiff's lawyer, Mr Bajwa said Dr Ung will be partial when he takes the stand.<br><br>Justice Lee disallowed Mr Yim's application and Dr Ung had to leave the courtroom.<br><br>Before proceeding to cross-examine Madam Valli, Mr Isaac, who is acting for the Redemptorist Order and Father Simon, sought to put her at ease.<br><br>'I am not going to hurt you. This is a temple of justice. There's nothing to worry about,' he assured her.<br><br>Asked to give the dates of birth of her two children, son Jairajkumar Jayabal, 28, and daughter Subashini Jeyabal, 22, Madam Valli kept stating Aug 10, 2004 - the date of the alleged forced exorcism on her in Novena Church.<br><br>Earlier, before Madam Valli took the stand, her daughter, Ms Subashini Jeyabel was overheard telling her mother to 'be calm' and 'not to look at anyone in the courtroom besides the lawyer'.<br><br>She and her family arrived in court at about 9.15am, avoiding the media glare outside.<br><br>About 70 people packed the public gallery of Court 4D on Thursday morning, some of them turning up as early as 7.30a.m.<br><br>from ST online[/url]</div>

She should not just get off with the judge dismissing the case.<br><br>My colleague who is Catholic just told me that this woman's mistake is that she thinks Catholics worship Mary.  She said they honour Mary but don't worship her.  So a statue of Mary would never be placed at the altar.<br><br>Why the judge has to keep prolonging the case?  When the woman went into wayang mode, he adjourned the case to the next day; when her lying daughter drama like her mother, he gave her time to compose herself and asked the opposing lawyer to apologise to her (solid, the lawyer refused to do so!) and now the case adjourned till the 14th?  Your Honour, don't waste our tax dollars on this lying scum family.  They should all be locked in the sewer where they belong.</div>
