But that doesn't tally with what a private investigator observed.<br><br>According to him, MissSubashini Jeyabal's mother, Madam Amutha Valli, 51, is emotionally attached to another man.<br><br>Madam Amutha and her sworn brother, Mr Resham Singh, were seen going out together. It was revealed in court yesterday that the two had even travelled together.<br><br>And her psychiatrist had written that she was troubled because she loved another man, not her taxi driver husband, Mr Jeyabal Suppiah.<br><br>Madam Amutha is suing the Novena Church, two of its priests, and six volunteers for compensation for trauma resulting from what she claims was a botched 'exorcism'.<br><br>Miss Subashini, under cross-examination for the second day, admitted calling her mother 'a slut' during a quarrel. Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim asked if she did that because Madam Amutha was intimate with Mr Singh.<br><br>Mr Yim is defending Father Jacob Ong.<br><br>Miss Subashini, 22, a student, denied her mother was unfaithful and insisted that Mr Singh began staying at the family's Ang Mo Kio flat only early this year.<br><br>She said Mr Singh would spend three or four days a week at their flat and sleep on the balcony.<br><br>'Uncle Sham is my father's good friend's son too. My father works really long hours as a cabby - the bills have to be paid,' she said.<br><br>'It was my father who asked Uncle Sham to help us.'<br><br>She said she did not know why her father wanted an extra pair of hands at home when they have a maid.<br><br>When Mr Yim said Madam Amutha had told psychiatrists she had only a platonic relationship with her husband, Miss Subashini insisted that her parents have a warm husband-and-wife relationship.<br><br>She also refused to believe that her father could have asked his wife to pretend to be crazy to get compensation from Telecom, her former employer.<br><br>She said: 'This doesn't fit his profile - he's a nice man, very supportive, very gentle. Of course, my parents have their occasional fights but these are only verbal.'<br><br>Telecom gave Madam Amutha $30,000 when she resigned in 1989, and she told her psychiatrist that Mr Jeyabal had told her to 'act like a mental patient' as he needed money for the family.<br><br>Mr Yim then referred to the report of the private investigator, who had observed Madam Amutha's family for four months early this year.<br><br>He said the investigator never saw Madam Amutha going out with her husband, but she often went out with Mr Singh.<br><br>Once, she and Mr Singh were seen taking her husband's taxi to Serangoon Road. They had also taken short trips to Malaysia without her husband.<br><br>Miss Subashini said: 'My father works 17 to 18 hours a day. He doesn't go out with any of us. But he cares for my mother, and buys her lunch and dinner.'<br><br>She admitted her parents do not sleep together, but said this began after the alleged exorcism.<br><br>She said: 'My mother sleeps in the living room as she wants to be near the main door.'<br><br>The trial resumes next Wednesday (31 Oct).<br></div>

Mr Bajwa said they were 'heckling the witness'.<br><br>This was taken very seriously by Justice Lee, who then warned members of the public not to make any noise, as this would intimidate the witness.<br><br>He added: 'If necessary, I will clear the gallery.'<br><br>The trial resumes on Thursday morning.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/</a></div>
