              <p>Valli laughed off priests' prayer attempts, says doc Khushwant Singh 31 July 2008</p>
              <p>Straits Times English</p>
              <p>(c) 2008 Singapore Press Holdings Limited</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GP testifies that plaintiff found early part of alleged incident amusing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AFTER nine months, 31 witnesses and 40 days of courtroom drama, Singapore's sensational 'exorcism' hearing came to a close yesterday, but not before a doctor offered more insight into the woman at the centre of the case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Kartika Hanafi told the High Court that Madam Amutha Valli Krishnan, who claims that she was traumatised by a church 'exorcism' in 2004, was amused by the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two days after the alleged incident in which church-goers and priests had tried to drive an evil spirit out of her, Madam Valli said that the priests were silly and that she enjoyed the stupidity of the occasion, Dr Kartika testified.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Later, upon cross-examination by Madam Valli's lawyer R.S. Bajwa, Dr Kartika agreed that the woman was referring only to the early part of the incident, when she found herself surrounded by five praying church-goers after fainting in the Novena Church on Aug 10, 2004.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Madam Valli is claiming that two priests and six church-goers pinned her down and began chanting over her to 'exorcise' a spirit, an ordeal that left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendants deny the allegations and say she is faking her symptoms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Kartika, a general practitioner at the Flame Tree Medical Centre, also said that Madam Valli later became depressed because of flashbacks and nightmares of the incident at the church. She also complained of being lethargic and unable to sleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, lawyers for the defendants told Dr Kartika that Madam Valli had also visited other doctors. Earlier in the hearing, they suggested that she was shopping for doctors to sign off on her claims of depression.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Darrell Low, who is acting for three church-goers, produced a compilation of Madam Valli's visits to Dr Kartika's clinic and another clinic between October and Nov 1, 2004. She obtained 74 sleeping pills from the two clinics while being treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for psychiatric problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Kartika said she would not have prescribed the pills to Madam Valli had she known that the woman had been given medication by another doctor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The doctor also said that Madam Valli had asked for a medical report that did not mention her alcoholism, family problems and depression. Dr Kartika refused the request.</p>

              <p>About this case</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YESTERDAY marked the final day of testimony in a civil hearing in which Madam Amutha Valli Krishnan claims she was traumatised by a forced exorcism at the Novena Church on Aug 10, 2004.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 52-year-old part-time tutor is suing the Redemptorist Order that runs the church, two priests and six church-goers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The last witness was Dr Kartika Hanafi, who saw Madam Valli two days after the alleged exorcism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Kartika said that Madam Valli was initially amused by the experience, calling the priests and church-goers who chanted over her silly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both sides are to submit their final arguments by Sept 29.</p>

              If she was possessed and in a real trance, what is there for her to be amused by?  And worse, to remember she felt amused.  
                          
              I salute the Defense team for uncovering her fake medical history.  She lied when she went to the Novena Church and she has been consistently lying all these years with her song-and-dance with the doctors.

              <p>Read about case in America, girl 17-at-the-time was held down over two days, she was shouting and all that to be released but the youth pastor and his gang were convinced she had been possesed by Devil!</p>
              <p>Anyway, so went to court... and High Court in Texas decided: We can't help you, because this is a case of <strong>disputed church doctrine and so protected under freedom of religion!</strong> Like, wacko.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>America is a good white protestant country.  If the claims was filed against the Catholic Church, the judge may have made a different call.  It is also a disgustingly litigation mad country.  If you try to help someone, you could be sued for interference.  If you stop a criminal, he is capable of turning around to sue you.  So bah to the USA and their legal system!</div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">At that time, she was adamant about taking those allegedly behind her exorcism to court.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, about a year later, Madam Amutha Valli Krishnan wanted those details covered up when she asked the same doctor for a medical report.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">The last witness of the Novena Church exorcism trial, Dr Kartika Hanafi, revealed this in court yesterday, the last day of the trial.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Madam Amutha, 52, claims she was the victim of a forced exorcism at the church on 10 Aug 2004. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">She is seeking compensation and is suing the Redemptorist Order that runs the church, two priests and six churchgoers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Cross-examined by defence lawyer Anthony Lee, Dr Kartika said Madam Amutha had been a patient at Flame Tree Medical Centre (FTMC) since 15 Oct 2003.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">COMPLAINTS</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">She said she frequently complained of insomnia and stress caused by problems with her work and family, and also told Dr Kartika of her alcohol dependency to help her sleep.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Kartika said that on 11 Aug, the day after the alleged exorcism, Madam Amutha visited the clinic and told the doctor examining her, Dr Doreen Ang, what had happened to her.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">She visited FTMC again the next day and told Dr Kartika the same account. Referring to her medical case notes, the doctor said Madam Amutha told her on 9 Aug she had gone with her family to the Novena church to pray.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Madam Amutha said she fainted in the church and woke up in a room there and saw people around her.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Reading</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"> from her case notes, she said: 'The patient (Madam Amutha) asked who they were and someone said, 'I am Jesus'. She became angry and said, 'Then I am Lucifer'.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">'There were four men holding her down and a lady read a Bible and sprinkled holy water. A 'pastor' asked her to identify the cross and eat the holy wafer. The patient all along felt they were all 'silly' and she was enjoying the stupidity of the situation.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">On 18 and 24 Aug, Dr Kartika said, Madam Amutha visited FTMC and told the doctor examining her that she could not help thinking of the events of 10 Aug, and wanted to take the priests involved to court.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">She said Madam Amutha visited her at the clinic on 30 Aug 2004, and told her she was adamant in pursuing the case in court.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">She said: 'Madam Amutha told me her son had called the PM's office and TV to publicise the case. I advised her to see a psychiatrist.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Kartika said Madam Amutha told her she was not worried that her psychiatric history, alcoholism or family problems would be known.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">'Madam Amutha said, 'This (the medical history) is irrelevant to the case! I want justice'.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">But on 21 Oct 2005, Madam Amutha changed her tune.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Kartika said: 'She came to see me after an absence of one year. She said she was advised to get a medical report from her doctors, past and present, to ascertain her mental state prior to the incident on 10 Aug 2004.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">'She wanted me to write a medical report but wanted no mention of her family problems, alcoholism and depression. </span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">'I told her it would not be legal or right because it would be a great omission of the truth. She insisted on the medical report but in the end, I informed her that I could not write it.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both sides' lawyers are supposed to hand in their written submissions by 29 Sep, said defence lawyer Tito Isaac.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>Huh?  Are you saying the Redemptorist Order could subsidise some of the lying cheating plaintiff's legal costs?  Why should they do that?  It is a different story if this was a genuine case needing financial assistance! But this is a deliberate attempt to swindle money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did you read the papers that before the case came to trial, as soon as the plaintiffs had a lawyer stupid enough to take the case, it was her son who contacted several journalists as they wanted the case to be publicised.  No wonder before the trial began and in the early days of the trial, the reporters sounded so sympathetic to that SM and her family of con artists. </p>

              <p>So interesting you talk about open mind, then you call me a bigot and
              ask me to shut my mouth.  Practise what you preach then come back to
              the forum.  I attended quite a number of court hearings and the
              sentiment of the public gallery is far different from what you claim!</p>
