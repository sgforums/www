            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, I believe so.  As I posted previously, mad dog and family may be preparing to sue a doctor or two the way they happily visit doctor after doctor (the whole family damm bleedy free ah!).<br><br>In another forum (I think AsiaOne, not sure though), a poster mentioned the mad dog's family wanted to drop the case on condition that the Church apologise to them!  The priests refused - and rightly so.  Applause, applause. (wah, try to con people and then want them to apologise to you - arrogant aren't they!).  This poster sounds like a lawyer the way he talks about legal terms.  The way he put it, his strong opinion is that it is the mad dog's lover (I haven't heard anything to disbelieve he is only 'sworn brother' and not LOVER!) who is behind this scam.  I can't remember all the legal mambo jambo that he mentioned but I think the gist was that they were so clever to choose a personal injury case.  If they lose, the case will simply be dismissed and they will not be charged for lying etc.   Aiyah, if the priests don't - i think the lay people should countersue them.  people like this need to be taught a good lesson.  Plus hopefully at the same time, mad dog's previous employer (SingTel?) countersues her for the money they had paid her.  Wah, i sure take leave and go to court every day then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
