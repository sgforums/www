            <div class='col-md body'>When you're down to nothing, God is up to something."<br>This is beautiful! Try not to cry.<br><br>She jumped up as soon as she saw the surgeon come out of the<br>operating room.  She said:  "How is my little boy ?  Is he going to<br>be all right ?  When can I see him ?"<br><br>The surgeon said, "I'm sorry.  We did all we could, but your boy<br>didn't make it."<br><br>Sally said, "Why do little children get cancer ?  Doesn't God care<br>any more ?  Where were you, God, when my son needed you ?"<br><br>The surgeon asked, "Would you like some time alone with your son ?<br>One of the nurses will be out in a few minutes, before he's<br>transported to the university."<br><br>Sally asked the nurse to stay with her while she said good bye to<br>son.  She ran her fingers lovingly through his thick red curly hair.<br>"Would you like a lock of his hair ?" the nurse asked.<br><br>Sally nodded yes.  The nurse cut a lock of the boy's hair, put it in<br>a plastic bag and handed it to Sally.<br><br>The mother said, "It was Jimmy's idea to donate his body to the<br>University for Study.  He said it might help somebody else.  "I said<br>no at first, but Jimmy said, 'Mom, I won't be using it after I die.<br>Maybe it will help some other little boy spend one more day with his<br>Mom."  She went on, "My Jimmy had a heart of gold.  Always thinking<br>of someone else.  Always wanting to help others if he could."<br><br>Sally walked out of Children's Mercy Hospital for the last time,<br>after spending most of the last six months there.  She put the bag<br>with Jimmy's belongings on the seat beside her in the car.<br><br>The drive home was difficult.  It was even harder to enter the empty<br>house.  She carried Jimmy's belongings, and the plastic bag with the<br>lock of his hair to her son's room.<br><br>She started placing the model cars and other personal things back in<br>his room exactly where he had always kept them.  She laid down<br>across his bed and, hugging his pillow, cried herself to sleep.<br><br>It was around midnight when Sally awoke.  Laying beside her on the<br>bed was a folded letter.  The letter said :<br><br>"Dear Mom, I know you're going to miss me;  but don't think that I<br>will ever forget you, or stop loving you, just 'cause I'm not around<br>to say "I Love You".  I will always love you, Mom, even more with<br>each day. Someday we will see each other again.  Until then, if you<br>want to adopt a little boy so you won't be so lonely, that's okay<br>with me.  He can have my room and old stuff to play with.  But, if<br>you decide to get a girl instead, she probably wouldn't like the<br>same things us boys do.  You'll have to buy her dolls and stuff<br>girls like, you know.  Don't be sad thinking about me.  This really<br>is a neat place.  Grandma and Grandpa met me as soon as I got here<br>and showed me around some, but it will take a long time to see<br>everything.  The angels are so cool.  I love to watch them fly.<br>And, you know what?  Jesus doesn't look like any of his pictures.<br>Yet, when I saw Him, I knew it was Him.  Jesus himself took me to<br>see GOD !  And guess what, Mom ?  I got to sit on God's knee and<br>talk to Him, like I was somebody important.  That's when I told Him<br>that I wanted to write you a letter, to tell you good bye and<br>everything.  But I already knew that wasn't allowed.  Well, you know<br>what Mom ?  God handed me some paper and His own personal pen to<br>write you this letter.  I think Gabriel is the name of the angel who<br>is going to drop this letter off to you.  God said for me to give<br>you the answer to one of the questions you asked Him 'Where was He<br>when I needed him ?'  "God said He was in the same place with me, as<br>when His son Jesus was on the cross.  He was right there, as He<br>always is with all His children.  Oh, by the way, Mom, no one else<br>can see what I've written except you.  To everyone else this is just<br>a blank piece of paper.  Isn't that cool ?  I have to give God His<br>pen back now. He needs it to write some more names in the Book of<br>Life.  Tonight I get to sit at the table with Jesus for supper.  I'm<br>sure the food will be great.<br><br>Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.  I don't hurt anymore.  The cancer<br>is all gone.  I'm glad because I couldn't stand that pain anymore<br>and God couldn't stand to see me hurt so much, either.  That's when<br>He sent The Angel of Mercy to come get me.  The Angel said I was a<br>Special Delivery !  How about that ?<br><br>Signed with Love from God, Jesus &amp; Me.<br><br>(Let's see Satan stop this one. )  Take 60 seconds and repost this,<br>within the hour, you will have caused a multitude of believers to<br>pray to God for each other.  Then sit back and feel the Holy Spirit<br>work in your life for doing what you know God loves "When you're<br>down to nothing, God is up to something."</div>
