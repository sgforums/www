If this is....what are catholics and protestants quarrelling abt?<br><br><a href="http://stephentong.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=269" rel="nofollow">http://stephentong.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=269</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">the Catholic Church does NOT teach that we are saved "by accumulating 'good works.'" We are saved by the grace of God working in us and through us. The works and "merits" are not in any sense "earning" our salvation or trying to outweigh our sins; they simply show what sort of people we are, and it is the sort of person we are that will get us into or keep us out of Heaven.<br><br>In fact, the Catholic teaching on this subject is entirely in line with the teachings of the Bible and also with the practices of the Evangelicals I have known. The practical differences between Catholics and Evangelicals on this subject are virtually none. It appears from the article that the differences with Orthodox on this subject are similarly small. </span><br><br></div>

But please realize that Catholic spirituality is centered on Christ and Christ alone, and any honor we give to Mary or the saints is really honor that we give to God.  I really appreciate how you expressed your love for Jesus and that you go to him alone.  I now challenge you to study the Catholic understanding of the Eucharist.  You see, when I go to Holy Mass every day, I am as close to Jesus as possible this side of heaven, because I receive His Body and Blood in the Eucharist.  This is the greatest gift the Father has given to us.  This is the eternal covenant between God and man, partaking of the divine nature by consuming Jesus Christ, the true bread from heaven.  You can only receive this sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, in union with Peter and his successors, within the Catholic Church.  You cannot receive this sacrament in Protestant churches, because they do not have valid holy orders.<br><br>If you really love Jesus, and I know you do, I believe it behooves you to investigate what the Church has taught and believed for 2,000 years (but what Martin Luther decided to reject in 1514).  Yes, we are all brothers and sisters in Christ, but the fullness of Christ and His truth subsists in the Catholic Church.  For Christ only has one Bride, not many.<br><br>Christ instituted one truth and not many. The Catholic Church ( and every christian for the first 15 centuries) must be wrong for a Protestant to be correct. I cannot contend the fact that Christ left us without a Sheperd to guide us to the Truth.<br><br></div>

Luther was extremely vulgar and married a nun.<br><br>3) Sola Scriptura destroyed Luther hopes of a united Protestant front.

Thus the Church does not want simply to come to the aid of these Christians, but also to spur them to works of devotion, penance, and charity.<br><br>Its theoligcally sound however individuals were abusing it to make a proft.
