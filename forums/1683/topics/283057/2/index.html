Besides it was for me alone...and it was a long time ago about one year after seeing Jesus in a wake vision....in my 7 th grade. It wasn't in a vision nor a dream. Peter wore a a brown ala franciscan monk robe....great body. Very wide shoulder a very muscular chest, I don't know about his six pack LOL though.<br><br>Seeing his face is like looking at the black hole(perhaps?). No light enter it or coming out from his face. Completely black dark. It's not that he doesn't have any face or head but it was covered in a substance(cloudy??) that doesn't allow light to penetrate.<br><br>No I'm not the only one who has seen him. I've read one other Christian testament book which write on the encounter with St. Peter in real world. "The torn Veil" the story of sister Gulshan Esther. But it's a rather old book so I don't think you are going to find it sold new.</div>

Filter out anything that doesn't match 'your reality' not the 'real reality'. Who are you to define what's real or not. If you do not know don't pass judgement lah.<br><br>Keep the narrow perspective. Perhaps that works best for you eh.<br><br>I'm already sick of friends telling me to notify them the next time God tell me da future, they just hopelessly want to witness what they think as a miracle just for the sake of seeing it......those people even if they know one miracle they would still be making excuses: "How if it wasn't God?", "Instinct?", "Maybe we all have it too but we don't remember having them?" , "Don't believe such things lah(ignore them), you were delusional/hallucinating....", etc, etc.<br><br>I think by the time they die and come to be judged by the almighty God, they would say to themselves: "Ah....I must be dreaming" "You must be fake" "Show me your true self satan"<br><br>Too much movies too little faith.....or is that brain and common sense......precaution is necessary but common sense must also be applied.<br>Sorry if I babbling...just to get some out of my chest.<br><br>The interesting part is that these people are actually more afraid with people with power..more than they do God.....completely hopeless...no faith but they go to church...when it comes to stand on the faith they falter but they do say things like God is good so many times.......as if their wrongdoings which they don't want to admit not to mention regret would do them no harm because "God is good". I'm not saying one needs to blast his way out of everything...but  for God's sake at least try to respect God if you know what I mean. I'm not saying you have to be a saint but be sure where you stand and make that commitment when required. God will help you in the time of trial.<br><br>If satan were here it would find people in abundance ready to follow it to hell.........many of  them would be churchgoers too. They are either too dumb or too afraid....to make a stand for God.<br><br>The motto of satan I believe is: "If we can't convince(fool) him, attack(break) him".<br><br>Each blows teach you a move or two soon enough you'll be a fighter.<br>The war has already started. Which side are you on?<br><br>I follow Jesus the man who lived to endure so much sufferings and be put on the cross to die yet He is now alive in glory(I know that for sure). So what do I have to lose.<br><br>The only thing that could really kill me is my own doing(my own sins).<br><br>Sufferings brings us more glory and death is a sure victory. March on brothers/sisters! Our enemy is united, I'm worry to see today's condition that (Real) faithful people are scattered. So God preserve His people.</div>
