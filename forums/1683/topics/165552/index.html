Gaude! Emmanuel,<br>nascetur pro te Israel!</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Sunday of Advent, 27 November 2005</span><br><br>Today is the beginning of the Advent season. What is Advent? Advent is the 4 weeks before the Nativity of Christ, aka Christmas. It is also the beginning of a new Church year. During Advent, we prepare to celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>During this time we are reminded to:<br><br>1) Prepare ourselves worthily to celebrate the anniversary of the Lord's coming into the world as the incarnate God of love,<br><br>2) Thus to make our souls fitting abodes for the Redeemer coming in Holy Communion and through grace, and<br><br>3) Thereby to make ourselves ready for His final coming as judge, at death and at the end of the world.<br><br>We can do these by taking part in the penitential services that will be held in the coming weeks. At the same time we should genuinely re-examine our lives and see if we can make a beneficial difference to the lives of those around us.<br><br>Do we buy that packet of tissue from the blind man on the street? Christ says that the least we do to our brothers, the least we do to Him.<br><br>Can we at least try to make peace with our enemies? Christ also says that we must love our enemies.<br><br>A new year lies ahead, shall we make a fresh start?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">O come, O come, Emmanuel,<br>and ransom captive Israel,<br>that morns in lonely exile here<br>until the Son of God appear.<br><br>Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel,<br>to thee shall come Emmanuel!</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advent Child: Not your average Final Fantasy (Week 2)</span></strong><br>by SingaporeMacross<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Veni, veni Adonai,<br>Qui populo in Sinai<br>Legem dedisti vertice,<br>In majestate gloriae.<br><br>Gaude, gaude! Emmanuel<br>nascetur pro te, Israel.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Sunday of Advent, 4 December 2005</span><br><br>We are now entering the second week of Advent. In todayÂ’s Gospel (Mark 1:3-8 ), JesusÂ’ forerunner John the Baptist cries out in the desert,<br><br>Â‘A voice of one crying out in the desert:<br>Â“Prepare the way of the Lord,<br>make straight his paths.Â”<br>John the Baptist appeared in the desert<br>proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.Â’<br><br>This is predicted in Isaiah 40:1-5, 9-11, where it mentions,<br><br>Â‘A voice cries out:<br>In the desert prepare the way of the LORD!<br>Make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God!Â’<br><br>Clearly the idea of preparing the way of the Lord is not to be dismissed easily. But what does it mean to prepare the way of the Lord? Yes, it is to prepare for the Second Coming of Christ. At the end of time we will face a second judgement, and we must be ready. As it is mentioned in todayÂ’s epistle (2 Peter 3:8-14),<br><br>Â‘But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,<br>and then the heavens will pass away with a mighty roar<br>and the elements will be dissolved by fire,<br>and the earth and everything done on it will be found out.Â’<br><br>Indeed we do not know when the end of time will come, so we should start preparing now. As mentioned in the previous week, Advent truly is a time for preparation. But we should not forget that though Jesus is not physically here, he is present in the tabernacle of our churches. He truly is present in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Perhaps we can take some time during this season to visit him. We must not only be generous with our material goods, we must also be generous with our time.<br><br>Another way of preparing the LordÂ’s way is to share the Good News with others, through words and actions. There are so many opportunities for us to do so, be it at school or work. But beware; followers of Christ will always be persecuted. They can expect to be ridiculed and mocked at. After all, even John the Baptist himself was beheaded. The prophets were also not welcomed in their own hometowns. You can expect resistance and anger from your family.<br><br>This is such if we are to proclaim Him. But do not fear, for the Lord is here!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, come, oh, come, great Lord of might,<br>Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height<br>In Ancient times once gave the law<br>In cloud, and majesty and awe.<br><br>Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel,<br>to thee shall come Emmanuel!</span><br></div>

Emmanuel<br>nascetur pro te, Israel.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Sunday of Advent, 11 December 2005</span><br><br>The Jews in the Gospels did not know how the Messiah was to come. They were expecting him to come, but did not know who. When Christ finally came, they could not believe it. They thought, Â‘How could a baby born in a dilapidated shack, a bastard child of a teenage girl be the Messiah?Â’ The people of Israel at that time were being ruled by the Romans, and expected a militaristic saviour to liberate them. They thought the Messiah would suddenly descend from heaven and establish his reign by destroying the enemies of Israel.<br><br>But this was not to be. Christ instead came to free us from sin, not material poverty. Since we are free from the shackles of sin, it is then our turn to free others from poverty, both material and spiritual. TodayÂ’s first reading says,<br><br>Isaiah 61:1-2a, 10-11<br><br>Â‘The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,<br>because the LORD has anointed me;<br>he has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor,<br>to heal the brokenhearted,<br>to proclaim liberty to the captives<br>and release to the prisoners,<br>to announce a year of favor from the LORD<br>and a day of vindication by our God.Â’<br><br>Can we not see that everyone is made in the image of God? Yes! The beggars, the homeless, the old and lonely. Even the filthy backstabber in your class and the poor lonely kid you always pick on. We must begin to reach out to these people no matter how difficult it is. And we must always use love and peace. We are not expected to like our enemies, but we are expected to show Christian love for them.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, come, strong branch of Jesse, free<br>Thine own from Satans tyranny;<br>From depths of hell Thy people save<br>And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.<br><br>Rejoice!

Emmanuel<br>nascetur pro te, Israel.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourth Sunday of Advent, 18 December 2005</span><br><br>We have now entered the fourth week of Advent. In todayÂ’s Gospel reading, we hear the story of the Annunciation. The angel Gabriel comes to Mary to declare that she will be the mother of Our Lord.<br><br>Luke 1:32-33<br>Â“Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,<br>and you shall name him Jesus.<br>He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,<br>and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,<br>and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,<br>and of his kingdom there will be no end.Â”<br><br>If Mary was given such an important role as the Mother of God, it is clear that she is definitely part of GodÂ’s plan to save us. Mary is no longer a mere character in the Bible, but an integral part of Christianity. How long more shall Christians everywhere continue to ignore the role she played? How long can we continue to ignore her, when she is the perfect model of Christians everywhere?<br><br>Luke 1:38<br>Mary said, Â“Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.<br>May it be done to me according to your word.Â”<br><br>In praying these words, she conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>Mary willingly accepted GodÂ’s will to be His instrument in our salvation. She did not understand much, but she had faith in God and followed anyway. She pondered all these things in her heart, and followed His will. We must imitate her example, in order to reach perfection in Christ.<br><br>If we were to read the Gospel further, we would go on to the Magnificat:<br><br>Luke 1:46-48<br>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,<br>my spirit rejoices in God my saviour.<br>For he has looked upon his handmaid's lowliness; behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed.<br><br>Mary was just a lowly human being like us, but she allowed herself to be part of GodÂ’s plan. We should surrender our wills to God like she did, and do whatever he wants of us. Furthermore, scripture demands that we must call her blessed. She placed herself as the lowly, but God raised her up. If God allowed this, so must we. Let us not be afraid to honour her as the perfect vessel of the Christ.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh, come, Thou Key of David, come<br>And open wide our heavenly home:<br>Make safe the way that leads on high<br>And close the path to misery.<br><br>Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel,<br>to thee shall come Emmanuel!</span><br></div>
