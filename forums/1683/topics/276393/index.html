            <div class='col-md body'>Bro/Sis<br><br>My friend had an abortion in year 2001 before she met her husband.  Her boyfriend back then did not want to marry her and her mother also pushed her to abort the baby for fear that my friend cannot support the child.<br><br>Now she's happily married to her husband and they have been trying for a baby for some time, but unsuccessful.  She somehow has the thinking that the soul of her aborted baby is haunting her and stopping her from conceiving.  She was told by her buddhist relatives to get some monks to chant for the baby so that the ghost can rest in peace and go for reincarnation.<br><br>Today she has come to me to seek my advice from a Catholic perspective.  I know we have feast day for the souls and we do practise praying for the dead.  But is there anything that we specially do for aborted babies?  Is there any prayer that my friend can recite for herself and her departed baby?   Or do you think I should get a priest to hold a Mass at her place or something?</div>

They consulted one of the top gynae specialising in fertilty.  The doc said both she and her husband were in perfect condition to have children.  He said probably they need to monitor the timing, which they did also.  Then the doc also cannot explain why they cannot.  He can only suggest artificial method.<br><br>Actually her buddist relative didn't tell her about the baby's spirit out of no where.  The relative went to some buddhist monk or what for some advice and was told about this (cuz the relative was the one who drove my friend to the abortion clinic).<br><br>She is not comfortable with getting a Buddhist monk or Taoist priest to chant anything (dunno what's the reason).  She is contemplating getting a psychic to talk to the spirit (if there is any psychic in Sg) or a Catholic priest to conduct a Mass.</div>

Maybe you should try calling them at "6 344 0929" ask for one of the brothers.<br><br>But bear in mind i can't be sure if it really was true, or it was just some nonsense they told us. But a lot of people did die at St Pat's in WWII especially under the chapel (old allied field hospital....) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's nothing to do with the spirit of the unborn baby. To have a baby or not to have, fortunately it doesn't depend on human. God decides and let human know His power. If he decides that it is time to wait,... then she has to wait despite all her efforts. Instead of trying with her own power, maybe she should seek God and understand what's the message. There is something to learn at every waiting point.</div>
