              <p>That's the way it generally is with parishioners in Singapore - people who aren't involved in the ministries don't often get involved in the parish community. However, no one will open up to you unless you do it first, so get to know a few familiar faces first. I like the music arrangements for Sunday Mass at Good Shepherd. It inspires, though prayer is largely between you and God.</p>

              <p>try St Francis Xavier......beautiful church but hard to access unless you drive. there's a bus stop just a few steps from the church's entrance but not sure what bus goes there.</p>
              <p>the sermons there by Fr Bosco and Fr Brian are interesting. Fr Ambrose preach there once a month too.</p>
              <p>one thing that i noticed is that they have lots of alter boys (as much as 19-20 during sunset mass)!!!</p>

              <p>dark night 2 - so did you manage to find a praise &amp; worship group ?</p>
              <p>many years ago, st michael's church had P&amp;W on the 1st &amp; 3rd Sat by Fr Vincent Lee (??) and was very "HOT" then but it has died down. From my experiences, most parish charismatic groups are still very mild and not so vibrant unlike pentacostal/AOG/charismatic churches. Sometimes during catholic P&amp;W, they invoke the intercession of the BVM, Saints and angels.....Some praise songs they sing are in the 1950s/60s era<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/oh.png" alt="oh.png"></p>

              <p>try St Francis Xavier......beautiful church but hard to access unless you drive. there's a bus stop just a few steps from the church's entrance but not sure what bus goes there.</p>
              <p>the sermons there by Fr Bosco and Fr Brian are interesting. Fr Ambrose preach there once a month too.</p>
              <p>one thing that i noticed is that they have lots of alter boys (as much as 19-20 during sunset mass)!!!</p>
