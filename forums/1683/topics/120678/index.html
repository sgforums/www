The Lord our God is Lord alone! Your shall love the Lord yours God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.Â” The scribe said to him, Â“Well said, teacher. You are right in saying, He is one and there is no other than he. And to love him with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.Â” And when Jesus saw that he answered with understanding, he said to him, Â“You are not far from the Kingdom of God.Â” And no one dares to ask him any more questions.<br><br><strong>Introductory Prayer</strong>:Lord, as I prepare during this time of Lent to celebrate the great mystery of your resurrection, I come before you in prayer so that you can form me and direct me. Burn away the sinfulness of my life so that I can glorify you with a pure and contrite heart. You know my sinfulness. You know my pride and sensuality. Accept my prayer today as a small token of my love. My hope is that from the little I am able to love, you will teach me to love with a magnanimous heart. I want to be part of your kingdom. I do not want to be on the fringes but to plunge myself into the depths of your love.<br><br><strong>Petition</strong>:Lord, teach me to love you with my whole heart, soul and mind and with all my strength.<br><br><strong>1. Which Is the First?</strong> The question concerning the first of the commandments was debated much by the scribes and Pharisees. There is a human desire to know what is first and what is second; to be able to put things in order. We are often attracted to the promise made by this or that guru about the one secret that will make us happy, healthy, or successful in business. So, our natural curiosity is attracted to know what the first commandment is, what we must do above all. We want to say, Â“Just tell me plain and simple what I must do and I will do it.Â” Here Jesus lays out, plain and simple, how we must live our lives: loving God with everything we are and loving our neighbor as ourselves.<br><br><strong>2. Love Encompasses All.</strong> The scribe comments that these laws are greater than any burnt offering or sacrifice. A sacrifice or burnt offering without love is empty. It is love for God and neighbor that gives all of our sacrifices, trials and good works their value. Love is at the heart of our perfection and when we are keeping this greatest of the laws Â– to love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength Â–, then all of the lesser things in life will fall into place.<br><br><strong>3. How Far Am I from the Kingdom? </strong>Jesus congratulates the scribe for his understanding and tells him that he is not far from the Kingdom of God. It gives us occasion to ask ourselves, Â“How far am I from the Kingdom of God?Â” This scribeÂ’s knowledge was not merely book knowledge, for it is not in simply knowing a certain number of truths that we obtain the Kingdom of God. Rather it was an intimate knowledge of love Â– knowing in a practical way how to give oneÂ’s heart, soul, mind and strength to God.<br><br><strong>Dialogue with Christ</strong>: Thank you Lord for this time of prayer. I hope that after this short time with you, I am a little closer to your kingdom. Help me during these days of Lent to purify my heart so that I can love you with a genuine love. Help me to keep in mind your commandment of love and to live it with all my strength. I do not want to live my faith with a mere intellectual knowledge of your commandments but to live it with a deep intimate knowledge that bears fruits of true holiness.<br><br><strong>Resolution</strong>: Before beginning each activity of the day I will stop and ask myself how I can live it with love.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Let us pray for all those young people who are thinking of giving a year of their lives to God, so that our Lord will strengthen them in their decision<br></div>
