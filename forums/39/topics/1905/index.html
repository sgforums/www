            <div class='col-md body'>SAJC -- St. Andrew's Junior College, one of the reputable colleges in Singapore, led by the Principal of high status, Mrs Belinda Charles, forces students to do charity work and sets a minimum amount of money that students must collect during flag day. This is totally unreasonable. Does charity work amount from the amount of money collected in the end? Is it necessary for the school to force students to re-do their flag raising day if they do not collect the desired amount of money? Charity work comes from the heart. What's the point of raising so much money when one doesn't put much hard work into it? A rich person who merely donates a few hundred dollars from his own pocket, should thus, in Mrs Charles words, be deemed as contributing a "huge" amount of charity to the society? If Mrs Charles was so "great", why doesn't she join us, students in charity work down at Orchard Road in such a hot weather? Why is she so rich living in huge bungalows, but doesn't join in the quest for donations doing street donations? Yeah...we all know that she joins in -- by forcing students from her college to do the charity work for her. And all she does is gladly receiving praises from the bigwigs at the Ministry of Education (Singapore) for doing such "great" charity work. Students like us, sweat it out in streets trying to raise funds for the elderly and disabled. Even though we do not raise large amounts of money, we have put in lots of efforts. Is there a need to redo our charity work yet again just because we do not meet the minimum amount that should be collected? Is this justifiable? Students like us do not get the chance to speak up in public against such rulings...all because we are afraid of being "marked" by the Principal with high status, Mrs Belinda Charles. Is any government officials are reading this, could they please bring this matter up? But I guess they won't...since Mrs Belinda Charles is also part of the "white bearing" government officials.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The current principal is now Mrs Lim Chye Ting and so far I haven't heard of students having to redo their flag days just because they have not raised the so-called targeted amount of money for the charity. Flag days in St. Andrew's Junior College are mostly voluntary. Students can choose if they want to go for a particular flag day or not. But of course, they are ADVISED to because of our precious PEARLS points. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I've been to flag day ONCE... My experience was that after the time was up, I returned to the collection point and handed my tin to the person in-charge, who was not from my school. Hence, I don't think the principal, or anyone else from the school could have known the amount of money a student raised, unless the charity organization informed the school of it. But WHY, if they do, inform the school of the amounts of money raised?<br><br>I've still got more to say... But ho, nono. We shouldn't be washing out dirty linen in public, should we? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If the Saints community has any grievances, hey, voice them to the Student Council alright? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Please don't tarnish the school's reputation here. I'm not trying to say that we don't have the freedom of speech but please, not here. It's not going to help much. If the school has a bad reputation it's not the school itself that suffers only. The students don't benefit from it either.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's kind of surprising how things like this still do happen.<br><br>I'm from the batch of 91, and was around when Mrs Charles was posted to SAJC. Back in those days, we never had the problem of having to redo the flag days (since I was in Yr2 when she posted in, so we're somewhat exempted). But I had a bad experience then. Won't say who my CT is, but she's the one who made it bad. As I was a problem child throughout my 3 yrs stay in SA, Mrs Charles remember me, even til this day.<br><br>What I want to say is this; back in 91, I had a long discussion with her before I was allowed back to SA to repeat my As, and this was one of them. I questioned the whole idea behind raising funds for the school's renovation proj (yeah, we were the pioneers who raised the money so you guys can enjoy real good facilities today). I don't know if she bought my story, but she definitely know what I'm talking about.<br><br>So in retrospect, it might not have been a case where she made it happened. Someone might have decided on it. I don't know. And we don't know the other side of the story either. I'm not defending Mrs Charles here, tho I do owe her a lot (otherwise I never would have gotten my degree in NUS).<br><br>In any case, she's moved on to SAS. And of course, another big round of fund raising over there to consolidate the entire family. I just wanna leave this thought behind for you guys since I know we'd be looking at more fund raising events for this big consolidation:<br><br>Do the fund raising because you want to give the school something in return. Don't do it because you have any grudges against some teacher, or even the principal. No one forced you to go SAJC (maybe your parents *shrug*), but as long as you are there, SA has definitely tried to do something with you, so do something for the school. For the future. So try. You can fight your battle with your teachers in class, or even within compounds of the school. But the school is another matter altogether. So even though I consider my donation little, I'm glad you guys got to enjoy many of the things (eg, the rubber track; we ran on TAR tracks in our days) which we'd never got to enjoy. Just memories and many lessons in life we gained.<br><br>I'm glad I learn this point after my bitter experience with my CT, when I discussed this with my classmate. We may have something against the teacher, or even the canteen operator, but never have anything against the school.<br><br>My 2 cents.</div>
