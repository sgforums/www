            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, one of my bosses told me that for my career advancement, I must move out of my department to take up some sort of leadership role elsewhere. My organisation is big. Some of us are given opportunities to try out different roles and move across departments.<br><br>I don't want to move. My department was the place of growth and fulfillment. And my friends are all there. Besides, I have already been moved once.<br><br>'You will be able to get more exposure and get to work with different people. We don't want you to get too comfortable'.<br><br>What is wrong with being comfortable with the people we work well with? Why can't I continue to contribute to my department and make it even better? I know I still have so much to give! And why must I be separated from the people I love?<br><br>Not everyone, not even the smartest or the most intelligent, work for money. Some of us, like me, value wonderful working relationships and are willing to stall our own career advancements to be part of the team that truly believes in us and where our colleagues have become friends. And don't be mistaken, it is not because we are cowards without courage to meet the demands of a more challenging job.<br><br>I just want to live authentically and work, love and play with the people who, for that particular period of time, belong to my world. I can't let them go, and I refuse to let them go. Call me 'idiot' or 'fool'.<br><br>After working for a while, money just isn't everything. Ambition doesn't understand the dynamics and passion that govern human relationships. He doesn't know that some humans can give up fame and glory to be with the people they cherish.<br><br>I am one of them.<br><br>Jane Eyre says, "Human beings must love something". Some humans must become someone some day. In the power of vision that presents life beyond the physical and mundane, I know the journey matters more than the destination. I don't need that 'She is somebody' tag. I already am, because I know the happiness of one who is loved.<br><br>I hope my bosses understand that there is nothing wrong with being loyal and letting go of some opportunities for someone or something more important, just like there is nothing wrong with being left-handed.<br><br>I don't want to live tomorrow regretting what I did or did not do today.<br><br></div>
