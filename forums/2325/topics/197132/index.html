            <div class='col-md body'>Our Prime Minister goes overseas and proclaims that Singapore has enough space for free speech. He cited the speaker's corner as an example.<br><br>Our speaker's corner is a mockery because hardly anyone goes there now. Too much hassle and only the birds of Hong Lim Square perch on trees to listen to the occasional ramblings.<br><br>People who really have a view would rather write to the various forum pages. More convenience and more audience. Millions read them everyday, since newspapers reach out to roughly the same number.<br><br>But...here's a big 'BUT'.<br><br>Though many desire to write, not all can write.<br><br>Civil servants can't write. Oh, they can but they have to seek clearance for the articles they write. By the time clearance comes or never comes, the topic would have become passe. A friend once remarked that a public servant is subject to institutional ruling. The period of clearance, no matter how long, and going by the 3-7-21 service standards, can take an average of 5 working days, will not change because someone wants his article published.<br><br>If a written view, and one that is written out of a genuine heart, has to be cleared, why tell us we are an open society? Having caveats and curtailments suppress free speech and undermine its truest ideals.<br><br>And if the authorities seek authentic views, people must be allowed to express themselves through mediums that they are able to express themselves most effectively in or on platforms that they would like to be heard from, no hands bared. That means writing to the forum page for some. Personally, I feel there is more than a subtle sense of clarity in the written word.<br><br>And, don't civil servants pay taxes? They do, therefore, no one, including their employers, has the right to suppress or silence their voices.<br><br>If what is said is offensive or challenge OB markers, then good, let it be taken up, debated upon and intellectually discussed. We will genuinely have a cause for change and purpose for action.<br><br>Silence and silencing kill a society's progress and people's sense of belonging.<br><br>We should not pay lip service to free speech and democracy. The archaic law of civil servants, who are Singaporeans too, having to seek clearance to express their views should be reconsidered and at an opportune time, be abolished.<br><br>In conclusion, many have realised that no one can be apolitical. The civil service and those who are heading it should not delude themselves any more.<br><br></div>
