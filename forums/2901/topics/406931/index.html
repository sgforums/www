              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong>Lesson One</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong>EACH OF US IS A LIVING
              SOUL</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong>WITHIN A MATERIAL BODY</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">At
              every moment our bodies are changing. Just contemplate on your
              present body. You are in the prime of youth now. How did your body
              look like twenty years ago? Try to comprehend how this body will be
              after fifty years. In the course of our life we actually have many
              different bodies – infant, child, youth, adult, and so on – but
              we remain the same person.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Am I a Lump of
              Chemicals?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">According
              to Dr. Harry Monsen, Professor of anatomy at Illinois College of
              Medicine, your body is worth only Rs. 110/- if the cost of all the
              chemicals that constitute your body is considered. </span><strong>Do you
              think you are worth only Rs. 110/-?</strong><span style="font-weight: medium;"> Will your parents sell you off even if someone pays them 50 crore
              rupees? When a living person looses his small finger or has to get
              his kidney replaced, he is ready to spend lakhs and lakhs of rupees.
              What is there in a living body that makes it so valuable? And why is
              a dead body utterly valueless, although all the chemicals are still
              there in it?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">The
              most fundamental knowledge delivered by Sri Krishna to Arjuna in </span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Bhagavad-gita</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> is that we are not these bodies; we are spirit souls. The body is
              only mere temporary covering or dress. The soul (living force) is
              present in the plants, animals and human beings. Wherever there is
              life there must be a soul, because the soul is life. Whether it is an
              amoeba or an elephant or a human being, the soul is present within
              each body.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What
              Exactly is the Soul?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>The
              soul is the spark of life that activates every body and enables it to
              function,</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> just as electric current activates a device and enables it to
              function. The soul can be compared to a driver and the body to a
              vehicle. The soul is the spark of life that makes the body appear
              alive and when the soul leaves the body, the person is said to be
              dead.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Scientific
              Proof of the Soul’s Existence</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">We
              are accustomed to understanding the term ‘science’ only in
              relation to matter and energy. There is however, a higher dimensional
              science that deals with the subject of the soul and spiritual energy.
              By nature spirit is ‘transcendental’ to matter. In other words,
              the soul is intrinsically beyond material sense perception. The
              techniques of material science are inadequate to ‘prove’ the
              existence of the soul in as much as the ear is incapable of detecting
              light. The soul can however, by realized as a higher reality by
              following the laws of spiritual science. Ultimately, all spiritual
              truth is revealed and ‘proved’ from within, by experience. Yet
              the following points may help us better understand the presence of
              soul.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>Common
              senses</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">When
              a person dies we say, “He has passed away.” Now who has passed
              away? The body of the person still lies there. The fact is that the
              source of life, the soul, has passed away from the body and therefore
              the person is now called dead.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>Intuitive
              Understanding</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">We
              have an intuitive understanding the </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>the
              real self, the ‘I’, is distinct from the body, mind and
              intelligence.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> We speak in terms of ‘my hand’, ‘my head’ etc. This way we
              can start from the top of the hair down to the tip of the toe and say
              every part of this body is ‘mine’. This indicates that these
              things belong to somebody, an owner. The eyes, ears and brain are
              merely organs, through which we see, hear or think. These organs in
              themselves cannot do any activity. There are eyes, ears and a brain
              even in a dead body. The activities have stopped because the driver,
              the soul, has left the body.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>Consciousness</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">There
              is consciousness in a living body, Just like the sun spreads heat and
              light all around, the soul spreads consciousness all around the body,
              from the tip of the toes and fingers to the top of the head. It is
              this consciousness that enables us to think, feel, move and so on.
              Thus, </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>consciousness
              is the symptom of the soul.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> Consciousness is what distinguishes a dead body from a living one. A
              machine can easily be built to respond to red light with the
              statement, “I see red light”, but does the experience of seeing
              red light accompany this mechanical response? As Thomas Huxley
              rightly said, “There is a third thing in the universe, to wit,
              consciousness, which I cannot see to be matter or force.”
              Consciousness gives the proof of the soul.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>Near
              Death Experience (NDE)</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">NDEs,
              as the name suggests, involve people who have a close call with
              death. Many people having NDEs also have Out-of-Body Experiences
              (OBEs) in which they report observing their physical body and events
              relating to it from a perspective outside the body during severe
              illness or physical trauma resulting in unconsciousness. A typical
              case might involve a person who is resuscitated from a heart attack
              and reports that he observed, from a point outside his body, the
              medical personnel endeavouring to revive him. At such times,
              according to standard medical opinion, the normal functioning of the
              brain, as indicated by certain brain waves, is impaired, and the
              patient should be unconscious, if indeed consciousness is a
              manifestation of the brain.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">There
              is enough research work in NDE presented by individuals with
              impeccable scientific credentials. For example, </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Dr
              Michael B Sabom, a cardiologist and professor at the Emory University
              Medical School,</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> was openly skeptical of NDEs but changed his mind after investigating
              them. Based on rigorous research, Sabom writes: “If the human brain
              is actually composed of two fundamental elements – the ‘mind’
              amd the ‘brain’ - then could the near death crisis event somehow
              trigger a transient splitting of the mind from the brain in many
              individuals... The out-of-body hypothesis simply seems to fit best
              with the data at hand... </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Could
              the mind which splits apart from the physical brain be, in essence,
              the soul,</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> which continues to exist after final bodily death, according to some
              religious doctrine? As I see it, this is the ultimate question that
              has been raised by reports of the NDE.”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>Past
              Life Memories</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Rigorous,
              unbiased studies have been carried out by serious researchers on
              past-life memories. </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>Dr
              Ian Stevenson, Carlson Professor of Psychiatry at the University of
              Virginia,</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> has extensively investigated spontaneous reincarnation memories
              recounted by children. In such cases he has been able to positively
              corroborate what the child has claimed by thorougly investigating
              details of the place and people they describe, including the dead
              person they claim to have been. Stevenson has assembled numerous
              accounts and verified them, always taking great care to screen out
              fabrications. </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>His
              studies give convincing evidence that the conscious self can travel
              from one physical body to the next.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Clearly,
              when one body dies, the contents of its brain are destroyed, and
              there is no physical process by which they can influence the contents
              of another brain. The simplest interpretation is that the conscious
              self must be an entity distinct from the brain.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Is
              Man Just a Powerful Computer or Robot?</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">A
              computer is controlled by a series of instructions (written in
              suitable computer languages like C, C++, VB). It is evident that a
              computer has to be programmed by an intelligent human being. Whatever
              ability a computer has, be it number crunching, object
              identification, natural language processing etc. is imparted to the
              computer by a sentient conscious human being. In other words, if the
              programmer programs his computer system to sum two plus two as five
              it would do so. Similarly if a computer system hooked with a vision
              system is programmed to recognize a square object as round it would
              do so. A computer cannot understand anything by itself. By itself,
              without bring programmed, it is a dumb machine.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">For
              example, consider a drama, which is being observed by a panel of
              judges and is also being recorded by a video camera. The judge is
              using his eyes to record the scene being enacted and the video camera
              is recording all the incidents using the lenses, which are the
              machine analog of the eyes. Both the machine and the human observer
              record the data and information, but the human observer also
              ‘experiences’ the phenomenon. The judges, for instance, go
              through a whole range of emotions like elation, sorrow, anger etc.
              while they view the play. The video camera, on the other hand, merely
              records the play visually. At the end, the judges make a decision as
              to which actor was the best based on the series of images projeted in
              front of the eye. However the video recorder cannot make any such

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">The
              difference is that although, both the human observer and the camera
              are watching the play, the human being is ‘conscious’, whereas
              the camera is devoid of any consciousness. Hence the main difference
              between man and machine is consciousness.</span></span></p>

              soul has two coverings – the gross body and the subtle body.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> The gross body, also known as the ‘sthula sharira’ is made up of
              five elements – earth, water, fire, air and ether. Earth represents
              all solids, water represents all liquids, fire represents light and
              radiation, air represents all gases and ether represents space and
              sound.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">The
              mind, intelligence and false ego constitute the subtle body. The
              subtle body is also called as the ‘sukshma sharira’. ‘True ego’
              is to understand that ‘I am spirit soul, eternal servant of God’.
              ‘False ego’ is to think in illusion that, ‘I am this body’.
              The subtle body and the gross body are coverings on the soul. Such a
              soul entrapped in these subtle and gross bodies is called a
              ‘conditioned soul’. One who becomes free from these covering and
              attains spiritual consciousness is called a ‘liberated soul’.</span></span></p>

              body is compared to a car and the soul to the driver.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> If an unintelligent puppy sees a big car coming on the road, it may
              be scared thinking a big animal is coming on four wheels. But a
              knowledgeable man will know that it is only a dead car, which is
              driven by a driver. There are headlights in the car to see the road,
              you also see with your eyes. The car produces sound with the horn,
              you also speak. The car has four wheels, you also have two hands and
              two legs. The car moves from place to place and you also do the same.
              But once the driver gets down from the car, the car cannot budge even
              one inch after 100 years. Similarly when a person dies, his body
              becomes completely inactive. It is exactly liek a car without a
              driver. The body that we see is actually dead. It appears to be
              lively because of the presence of the soul. When the soul leaves the
              body, the body becomes inactive.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Our
              bodies grow and change because the living soul is present within the

              activities cease. </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>The

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Every
              living body in this material world undergoes six changes: birth,
              growth, maintenance, production of by-products (chemicals,
              offspring), diminution and destruction. These changes happen to all
              living bodies, whether they be plants, animals or human beings. For
              example, a child is born, grows into youth, remains young for a few
              years, produces a child, gradually ages and finally dies. We cannot
              stop this by our so-called material science. Sometimes people
              foolishly think that by scientific advancement human beings will
              become immotal. We cannot even stop these six changes in the body,
              where is the question of stopping death?</span></span></p>

              and Perfect Knowledge of Evolution</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Darwin’s
              evolution theory is an imperfect understanding of the real spiritual
              evolution, which takes place by the transmigration of the soul from
              one body to another. Originally, the living entity is a spiritual
              being, but when he desires to enjoy this material world, he falls
              down from the spiritual world. First, the living entity accepts a
              body that is human in form, but gradually, due to his degraded
              activities he falls into lower forms of life – into the animal,
              plant and aquatic forms. By the gradual process of evolution through
              8.4 million species of life, the living entity again attains the body
              of a human being and is given another chance to get out of the
              process of transmigration. If he again misses the chance in the human
              form to understand his position, he is again placed in the cycle of
              birth and death in various types of bodies. This is the complete and
              perfect knowledge of evolution. (</span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Srimad

              3,000,000 species of beasts, and 400,000 species of human life”.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">The
              meaning of “species” understood by biologists is different from
              the meaning implied here. The meaning of “species” used by
              biologists applies to the gross physical appearance of the gross
              morphological feature of the living material bodies. The Vedic
              meaning, however, is based on the level of consciousness of the
              living being. For example, biologists say that all human beings
              belong to one species, whereas the Vedic literatures list 400,000
              human species.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">In
              other words, there are 400,000 grades of human beings on different
              levels of consciousness. In the lower levels of consciousness, a
              living entity, although in a human body, behaves just like an animal.
              In a higher level, his consciousness may be slightly evolved and he
              may be selfish for his family. In a still higher level, he is
              concerned about his community, then about his state/country. At a
              higher level, one may become an altruist/philanthropist. And after
              many lifetimes one starts to enquire about God. The living entity
              still develops several conceptions about God in many, many lifetimes,
              until he comes to understand that, “Lord Krishna is the Supreme
              Personality of Godhead and surrendering to Him is the highest goal of
              life”. To stop the repetition of birth and death in different forms
              of life, we must transcend the covering of material nature and come
              to the platform of pure consciousness. But if we do not learn the
              transcendental science of Krishna consciousness, then at death we
              must transfer to another body, either better or worse than our
              present one.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">This
              vast universe is filled with untold billions of eternally living
              spiritual souls or sparks of life and all of them are transmigrating
              from one body to the next. From the tiny one-celled amoeba to the
              great blue whale, all living organisms consist of two basic
              components: the material body and the spiritual soul. The material
              body is a lifeless yet complex arrangement of physical elements and
              the spiritual soul is a spark of life – a spark of supreme life,
              God. Though only one ten-thousandth the tip of hair in size, the soul
              animates one body after another. In its evolutionary course, the soul
              transmigrates from one species to another. In some species he remains
              only a few seconds, in others for as long as several thousand years.
              When a particular body is no longer fit for habitation, the soul
              leaves it and enters a seed, egg or womb to begin developing his next
              body.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Does
              the soul’s transmigration from body to body take place randomly or
              does some higher authority supervise? In one lifetime the spiritual
              soul may enjoy as a lusty rogue, and in the next lifetime he may be
              kicked as a street dog. What determines a particular soul’s next
              body?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">According
              to </span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Bhagavad-gita</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">,
              each soul receives punishment or reward for the sinful or pious acts
              he performs during his human lifetime. This is known as the law of
              karma. Every act a human being performs is either in accord with or
              contrary to the universal laws that God gives in the revealed
              scriptures. God’s scriptural laws govern only those souls who are
              in the human form, because unlike the dull creatures in the lower
              species, the human being has sufficient intelligence to freely obey
              or reject the Lord’s scriptural instructions. However, along with
              that freedom comes accountability. Thus a sinful soul – one who
              breaks God’s laws – may be born as a dog in his next life, a
              pious soul may take his next birth as an aristocrat, and a self
              realized soul may break free from the bonds of karma altogether and
              enter into the deathless spiritual world.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>The </strong></span><em><strong>Bhagavad-gita</strong></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong> further explains that a living soul receives a particular kind of
              body according to his particular desires.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> The subtle body, which accompanies the soul during the transitional
              state between death and rebirth, contains a record of all his
              thoughts, desires and activities, and these determine the kind of
              gross body the living entity will inhabit in his next life.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">When
              you go to a cloth shop you find varieties of clothes – shirts,
              suits, pants, jeans etc. Similarly there are 8.4 million species for
              us to choose. We may acquire any of them to fulfil our desires. Even
              amongst human beings there are so many varieties – asuras,
              civilized, devas etc. Krishna is capable of fulfilling every living
              entity’s desires.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Mental
              activities or psychological activities of thinking, feeling, and
              willing are also activities on the platform of ethereal existence.
              That subtle forms exist in the ether has been proven by modern
              science by transmission of television, by which forms/photographs of
              one place are transmitted to another place by the action of the
              ethereal element. Within the </span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Srimad
              Bhagavatam</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> is the potential basis of great scientific research work, for it
              explains how subtle forms are generated from the ethereal element,
              how the tangible elements namely air, fire, water and earth are
              manifested from the subtle from.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Mental
              existence transforms into tangible form as soon as there is an
              opportunity. So, the soul being carried by the subtle body occupies a
              womb depending on the unfulfilled desires stored in the subtle body.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Think
              of any desire.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Do
              you know someone who likes to sleep a lot?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Nature
              can award him a polar bear’s body so that he can peacefully sleep
              for 6 months in a year without being ridiculed by his friends or
              scolded by his parents.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Do
              you know someone who likes to eat flesh and drink blood? Nature will
              say: “Come On! Take the body of a tiger or a lion and eat flesh the
              natural way!”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Do
              you know someone who likes to be in water always and keep swimming?
              (Some swimmers are mad: they want to swim from the Palk Strait to the
              English canal!) Nature will say: “Come on! Take the body of a fish
              and swim to your heart’s content”.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Some
              people don’t want to wear proper clothes on their body. They want
              to expose major part of their body and draw the attention of opposite
              sex. Nature says: ‘Take the body of a tree, and stand naked to your
              heart’s content in all seasons.’</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">In
              this way each species represents a different ways of enjoyment. So
              these are allotted to the living entities based on their desires.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">So
              we may think of the body either as the soul’s vehicle for
              expressing his material desires, or as the end result of good or bad
              acts the soul performed in his last human birth. Both concepts are
              correct.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">But
              in either case, we see that there must be a witness and controller
              who fulfils the particular desires of each spiritual soul, and who
              rewards or punishes each soul as he deserves. That witness,
              controller, and judge is the Supersoul.</span></span></p>

              Four</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>IN
              THE HUMAN BODY THE SOUL</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>CAN
              DISCOVER THE SUPERSOUL</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Who
              is the Supersoul? The Bhagavad Gita (13.23) says, “Besides the
              atomic spiritual soul. In this body there is another enjoyer a
              transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord. He is the supreme proprietor,
              oversee, and perimeter, and He is known as the Supersoul.” In other
              words, </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>within each
              body there are two souls – the atomic soul (the individual spark of
              life) and the Supersoul (the supreme source of all life).</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> The atomic soul and the Supersoul reside together within the heart of
              each and everybody throughout the universe at the time of death the
              Supersoul accompanies the atomic soul to his next body.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">But
              the Supersoul is not an ordinary living entity. Only by the
              Supersoul’s arrangement does each atomic soul receive his proper
              body, only by the Supersoul’s sanction can the atomic soul fulfils
              his desires for happiness. The Supersoul is the personal expansion of
              Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atomic soul
              dwells within the material body, and he suffers and enjoys the
              various pains and pleasures arising from his particular body. But the
              Supersoul, although fully aware of these pains and pleasures, is
              aloof from them.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Because
              He is aloof from the changing body, whether He accompanies the atomic
              soul within his insect body, his dog body, or his human body, the
              Supersoul stays in the same situation – in transcendence.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">As
              the constant companion of each individual atomic soul, </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>the
              Supersoul fulfils the desires and awards the particular material
              bodies of every living entity.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> And he accompanies them on their course of birth, old age, disease,
              and death – life after life. Lord Krishna explains in the </span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Bhagavad-gita</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> (13.28): “One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual
              soul in all bodies and who understands that neither the soul nor the
              Supersoul is every destroyed he actually sees.”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">One
              may wonder, “If the Supersoul – God – is always with the
              individual atomic soul, why is the atomic soul suffering? Why doesn’t
              the Lord in the heart divert the atomic souls from their suicidal
              course of repeated birth and death? </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>If
              the Supersoul is actually our well wisher, why doesn’t He end our
              suffering?</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">”
              The Upanishads answer this question with the analogy of the two birds
              in the tree.</span></span></p>

              Five</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>THE
              SOUL AND THE SUPERSOUL</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>ARE
              LIKE TWO BIRDS IN THE TREE</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"><strong>OF
              THE BODY</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">The
              Upanishads compare the body to a tree and the soul and Supersoul to
              two friendly birds sitting within the tree. The first bird
              (representing the atomic soul like you and me) is eating the tree’s
              fruits, which are of two kinds – happiness and distress. The second
              bird (representing the Supersoul) is self satisfied, so He doesn’t
              bother with the fruits. He simply watches his friend, the first bird.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Krishna
              is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they
              are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Forgetfulness
              of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of his changing
              his position from one tree to another or from one body to another.
              The atomic soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material
              body, but as soon as the agrees to accept the other bird as the
              supreme spiritual master – as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary
              surrender unto Krishna for instruction in </span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Bhagavad-gita</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> – the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all
              lamentations. Both </span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Katha
              Upanishad</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> and </span></span><em><span style="font-weight: medium;">Svetasvatara
              Upanishad</span></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> confirm this:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium;">samane vrkse puruso nimagno</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">‘<span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">nisaya

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium;">asya mahimanam iti vita-slokah</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“<span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Although
              the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully
              engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of
              the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend
              who is the Lord at once the suffering bird becomes free from all
              anxieties.”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Unfortunately,
              very few souls within this material universe desire to serve the
              Supersoul, break free from the bonds of karma, and return home back
              home to spiritual world. Although this material world is always
              miserable and dangerous, most people’s hearts are filled with so
              many desires to enjoy this world that they doom themselves to stay
              here. Everyone has this freedom and the Supersoul within the heart
              perceiving each spiritual soul’s desires, helps him try to enjoy
              the material world as he wishes birth after birth.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">As
              we can clearly see, the Supersoul is our dearest friend. And since
              the Supersoul is but an expansion of Lord Krishna, that means Krishna
              is our dearest friend. Who is Krishna? The Sanskrit word word
              ‘Krishna’ means ‘all-attractive’. One who possesses all
              beauty, all knowledge, all fame, all strength, all riches and all
              renunciation only can be addressed as ‘Bhagavan’ or Supreme Lord.
              Because Krishna possesses all these in completeness, Krishna is the
              all-attractive Supreme.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">God
              beyond this material creation, whose association all the souls are
              craving for. (How Krishna can be called God is a subject matter
              beyond the scope of this small presentation and it can be explained
              properly and authoritatively if you kindly send a request letter to
              us.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Krishna
              is our dearest friend. However, although Krishna always want us to
              return to Him – so that we can become free from the suffering we’ve
              been going through in one material body after another – He will not
              interfere with our minute free will. Without any freedom, we can’t
              develop any real love for Krishna, and without developing love for
              Krishna, we can’t break our attachment to things of this world and
              go back to the spiritual world.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">It
              is only by surrendering to Lord Krishna and accepting His
              instructions that the spiritual soul can evolve to the highest state
              of existence – pure Krishna consciousness, pure love of God. </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>The </strong></span><em><strong>Bhagavad-gita</strong></em><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong> explains that the soul who has attained love for Krishna doesn’t
              again take birth in this material world after leaving his present
              body. Such a pure soul attains a spiritual body in the spiritual
              world.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;">Covered
              by illusion, we have been desiring and obtaining body after body in
              this miserable material world. Now, if we awaken our spiritual
              desires, our love for Krishna, He will award us an eternal spiritual
              body in the spiritual world. The spiritual world has none of the
              disappointment, despair, fear, and pain that plague the world. That
              is because in the spiritual world every soul is engaged in his
              eternal, natural activity – rendering loving devotional service to
              Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unlike the
              so-called loving relationships of this material world, which are mere
              shadow relationships, </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>our
              loving relationship with Krishna in the spiritual world is our
              original, eternal relationship, and it alone can give us real
              satisfaction and solace.</strong></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: medium;"> Having now attained a human body, we should all take up the process
              of developing our love for Krishna as our most important task – and
              reach the pinnacle of evolution within this lifetime.</span></span></p>
