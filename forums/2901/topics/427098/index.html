                      beautiful that it attracts everyone, including the truth itself. Truth is so beautiful that many sages, saints and devotees have left everything for the sake of the truth. Mahatma Gandhi dedicated his life to experimenting
                      with truth. Every one of us has the urge to search for truth alone, for the absolute truth is not only all-beautiful, but also all-powerful, all-resourceful, all-famous, all-renounced and all-knowledgeable.</span></p>

              with a beautiful girl. The girl was not only beautiful in appearance, but also saintly in character, and, as such, she did not like the man’s advances. The man, however, was insistent because of his lustful desires, and
              therefore the girl requested him to wait for only seven days, and she set a time after which he could meet her. The man agreed and, with great expectations, he began waiting for the appointed time. The saintly girl, however,
              in order to manifest the illusory beauty of the material body and the real beauty of absolute truth, adopted a very instructive method. She took very strong doses of laxatives and purgatives, and, for seven days, she continually
              passed loose stool and vomited all she ate. Moreover, she stored all the loose stool and vomit in suitable pots. As a result of the purgatives, the so-called beautiful girl became lean and thin like a skeleton, her complexion
              turned blackish, and her beautiful eyes sank into the sockets of her skull. Thus disfigured, she waited anxiously at the appointed hour to receive the eager man.</span></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>The man appeared on the scene well dressed and well behaved and asked the ugly girl waiting there about the
              beautiful girl he was to meet. The man could not recognize the girl he saw as the same beautiful girl for whom he was asking; indeed, although she repeatedly asserted her identity, beacuse of her pitiabile condition he was
              unable to recognize her.</span></p>

              pots. She also told him that he could enjoy those juices of beauty. When the mundane poetic man asked to see these juices of beauty, he was directed to the store of loose stool and liquid vomit, which were emanating an unbearably
              bad smell. Thus the whole story of the beauty-liquid was disclosed to him. Finally, by the grace of the saintly girl, this man of low character was able to distingugish between the shadow and the substance, and thus he came
              to his senses.</span></p>

              beauty. The girl mentioned above had a beautifully developed material body in accordance with the desires of her mind, but actually she was apart from that temporary material body and mind. She was, in fact, a spiritual spark,
              and so also was the lover who was attracted by her false skin.</span></p>

              truth and are unaware of the spiritual spark, which is both truth and beauty at the same time. The spiritual spark is so beautiful that, when it leaves the so-called beautiful body, which in fact is full of stool and vomit,
              no one wants to touch that body, even if it is decorated with a costly costume.</span></p>

              is permanently beautiful, retaining the same standard of beauty for innumerable years. That spiritual spark is indestructible. The beauty of teh outer skin can be destroyed in just a few hours merely by doses of strong purgatives,
              but the beauty of truth is indestructible and always the same.</span></p>

              that she forgot to feed the parrot within the cage, and consequently, the parrot became very weak. The body can be compared to the cage and the soul—the living principle—can be compared to the parrot in the cage. So, if
              someone takes very good care of the cage by polishing it clean, but ignores the needs of the parrot, then the whole purpose of keeping the parrot in the cage is defeated. Jesus asked, “What profiteth a man if he gains the
              whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul? </span></p>

              the driver needs food, similarly our material body needs food for sustenance and our soul has to be fed spiritual food—spiritual knowledge and spiritual engagement. The human body is awarded with special intelligence to
              inquire about the Absolute Truth. And such inquiry is essential, because it alone can satisfy the soul. Therefore, one should work only to earn one’s sustenance and spend the balance time, energy and resources in understanding
              the ultimate goal of life and freeing oneself from the cycle of birth and death. </span></p>

                  is that we may be living longer than our ancestors, but we are not happier than them. By prolonging our life, we are only increasing our pain. There are so many different kinds of diseases. Though medical science is trying
                  to find out remedies for them, medical history shows that by the time science finds the cure for one disease, another, even more deadly disease comes up, as has happened in the case of cancer, syphilis, gonorrhea, AIDS, etc.
                  We may cure one disease for sometime, but we can not cure disesase per se. The pain suffered through diseasse is a common experience for everyone and needs no explanation.</span></p>

                  paniful and the dying person experiences a pain that is equivalent to the simultaneous biting of 40,000 scorpions. The great sage Kapila informs his mother abouth the ghastly nature of the death experience, “in that diseased
                  condidion the dying person’s eyes bulge due to the pressure of air from within, and his glands become congested with mucus. He has difficulty breathing, and there is a rattling sound within his throat... thus he dies most
                  pathetically” [Srimad Bhagvatam 3.30.16-18]. The soul is so habituated to living in the body that he must be forced out by the laws of ntaure at the time fo death. Just as a person suffers greatly when he is forcibly evicted
                  from his home, similarly the soul suffers immentsely when he is focibly kicked out of the body. In nature, we see that even the tiniest creatures display the most amazing abilities and techniques for escaping death when their
                  lives are threatened. But as death is inevitable for all living being, so are the fear and pain associated with it. </span></p>

                  the mind cause numerous problems. Some examples are: Every third American is forced to consult a psychiatrist due to mental frustration. In old age, the deteriorating body gives varieties of problems. For example, once a person
                  grows beyond 80 years, he can neither sit nor stand without agonizing back pain.</p>

                  one else, then a mosquito or a virus, is sure to make your life miserable. For example, sometimes we see even so-called educated people in cities fighting in the court for a common verandah outside tehir flats for years together.

                  in the weather such as scorching heat, freezing cold, untimely rains, and so on.</p>

                  him food, clothing, shelter and even medication, but under punishment. Similarly the rebellious living entities, who are not ready to serve the Lord, are unfit to live in the kingdom of God. So they are sent to this material
                  world which is exactly like a jail. God has provided us food, water, air, light, etc but all these facilities are provided under the punishment of the threefold miseries of the material nature.</span></p>

              used to reduce the misery of sweating. A grinder is used to avoid the misery of manual grinding. A motor cycle is used to avoid the misery of pedaling a cycle. These are simple examples. In a similar way, all advances in science,
              technology and medicine are aimed at putting an end to miseries or, at least, reducing them.</span></p>

              again come up to the surface in some other form. There is a very instructive story to explain this point. Once, a man got a boil on his body. A doctor gave him an ointment to apply on it. He applied it and got cured. He was
              happy. But after a few days, he got a similar boil in another part of this body. He again went to the doctor. The doctor asked him to keep applying the ointment whenever the boil came. But the suffering man asked the doctor,
              “That’s alright. But every time I get the boil, it lasts for a week and, throughout that week, I have to endure severe pain. Is there no way to put an end to this problem altogether?” The doctor kept mum, because he
              knew no permanent solution to the boil problem. The patient went to another doctor, who could understand the root-cause of the problem â€• impurity in the blood. He treated the patient’s blood and the patient was permanently
              cured.</span></p>

              trouble with the boils again and again. This is because people do not know the root cause of the problem â€• misidentification of oneself with matter. Due to such misidentification, the spirit soul is forced to undergo the
              cycle of repeated birth, old age, disease and death.</span></p>

              never offer solution to these problems? It is because science can offer only material solutions and no material adjustment or manipulation can stop these problems. Therefore, spiritual solution is the only way out. At best,
              science can offer temporary stopgap patch-up solutions â€• nothing more.</span></p>

              these are no solutions; they are only ‘covering up’ the harsh realities of life. The body is, after all, a dead corpse, which is bound to decay and die. Where is the solution to death, old age, disease, and repeated birth?</span></p>

              they endeavor, the result is only suffering. Why? What is wrong? At least this repeated frustration can bring one to the platform of sanity, to the understanding that there must be some supreme controller who is conducting
              this world to behave in a particular way. A Godless civilization centered around a rat race for sense gratification can never bring about peace and harmony; it can only bring about war and dissatisfaction.</span></p>

              and discouraging you when you do bad things? We can show vivid examples to substantiate this. People who indulge in illicit sex get AIDS and lose all immunity in the body due to which they may die contracting even a minor
              disorder like cold or fever. People who take tobacco, liquor etc., undergo varieties of complications. These are evidences to show that God does not want them to indulge in these things. A sensible hoarding said, “Jhing
              ksanaachi vaat maranaachi.” This is a Marathi phrase, which means ‘Things like cigarette, drugs etc., may give a momentary kick or pleasure but they pave the road to death. On the other hand, those who perform mantra meditation
              and cultivate the virtuous qualities of humility, sense control, austerity, cleanliness, tolerance, honesty, etc., do not suffer from such complicated ailments. In fact, they achieve peace of mind and happiness. In the Vedas,
              God has given us a suitable program for the benefit of the body, the mind and the soul.</span></p>

              a resident of this eternal realm. The Supreme Lord is one amongst many souls, who are all subordinate to Him. Every soul is endowed with a minute, independence either to choose to love and serve God or to be independent of
              God and struggle for illusory so-called enjoyment in this material world. The souls in this world have chosen the second option.</span></p>

              by following the instructions mentioned in the revealed scriptures, are called devotees and God personally takes charge of their protection and maintenance. And God’s external energy takes charge of punishing the other living
              entities. Just like any government has a prison department to deal with the criminals, God has created this material world for the rebellious souls to enjoy (or in illusion think they are enjoying). The soul being a part and
              parcel of God, can be happy only when he is serving God with love and devotion and not otherwise. The living being who desires to enjoy independent of God will never get satisfaction exactly like a fish out of water can never
              be satisfied with any amount of comforts. Only when the fish is put back in its original position in the water can it become completely happy. Similarly the spirit soul can be happy only in the spiritual world which is his
              original home. The so-called facilities and comforts of the material world can never satisfy the pure soul who is in search of eternal bliss through loving union with God.</span></p>

              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><em><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>Harer nama harer nama<br>harer namaiva kevalam </span></em><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>|</span><em><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'><br>kalau nastyva nastyva<br>nastyva gatir anyatha </span></em><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>||</span></p>

              chanting of the name of Lord Hari, the chanting of the name of Lord Hari. There is no other way, there is no other way, there is no other way.”</span></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>There are hundreds and thousands of names of God and all of them are very powerful. But the Kali-santarana
              Upanishad specifically mentions a maha-mantra or, the great chant for deliverance, which is called the Hare Krishna maha-mantra:</span></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><strong><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri"; font-weight: bold;'>HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA<br>KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE |<br>HARE RAMA HARE RAMA<br>RAMA
              RAMA HARE HARE ||</span></strong></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>The glory of this mahamantra is that it is non-different from the Lord Himself. In the material world, a
              substance and its name are different. For example the substance ‘water’ and the word ‘water’ are different; so a thirsty man may keep on yelling the word ‘water’ hundreds of times, but his thirst is not going to
              be quenched until someone brings him the substance ‘water’. On the contrary, his thirst is only going to increase. But in the spiritual realm, all living beings as well as the Supreme Lord are absolute. Thus the holy name
              of the Lord is non-different from Him, that is, by regularly chanting the holy names of the Lord, we can actually perceive His presence in those names.</span></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>Although the words in the maha mantra may appear to be a mere combination of some alphabets, nonetheless
              they are spiritu al seeds. Just like a child cannot understand how a 500-rupee currency note is different from ordinary paper, a common man may not appreciate the special spiritual potency of this holy vibration as compared
              to ordinary mundane words. Even if one is unable to understand the potency of the Hare Krishna maha mantra, still one can chant it and gain the benefit exactly like a patient who gets the benefit of the medicine administered
              by a doctor even if he does not know its potency.</span></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>The Supreme Lord is all-attractive. He is therefore supremely beautiful. When a living entity sees that Lord
              face to face, his tryst with eternal beauty is forever fulfilled. All his desires are fully satisfied and he lives an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.</span></p>
              <p class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: "Calibri";'>Simply by the sincere chanting of the holy names of the Lord, one can achieve the ultimate goal of life of
              seeing everlasting beauty face to face. That stage is the perfection of one’s life. In that stage, one will feel boundless joy due to one’s loving relationship with the Lord and one will never depart from the truth even
              for a moment.</span></p>

              that a person next to the chanter can hear it. While chanting, concentrate on hearing the maha-mantra. This concentration is mantra meditation and is powerful for cleaning our hearts. It is difficult to stop the mind wandering
              but as with anything else practice makes perfect. Note that the mantra should be chanted distinctly so that each- syllable can be clearly heard.</span></p>

              One can chant in any situation - on a train, while going to work or waling on the street - but it is best to finish our fixed quota of chanting with full concentration early in the morning, before starting one’s routine
              daily activities.</span></p>
