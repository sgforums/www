              <p>After visiting the Shree Lakshminarayan temple, Bangulzai and I got into a short discussion about Rama and Sita, whose picture they have in the worship area. Here's some stuff on Rama from Wikipedia:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The name Ramayana is a tatpurusha compound of RÄ�ma and ayana "going, advancing", translating to "Rama's Journey". The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books, and 500 cantos (kÄ�á¹‡á¸�as), <em>and tells the story of Rama (an incarnation of the Hindu preserver-god Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon (Rakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana.</em> Thematically, the epic explores themes of human existence and the concept of dharma.<br>In the Uttara Kanda, Rama banishes his wife Sita, even as she is pregnant, asking Lakshmana to deliver her safely to Rishi Valmiki's ashram. He does so when it is reported to him that some subjects of his in Ayodhya believed that Sita was unchaste due to her long captivity in Ravana's city. As a king is expected to uphold moral principles, and the keeping of an unchaste woman is considered a violation of said principles, Rama reluctantly banished Sita in order to uphold his duty as a king.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>Rama and Sita were also the subject of a Philippine musical. Take note, this was a 1988 production, pretty impressive for its time. Hopefully someone can comment on its faithfulness to the Hindu original. If anyone's curious I can help figure out what's going on. I wish I could translate it fully but I'm not very good at Filipino :)</p>
              <p>If you like the videos below, there are many other videos of the same production in the Youtube user's channel.</p>

              <p>Yes, that's an elephant =P From Wikipedia, "Vishnu's eternal consort Lakshmi took birth as Sita and was found by king Janaka of Mithila while he was ploughing a field." I guess that means Rama and Sita really are a couple who's meant for each other.</p>
