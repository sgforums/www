              <p>Be Open To Possibilities</p>
              <p>When you imagine your future, do you see unlimited potential or do you see a lack of opportunities? Almost everyday, we are overrun by bad news, bleak outlooks, and people who complain about how miserable their lives are. In such a climate, it's no small task remaining upbeat and optimistic. But it is precisely that kind of positive attitude that will open your eyes to the opportunities that are always present.</p>
              <p>Many of the circumstances appear to block us only because of the assumptions we make. In other words, if we colour our view of the world with negative energy, our behaviour towards it will appear to elicit an unfavourable response. If you look at your environment through cracked and grimy glasses, you won't see a pretty picture.</p>
              <p>When you participate in negative dialogue, either with yourself or with others, you are setting yourself up for failure. It's almost as if there's an instinct to prove oneself right, and if you think things will turn out badly, your thoughts and action will contribute to that result. When you retreat from a world you perceive as grim, you're closing yourself off to the possibilities.</p>
              <p>But what happens if you remain open to the possibilities? When you view the world from a perspective of unlimited potential, your attitude will shift. So will the way you engage your employees, customers, friends and family; everyone you come into contact with. You will project an image of abundance, and your drive and hope will inspire those around you. You will become a motivating force in a climate of openness and courage, a climate that gives back to you just as much, if not more, than what you gave to create it.</p>
              <p>When we're open to possibilities, we see further and are more inclined to take risks. Risks that may not always yield the results we want, but which create more paths towards our goals. You're only a failure if you stop trying. Because opportunities for success are limitless - when one doesn't pay off the way you imagined, there's always the next, and the next. One of them will be the one to catapult you forward, and it could just be the next one.</p>
              <p>Being open means that you have to stand confident in the realm of possibilities - no matter the competition and no matter your fear. If your entire focus is on what your competitors are doing, your attitude will be passed on to your employees, and, ultimately, your clients. But if you focus on what you do best and how to better satisfy your clients and engage with them in new and powerful ways, your results will be quite different!</p>

              <p>yesterday at Mass, the parish priest did say something very pertinent..</p>
              <p>when bad things happen, people ask "God, why me?"</p>
              <p>when good things happen, people say "It's about time it happened to me!"</p>
              <p>but.. do we ask "Why me?" when good things happen?</p>
              <p>i give thanks.. for little things, for big things, even when things seem to go wrong...</p>
              <p>even when things go wrong, if we look at them as something we will eventually overcome and learn, it is something to give thanks for.. because if we learn from it, we have become a little wiser, and therefore the bad thing becomes a good thing..</p>
              <p>and from there, our lives become a lot happier, brighter and we realise, life is wonderful</p>

              <p>Opportunities are endless. Are you able to see it. Control the situation . Seize the opportunity. I always believe that the greatest risk is to risk nothing,The person who risk nothing ,  does nothing  , has nothing ; is nothing and becomes nothing. And everything has a price to pay. Sacrfices now will reward you later.</p>
              <p>Its hard to know what the future holds.Anticipation,prediction.Frustration.Disappointments.Success.Failures.Choices.Decisions.But all these are making me feel alive.</p>
