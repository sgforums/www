            <div class='col-md body'>Something to Think About.......<br>You will never look at a cup of coffee the same way again.<br>A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and<br>how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was<br>going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting<br>and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose.<br><br>Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water.<br><br>In the first, she placed carrots; in the second she placed eggs;<br>and in the last she placed ground coffee<br>beans.<br><br>She let them sit and boil without saying a word.<br><br>In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners.<br><br>She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the<br>eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out<br>and placed it in a bowl.<br><br>Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what do you see?"<br>"Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.<br><br>She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots.<br>She did, and noted that they had gotten<br>soft.<br><br>She then asked her to take an egg and break it.<br>After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg.<br><br>Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled,<br>as she tasted its rich aroma.<br><br>The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?"<br><br>Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced<br>the same adversity - boiling water - but each had reacted<br>differently.<br><br>The carrot went in strong, hard and unrelenting.<br>However,<br>after being subjected to the boiling water,<br>it softened and became weak.<br><br>The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its<br>liquid interior. But, after sitting through the boiling water,<br>its inside became hardened.<br><br>The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were<br>in the boiling water they had changed the water.<br><br>"Which are you?" she asked her daughter.<br><br>"When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?<br>Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?"<br><br>Think of this:<br>Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong,<br>but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and<br>lose my strength?<br><br>Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes<br>with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death,<br>a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I<br>become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same,<br>but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit<br>and a hardened heart?<br><br>Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the<br>hot water, the very<br>circumstance that brings the pain.<br>When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor.<br><br>If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst,<br>you get better and change the situation around you.<br>When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest<br>do you elevate to another level?<br>How do you handle Adversity?<br>ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?</div>
