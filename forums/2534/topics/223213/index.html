            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I just lost another boyfriend, which makes umm...4 in 5 months, and if your still don't know why, it's because they can't accept me as I'm transsexual.<br><br>/rant<br><br>So what's different now? I mean I'm still the very same girl which they fell in love from the start. In their eyes I was an angel, the perfect girlfriend, fun; pretty; cute; sweet; basically, everything they were looking for in me. But when I tell them the truth, everything just changes completely.<br><br>He promised me it wouldn't end up the same way like it did with my previous boyfriend, but that's pretty much how it turned out. Initially they are left a little shocked, but still okay, and they think that it's still possible for things to work out. But then a few hours later the full impact strikes them, and they realize what's going on, then they tell you "Sorry, but I don't think I can continue this relationship. However we can still be friends."<br><br>Friends? Yea right. Things never remain the same after that. They just seem to distance themselves further and further away from me. They ignore my phone calls, ignore my messages. Even when I manage to get them to respond to me, most of the time their replies are as dead as...dead, or they try to find a way to get away from you.<br><br>A chat with me and my second-last ex after 1 month of not talking.<br>Me: Hello.<br>Him: Hi umm, I'm busy now, I'll call you back later.<br>Me: Okay...<br>(he never called back)<br><br>A chat with my last ex after 2 weeks of not talking.<br>Me: Hello, are you free now?<br>Him: Huh? Err, actually I was just going to watch something.<br>Me: Oh...<br>Him: Err, if you still want to talk, I can while I watch my show.<br>Him: Actually, nevermind, I'll just watch my stuff, and have my lunch, then I got some things to do.<br>Him: Bye bye then.<br>Me: Bye...<br><br>Have your read today's article on how people with AIDS are discriminated against, and choose to keep it from people around them, except those whom matter? Well, it's similar to what I experience, not in terms of people don't want to share things with me, but more on how people distance themselves from you, how you lose friends, how you become an outcast.<br><br>Is it that hard to accept a transsexual woman? I mean, hey, I'm still the same person you fell in love with. Am I fated to be alone for the rest of my life? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for taking so long to reply; I've been really busy this last week at my church, and will probably be busy next week too as I've been practicing daily for dances, performances, as well as helping prepare things for my Thailand mission trip in 10 days. Will be leaving on the 20th, and back on the 28th, 3 days after Christmas. I'm a little sad to be away from home during Christmas, but heck, there'll be plently more in the future. =)<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the advice everyone, especially the Bear *hugs*. I usually tell pretty early, somewhere around the 5th date, depending on how long I procastinate. That way it's too far into the relationship for the guy to feel cheated or betrayed, and yet it's not too early for them to judge without giving me a chance.<br><br>By the way, the forum seems to have died shortly after I disapeared, and apparently so did Phoebie's other forum. Come on, let's contribute more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
