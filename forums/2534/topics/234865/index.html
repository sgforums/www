            <div class='col-md body'>Choices<br>By Byron Pulsifer<br><br>Choices.<br>We all make them everyday.<br>Some are good, and some are not so good.<br>You can surrender your destiny to the desires of others, or you can<br>make your own. The point is that we can make choices that help us to<br>move forward through adversity, or we may make choices that assist<br>others to move beyond or through some of life's issues.<br><br>"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is<br>not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved."    --<br>William Jennings Bryan<br><br>Choices are within everyone's command.<br>No one has to do, or is obligated to live their lives as others live.<br><br>On the other hand, inevitably at some point in our lives, we witness,<br>first-hand, choices that other people, friends, family members or<br>colleagues make that we can clearly see are leading them down a<br>slippery slope to either immediate devastating consequences, or a<br>future that can be potentially harmful.<br><br>As caring people, we probably have all made efforts to try and assist<br>other individuals to change or alter a choice so they won't experience<br>what we feel will be negative reactions, rejection, or, worse still,<br>criminal prosecutions.<br><br>While there is nothing inherently wrong or misguided about our good<br>intentions, the ultimate choice people make is entirely up to them.<br>We can't live other people's lives for them; we don't want to put<br>ourselves in any position that appears or demonstrates that we own their problems or own their choices.<br><br>These people own their own lives; they make the choices, good or bad.<br><br>"Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anyone else<br>expects of you. Never excuse yourself."   -- Henry Ward Beecher<br><br>Choices. We make hundreds of choices in our lives. Other people make<br>hundreds of choices. We might wish and hope that we can change other<br>peoples' choices so they can avoid potential problems be that drug<br>abuse, alcohol, relationships, parenting and on and on.<br><br>But, we cannot make choices for others - what we can strive to do is offer<br>constructive opinions or suggestions, when asked, or referrals to<br>professionals who can assist in one's decision-making. A quote by W.<br>Clement Stone may help you, or may help others keep moving forward<br>through the never-ending maze of choices:<br><br>"You always do what you want to do.<br>This is true with every act. You may say that you had to do something,<br>or that you were forced to, but actually, whatever you do, you do by<br>choice.<br>Only you have the power to choose for yourself."<br></div>
