            <div class='col-md body'>All the suffering in the world arises out of wanting happiness for self.<br><br>All happiness in the world arises out of wanting happiness for others.<br><br>A reason why we are unhappy is that we are not true to ourselves.<br>Paradoxically, we are also untrue to ourselves when we are untrue to<br>others, as true sincerity to yourself naturally overflows to those<br>around you.<br><br>How (un)happily we relate to others is related to our happiness, since<br>much of our lives involves relating to others. When we speak of being<br>true to ourselves, it is usually mistaken that we should simply do<br>whatever we fancy for ourselves.<br><br>Obviously, this doesn't really bring happiness. If it does, we would<br>be perfectly happy already. This means we are doing the wrong things<br>to be happy. Being true means being aligned with the truth, qualities<br>of which include the realisation of generosity, loving-kindness and<br>wisdom. Often, happiness is sought through their opposites -<br>attachment (to personal happiness), aversion (to those who "threaten"<br>our happiness) and delusion (about what is happiness). Attachment and<br>aversion arise from this delusion, which keeps true happiness.<br><br>A common symptom of unhappiness is the complaint that we want<br>happiness, but others make us unhappy. The truth is no one other than<br>ourselves can make us unhappy. We are unhappy about others only when<br>we choose to relate to them in an unhappy manner. Flip this around and<br>it is equally true - those who "make" you unhappy should realise that<br>the cause of unhappiness is not you, but in how they choose to relate<br>to you. If our happiness is always determined by how others treat us,<br>how can we be truly happy? What if someone deluded thinks that making<br>you unhappy brings happiness for oneself?<br><br>Be generous, loving and wise to that person. Respond with sincerity.<br>Seek to understand and bring happiness to that person. Focus on<br>dissolving the person's unhappiness instead of being unhappy with how<br>that person is affecting you. This also dissolves your unhappiness<br>about that person. It's a win-win situation. Retaliating with aversion<br>would only perpetuate unhappiness on both sides.<br><br>What if those unhappy with us do not appreciate our sincerity? This is<br>still no cause for you to be unhappy. True sincerity expects no<br>reciprocation. It simply does what is right - that aligned to<br>happiness. There is happiness in knowing we are blameless, when we do<br>our best to bring others happiness. The only ones who hold our<br>happiness ransom is us.<br><br>For instance, if someone is unhappy with me for saying the Earth is<br>round, why should I be unhappy about that? The truth is that the Earth<br>is not flat. Others' unhappiness with the truth has no power to make<br>us unhappy if we are at peace with the truth. Likewise, others'<br>unhappiness with the trueness of our sincerity has no power to make us<br>unhappy. The options are obvious - If we do not choose to relate to<br>those unhappy with us happily, we choose to relate to them unhappily.<br>Our happiness first comes from how kindly and wisely we relate to the<br>universe; not how it treats us. Yet the kinder and wiser we are, the<br>kinder and wiser<br><br>To be unhappy, have expectations that others make you happy.<br><br>To be happy, make others happy without expectations.</div>
