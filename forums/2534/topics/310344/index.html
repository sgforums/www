              <p>Music To My Ears.......<br> <br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://pics3.city-data.com/forum/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">At the prodding of my friends, I am writing this story. My name is <a class="citylink" title="Mildred, Texas detailed profile" href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Mildred-Texas.html">Mildred</a> Hondorf. I am a former elementary school music teacher from DeMoines, Iowa. <br> I've always supplemented my income by teaching piano lessons -
              something I've done for over 30 years. Over the years I found that
              children have many levels of musical ability. I've never had the
              pleasure of having a protégé though I have taught some talented
              students. <br> However I've also had my share of what I call "musically challenged"
              pupils. One such student was Robby. Robby was 11 years old when his
              mother (a single mom) dropped him off for his first piano lesson. I
              prefer that students (especially boys!) begin at an earlier age, which
              I explained to Robby. But Robby said that it had always been his
              mother's dream to hear him play the piano. So I took him as a student. <br> Well, Robby began with his piano lessons and from the beginning I
              thought it was a hopeless endeavor. As much as Robby tried, he lacked
              the sense of tone and basic rhythm needed to excel. But he dutifully
              reviewed his scales and some elementary pieces that I require all my
              students to learn. <br> Over the months he tried and tried while I listened and cringed and
              tried to encourage him. At the end of each weekly lesson he'd always
              say, "My mom's going to hear me play some day." But it seemed hopeless.
              <br> He just did not have any inborn ability. I only knew his mother from a
              distance as she dropped Robby off or waited in her aged car to pick him
              up. She always waved and smiled but never stopped in. Then one day
              Robby stopped coming to our lessons. <br> I thought about calling him but assumed, because of his lack of
              ability, that he had decided to pursue something else. I also was glad
              that he stopped coming. He was a bad advertisement for my teaching! <br> Several weeks later I mailed to the student's homes a flyer on the
              upcoming recital. To my surprise Robby (who received a flyer) asked me
              if he could be in the recital. I told him that the recital was for
              current pupils and because he had dropped out he really did not
              qualify. He said that his mom had been sick and unable to take him to
              piano lessons but he was still practicing. <br> "Miss Hondorf . . . I've just got to play!" he insisted. I don't know
              what led me to allow him to play in the recital. Maybe it was his
              persistence or maybe it was something inside of me saying that it would
              be alright. <br> The night for the recital came. The high school gymnasium was packed
              with parents, friends and relatives. I put Robby up last in the program
              before I was to come up and thank all the students and play a finishing
              piece. I thought that any damage he would do would come at the end of
              the program and I could always salvage his poor performance through my
              "curtain closer." <br> Well the recital went off without a hitch. The students had been
              practicing and it showed. Then Robby came up on stage. His clothes were
              wrinkled and his hair looked like he'd run an egg-beater through it.
              "Why didn't he dress up like the other students?" I thought. "Why
              didn't his mother at least make him comb his hair for this special
              night?" <br> Robby pulled out the piano bench and he began. I was surprised when he
              announced that he had chosen Mozart's Concerto #21 in C Major. I was
              not prepared for what I heard next. His fingers were light on the keys,
              they even danced nimbly on the ivories. <br> He went from pianissimo to fortissimo; from allegro to virtuoso. His
              suspended chords that Mozart demands were magnificent! Never had I
              heard Mozart played so well by people his age. After six and a half
              minutes he ended in a grand crescendo and everyone was on their feet in
              wild applause. <br> Overcome and in tears I ran up on stage and put my arms around Robby in
              joy. "I've never heard you play like that Robby! How'd you do it?"
              Through the microphone Robby explained: <br> "Well, Miss Hondorf . . . remember I told you my mom was sick? Well
              actually she had cancer and passed away this morning. And well . . .
              she was born deaf so tonight was the first time she ever heard me play.
              I wanted to make it special." <br> There wasn't a dry eye in the house that evening. As the people from
              Social Services led Robby from the stage to be placed into foster care,
              I noticed that even their eyes were red and puffy and I thought to
              myself how much richer my life had been for taking Robby as my pupil. <br> No, I've never had a protégé but that night I became a protégé . . . of
              Robby's. He was the teacher and I was the pupil. For it was he that
              taught me the meaning of perseverance and love and believing in
              yourself and maybe even taking a chance on someone and you don't know
              why. This is especially meaningful to me since after serving in Desert
              Storm Robby was killed in the senseless bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
              Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April of 1995, where he was
              reportedly . . . playing the piano.</p>
