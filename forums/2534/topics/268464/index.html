My name is Rose.<br><br>I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?"<br><br>I laughed and enthusiastically responded, "Of course you may!" and she<br>gave me a giant squeeze.<br><br>"Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?" I asked.<br><br>She jokingly replied, "I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married,<br>and have a couple of kids..."<br><br>"No seriously," I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to<br>be taking on this challenge at her age.<br><br>"I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting<br>one!" she told me.<br><br>After class we walked to the student union building and shared a<br>chocolate milkshake.<br><br>We became instant friends.

I'll never get my speech back in order so<br>let me just tell you what I know."<br><br>As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, "We do not stop<br>playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing.<br><br>There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and<br>achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've<br>got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.<br><br>We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know<br>it!<br><br>There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up.<br><br>If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and<br>don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old.
