            <div class='col-md body'>There are few of us who escape feelings of fear and self-doubt as we<br>go about our life. Not to worry! We can all learn how to create within<br>us a wonderful sense of confidence and peace of mind as we face all<br>situations in our lives. Here are very powerful tools to help us push<br>through the fear and self-doubt in order to create a beautiful and<br>satisfying life...<br><br>1. Build your sense of trust in yourself. Your first task is to build<br>the trust that whatever happens in your life, you can handle it all.<br>Right now, think of something about any area of your life that is<br>bothering you and repeat to yourself ten times the important words,<br>"Whatever happens, I'll handle it." I suspect you will immediately<br>begin to feel a sense of peace within your being. These are important<br>words to have when the "what if's" come up. "What if I lose my job?<br>I'll handle it." "What if I get sick? I'll handle it." "What if<br>something happens to my marriage? I'll handle it." And what does "I'll<br>handle it" mean? It means, "I'll learn from it. I'll grow from it.<br>I'll make it a triumph!"<br><br>2. Do your very best, then let go of the outcome. To help you let go,<br>develop the trust that "It's all happening perfectly." This calming<br>affirmation is a shortened version of: "I've done my best, but even if<br>things don't go the way I want them to go, I will simply find a way to<br>be enriched by whatever life brings me. I will learn and grow from it<br>all. Therefore, it truly is all happening perfectly." Repetition over<br>and over again of this wonderful affirmation, will definitely quiet<br>the negative chatter of the mind and help you let go of the outcome.<br>Peace at last!<br><br>3. Stop complaining. Complaining is a big clue that you are not taking<br>responsibility for your experience of life. Instead of seeing life's<br>obstacles as problems, see them as opportunities, opening the door to<br>growth. When you can control your reactions to whatever life hands<br>you, you have the upper hand. You now have a choice: You can create<br>your own misery...or you can create your own sense of growth and<br>wellbeing. That's power! Every time you have the opportunity to<br>stretch your capacity to handle the world around you, the more<br>powerful and confident you will feel.<br><br>4. Yes, "Feel the fear and do it anyway." Often we think, "I'll do it<br>when I am not so afraid." But in reality, it works the other way<br>round. The "doing it" comes before the fear goes away. The only way to<br>get rid of the fear of doing something is to go out and do it. Action<br>is the key. Once you have done something you have feared a number of<br>times, guess what happens...the fear of that particular situation goes<br>away. And it's then time to further expand the comfort zone and move<br>on to the next situation you fear. That's what growth is all about.<br>And as your confidence builds, it will become easier and easier to<br>"feel the fear and do it anyway!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5. When making decisions, adopt the "no-lose" philosophy. The<br>"no-lose" philosophy tells us that "I can't lose - regardless of the<br>outcome of the decision I make. I look forward to the opportunities<br>for learning and for growing that either choice gives me." Remember,<br>if you learn through your "mistakes," there are no mistakes! In this<br>way, the "no-lose" approach to decision-making guarantees that all<br>your decisions will be the right decisions.<br><br>6. Know that you count. Know that your presence makes a difference. If<br>you don't understand this very important fact, act as if you do make a<br>difference! Just keep asking yourself the "act-as-if" question in all<br>areas of your life: "What would I be doing if I were really important<br>here?" Make a list and then take action. Soon you will "live into" the<br>realization that you really are important.<br><br>7. Commit 100% to all areas of your life. That means when you are at<br>work or with your family and friends, or meeting new people, or<br>volunteering in the community...or whatever...give it all you've got,<br>holding nothing back. When you commit to giving 100%, your sense of<br>focus, excitement, participation, enjoyment, fulfillment, and<br>happiness come alive. What a glorious feeling that is!<br><br>8. Say "thank you" a lot. Saying "thank you" is a wonderful way to<br>make important connections in all areas of your life. The words "thank<br>you" can also help you appreciate and focus on all the good that is<br>around you, thus helping you release any feelings of anger and<br>resentment you may be holding. You can see why the words "thank you"<br>are two of the most powerful words ever spoken.<br><br>If you, step by step, begin incorporating into your life these tips,<br>your sense of confidence and peace of mind will grow and grow.<br>Remember: there is plenty of time...but now is definitely the time to<br>begin!</div>
