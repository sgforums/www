              <p>An eye witness account from New York City , on a cold day in December, some years ago: A little boy, about 10-years-old, was standing before a shoe store on the roadway, barefooted, peering through the window, and shivering with cold.â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>A lady approached the young boy and said, 'My, but you're in such deep thought staring in that window!'â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>'I was asking God to give me a pair of shoes,’ was the boy's reply. The lady took him by the hand, went into the store, and asked the clerk to get half a dozen pairs of socks for the boy. She then asked if he could give her a basin of water and a towel. He quickly brought them to her. â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>She took the little fellow to the back part of the store and, removing her gloves, knelt down, washed his little feet, and dried them with the towel.â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>By this time, the clerk had returned with the socks. Placing a pair upon the boy's feet, she purchased him a pair of shoes. â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>She tied up the remaining pairs of socks and gave them to him.. She patted him on the head and said, 'No doubt, you will be more comfortable now.'â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>As she turned to go, the astonished kid caught her by the hand, and looking up into her face, with tears in his eyes, asked her. 'Are you God’s wife?'â€¨</p>

              <p>Whenever I'm disappointed with my spot in life, I stop and think about little Jamie Scott. Jamie was trying out for a part in the school play.</p>
              <p>His mother told me that he'd set his heart on being in it, though she feared he would not be chosen. â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>On the day the parts were awarded, I went with her to collect him after school. Jamie rushed up to her, eyes shining with pride and excitement.</p>
              <p>Guess what, Mom,' he shouted, and then said those words that will remain a lesson to me.....'I've been chosen to clap and cheer.'</p>

              <p>On my way home one day, I stopped to watch a Little League base ball game that was being played in a park near my home.</p>
              <p>As I sat down behind the bench on the first-base line, I asked one of the boys what the score was 'We're behind 14 to nothing,' he answered with a smile.â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>'Really,' I said. 'I have to say you don't look very discouraged.'â€¨</p>
              <p>'Discouraged?', the boy asked with a puzzled look on his face...â€¨'Why should we be discouraged? We haven't been up to bat yet.'</p>

              <p>Teacher Debbie Moon's first graders were discussing a picture of a family.</p>
              <p>One little boy in the picture had a different hair colour than the other members.</p>
              <p>One of her students suggested that he was adopted.â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>A little girl said, 'I know all about adoption, I was adopted..'â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>'What does it mean to be adopted?', asked another child.</p>
              <p>‘It means', said the girl, 'that you grew in your mommy's heart instead of her tummy!'</p>
