              <p><span id="app2437228683_tale1431644984">A
              young man, a student in one of our universities, was one day taking a
              walk with a professor, who was commonly called the students' friend,
              from his kindness to those who waited on his instructions. As they went
              along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they
              supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by,
              and who had nearly finished his day's work. <br><br>The student turned
              to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide
              his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see
              his perplexity when he cannot find them." <br><br>"My young friend,"
              answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense
              of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater
              pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then
              we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." <br><br>The
              student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close
              by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to
              the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his
              coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something
              hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin.
              Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon
              the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then
              looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now
              put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe;
              but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings
              overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered
              aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and
              helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from
              some unknown hand, would save from perishing. <br><br>The student
              stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now,"
              said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had
              played your intended trick?" <br><br>The youth replied, "You have
              taught me a lesson which I will never forget. I feel now the truth of
              those words, which I never understood before: 'It is more blessed to
              give than to receive.'" <br><br> Author unknown, retold by Artin Tellalian </span></p>
